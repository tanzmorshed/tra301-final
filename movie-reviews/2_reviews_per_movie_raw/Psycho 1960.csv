","No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film."
"telegonus","10","221","239","5 September 2001"," It's the Little Things
","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:<br/><br/>a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.<br/><br/>b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.<br/><br/>c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.<br/><br/>d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.<br/><br/>e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".<br/><br/>f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.<br/><br/>g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.<br/><br/>
In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative."
"arichmondfwc","10","94","101","19 May 2017"," Anthony's Norman
","Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins."
"littlemartinarocena","10","182","209","23 November 2007"," Hitchcock and Herrmann
","Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car..."

","When I watched this for the first time in over 30 years, I was surprised how little action there was since I had remembered this as some intense horror movie. Of course, I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic, sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, along with Rear Window.<br/><br/>I mention the lack of action, and blood, too, because younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. A generation back, movie makers tended to build up characters and suspense, so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Also, this movie doesn't have the shock value today for audiences, either, not after years of Freddie Krueger-type blood-and-guts seen in the past 30 years.<br/><br/>But, what you WILL see in this movie is (1) superb acting; (2) a fascinating lead character; (3) excellent photography, and (4) a bizarre story.<br/><br/>""Norman Bates"" is one of the most famous fictional names in film history, thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. ""Norman"" is a nutcase, as it turns out and the more you know all about him, the more fun it is to study Perkins and his character ""Norman"" in subsequent viewings. He really has the guy down pat. However, it isn't just Perkins' film; the supporting is just fine with Leigh, whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it; Martin Balsam as the private detective; Vera Miles and John Gavin. Everyone contributes.<br/><br/>What makes me really enjoy this movie is the cinematography. I bought this on VHS when it became available on widescreen. Later, of course, I got the DVD. Each time, I appreciate John Russell's camera-work and Hitchcock's direction more and more. I wonder if this isn't Hitchcock's best job of directing as his camera angles and lighting are outstanding. On the DVD, the blacks, whites and grays are just super and the famous house next to the Bates Motel never looked better. That house really looks eerie.<br/><br/>The sound effects in here don't hurt. When Balsam is attacked, the accompanying frightening music never fails to bring chills down my spine. The music literally ""screams"" at you.<br/><br/>I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again. Many people here think this is Hitchcock's greatest film. Add me to that list."
"slokes","10","212","256","10 August 2004"," Movie At The Crossroads Of Time
","What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.<br/><br/>You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.<br/><br/>Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.<br/><br/>He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.<br/><br/>If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.<br/><br/>It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.<br/><br/>Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.<br/><br/>Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready."
"LoveCoates","10","395","502","31 July 2001"," Two Words: Hitchcock's Best (...and you know that's no small feat!)
","Yes, everything you've heard is true. The score is a part of pop culture. The domestic conflict is well-known. But nothing shocks like the experience itself.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor. Stop reading thse comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" is easily the best horror-thriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) but not really.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.<br/><br/>Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). ""Psycho"" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.<br/><br/>Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.<br/><br/>One more thing...<br/><br/>Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot ""remake."" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.<br/><br/>I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.<br/><br/>Eleven-and-a-half out of ten stars."
"AlsExGal","10","26","29","25 March 2017"," Always holds me from beginning to end...
","...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.<br/><br/>This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises. <br/><br/>The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns. <br/><br/>Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the ""protagonist"" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search. <br/><br/>The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.<br/><br/>This film is mentioned in the documentary ""Moguls and Movie Stars"" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem. <br/><br/>Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as ""man"" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think."
"Chris-332","10","122","152","19 January 2000"," Hitchcock did it all in this one.
","When Psycho came out, the horror industry of movies was merely monsters, zombies, werewolves, and vampires. So when Psycho hit screens, the audience was finally introduced to psychological thrillers. It hit with such a huge bang that the audience was shocked...with fear and suspense. Psycho created what the thriller genre is today. It sliced through clique monster movies and changed it forever. Still today when you look at Norman Bates and his extremely freaky look when you see him watching the inspector's car sinking into the swamp sends chills down my spine. And when Marion Crane met her bloody demise in the middle of the movie, Hitchcock proved to everyone that this movie is different, different from every other movie you have ever seen. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous, the music is marvelously freaky, the acting is magnificent, the story is exceptional, and everything else about the movie is great. Too bad the sequels and the new remake was complete trash."
"Popenoe","Null","253","328","17 January 1999"," The Greatest Horror Film Ever
","When you look up the phrase ""Horror Film"" in the dictionary .. a picture of Janet Leigh screaming in a shower should appear next to it. Undoubtedly, Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, bar-none. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing Jason double-spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.<br/><br/>Aside from this though, the movie is flawless. I won't even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween (1978).<br/><br/>The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh as the beautiful Marion Crane, Vera Miles as the concerned sister, Lila Crane, and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins as the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to any horror movie film fanatic. I would especially recommend this movie to any horror movie fan not desensitized by Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, or Scream .. if such a fan exists."

","Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits.  Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).<br/><br/>Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre."

","Alfred Hitchock is the master of suspense and Psycho is probably his most famous film. Because, let's face it, one way or another, you have seen or heard of this film. It's been made fun of, been remade(unfortunately), not to mention that this movie's word will be spred from generation to generation. I came across it very young, my parents used to tell me how scary it was and how I wouldn't want to take a shower after watching this film. I didn't believe them, but when I watched it, I for the first time pulled the blanket over my head, it was that frightening! The thing that is so amazing about Psycho is how much of an impact it made, and understandably why it did. It ranked in over 60 million dollars at the box office, now this was the time where tickets were like 50 cents at the theater, now if you compare that to today, that's Titanic like money! It broke many taboo's, like this was the first film to show a toilet being flushed, isn't that interesting? My high school teacher said that her and her mom saw Psycho when it was first released in theaters and she actually ran out of the theater terrified! Alfred did so well keeping us glued to our seats with all his great twists! This was before The Sixth Sense, I mean, the ending is just such a mind blower! But I won't give spoilers.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a woman who is in love with a divorced man Sam Loomis. He says once he pays his ex wife off with the alimony, they'll get married. When Marion's boss asks her to put their most valued client's money, $40,000 to be exact, and bring it to the bank. She has other plans though, she takes the money for herself and flee's the city, but not before her boss sees her driving off. Shaky enough, huh? But she pulls over to get a nap in, and a police officer asks if she's OK, but she gets shaky and just wants to drive off. The policemen fallows her since she is so shaky and she ends up buying a different car. She gets caught in a giant rainstorm and pulls over to the Bates Motel.<br/><br/>She meets there, the owner, a pleasant and polite young man, Norman Bates. He lives in the house next to the motel with his mother. Marion checks in and Norman offers her dinner, they have a conversation mostly about his mom and Marion is concerned when she heard screams from the house that sounded like his mom. Norman gets on the defenses and asks Marion some questions as well, she says she is going to a ""private island"". Norman is very attracted to her, you can tell immediately, and she leaves knowing that she has to get out of the trap she set for herself back in Phoenix. As she's taking a shower before bed, a mysterious figure comes to the curtain and opens it stabbing Marion violently several times causing her to die. Norman cleans up the mess and gets rid of her body not knowing about her money and throwing that away too.<br/><br/>Marion's boyfriend, Sam and her sister, Lola, hire a private detective to find her. The private detective comes across The Bates Motel and doesn't end up coming back after trying to ""talk"" to the mother. Lola and Sam are concerned and decide to investigate for themselves, but will they end up coming back to the city alive? Psycho is just one of those movies you have to see before you die. It's one of the most important films of our time and will never be forgotten. It's a true treasure with terrific actors and a terrifying plot that will give you nightmares for weeks! Please don't let that scare you, I'm just having fun, but it is a freaky film! Watch it in the dark! It has a better effect, I think. Over 40 years and this film is still horrifying as if it were made today! <br/><br/>10/10"

You went to see it anticipating something scary and thats what you got. Even 30 years later I still remember sitting in a dark theatre with my heart pumping and everyone, and I mean everyone, screaming their lungs out.<br/><br/>The movie set a new and very high standard in horror movies which I don't believe has ever been equaled.

"Whizzer-2","10","53","67","1 October 1999"," Perkins Irreplaceable?
","Hitchcock was very fortunate to have cast the young Anthony Perkins in the leading role.  At the time there were some other young aspiring actors who might have qualified for the part, namely:  Michael J. Pollard; Jack Nicholson; Bruce Dern, Dean Stockwell, Victor Buono and Dennis Hopper.  However, it's hard for me to imagine anyone other than Perkins playing Norman Bates with complete authenticity, it's seems the role was simply made for him and only him.  Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in ""Easy Rider""?  Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks.  Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in ""Magic"".  I think he just might have pulled off a convincing Norman, but don't believe he was available back then.  Oh well, so much for speculation...Perkins did a great job."

"majikstl","10","13","16","13 June 2004"," It was a dark and stormy night...
","(((((SPOILERS))))<br/><br/>For most people, the most memorable scene in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, indeed it's most famous scene, is the shower sequence. It has been broken down and analyzed ad nauseam as an example of the fine art of editing. It is a great sequence, but to me the best scene in PSYCHO occurs just before that. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, on the run from having committed a crime, sits in the parlor behind the Bates Motel's office and discusses nothing and everything with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the motel's lonely proprietor. It is a chat between strangers who desperately need to talk to someone, anyone, but have no one to whom they can confide. It is a beautifully written and acted scene, which serves as the calm before the storm. <br/><br/>For all of its flashiness and sleight-of-hand gore, the shower sequence isn't nearly as effective at showing what a master filmmaker Hitchcock was. It is in the parlor scene that the entire narrative spins around; as the audience is prompted to switch their allegiance from Marion to Norman. Nothing really happens in the scene, other than two characters talking, but how things are said reveals as much as what is actually said. Here Marion comes to terms with her mistake and decides to pull herself out of her ""private trap."" Norman introduces us, indirectly, to Mother and wins our sympathy, which is vital to the way the rest of the film plays out. The scene very skillfully sets the mood of uneasiness that propels us into the upcoming murder, even as it suggests that Marion is achieving a sense of inner peace. Madness is revealed, danger is suggested, yet the audiences is coolly and cruelly lulled into an almost tranquil state. It is obvious something is coming, but not so soon. <br/><br/>Then the shower curtain is ripped aside and blood begins to splatter.<br/><br/>The measure of a film like PSYCHO is not how cleverly it fools you the first time, but how irrelevant its surprises are to enjoying it time after time. Indeed, compare it to Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake, or even Brian De Palma's 1980 semi-remake, DRESSED TO KILL, and the power of the film is obvious. Van Sant's version, though a scene for scene imitation is barely watchable even once, especially if you are already familiar with the plot; and while De Palma's homage is stylish and intriguing the first time around, its psychology and plot tricks don't stand up on repeated viewings. By contrast, Hitchcock's PSYCHO can be viewed repeatedly with full awareness and appreciation of knowing what is coming up next. <br/><br/>I think an element of Hitchcock's genius is apparent in that he doesn't treat his major plot twist as a just a gimmick. The entire first half of PSYCHO could have been treated as just a shaggy dog story, a prelude marking time until Norman Bates' story takes center stage. But Hitchcock realized that Janet Leigh's story had to be presented with all due gravity, otherwise the shift to Anthony Perkins' story wouldn't be nearly as effective. Neither Van Sant nor De Palma seemed to understand this, especially De Palma who treats the Angie Dickinson scenes in DRESSED with a cruel, condescending sense of humor. Hitchcock's PSYCHO works as a whole, but could very easily have been presented as two independent episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents....."" Marion Crane's story is not just a build up (though Hitchcock himself claimed that killing off his leading lady was all meant as a joke on the audience), but as a complete story unto itself, replete with the type of shocking twist ending that was the hallmark of Hitchcock's television anthology. Likewise, the Norman Bates half of PSYCHO, is a complete suspense tale in its own right. The shower scene is the bridge between the two stories, but it is the scene in the parlor that cements the two tales -- and the fates of the two protagonist. <br/><br/>And if you look at PSYCHO as two separate parts of a whole, then Marion's story is revealed to be the more complete of the two. Norman's story, while beautifully done, is essentially a mystery story; Sam, Lila and Arbogast are trying to solve a whodunit: what happened to Marion and the $40,000? The cleverness of Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano is that they let us think we know the answer right off the bat, building to a conclusion where it is revealed how completely we have been fooled. In the end, we know little more than Lila and Sam. To some extent, this is the real gimmick of the film. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Marion's story allows Hitchcock to make so much out of so little. He creates tension, even though there is no tangible threat. Marion is on the run with stolen funds, but the theft hasn't even been discovered yet. All of the danger is strictly in her mind: What will happen when...? She is a smart woman who has done something very stupid, but proceeds even as her fears grow and grow. But cinematically the suspense is created out of mundane things: a policeman's face at the car window, rain and windshield wipers slashing across the screen, the glare of on coming headlights. Mix this with the haunting voice overs of accusing voices and Bernard Herrmann incredible musical violence and the effect is hypnotic. But these imagined dangers do not prepare Marian or the audience for the real dangers ahead.<br/><br/>And something has to be said for Janet Leigh. Always overshadowed by Anthony Perkins' iconic performance, Leigh never gets her due (though she was nominated for an Oscar, she lost to Shirley Jones in ELMER GANTRY). But she dominates the first half of the film with a vivid performance that is sexual, humorous and bittersweet. So much of her role depends on the subtlety of her facial expressions: her sad smile at pretending to believe Sam's excuses for not marrying her, her bemused glances at the flirtatious old millionaire, her self-satisfied smirks as she thinks about how people will react to discovering her crime, her mixture of concern and fear as she talks to Norman in the backroom parlor. Plus, she displays an attitude that is both smart and sexy. It is one of the great film performance.<br/><br/>It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be."
"Don-102","10","98","153","28 June 1999"," A Perfect Film.
","Perfect films are few and far between and the filmmakers usually have no inkling as to the top-notch quality of work they are doing.  Alfred Hitchcock thought it was a good idea to make a new kind of suspense picture back in 1959.  Something that would give the audience goose bumps was in order, but bigger bumps must have been the goal.  Hitch had to use his TV crew (from his network series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents..."" because many film executives didn't like the material.  Little did they know that the big Brit was about to make a cinematic milestone and change the way films are structured and material is presented.  At the time, PSYCHO was a nasty-spirited movie that led some moviegoers to leave early or stop taking showers.  It has held up amazingly well and is far superior to its countless rip-offs.<br/><br/>PSYCHO is perfect because: 1) It is in black and white, not blazing technicolor which would have stained the film for no purpose and made the shower murder less artistic. (Hitch may have went the route of director Michael Powell who became an outcast once his technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM was seen.)<br/><br/>2)The featured star disappears a third of the way through igniting a new method of scriptwriting and casting.  (Hitch made strict stipulations for theatre owners not to allow people into the movie once the picture started in order for this secret to stay secret.)<br/><br/>3)Lesser known actors are used to provide a more authentic feel for the characters.  This is so true in the case of Anthony Perkins, not exactly a Cary Grant, who creates a stunningly chaotic portrayal of an abused son/mental madman. (Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind, not to mention his evil grin.)<br/><br/>4) The shower scene, of course.  Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. (Hitch storyboarded each of the 80+ cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.)<br/><br/>5) Norman Bates' mother, who sits upstairs in the ""old house on the hill"" and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it.  (Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.)<br/><br/>6)The set-up and payoff which consists of 40,000 dollars, a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror.  (Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.)<br/><br/>7)Finally, composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating, vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly.  (Hitch and Hermann worked on several films together, none better than this.)<br/><br/>Is there any other question that PSYCHO is one of the top 7 or 8 films of all time?  I don't think so.  Just look how film history began a slow course towards more independence and honesty after PSYCHO scared everyone into believing this kind of film could be made.<br/><br/>RATING: 10+"
"AgentDice","10","14","18","21 October 2013"," ""A boy's best friend is his mother. ""
","Without a doubt one of the most influential films of all time. Timeless classic.<br/><br/>Whether this is a true slasher film is debatable, but it's influence on the genres of horror and suspense/thriller is undeniable.<br/><br/>This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.<br/><br/>What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.<br/><br/>One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off. See it for the first time (and even a tenth) and enjoy a master director at the peak of his craft."

","""Psycho"" is the most astounding, daring, and successful scary film ever made... Hitchcock uses pure cinema to arouse audience emotions...<br/><br/>For the first forty minutes he cautiously builds up sympathy and audience identification with a troubled fugitive, a young estate secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who wants to marry Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but neither can afford it... Entrusted, by a wealthy customer, with $40,000 to put in a safe deposit box in a bank, she succumbs to temptation and steals the money in order to start a new life with her lover... So the motive is love! <br/><br/>We begin to feel the tension when she's spotted  leaving Phoenix, Arizona  by her boss who thinks she remains in bed with a headache... Then, when she pulls off the highway to take a nap and is awaken by a suspicious patrolman  in disturbing dark glasses  who trails her... Hitchcock's trademark paranoia about the police is here at his best...<br/><br/>Frightened and tired by a violent rainstorm, she stops at Bates Motel and has a small talk with a twitchy cordial motel keeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins-in an outstanding performance), an attractive shy young man who seems uneasy around her and can't even bring himself to pronounce the world bathroom...<br/><br/>The movie turns dark and claustrophobic when she overheard the voice of Norman's mother speaking sharply with her son, and after she learns Norman's strong devotion to his irritable mother...<br/><br/>Alone in the room, she strips to shower Safe and relaxing, the hot air rises as the water cascades over her Suddenly she turns at a sound, her eyes dilate with horror and her repeated screams rend the air as a hand from nowhere holding a long knife plunges it repeatedly into her body Her blood, mingling with the water, flushes down the drain in one of the most terrifying images of modern cinema <br/><br/>No one who saw the film will forget the shock effect of that scene... Not only because of its terrifying realism, with the blood gushing and swirling on the shower floor; but also because Leigh was a sympathetic and star figure Although she had stolen, we felt involved with her (as we were involved with Marnie); we wanted her to get away; and here, with two-thirds of the film still to got we watched helplessly as the life and the beauty and the hopes were butchered out of her<br/><br/>The movie is only off one third when Hitchcock's spiral close-up of her unmoving eyeball reveals the nightmare... But the movie does really begin after her murder because once she is killed, we never stop thinking about her...<br/><br/>With Marion Crane gone, our attention is shift to the sensitive Norman with a passion for birds and mother... They are very close and he guards her jealousy... <br/><br/>As three people began to investigate, our sympathies were subtly maneuvered to the good-looking young man who, it seemed, must try to protect a homicidal mother We see him distraught, cleaning up and disposing of Marion's car, with her body and cash, into a swamp... <br/><br/>We have no reason to think that he himself have done the dirty work... So could his crippled old mother be the vicious murderer? Or do we have some other reason to suspect that Norman's abusive mother does not exist? We heard the old woman talking constantly to him and we see Norman carrying her to the cellar... Or is it another Hitchcock's trick? But the knife comes out again striking and killing... The high angle shot shows perfectly her mad menacing rush from her bedroom... <br/><br/>Hitchcock's version is definitive, a terrifying insinuating thriller with only two sudden and vicious murders... A classic essential cinema with his rich, vivid and effective imagery in the use of light and shadow; his voyeurism when Perkins spies on Leigh in a black bra (The first time he shows a lady disrobed); his 'metaphysical vertigo' in the overhead shot as Norman drags his mother down to the cellar..."

"dee.reid","10","6","7","27 June 2009"," I guess it's never too late to thrown in your own love and admiration for a classic film...
","I have to admit that I have a terrible habit of getting around to watching classic movies when it's really late in the game. I guess my excuse is that I'm only 23, and most of the so-called ""classic"" movies of the 20th century were made well before I was even born. I'm ashamed to say that I fell in love with both ""Jaws"" (1975) and ""Halloween"" (1978) just last year; this year, just about a half-hour ago, I had the great pleasure to see Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense-thriller ""Psycho.""<br/><br/>A lot has already been said about this film, so I won't comment too much on what it's actually about, and instead I'll only comment on significance and my reactions to it. ""Psycho"" has a plot based heavily in reality: adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, the book and film were loosely based on the crimes of real-life Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. ""Psycho"" finds its story revolving around Marion Crane (the late Janet Leigh), a lowly Phoenix, Arizona, secretary who embezzles $40,000 from her boss and hits the road, later stopping in at the isolated Bates Motel, and meets the owner and sole employee of the establishment, Norman Bates (the late Anthony Perkins).<br/><br/>The rest of the plot is well-known to anyone who has seen the film, so I won't describe it. Plus, to really describe the rest of the plot in any sort of detail at all will ruin the shocks and surprises that the film has in store for the viewer (most notoriously, the infamous ""shower scene,"" which has to be seen to be believed, and experienced). The ""shower scene"" itself is one of the chief reasons to see this picture; it's shocking, Bernard Herrmann's theme slices away at your eardrums, and it's one of the iconic death scenes - one of the most iconic scenes, period - in movie history.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" is a phenomenal piece of film, from a master filmmaker and an equally talented cast and crew; it's a true cinematic landmark. Most importantly, and the reason why I now hold this film to the high degree that I do now, is that ""Psycho"" is partially (or is it entirely?) responsible for influencing entire generations of filmmakers, particularly those in the horror genre. ""Psycho"" has almost single-handedly influenced, and given rise to, the slasher sub-genre of horror, which of course gave rise to, and is populated by the likes of, Leatherface (from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series), Michael Myers (from the ""Halloween"" series), Jason Voorhees (from the ""Friday the 13th"" series), my personal favorite movie slasher Fred Krueger (from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series), and countless other imitators. ""Psycho"" would itself become fodder for the slasher genre nearly two decades after its release, when it was followed up by three vastly inferior sequels, with Anthony Perkins reprising his signature role as Norman Bates in all three films.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" has also been the subject of a lot of psychiatric and psychological analysis, for those interested in understanding the criminal mind and how it functions. As a criminal justice major in college, in my studies I've across several opportunities to study ""Psycho"" (but never did) and exactly how it influenced the slasher genre and why it's fascinated criminology experts in the decades since its release, thus having even greater influence outside of the film community and American pop culture.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock proved that he was a cinematic genius with ""Psycho,"" since I understand that it is arguably his best and most popular film. At least now I've finally had a chance to see a movie that I've heard so much about and never previously got the chance to watch.<br/><br/>10/10"
"J. Spurlin","Null","12","17","7 December 2006"," A Hitchcock masterpiece—thanks to Bernard Herrmann
","""Psycho"" ranks second on a list of Alfred Hitchcock's four masterpieces, following ""Vertigo"" and followed by ""North by Northwest"" and ""Rear Window,"" which ranks number four only because it lacks a Bernard Herrmann score. While Hitch's camera is always the best feature of his films, Herrmann is the artist who puts three of them over the top and into the realm of true greatness—setting them beyond such near-great movies as ""Notorious"" and ""Strangers on a Train,"" which both had good scores, but nothing like the sublime and haunting music of this film. There is no underestimating Hitchcock, nor the work of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, who play the film's two main characters; but without Herrmann this could not have been a great movie.<br/><br/>The opening scene is the best place to appreciate both Herrmann and Hitchcock. Joseph Stefano's script is extremely well-structured and it was his idea to make Marion Crane the story's main character, before switching over forty minutes later to Norman Bates. (In the original novel, Robert Bloch dispatches Mary Crane much sooner.) But his dialogue is often stilted, and the opening scene, where Marion and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) share a lunchtime tryst in a cheap hotel, is badly written. The fault is made worse by Gavin, whose performance is stiff and awkward throughout, nowhere more than here. Yet this scene is among the glories of the movie, with the camera, the music and Janet Leigh's performance all giving it an aching poignancy that haunts our minds long after the film is over. Our sense of Marion's longing and frustration, which could not be conveyed by Leigh alone, is necessary for us to understand why she commits the rash act of stealing money from her boss's client. Watch how much is conveyed to us by the camera when Marion suddenly rises from the bed. Listen how much is conveyed by Herrmann's music when Sam spreads out his hands in mock-surrender and says, ""All right."" The scene as written would seem unworkable in other hands; in the hands of Herrmann and Hitchcock (and Leigh) it becomes masterly.<br/><br/>Gus Van Sant's remake, a fascinating failure, helps us appreciate many things about this film, including the performances—even, perversely, the performances of Gavin and Vera Miles, who plays Marion's sister, Lila. Gavin is incompetent and Miles is thoroughly competent, but both have the same effect on us: we don't care about them. Or rather, we would be bored by them if they were doing anything other than solving the mystery of Marion's disappearance. Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore give these bland characters more dimension, and in doing so, annoy us with their distracting personalities. Characters that are deliberately featureless often excite our imaginations more than ones that are full of tedious quirks. As is so often true with old movies, their ""faults"" prove to be virtues when remakes attempt to correct them.<br/><br/>Oddly, I vividly remember everything about the Van Sant film, except for Vince Vaughn's performance as Norman Bates; I only remember that at the time I thought it was excellent. Anne Heche, by contrast, was memorably awful, especially in the one scene that enhances our appreciation of Janet Leigh. When Marion is in her apartment alone (and without any monologue), packing her things and worrying about her mad plan, Leigh conveys all the anxiety in her decision with a minimum of affectation. But Heche not only makes the putrid decision to play the scene as if she is half-amused by her own craziness; she conveys this idea with the maximum of overplaying, as if she were compensating for her lack of dialogue with broad gestures and eye-rolling. Leigh shows us how she feels; Heche announces it over a megaphone.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is among the most memorable ever recorded on film. He is sympathetic and frightening; innocent and malign; horrifyingly unlike us and even more horrifyingly like us. Stefano gives him the best lines; and Hitchcock's camera is preternaturally adept at drawing us into his world when necessary and then coldly keeping us distant when needed. Yet with all this, how much more than a satisfying thriller with a clever trick ending could ""Psycho"" have been without Herrmann's score to help it transcend itself? Could Norman Bates have haunted us as much with a merely excellent score, like the ones for ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""Frenzy""? Neither Bloch nor Stefano is Shakespeare, and Norman Bates does not live on the page, as Macbeth, Edmund and Iago do. Could Norman Bates, like Shakespeare's characters, live for four-hundred more years? If he survives, it will have been the joint genius of Perkins, Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann that rendered him, and his story, an immortal nightmare."
"jhclues","10","14","21","21 January 2001"," Nobody Does It Better Than Hitchcock
","Throughout his long and illustrious career, director Alfred Hitchcock thrilled and captivated audiences everywhere, but never before or since as well as he did with the psychological chiller, `Psycho,' which introduced the cinematic world to a guy named Norman Bates.  And now-- forty years later-- even in an age of jaded, desensitized sensibilities, graphic horror and the likes of Hannibal Lecter and `American Psycho,' Hitchcock's masterpiece remains, even after repeated viewings, truly frightening and intrinsically disturbing.  Just as Ingmar Bergman did with his character of Karin in his landmark film, `Through A Glass, Darkly,' Hitchcock presents a character (Bates) at the psychological crossroads of his life, a pivotal juncture wherein he is required to make a conscious decision that will determine the course of the rest of his life:  Whether to reach for the light (and healing), or succumb to the voices beckoning to him from the dark, a place from which there will be no return.  Norman, however--like karin-- is incapable of making that decision, and ultimately must adhere to the resolution of the subconscious, which takes him past the point of no return and subsequently beyond the reach of any help forevermore.  The rest of the characters in the story-- Marion Crane, Lila, Sam Loomis, Arbogast-- are all mere pawns who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are forced by fate to help play out the drama of Norman's twisted existence. 	Janet Leigh gives a memorable performance as Marion, creating a character that was not only destined to go down in cinematic history, but one that would make women everywhere afraid to shower at a motel.  Vera Miles is effective as Marion's sister, Lila, and John Gavin gives credibility to Marion's lover, Sam Loomis.  Martin Balsam gives a solid performance as well, as Arbogast, the ill-fated Private Eye whose encounter with Norman's mother on the stairs is a scene nearly as famous as that of Marion's `shower.'   But the real star of the film is, of course, Anthony Perkins, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Norman Bates, a character even more chilling than Hannibal Lecter, in that his outward appearance is so deceiving, so contrary to the evil dwelling behind his unintended facade of normalcy.  His gentle countenance and boyish charm are so `real' that after being exposed to him it forever after makes anyone and everyone you encounter in your own life suspect.  And Perkins plays him to perfection, in arguably the best (and definitely the most memorable) performance of his career. 	The supporting cast includes John McIntire (Sheriff Chambers), Simon Oakland (Dr. Richmond), Vaughn Taylor (George Lowery), Frank Albertson (Tom Cassidy), Lurene Tuttle (Mrs. Chambers), Patricia Hitchcock (Caroline), John Anderson (Charlie) and Mort Mills (Highway Patrolman).  If there was any doubt by the time this film was made, `Psycho' once and for all proved that Hitchcock was, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  There have been many imitators before and since, but all of them, good and bad alike, only serve to point out that nobody does it better than Hitchcock.  I rate this one 10/10."

Having said that, if you take Psycho of its pedestal as 'one of the greatest films of all time' (though through a historical perspective and in terms of influence, the title is richly deserved' and watch it treat it for what it is, a psychological horror, than the film remains very enjoyable. The acting performance put on by Anthony Perkins is highly believable and at times chilling and, if you have not been exposed to the shows twists and ending already, they still have the potential to shock and surprise even the most seasoned horror fan. On the subject of horror fans, it is worth a watch on that merit alone or for any fan of cinema, to see the film that has shaped cinema today more than almost any other film"

","Psycho is considered by many critics and audiences as the best horror film ever made. I don't think it is that but it is still impossible to say that it is not a great film and is one of the best horror films ever, maybe top five, but not one. Alfred Hitchcock is on the other hand the best director ever to grace the cinema. He has created some of the best films ever and has never made a bad one. Some of his best are the original The Man Who Knew too Much, Psycho, and North By Northwest. The plot to Psycho is amazing, every thing seems more real than you would expect from this kind of film. The screenplay is also great. With very good characters and dialogue. The screenplay is also very daring doing very new things. The performances are also great. Anthony Perkins in particular is amazing but everyone give great performances. Janet Leigh is probably second best in her Oscar nominated performance. She brings her character to life very well, but Perkins doesn't. He just becomes that character, and that is one of the best performances in history. The visual effects are excellent for the time and would stand up fairly well for today. This is one of Hotchcocks best films and is one to watch over and over and over again."

","The psychological threads of the film are so complex as to be nearly inexhaustible; this feature alone contributes to its place in film history as one of the great celluloid efforts of all time. Like any genuine work of true genius, it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced film-goers to confront head-on just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche: the Oedipus/Elektra complexes, jealousy about sexual perceived sexual] rights, guilt, and self-hatred [as in Norman's cross-dresssing], to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot, ever, alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here, it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the $40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her [illicit] lover, Sam Loomis. The opening vista, a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix [note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name], is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads: the hunger for sex, for a safe haven, for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill, spiky score, which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred, one thinks, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly, the killer's ""cleansing"" ritual takes place in a swamp, the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean, dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally, I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room: Beethoven's Eroica Symphony [No. 3]. This majestic, noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's, but that jealousy, perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother, drove the boy to madness. Guilt, one of the human being's great purgatives, finds no outlet here, as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end. Hitchcock's use of mirrors works wonderful psychological tricks upon us, forcing us to wonder if what we see in our real and fancied mirrors, is real."

","This definitely contains **SPOILERS**, and is intended only for those who have seen the film, although it's hard to imagine many of you out there who haven't already seen this remarkable film.<br/><br/>Let's start with what is probably the most amazing scene in the film, the conversation between Norman and Marian in the motel office parlor. Anyone interested in learning how to develop dramatic, and/or psychological tension, should study this scene. Sharp dialog, mood swings, marvelous camera angles and great character reactions permeate the scene. Much of the scene, and it's darkly humorous lines, hint at the truth about Norman and his mother without actually revealing it. For example, as Norman is bringing the tray of food into the office for Marian after an argument with mother, he says, ""My mother is ...what's the phrase...she isn't quite herself today"". In the parlor while Marian eats, Norman defends his mother with, ""We all go a little mad sometimes"". And just before Marian leaves the office she tells Norman, ""I stepped into a private trap back there. I'd like to go back and pull myself out of it...if it's not too late"". The irony being that Marian may have decided to try to escape her trap, but she has already, unknowingly been ensnared in Norman's private trap. Yes Marian, it is too late.<br/><br/>In another sequence while Norman and Marian are talking in the parlor, the camera is at eye level on both characters. Suddenly, when Marian brings up the subject of Norman's mother, the camera angle changes. Norman is now being viewed from a lower angle. We are looking up at Norman and, in the background, his stuffed owl with it's wings spread, clearly in an attack posture. At the same time, we are now seeing Marian at slight downward angle. Norman has become the predator and Marian the prey!<br/><br/>Now, how about lighting? In a scene very near the end of the film, Marian's sister has made her way into the fruit cellar, lit by one bare bulb, where mother sits in a wheelchair. Lila touches her shoulder, the wheelchair swings around revealing mother's well preserved corpse. Lila screams and draws her hand back hitting the light bulb, causing it to swing wildly. The end result is that the remainder of the scene is played out in alternating light and shadow due to the swinging bulb: Lila's terrified face, mother's corpse, Norman running into the cellar in mother's clothes wielding a butcher's knife, Sam running in behind Norman and dragging him to the floor, Norman's face becoming a twisted mask of despair as the knife falls to the floor and the wig slips from his head. It all has the look of a nightmare...macabre, surreal, and sheer genius!<br/><br/>I have always loved Hitch's brand of humor, dark or otherwise. Here are some of my favorites from this film: Marian talking to Sam in the motel room at the beginning of the film, ""You make respectability sound...disrespectful"". Charlie the used car salesman, speaking to Marian, who is obviously intent on trading in her car, ""First time I ever saw the customer high pressure the salesman"". Arbogast, the private detective, speaking to Norman at the motel, ""If it doesn't gel, it isn't aspic...and this ain't gelling"". Norman speaking to Sam, after Sam has implied that Marian may have made a fool of him, ""She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother"". Lila to Sam, defending her decision to try to talk to Norman's mother, ""I can handle a sick, old woman"". How about the fact that Norman's hobby is stuffing birds, and in cleaning up mother's mess he stuffs a ""Crane"" into the trunk of a car. Classic Hitch!<br/><br/>Let me leave you with one last tidbit. In the final scene of the film Norman is sitting in a cell, wrapped in a blanket, and we hear mother's thought that is the last line of the film, ""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly"". The scene then dissolves to a shot of Marian's car being dragged from the swamp. Just as Norman's image disappears from the screen, look closely and you will see the face of mother's corpse superimposed over Norman's face for a fraction of a second. One last little (subliminal?) chill from the master! I can see you all rushing to your VCR's now. Enjoy!"

"TheClapper","9","6","8","22 November 2014"," The Great Cinematic Poem
","The strings of Bernard Herrmann combined with the screams of Janet Leigh, the knife of Norman Bates and the cuts of Alfred Hitchcock makes the movie moment that penetrated pop culture like no other. <br/><br/>My impression is that Psycho is perceived as purely a great piece of craft and entertainment, but in my mind what makes Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho such a singular work is the deep and personal poetry it contains.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was completely fearless in his ideas at this point. He makes his most radical and innovative film. The movie is heightened from his famous thrillers to a pure and modern horror movie. The visual universe is now dirty and grim as opposed to beautiful and glamorized. The icy and sophisticated blonds are gone and there are no traces of sympathetic heroes. <br/><br/>Everyone who has seen an interview with Alfred Hitchcock knows that he hides behind an inflated and parodic character. In his interviews he is very secretive and doesn't revel anything about himself. The opposite is true in his films. In his movies he is often completely open and naked. He exposes the most shameful truths about himself and his life. In Psycho he does a personal examination on a level beyond anything I've ever seen. He puts himself in the space where he is the most vulnerable. He offers a ""peeping hole"" into the darkest corners of his personality. The movie is extremely revealing, but in very subtle ways. One has to work to find the treasures of Psycho. <br/><br/>Psycho is like a novel in the way images are often suggested and has to be completed in the heads of the audience. The sexual and violent scenes are never explicit. This makes the movie even more disturbing than it ever could be if we had seen the images, and this was also the only way Hitchcock could convey what he wanted to convey and still get past the ridiculously strict American censorship laws of the time.<br/><br/>Sexuality is always a theme in a Hitchcock movie, but he never explored it as profoundly or intimately as he did in Psycho. The shower scene for example feels like a rape as much as it does a murder(the feeling intrusion, the nakedness and so on). Norman desperately desires Marion Crane. He is sexually satisfied by killing her(it might be a stretch, but I see the knife as a symbol of the male sex organ). This scene is all about the childish shame of Normans sexuality. Norman, or the mother side of him, tries to suppress his sexuality completely. This is one of the examples of the openness of Hitchcock in this movie. His catholic upbringing would suggest a lot of shameful sexuality in his life as well. Something he has in common with his biggest contemporary director hero, Luis Bunuel. Bunuel are one of very few directors who explored his own sexuality with anything close to the amount of honesty of Psycho.<br/><br/>Psycho is such a rich movie. It is filled with details. I believe you could watch it fifty times over and still find something new the fifty first time you watch it. Pay for example attention to all the little symbols and metaphors scatterd all over every single frame. Notice all the fascinations or ""fetishes"" of Hitchcocks that he put into it. The stuffed birds and the way they mirror Normans mother. The way food and eating connects with murder and sex. The peeping hole as a symbol for voyeurism and the movie camera. The cellar as a symbol of the suppressed and the shameful truths about Norman Bates. I really want to go into all these details, but like I said, there are too many and too much to discuss. It wont fit into the format of an IMDb review... <br/><br/>If you don't see the same things I do in this movie, please watch it again. Even more than the magnificent ""Vertigo"" Psycho has the ability to grow immensely on a second viewing, and continue to grow on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth... In my heart it has grown to be one of the absolute best films in movie history."

","It's hard to think of a thriller more well known than Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho! Unfortunately the films popularity may spoil the shock value. Upon seeing the film for the first time I thought knowing the outcome may make the experience less enjoyable. This was not the case! I now see why Psycho is considered masterpiece! Hitchcock is a master of suspense. As the film begins, the plot immediately makes the audience uncomfortable. As Marion Crane makes off with the money, I had no idea what would happen next. Hitchcock adds in various ideas that lead me astray and even stress me out. When the police officer was questioning Marion and began to follow her, I felt her anxiety. Also when she was rushing the car salesmen I felt uneasy. This is great film-making. The emotions that Hitchcock draws out don't exactly correspond with the direct plot. After all we haven't even met the infamous Norman Baits yet and already I am on the edge of my seat with anticipation.<br/><br/>We arrive at Baits Motel as the rising action rolls into the main plot. What an astounding actor Anthony Perkins is! Perfect casting for a psychopathic mamma's boy! He is an actor that truly understands his role. When he peers through the hole in the wall, spying on Marion you can almost tell the moment when the mother personality clicks on. The only thing that I could have found more satisfying would have been if we saw Norman doing his mothers voice.<br/><br/>I love Hitchcock's style. When Marion was stopped by the police officer the way he shot the actors close-up really gave me the impression of invaded personal space and added to my discomfort. He also had great techniques for moving the camera into may different positions without cutting. When the camera follows Norman Bates up the stairs to his mothers room the camera does a 360 as it climes and we are left with the perspective of a bug on the wall.<br/><br/>Psycho is a classic horror/thriller that I will watch again. It provides an outstanding cast and fantastic cinematography. The timeless score that accompanies the film could not be any better."
"Jonny_Numb","9","6","8","6 November 2006"," ""A Standard Rave""
","Strange what the passage of time can do to a film. I remember seeing portions of ""Psycho"" when I was very young on local TV; when our household became cable-ready a few years later and AMC showed actual movie classics, Hitchcock's film was regular on the rotation. I remember being shocked and impressed by Janet Leigh's shower demise and Martin Balsam's staircase tumble, but not too wild about the actual narrative. When you're less than 10 years old, you take for granted a lot of the nuances of film-making that only make sense when you're older.<br/><br/>And ""Psycho"" is almost entirely nuance and technique. From Anthony Perkins' legendary performance as the quiver-lipped, boyish Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's piercingly authorative, all-strings score to Hitchcock's intersection of characters (where misunderstandings and misplaced responsibility are the norm), the film is a masterful blend of all the elements that make for quality cinema. And for all its pop-culture influence (as it was one of the first 'psychological horrors' put on screen), ""Psycho"" remains extremely subtle and surprising, even if you know all the plot turns in advance.<br/><br/>See Marion. See Marion embezzle $44 grand from her boss. See Marion on the run from her own guilt. See Marion make a fateful stop at the Bates Motel. See Norman. See Norman talk about his abusive, domineering mother... (I needn't go any further.) <br/><br/>Since there is really no creative way to write about a film that has already been so extensively written on, I offer some of my personal favorite moments: The head-on shots of Marion (Janet Leigh) driving away from responsibility, listening to dialogues taking place far away, her facial expressions our only indicator of emotion. The judgmental look of the used-car salesman. The way Norman leans his head forward in the parlor, becoming somber and defensive over the word 'someplace.' The shriek of strings as the shower curtain is pulled back. Norman's awkward reaction to Private Investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam)'s casual questioning. Arbogast's oblivious, seemingly slow-motion ascent of the staircase. Mrs. Bates' closing monologue, delivered in an acrid voice whose tone will literally make your skin crawl.<br/><br/>And there's a lot more. As much as it's been said already, I will have to concur that ""Psycho"" is probably Hitchcock's masterpiece (I haven't seen all of his films), a near-seamless blend of story, character, irony, and technique."
"MovieAddict2016","10","20","35","20 October 2003"," ""Television has brought murder back into the home - where it belongs."" - Alfred Hitchcock
","""Television has brought murder back into the home - where it belongs."" - Alfred Hitchcock<br/><br/>I am often asked what my favorite film of all time is. My reply is always the same: I do not have a favorite from all the genres. But from the thousands of films I have seen, I have not seen a film more horrifying nor terrifying as Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" the only movie that has ever truly scared me in my entire life. And so I can honestly say that ""Psycho"" is the scariest film I have ever seen, and is quite probably my favorite horror film of all time.<br/><br/>This is the movie that redefined the genre, and literally gave birth to psychological thrillers. By today's standards, ""Psycho"" may seem - at the most -  tame. Audiences may not be scared by the plot anymore - a plot that was, at the time, unlike anything other, but nowadays quite normal. Gus Van Sant remade Hitchcock's classic in 1998 with both critics and audiences blowing it off. Modern audiences of today are used to slashers such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" etc., and so Van Sant's ""Psycho"" did nothing but disappoint them. But I guarantee that if you place modern audiences in front of Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" they will come out of the film terrified to death (like I was when I first saw it).<br/><br/>Why is this? It is simply because modern audiences don't expect such creepiness and evilness to be in a 1960 film. Most modern audiences think that ""Star Wars"" (1977) was the start of motion picture history, that anything beforehand is stupid, cheery and not worth their time. They will go into Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and expect a happy little picture, which is why they will come out pale with fear.<br/><br/>It all comes down to the fact that in 1960, mainstream films did not have such subject matters as split personality disorder (seen in this year's ""Identity""), figures with homicidal tendencies (like John Doe in ""Se7en""), or characters who are literally insane (like Hannibal Lector-type-criminals). ""Psycho"" set the course for these films. It blew audiences out of the water. They had never seen anything like it before. It is probably the only film that has ever really, truly scared me to death. I didn't want to take showers for weeks.<br/><br/>Hitchcock once said, ""Cartoonists have the best casting system. If they don't like an actor, they just tear him up."" I'm glad Hitchcock didn't try to tear up Anthony Perkins, who plays Norman Bates in ""Psycho,"" as a shy, awkward fellow living off of a re-routed highway. He is perfectly cast and soundly directed by Hitchcock, coming off as a somewhat strange, implacable fellow. We aren't quite sure what to make of him.<br/><br/>Phoenix banker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a poor creature living off of practically nothing. She wants to get married to Sam Loomis (John Gavin), but the costs of a wedding outweigh both their incomes. And so one night when her employer entrusts Marion with 40,000 dollars, she flees with the money in the back of her car to go find Sam. However, tired from a long drive, she stops at the Bates Motel for the night. She never leaves the motel, because Norman Bates' reclusive mother becomes jealous of Marion and kills her. Or does she?<br/><br/>Hitchcock masterfully weaves the suspense and horror in ""Psycho,"" so much so that we simply do not know what to think until everything unravels towards the end. The infamous shower scene remains one of the most impressive and wonderful segments in all motion picture history, ranking up there with the unveiling of Harry Lime in ""The Third Man,"" the revelation by Darth Vader in ""Star Wars,"" and one of my personal favorites, the part in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" when Neal Page and Del Griffith wake up in bed entangled with each other. (""Those aren't pillows!"")<br/><br/>I think that the anticipation of fear, or the insinuation of something sinister lurking behind a shadowed doorway, is much scarier than blood and guts. Freddy Krueger does not scare some people. Modern horror films tell us what we are supposed to fear, whereas films such as ""Psycho"" leave the images up to us. Not every person may leave a Jason Voorhees movie scared. Everyone will leave ""Psycho"" scared. Because as our mind tries to place a face on the fear, our mind incorporates our very fears into the image.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock is undoutedly one of the greatest and most influential film directors in the history of motion pictures. He can create suspense like no other and he can make even the simplest story the most nail-biting, terrifying picture of all time. I recently purchased a DVD with four of Hitchcock's early British films from the thirties, including ""The 39 Steps"" and ""The Lady Vanishes."" Hitchcock's sense of solid suspense can be felt even in those early films. He is, quite simply, the master of suspense. Is it no wonder he has gained the exact reputation as mentioned?<br/><br/>Some films land on greatness and don't always deserve their reputation quite so much as everyone seems to think so. ""Psycho"" is not such a film. Here is a movie that bent and broke every set rule of film making for the time, and changed the course of horror films for the better. The nineties have shown a return to the classic horror/mystery/thriller mix of Hitchcock and Agatha Christie. Here is the granddaddy of them all. Here is the best horror film ever made.<br/><br/>5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

This was the first film to be made where people couldn't come in halfway through and then watch the end, followed by the start. There is, of course, the perhaps urban myth of Hitchcock being phoned by a desperate cinema manager telling him that there was a queue round the block, it was raining, and could he let them in? Hitchcock, undaunted, made him buy everyone umbrellas.<br/><br/>Hitchcock himself called Psycho a comedy, and it has comic sections in it, although it is an extremely black comedy. At the end, you really don't expect the psychiatrist, when asked if Norman killed those people, to say ""Yes....""turn of head, raise of eyebrow""and no!"". This made the entire cinema, consisting fully of A-Level students, laugh. You don't expect half of the things that happen in the film to happen, but that doesn't make it necessarily bad.

Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was superb.  Especially Anthony Perkins playing the role of Norman Bates.  He always talked so fast, like he was nervous and anxious all the time.  When he talked to Marion Crane about his mother, it gave me chills down my spine.  ""She just...she just goes a little mad sometimes.  We all go a little mad sometimes.""  At that era, I don't think a better person could have delivered that line than Anthony Perkins.

"sddavis63","6","26","48","1 June 2011"," I Didn't Think It Lived Up To Its Reputation
","""Psycho"" has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical ""Hitckcock-ian"" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.<br/><br/>First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were ""horrific"" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.<br/><br/>What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.<br/><br/>One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it. (6/10)"

","What else can one write about a film that has been expounded by numerous film scholars? We all know about the famous shower scene, don't we? But there's so much more to ""Psycho"" than that. It works well as a psychological thriller but if one understands the psyche of ""Psycho"" it works remarkably as a horror movie (notwithstanding that we are immune to on-screen gore now).<br/><br/>There is a reason why director is considered to be the most important person in a movie. We have heard about the legend of Hitchcok - the great director. The same story could have been rendered to a derivative b-movie by an average director but Hitchcock took it to unforeseen greatness. He made a great use of Robert Blotch's book. Where else would you see a mainstream suspense-horror film put on the highest pedestal of cinema? <br/><br/>There's no emptiness in a Hitchcock film. Every scene has a purpose and underlying meaning. There could be a meta-movie on the relationship between two sisters, who we never see together on screen for the obvious reason.

","""Psycho"" still remains a classic after thirty-eight years.  It had been imitated by so many slasher films such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and ""Scream.""  Not even the pointless 1998 remake can beat Alfred Hitchcock's original.  Anthony Perkins delivers a sincere performance as the mama's boy, Norman Bates who runs a motel.  Janet Leigh also turns in a good performance as the embezzler Marion Crane who checks in and gets stabbed repeatedly in the famous shower scene.  Even the Bernard Herman score is very suspenseful.  The only slasher film that comes close to perfection is ""Halloween.""  Remember: the key is suspense, NOT blood and gore.  My evaluation: **** out of ****."
"Dtkoyzis","Null","15","26","12 February 2001"," a classic, but hardly Hitch's best
","The first time I saw this film I was quite disappointed.  So much of it has become cliché in the four decades since its release, including the famous shower scene, Perkins' oedipal relationship with his mother, and even Bernard Herrmann's unsettling score.  I had known the identity of Perkins' ""mother"" even before I saw the film and had to be told by a sibling that the audience was not supposed to be aware of this up to the last.  It was like knowing the punch line in advance and not really getting the joke once it was actually told.  It is, to be sure, a tribute to Hitchcock that this film has become so much a part of North American popular culture, but the downside is that the element of shock that so affected audiences back in 1960 is almost entirely lost on a later generation of viewers.  One thus has to imagine what it would have been like to see it during its first run in the movie theatres.<br/><br/>Had I been there at its opening, I think I would still have judged this film to be inferior to the string of excellent Hitchcock offerings preceding it during the previous decadefrom ""Strangers on a Train"" to ""North by Northwest.""  Why?  So much of his previous work had relied on the use of suspense to draw the viewers into the plot.  A good thriller builds this up carefully and deliberately until the final climax at or near the end of the film.  Good suspense leaves much unstated and works its way subtly into the imagination.  It's what you don't see that's the scariest. Think, for example, of the murder in ""Rear Window.""  You hear a crash and a short, shrill scream followed by ominous silence, but you're not really sure what's happened until much later.  Here, on the other hand, Hitch kills off his heroine brutally near the beginning of the film, leaving little if anything to the imagination, and largely putting aside the issues we had been misled to think the plot was building up to.<br/><br/>Moreover, despite Hitch's tongue-in-cheek claim that he had intended it as a comedy, there is little of the director's famous humour so much in evidence in the immediately preceding film, ""North by Northwest.""  There is not much humour to be found in shock, while there is great humorous potential in suspense.  He should have stuck with suspense and left shock to a lesser director.<br/><br/>I alluded to Herrmann's score.  Without it, I think this would have been judged a far less effective film and less the classic it is generally reputed to be.  Imagine Leigh driving along the highway without the composer's jittery music in the backgroundor, perhaps more accurately, the foreground.  In such scenes it is the music that almost entirely creates the suspenseful atmosphere.  Without it there is nothing of the sortjust Leigh driving and looking in her rear view mirror.  Period.  Not very scary.<br/><br/>Is it a classic then?  It is, insofar as it influenced a whole generation of movie-goers and film makers who sought to imitate it.  But on its own merits, I don't think so."
"Rosebud-49","9","13","22","21 September 1999"," Spellbound by Hitch
","Only a sinister organization such as the Academy would bypass Alfred Hitchcock as Best Director in 1960. Psycho is a masterpiece and Hitch will be remembered for centuries regarding his classic portrayal of a young Norman Bates, his run-down motel, and the mysterious relationship and death of his Mother. From Sam Loomis, Marion and Lila Crane, Detective Arbogast, Mr. Lowry, and even the used car salesman, Psycho is filled with astonishing characters, suspenseful plot twists, and a climax that would make every child in America think twice before entering the basement.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock was an American icon and Psycho is a true reflection of his genius. To his day, Psycho remains one of best films of its genre. Further, Hitchcock's talent has stood the test of time, ultimately earning him the most honorable surname ""The Master of Suspense""."

","I have been reading some of the comments about Psycho and was shocked to read that some of the viewers thought that it was rubbish. You have to realise that for its day it was a shocker. It broke all the conventions of the horror films in that day. Every shot was carefully thought out, for example, because of film laws, Hitchcock couldn't show the knife touch the body in Shower scene, but the way that it was shot made you believe that you were seeing it.<br/><br/>Many people prefere the new version because it is in colour. Colour films had been around for quite some time when the film was made. Hitchcock decided to make it in Black and White for a reasion. You have to agree that it makes the film very scary. The shadows are enhanced on the house and Norman's face appears to be horribly hollow, just like the final image of his mother.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the new version is good, but the use of colour changes the initial image that Hitchcock wanted to put across."

","The first Alfred Hitchcock film I saw was The Birds and I thought it was a film which couldn't be beaten in its genre, until I saw, ""Psycho."" (There are a few spoilers here.) Horror films usually leave you cold and chilled and as shocking and disturbing Psycho is, it's a film you can somehow warm to. The shower scene is a scene like no other.  Its more shocking than frightening, the instant when the curtain draws back and you are faced with a shadowy figure clutching a knife sucks the adrenalin out you like a sponge, after Marion is viciously stabbed she clutches the shower curtain and falls to the floor, so simple yet so powerful. The full story which is one that you really need to know nothing about to get the full affect.  Unfortunately I knew quite a bit about it before I saw it.

"hveiti","10","12","20","27 November 2000"," Legendary, in both a good and a bad way
","Not much to be said about this that hasn't been said before.  Only the second Hitchcock film I've ever seen, and so far there isn't a single positive thing that's been said about him that I can disagree with. Calling someone 'The Master' is terminology that I would usually frown upon as being too dismissive of other greatly talented people, but after witnessing the directing, the cinematography, the subtle performances, the inimitable atmosphere and the quiet genius of this masterpiece, I find myself forced to agree.  The notorious shower scene manages to be shocking, brutal and understated all at once, and its infamy on the pages of motion picture history is well-deserved.  Anthony Perkins is subtly explosive, like a match waiting to be struck.  He plays Bates with a boyish, grinning charm that generally belies his chilling insanity.  Also worthy of mention is Bernard Herrmann's incredible score, possibly one of the best I've ever heard.<br/><br/>In a curious way, the one thing I find disagreeable about this movie is, indeed, its legend.  I cannot imagine how much I would have enjoyed it had I not known any of the plot twists beforehand, and could have gone into it unknowingly.  Still, perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the legend is completely due, because this film's merit becomes obvious when you consider that first-time viewers of my generation (I'm 21 years old), who have become inundated with the blood, gore and overblown special effects of today's blockbusters, can still find its subtle ingenuity chilling and scary in equal measure.  Beautiful. 10/10"
"llihilloh","10","12","20","25 November 2000"," This is what good movies are all about.
","This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created. <br/><br/>Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone. <br/><br/>Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever. <br/><br/>The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.<br/><br/>Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see."
"HK Cat","Null","12","20","20 February 2000"," Timing, Hitchcock made it special.
","In reading the comments of some, I think that to have seen Hitchcock's Psycho when it opened in '60, is to fully understand its impact today. It was a masterpiece then and remains a masterpiece today. Superior direction and camera work, and as one person commented, the film was released at a time when [psychological] monsters in the form of the ""boy next door,"" was not explored in films. Yes, Psycho started slow by today's standards, but the style back then was to move from the pleasant familiar to the darkest of horrors. Hitchcock understood how to create atmosphere and mood. His shower scene, while some today wonder what the hoopla is all about, set a standard of horror in an ordinary setting. How many films have copied this scene? I remember as a kid, fearing showers and hotels after seeing this flick. Hitchcock reportedly said that it was a good thing he didn't place Crane on the toilet (sic), or people would have a phobia about toilets. Ironically, in Psycho 3 (?), a character was killed while on the toilet. The remake of two years ago sucked--big time. Hitchcock's Psycho not only had the master at the helm, but it was also a matter of timing in cinema history. Those elements cannot be duplicated."
"maestrocomics2","10","12","20","6 February 2000"," A True Classic.
","I feel that this movie is superior to Alfred Hitchcock's other films and that it, rather than ""Vertigo"", should be considered his masterpiece.  Even though it was shot on a small budget, its suspense, thanks to Hitchcock's direction, Tomasini's flawless editing, and Bernard Herrmann's still holds up on multiple viewings.  Also important to the film is solid acting from Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam and John L. Russell's constantly under-rated photography."
"THE FRA","10","12","20","16 January 2000"," Technical excellence, at its best.
","Ever wonder what the movie history would be like, if the ""genius"" of Hitchcock, were never brought to silver screen? Aside from the story line, the cast, and the acting, the highest point of this film, to myself, is the camera direction. Being a past film and tv school grad', all I can say is, this one is a masterpiece. The angles and the way he let's the camera, lead or suggest to the viewer, the next scene,is alone, among the best direction of any movie. To see what Im saying, when next shown, turn the volume off, and just let the camera , under his direction, tell you the story. I believe one will get a different understanding of this film, and a greater appreciation of the director."
"salatiello","9","21","39","4 March 2001"," This is one to watch again and again.
","Alfred Hitchcock's crisp efficiency is not unlike that of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the dutiful son who cleans up after his mother in the landmark thriller ""Psycho.""  Not only is this a masterfully directed suspense chiller, it actually set standards by which all fright films since have been measured.  The cinema has produced some great scores, but Bernard Herrmann's music is incredibly enhancing and simply unforgettable, one of the best ever (and it did not even get an Oscar nomination for Best Score). The more I watch ""Psycho,"" the more I prefer the first half, with its sense of dread and a fascinatingly cool Janet Leigh (Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). Hitchcock, of course, never won the Best Director Oscar, but was nominated for ""Psycho,"" one of 1960's biggest box-office hits.  Shockingly, Anthony Perkins, in a career-making role and one of the most famous performances in screen history, failed to win a Best Actor nomination -- probably because the performance was too edgy and disturbing (which is what made it great).  Some scenes are dated, of course, but this film almost never falters.  It gets a ""9"" (and a very high nine at that) from me."
"Movie-12","10","20","37","27 October 1999"," One of the best horror films of all time. **** out of ****
","PSYCHO (1960) ****<br/><br/>Starring: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, Janet Leigh, and  John McIntire Director: Alfred Hitchcock   Running time: 109 minutes    Rated R (for scenes of strong violence)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	Alfred Hitchcock is easily one of the most acclaimed directors in film history--right up there with Stanley Kubrick and Steven Speilberg. His films defined horror for generations, especially with what many people are still calling the scariest movie of all time: ""Psycho."" Over the years, the movie has been given much praise. It has had the honor to be placed in the American Film Institute's best 100 movies of all time list. The film has had the privilege to be re-created in 1998 by great director Gus Van Sant, who also added new actors and coloration to this classic tale. ""Psycho"" also has had the fortunate pleasure to have been followed up by several time-lapsing sequels, although not equal in quality, which continued the story and characters beyond the original film's restrictions. On top of all this, the movie has a unique story line, unusual characters, imagination-provoking motives, and manages to conduct its rare structure like no other film. ""Psycho"" is one of the better thrillers of our time. <br/><br/>	First lets take a look at the unique but perfectly organized structure of this classic horror tale. It beholds what I call a false first act. The first act opens by introducing a character named Marion Crane, sister of Lila Crane, who steals $40, 000 from her employer one day and is in the process of leaving town when her situation is complicated even more. Marion is pulled over by a mysterious police man, who checks out the circumstances, and then allows her to continue on with her journey. He then follows her many miles to a car dealer, where Marion cleverly trades her current car in for a used junkie to camouflage herself from peering foes. Marion then continues to drive along the busy highway until a shielding rainstorm persuades her to stop to rest at The Bates Motel. (spoilers ahead) Then she meets the owner, Norman Bates, who explains to her that his mother is a lunatic. Marion then goes to her cabin where she is stabbed to death in the shower by an unknown predator who looks like an old woman.<br/><br/>
	Extraordinary, a simply flawless false first act. The movie introduces a character, a problem, and complicates it for the character involved. Then the conclusion (the murder of Marion) solves the first initial problem, throwing us off balance. While we recover, the filmmakers open a brand new series of events, this time detailing the missing Marion Crane. A detective, Milton Arbogast, who tries to investigate Norman's mother, is also killed in the process of doing so. Lila's investigation of her own evolves the second act problems, all winding towards the same awe-inspiring denouement, which I will not have the audacity to reveal to you. <br/><br/>	Now for some nice pointers for ""Psycho"": The opening scene develops Marion Crane's romantic characteristics as well as her personal morals. The scene in which Marion decides to commit theft is never explained to us through dialogue like many lesser films would do, but through Marion's complex stares at the cash and her reactions to it. The police officer's behavior is a whole plot in itself, and since the character's point of view is so focused, we know nothing more about this suspicious man than Crane herself. The Atmosphere of the Bates Motel is one of the creepiest moods I have ever experienced in the movies. Not to mention the famous shower scene, certainly the most shocking and grisly slasher moment of all time. The investigation of Marion's disappearance has a specific odyssey to it--intriguing and unsatisfying. All these minor elements contribute to making ""Psycho"" the most talked about films ever. <br/><br/>	There is a small, but quite noticeable, opinion flaw in the last ten minutes of ""Psycho,"" however. It is the scene where the detective explains the disturbing behavior of Norman Bates to the film's remaining characters, but also to the audience. This scene has never been necessary. The picture would have ended with much more controversy and fantasy if the writers would have left the strangeness of Norman to the imagination rather than explaining elements to us, not to mention the fact that all answers are revealed in the many sequels. I think it would have been interesting to see what happened if Gus Van Sant would have left that sequence out of his re-make, after all, he added a lustful masturbation scene, so why couldn't he have taken out some unneeded material as well. Oh well, I guess, until another actor attempts to master the terror found in the eyes of Anthony Perkins, we'll just have to juggle around these ideas in our minds of how this near-perfect movie could have been better. Don't you love it when movie's make you do that!<br/><br/>Brought to you by Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures."

I have always seen it appear in lists of top horror movies, top movies from the 1960s, top thriller movies etc. and i have wanted to watch it for the longest time. The acting is phenomenal (bar a couple of minor characters) and the storyline is excellent. Due to the movie being created in the 1960s, CGI was not used, meaning they had to rely on practical effects. Although not very explicit and violent, the practical effects are done well, and the viewer is allowed to imagine the rest. Psycho has done a great job of leaving me feeling unsettled and intrigued at the same time. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the dialogue is so natural and brilliant. It is so cleverly written with a couple of twists and turns at the end, which leaves you feeling so satisfied.

Hitchcock took a story and made it his masterpiece. Scary from start to finish, keeping you on the edge of your seat and asking yourself questions like, Are there people like Norman Bates in my world?
Masterly filmed in Black and White with a cracking music score that makes it even more impairing.
Hitchcock funded the film himself by mortgaging his house, as none of the film companies believed in Psycho.
Nearly sixty years later and it is one of Hitchcock's best films.

"ironhorse_iv","9","4","5","26 June 2013"," I'm a little bit psycho for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. It's amazing!
","Some critics believe 'Psycho' to be Director Alfred Hitchcock's Magnum opus. In my opinion, it's an masterpiece that set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films. Even before the 1960's, Alfred Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense and perhaps the best-known film director in the world at the time. This movie just add to it with subliminal themes, subtext and images. The center theme of Psycho is the concept of multiplies identifies where characters are challenge to live through life under multiplies roles. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is just that type of a character. She is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and living in a double life with her affect with strong will Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One day, Marion is given money to be deposited in the bank. Instead of depositing it, Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her love affair Sam. Rather than meeting Sam, she finds a nervous charming innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) at the Motel, she was staying. He was control by his over demanding mother. Anthony Perkins gives a subtle performance here. She is taken by Norman Bates innocent charm, as she sees him as the fragile alter-ego of Sam. In many ways, Norman Bates and Sam have very similar stories, the only different is that Norman can't live without her mother, while Sam can. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, as the shower scene is probably the film's most famous sequence. In a way, the shower scene was like baptismal waters. Marion had decided to go back, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she cleaning herself of sin. I like the fact that Marion's underwear is white before the theft, and black after. Feeling in rage that Marion might steal Norman away from her when Marion suggests to Norman that he put his mother in a mental hospital, her mother strikes Marion, only for Norman to cover it up. When Marion goes off missing, her personality live on with her double, twin sister Lila Crane (Vera Miles) who finds herself staying at the Bates motel, just like her long-lost sister. I love how Hitchcock utilized and probably was the first to establish the writing technique of the false protagonist. The false protagonist is when the viewers are introduced to a character that supposed to be the main character, only to be removed from the story either by death or other means early in the film. By removing Marion Crane from the story, early on. It might offend Janet Leigh's fans, but Alfred Hitchcock's know what's for the best. One of the best image scenes are the mirrors in why show that the characters have multiply personality. Another running theme is the money. The stolen money that Marion carries about with her represents her dirty little secrets. Hitchcock goes so far as to symbolically link this pile of money to a pile of feces. Every talk about money is weaved into dialogue about how filthy it is. While the showing scene can be seen as erotica for Norman Bates; Norman Bates mother sees it as filth. Contrary to a widely told tale, Hitchcock did not arrange for the water to suddenly go ice-cold during the shower scene to elicit an effective scream from Leigh. But Hitchcock did tested the shock value of Mother's corpse by placing it in Leigh's dressing room and listening to how loud she screamed when she notice it there. Compare to Modern Day Slasher films, this film is really tame of violence. The film was known to be nauseating for some viewers at the time, even with it being shot in black and white. The novel is more brutal than the film version. It had a beheading no less in it. Alfred Hitchcock cut it out, and did stabbing instead. Even with its graphic nature, the ""shower scene"" never once shows a knife puncturing flesh. Alfred Hitchcock desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory so he film the movie in black and white, while also trying to cut cost down. I think, the biggest reason why it is in black and white is because it's better for horror films with the use of shadows. While it is tame, the movie is still disturbing. Hints why the film still have the Rated R label. What might bizarre is how often the film talks about eating. Considering that the writer of the original book, Robert Bloch based his story loosely upon the activities of serial killer and cannibal Ed Gein, some of these constant references to eating could simply be a sly reference to cannibalism. One subliminal theme of Psycho is when Norman chats to Marion about his hobby of taxidermy. It's remind us another Hitchcock classic movie 1963's The Birds. By having Marion eat like a bird, and having a last name like a bird. No wonder why Norman wants to eat her all up, but Norman couldn't hurt a fly or could he. That's actually a form of symbolism. The soundtrack of screeching violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled ""The Murder"" is amazing. It works for the film so well. This film sequels that followed in 1983 are just mediocre at best. There was also a 1998's remake of the film with Director Gus Van Sant that was God awful. 2012 and 2013 was a big high for Psycho fans as Bates Motel started to aired on A&E. Anthony Hopkins star in 2012 film Hitchcock about filming the movie, and also a HBO telefilm call 'The Girl"" with Toby Jones as Hitchcock during the filming of this movie, Psycho."
"reedmilder","10","16","29","2 March 2001"," My favorite film!!!
","Although it is extremely difficult to pick a single film as one's favorite, this would be my pick if I were forced to choose.  No, it is not because it is the most shocking or original film ever made (as if there could be).  In 40 years, the film has lost much of what made it revolutionary in 1960.  It is simply a fantastic screenplay that keeps me on the edge of my seat at all times.<br/><br/>This is Hitchcock's best work as a director in my opinion.  Though he rarely made a bad film, most of Hitch's films are commercially-directed. I think of North By Northwest, Suspicion, Notorious and The Man Who Knew Too Much as examples.  Though each is a fantastic film, they are not terribly stimulating too watch and have minimal artistic merit.  Psycho, by contrast, is a true work of art.  No one could have expected it to be a hit at the time and was a great departure from Hitch's 1950s films.  There are no Cary Grants or Jimmy Stewarts here.  Just minor stars like Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam.<br/><br/>The two aspects of Psycho that set it apart are its cinematography and score.  There are no panoramic views typical of great cinematographic works. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a B movie.  One need only watch the famous shower scene to understand what I am talking about.  It is perhaps the most breathtaking 2 minutes ever put to film.  Hitch's close up shot of Marion's eye is still jolting today.  Imagine watching the scene on the big screen in 1960!  I guess what truly sets this film apart is the score. Perhaps no film is as tied to its score.  Bernard Herrmann may be the best there ever was at his profession.  His scores for Vertigo and Marnie are also top notch.<br/><br/>Just watch this film.  If you've never seen it, it will provide a unique and surprising experience.  If you've already seen it, watch it again and enjoy Hitch at his best!  If you love Psycho as I do, check out Polanski's Repulsion, the French film Diabolique, and Hitch's first talkie Blackmail."

However, it is a really good movie, mostly because of the great performance of 'Norman Bates'. I don't understand why somebody will consider his performance as dry or dull. His performance is fabulous! It was so scary when you saw him having that evil smile on his face, in the dark when he just said goodbye to Marion. You know there's something wrong with him but you don't know what will happen next. You can guess he's probably the murderer but don't know why. The ending is quite surprising. I like the ending.

It has this special style that could only be achieved through the eyes of Alfred Hitchcock and the excellent actors in the film.  There is this mysteriousness that presides over the movie, and that is what adds to the overall feeling from Psycho. Hitchcock's eye for great suspense really does the trick for this movie. He also chose to go Black and White in this movie, instead of color for his own stylistic purposes (and to hide the redness of...yeah.) The B&W really makes the movie more ""scary"". No one can forget the Bates Motel or the mysterious house on the hill behind it with ""that person"" in the window.  Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates also has his best performance of his career in this movie, bringing the character of Norman Bates to life. Even 40 years later, no movie is able to stand up to Psycho or make a larger impact on world culture.  Truly the best movie of all time, definitely a 10/10."

Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!<br/><br/>Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!<br/><br/>10 out of 10 OF COURSE!!!!!!!!"

","A respectable 30-year-old spinster steals $40,000 from her workplace and takes off on a solo car journey to nowhere.  She makes the fateful mistake of staying overnight at the Bates Motel ...<br/><br/>     There is a difference between a great film, where the cast and technicians seem inspired and the project is carried along on the energy of its ideas, and a merely good film, in which the cleverness is calculated, and the tricks are consciously inserted.  ""Psycho"" is merely a good film.<br/><br/>     But what cleverness!  The incidental music of Bernard Herrman, Hitchcock's composer of choice, has a discordant, staccato leitmotif in the strings which repeats constantly, building almost hypnotically towards the shrill climax of the shower scene.  Hitchcock deploys a battery of subtle devices to keep the viewer feeling vaguely uneasy.  Sexual frankness was a shocking thing in a mainstream movie in 1960, and the opening scene (showing Marion's ""extended lunch hour"" with Sam) is so sexually honest that it cannot have failed to disturb contemporary cinema audiences.  Faces are lit from below or the side, creating an inchoate sense of foreboding.  Owls and ravens, traditional omens of evil, preside silently over Norman's parlour. The windshield wiper which fails to clear the rain is a symbol of Marion's guilty conscience.<br/><br/>     The film's abiding mood is one of creepy uneasiness, and this is reinforced at every turn by Hitchcock's system of visual imagery.  There is, of course, the Old Dark House, but far less obvious techniques are also at work.  As Arbogast mounts the stairs, the camera retreats disconcertingly before him.  The tines of the rakes in Sam's store are raised like bony, clutching fingers behind Lila's head.  Marion's unblinking eyeball is compositionally echoed by the circular plughole, the water draining out as her life force ebbs away.<br/><br/>     In the long dialogue scene between Norman and Marion (""We all go a little mad sometimes""), the rhythm of the cutting is exquisite.  Sometimes we see the speaker, sometimes the listener, as the rapidity of the cuts forms a counterpoint to the text, and emphasises the discomfort of the characters (Marion wary but self-possessed, Norman outwardly affable but painfully shy).<br/><br/>     The cinematic axiom, ""Show it, don't tell it"", is beautifully illustrated in the scene in Marion's bedroom.  The camera closes in on the bundles of banknotes lying on the bed, then pans to the packed suitcase, telling us without the need for words that she has decided to take the money and run.<br/><br/>     Then something puzzling happens.  The film seems to lose all belief in its own precepts, and the rich visual symbolism is abruptly abandoned.  Lila opines, ""I'll feel better when all this is explained,"" but she is wrong. The explanation is a huge let-down.  We get Dr. Simon, a psychiatrist, lecturing us at tedious length about Norman's condition.  ""Show it, don't tell it"" flies out of the window.  Maybe Stefano, the scriptwriter, realised that the running time was already over two hours and the thing needed its loose ends tied up rapidly.  Perhaps the flat, prosaic ending is the price Hitch has to pay for the slow painstaking build-up in the early reels (it is almost half an hour before Norman makes it onto the screen).  Whatever the reason, I for one found the closing section very disappointing."
"kalina2","10","6","9","28 April 2006"," Saw it in 1960
","I saw this movie in a packed house in 1960 without any knowledge of the plot--and judging by the reaction of the audience when the shower scene occurred, no one else had knowledge either.<br/><br/>When the scene began developing, there were gasps. When the curtain few open there were screams, and they continued during the stabbing. A state of fright literally hung over the theater. When Ms. Leigh slid down slowly, dying, people were still gasping and crying out. They were there! They had witnessed a real murder! Nothing in any previous movie had prepared the audience for this kind of shock.<br/><br/>It was years before I could take a shower and not re-experience that state of fright again.<br/><br/>Maybe you had to be there to understand this."
"JoeysGirl4Ever","Null","6","9","20 February 2004"," Don't worry... NOT A SPOILER
","Knowing all of Hitchcock's little quirks makes watching one of his films more interesting.  His preference of blondes, his obsession with the bathroom and the letters BM are just a few.  Hitchcock liked to use foreshadowing also in his films, which makes the film more interesting to the viewer because while some would think it distracts from the element of surprise, it's done in such a subtle way that it only makes a difference if the viewer is looking for it.  The viewer isn't sure what will happen next but there are little clues to add more of the mystery element to the suspense story. Also, the actors play their scenes well especially Anthony Perkins who seems to have schizophrenia down to a science.<br/><br/>         Janet Leigh does well as a confused girl gone bad, (Not so much a good girl because she has hotel rendezvous with a certain non-committal man.) her character Marion Crane, takes a drastic measure in hopes to seal the deal with her boyfriend and things don't work out so well for her.  In this process Janet has to act out the famous `shower scene' and does so very well; it has to be difficult to play a naked woman in a distressed situation but the viewer wouldn't guess so from her performance.  Anthony Perkins, who plays Norman Bates, also does very well, he is truly an amazing actor.  When Anthony plays the actual Norman he's so convincing as a charming young man, as a female viewer it's almost hard to not fall for the boy-next-door facade he puts on; then there is Norman's alter-ego, his other half, that the viewer gains full details about at the conclusion of the film.  This alter ego is not displayed until the ending also in a very creepy moment that takes the cake for this performance.                     <br/><br/> <br/><br/>        The little clues that Hitchcock places in the story are very subtle but are fun to think about after viewing the movie, for instance, Norman's love for stuffing things and keeping them `alive' so to speak; after watching the film it puts a few more pieces of the puzzle together.  Another of Hitchcock's quirks is to show up in his film at random spots, one of which is in front of the business where Marion works.  Hitchcock has a hat on and is standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross the street in the scene when Marion comes back from her lunch break.  The work scene also displays yet another of Hitchcock's loves: blondes.  There are two secretaries in the office, Marion the blonde and her opposite the brunette who doesn't even get named.  A very wealthy businessman comes into the workplace and immediately gives his attention to Marion, not only that but her opposite is a complete ditz.  She doesn't sound very intelligent and seems very oblivious, especially when she makes the comment that Mr. `Wealthy' must have seen her wedding ring that's why he didn't flirt with her.  (When in fact it's obvious that she's NOT very attractive.                <br/><br/>          All in all this movie was very good, the suspenseful moments are very effective and this viewer found herself plugging her ears and turning her head at some moments.  Psycho has received many outstanding reviews and they are justly given, this reviewer would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys suspenseful movies even if some of the `fight' scenes are a little corny.  (It is filmed in the 60's)  Just be prepared to avoid motel showers in fear of being `all washed up'."
"SohiKwor","Null","13","24","6 December 1998"," Impressions
","I didn't find Psycho deathly scary (the shower scene was too quick, I'll have to watch it again.) But the violent scenes did scare me and are all memorable. The Old Dark House that Norman Bates lives in (with his Mother), his wholesomeness, his habit of eating something (I don't know what) while he talks with the detective, his freakish smile, are all memorable. The ways in which Norman Bates' eyes change expression just in conversation with Marion is incredible.<br/><br/>Hitchcock claimed Psycho was a big comedy. He was exaggerating, but some of it is--the first third is suspenseful but funny, especially the office banter and the close-up mugshot of the cop. Hitchcock was frightened of the police as a child, and it shows. The last comedic scene is the psychiatrist. His purpose isn't really to explain Norman Bates to us, but to bring us back into banal daily life so abruptly that we laugh. Then Hitch draws up our hackles again with the shot of Norman Bates sitting alone, and the car being dredged up.<br/><br/>Finally the cinematography in this movie is godly. I know zero about film criticism, but I can see the beauty and symmetry of every shot. The sets are clean and free of distractions. The light is awesome. The dark is awesome. The movie is awesome."

Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles $40,000 and runs away to meet up with her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). While on her travels she stops at the Bates Motel and meets up with the shy, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives in a house right above the motel with his ""mother"".

A few days later, Marion's sister, Lila (Vera Miles) meets up with Sam and a private investigator (Martin Balsam) to determine what happened to Marion and the money, but not before suspecting Norman and his motel may have something to do with it. <br/><br/>From the beginning theme to the last view of Marion's car being pulled from the swamp, this movie is outstanding. Hitch really knew how to fool around with the audience and created some terrifying moments that still scare even after 40 years. The shower scene still scares me! Anthony Perkins was good here but not as good as in ""Psycho II"", and the supporting performances from Vera Miles and John Gavin were fine. They made a good investigative team. Miles was very determined to find out what happened to her sister, which made you feel sympathetic to her pleas. Janet Leigh, in the 40 minutes she is on screen, was excellent. Now I can understand where her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis gets her screaming from! ""Psycho"" was followed by 3 sequels and a remake which doesn't even come close at what this film did by scaring people."

","Although it is virtually impossible to replicate the effect of the original release in 1960, ""Psycho"" remains a disturbing and macabre psychological thriller where we watch a meticulous work with the camera that thickens the suspense coupled with the soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann and Anthony Perkins's performance of Norman Bates, in addition to a most well-structured argument. This is quintessential Hitchcock, inspired by the true case of the murderer Ed Gein. Hitch then frankly defied the limits of the already agonizing, though still active Production Code. ""Psycho"" addressed such themes as adultery, homicide, Oedipus Complex, transvestism, mental disorder, exhumed bodies, everything exposed both subtly and graphically. ""Psycho"" introduced us to an antagonist of enormous psychological density; a psychopath with indelible mental disorders whose causes and motives were only fully discovered in the whodunit's climax."

","Marion (Janet Leigh) works for a real estate agent and earns, most likely, very little bucks in the late fifties. She loves a handsome gentleman named Sam (John Gavin) but, alas, his divorce has left his prospects dim, as a good deal of his money goes to his ex-wife. In fact, he lives in another California town, behind the hardware store he runs. Marion is getting tired of meeting Sam in cheap hotels and listening to his weak promises. One day, a crooked businessman comes in with $40,000 cash for a house he is buying for his daughter, who is marrying soon. Marion's boss is aghast to hold this much money so he sends Marion to the bank on a Friday afternoon. The money never gets deposited. Going a bit ""crazy"", Marion takes the cash and runs north, thinking this will allow Sam to marry her. But, a heavy downpour makes Marion stop at an out-of-the-way motel, The Bates. Greeted by the motel's owner, Norman ( a superb Anthony Perkins), Marion soon learns she is the only guest and is given the best room. Norman even brings her a meal, over the objections of his mother, who Marion sees in a window and hears from the 'big house"" behind the motel. After she eats, Marion decides maybe she should take the money back in the morning and steps into the shower. Suddenly and ghastly, Marion is stabbed to death by, its assumed, Norman's mother. Norman cleans the place up and sinks Marion's car, along with the money, into a pond near the motel. All too soon, Sam and Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) are looking for her. A private eye goes snooping, too, hired by the man with the bucks, for he can't notify the police. When the PI gets to the Bates, Norman's mother makes short work of him, too. Another car goes swimming and sinks. But, when Sam and Lila likewise trail Marion to the Bates, will more deaths ensue? Is there bigger secrets afoot? You bet! This classic tale of a psychosis and murder is rightly one of Hitchcock's most famous films. DEFINITELY SCARIER THAN SCARY, many folks never take a shower again after viewing it. Perkins is beyond great as the weird Norman and Leigh, Gavin, and Miles do their parts quite nicely. The twist at the end is compelling while, even in black and white, the film's production is stunning. Don't miss this one if you dare!"
"ChristianLeFeuvre","10","2","2","1 May 2019"," A true 'classic'
","One of the greatest films ever made, by one of the greatest directors in movie history.......
Janet Leigh stars as Marion Crane, who embezzles $40,000 from her employer and goes on the run. When she becomes tired whilst driving in the rain at night, she pulls into the 'Bates Motel' and meets Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins. Unfortunately, Marion's stay isn't as relaxing as she'd hoped and she is murdered whilst taking a shower.
There are so many things about this film that make it a genuine classic, from the direction to the brilliant cast and acting.
'Psycho' was so influential to future horror/slasher movies in so many ways, but what Hitchcock did so well was to make Norman Bates so opposite to the usual depiction of murderers in movies, he's not the typical unattractive loners who have difficulty in communicating with anyone, on the contrary, Anthony Perkins is a handsome guy who is very charming in this film, and Hitchcock makes him almost likeable, sensitive and makes the audience quite sympathetic towards him. When we first meet him he is so sweet-tempered and mild, and during a conversation with Marion we learn that he is under the control of a harsh, disciplinarian mother and is almost traumatised by her to the point that, despite being a grown man, he is almost child-like and this is made clearer by a line he says to Marion, 'A boy's best friend is his mother'. We even hear 'Mother' belittling Norman and shouting at him, seemingly jealous of any attractive female guests, and we then get that famous shower scene of 'mother' killing Marion.
The shower scene is still as effective as it was in the '60s when the film was released, especially with Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.
The way Hitchcock builds the suspense in this film, and how he overturns our expectations is unparalleled. The violence in 'Psycho' by today's standards is actually pretty tame and most of it is, in reality, down to the sound effects and the viewers' imagination. And this is what Hitchcock always insisted on, that any 'horror', and the 'scares' comes from the suggestion of violence. It's the way the audience's brains fill in the gaps of the things we don't actually see, that's what's scary, cause no matter what any film-maker can show, it can never be as scary as what our imaginations can come up with.
This movie didn't just have a surprise twist ending, or violent murder scenes, it told its story in a very unique way. Killing off the leading lady so early in the film, the sparse amount of characters, the remote location, the build-up of the tension all these were completely new to audiences at the time, and even today we don't see this done so often, and certainly not done as well as Hitchcock did it.
Nearly 60 years on from its first release, 'Psycho' remains incredibly influential and still very thrilling and scary.
A true 'classic' in every sense."

","Psycho has to be Hitchcock's magnum opus it's that brilliant. It's a masterful symbiosis of plot, story, acting and directing. I would say that Psycho is the genesis of the slasher movie. That may or may not be something to be proud of considering many of the slashers out there but I would venture to say that Psycho is the first.<br/><br/>Also among the firsts would have to be Norman Bates. That name needs no introduction or any description much like Jason Voorhees, Michael Meyers, Freddy Kruger, and Chucky. If there were a conference of them all then Norman would be in the godfather's seat. The performance by Anthony Perkins was stellar. From the talkativeness to the jittery, stammering nervousness, to the mad silence as the voice in his head spoke he was terrific. Too many performances in the 50's and 60's were stuffy, not so Anthony Perkins. Hitchcock chose the perfect actor to make this film legendary."

","""Psycho"", the Hitchcock masterpiece of 1960, is still a scary ride. TCM presented it on Halloween night, which was an appropriate way to add to all the horror being shown on television.<br/><br/>As the film opens, we are treated to Saul Bass' titles that herald some of what one is expecting will come in the film. Then, one hears the magnificent opening bars of Bernard Herrmann's music score and one realizes this is not an ordinary movie. The crisp black and white cinematography by John Russell, as well as the intelligent editing by George Tomasini, surpass any doubt this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Of course, the film owes a debt to Joseph Stefano who adapted the Robert Bloch novel, in which the movie is based, with great flair.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" works because of the wonderful cast assembled for the movie. Anthony Perkins was an actor who could play anything. His range was enormous, as he shows in the film. His Norman Bates shows a man that appears to be in complete control of himself. We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done. Alas, she was not going to make good on her resolve.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also interesting. Martin Balsam plays the private detective well. He is instrumental in cracking Norman's confidence, but of course, it comes with a high price he must pay for trying to shake the sick man. Vera Miles and John Gavin are seen as Marion's sister and boyfriend.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" will remain an exercise in horror by a man who knew how to scare us, Alfred Hitchcock!"

"lee_eisenberg","10","7","12","14 July 2005"," since everyone knows the story, let's talk about camera angles and such...
","I checked the spoiler box because I think that even any discussion about camera angles will give the ending away. For starters, when Marion and Norman first meet, you can see Norman's reflection in the window, as if there's two of him. When Marion and Norman are eating dinner in the room with the stuffed birds, you can see that some of the birds are positioned so that their beaks look almost as if they're pecking at both Marion and Norman; something is eating at Norman, and we get to see a premonition of Marion's impending fate. When Norman looks through the hole (which incidentally is behind a picture of two people attacking a woman), we get a POV shot; when Marion is in the shower, we get a POV shot. When Norman pushes Marion's car into the swamp, half of his face is in a shadow, as if he has two sides.<br/><br/>On the subject of those birds, there are several references to birds throughout the movie: Marion's last name is Crane, she comes from Phoenix, and finally, the stuffed birds. The truth is, Hitchcock had a keen interest in avians; in ""Sabotage"", a woman finds her strength after watching ""Who Killed Cock Robin?"", then the bird references in ""Psycho"", and finally, the ornithological uprising in ""The Birds"". Speaking of the characters' names, there's Crane (a bird), Bates (bait), Loomis (gloom), and Arbogast (aghast).<br/><br/>Another thing that Hitch does in this movie is play with the audience. First, the movie focuses on Marion. When she steals the money, you're not sure whether to root for her, because she is the main character and you want her to succeed, but do you want her to steal? Then, the movie focuses on Norman. When he hides Marion's murder, you want him to succeed, but succeed in hiding a murder? Finally, the focus shifts to Lila.<br/><br/>Everyone remembers the shower scene, but what does it mean? It seems as though Marion, by flushing the paper down the toilet, was washing away her misdeeds, and taking a shower consecrated that.<br/><br/>The dialogue is of course a key part. Obviously, ""Mother...what's the phrase...isn't quite herself today."" and ""A boy's best friend is his mother."" are premonitions, but there are others. In the discussion of institutions, Norman talks about ""...the cruel eyes studying you."" Then, when he looks through the hole, his eyes study Marion. At the end, you might say that there are three explanations: first, the bombastic psychiatrist explains Norman's mental state; then, ""mother"" describes how her son is guilty; and finally, the car is towed out of the swamp, as though they have dug into the putridity of Norman's mind. They have penetrated Norman's mind, just like the knives penetrated Marion's and Arbogast's bodies.<br/><br/>On the DVD, you should watch the original trailer, which has Hitch showing us around the motel and house. He was really playing with the audience there. First off, he looked into a toilet. No movie had ever portrayed a toilet (but everyone knew why toilets existed), so what must the audience have thought about that? Also, he looks in a closet, looks surprised, and closes the closet. Did he see something in there? I try to imagine being someone who saw that trailer, and then saw the movie, waiting to see what would happen."

","Psycho is definitely the best Hitchcock movie, and the best mystery movie of all time.  Maybe it's not a really scary movie, but it is great and dramatic.  It kept me guessing until the end.  The end scene had to be the scariest, much better than the infamous shower scene.  Anthony Perkins is brilliant, along with some other cast members.  It makes you think long after the movie.  I would give it *** out of four or a B+."

","I saw this movie for the first time two weeks ago, and it was the greatest I've seen in my life. You could believe, no, wait, you HAD to believe every word Norman said, until you find out his terrible secret, even if you'd seen it before, or known the truth (like I had). It was, however, a shame to know that the final shot of Norman probably sealed Anthony Perkins' fate of being type-cast as Norman Bates forever, he did that good of a job. Janet Leigh was also incredible, as were Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam. Even if they only had three lines, anyone in this flick made it what it is. The shower scene looked, and sounded, real. The thing that's so freaky about this movie is that it could happen to anyone, it's not about an impossible occurrence like other horror flicks."

","I love this film, and see no need for me to add to the HUGE number of opinions already posted here about it.  There are, however, a few minor things that might be of interest to some of you.  Several of the comments from other folks include references to various types of instrumentation in the music, such as tubas and other brass, etc.  In fact, the entire score is strings only - listen closely next time and you'll hear it!! Another great little overlooked detail is Saul Bass's main titles, converging and then flying off the screen.  Okay, here's a little continuity problem that no one else I've ever talked to has noticed (possible spoiler coming): when Marion skips Phoenix with the cash, she's driving her black 1956 Ford when Mr. Lowery sees her on the street.  Later, on the highway out of town, there is a point-of-view shot over the hood of the car - but the shot is of the hood of the white 1957 Ford which Marion does not acquire until later in the picture - oops!! I guess the editors figured no one would notice. By the way, that '57 Ford used to belong to Ward and June Cleaver before Marion bought it (the car was a Universal Studios property; ""Leave It To Beaver"" was filmed on the same lot as ""Psycho""). Anyway, enjoy the film (p.s. you do know that the blood in the shower scene is really chocolate syrup, don't you?)"
"horrorkid87","Null","10","19","18 November 2000"," The Best In Its Time
","This movie is the best movie by Alfred Hitchcock ever.  That is hard to do to.  Because he did all the good scary movies back then such as Rear Window and The Birds.  I loved it I own the movie and parts 2 and 3 I like the shower scene.  Another good thing about this movie was that it had a good back ground the motel off the main highway and the creepy old house on the hill behind the motel this was scary for its time but not now.  However it still is a real good movie a classic.  The remake was ok but it can't match to this one."
"Brian-272","9","10","19","4 November 2000"," A classic. Hitchcock's greatest film. Everything is perfectly done and the film has the most famous scene in movie history you know the scene ""The Shower Scene"".
","Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho has it all to start with romance, embezzlement, disappearance, secrets, voyeurism, a dead corpse, a split personality of a man who thinks from time to time he's his dead mother and of course death in the most famous scene of all time the scene of Janet Leigh getting stabbed to death in the shower. The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own. After 40 years and beyond we all still have the right to go a little mad."
"mrsweeneytodd","10","10","19","28 April 2000"," Hitchcock: True Cinematic Genius(spoilers)
","My mother always used to complain about this movie, it being the one suspense/horror film she actually went to.  The shower scene tormented her dreams for a long period of time.  I am very glad that she never actually gave me the details of the movie, as I was able to enjoy it without anything spoiled.  From the point of the unknowing 90's viewer, this movie still holds up superbly, and becomes even more amazing if enough Hitchcock documentaries are watched.  I find a couple of things are overlooked though. The greatest scene in my opinion is not the shower scene(although having the billed star die halfway through the film is incredible).  It is the conversation between in the hotel room with the stuffed birds in the background.  Subtle with so many distinct ironies and fantastic underplayed acting, mixed with the eerieness of that background creates maybe my second favorite scene in film(the first being the ending stairwell scene from Vertigo)  Perhaps what creeped me out the most was the visual of that lonely forgotten house atop the hill, definitely embued with some unknown prescence that the audience cannot quite put their finger on.  Like all stellar pieces of film or theater, there is a great deal of humor despite the premise of the work.  The most amazing part of this film is its implication on cinema as a whole - the disturbing material inspired countless psychological thrillers and changed film forever.  Although none will be able to match this movie for the sake of pure cinematic beauty, that's where the genius of Hitchcock comes into play.  He is probably the single greatest director of our time(sorry Kubrick), despite many nowadays not being able to enjoy what they consider ""dated"" films.  *Sigh*"

"bamamatman","10","10","19","29 December 1999"," A Classic in Every Sense of the Word
","To cinema lovers everywhere, Alfred Hitchcock was a god.  And while he may not have created the heavens and the earth, he did create something possibly more amazing: Psycho.  Hitchcock once said that he did not care about the acting so much as the technical elements of the film, but he pulled uniformly outstanding performances from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles.  But, as many other reviewers have noted, it was not the actors that made Psycho one of the pinnacles of cinema; it was Hitch himself.  His skillful use of lighting, effects, editing, and camera work have never been evidenced better than here.  Hitchcock's magic was that he could take such a horrific story and make it so beautiful that you the viewer are entranced by it, not able to wrest yourself away for any reason. Psycho is the only movie I've ever seen that grows scarier each time I watch.  The titles are a work of art in and of themselves, the photography is absolutely amazing, and Anthony Perkins's subtle, nuanced portrayal of Norman will almost have you rooting for him.  Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is truly a classic in every sense of the word, and in every sense of the film to which it can be applied."
"plato-11","10","10","19","28 December 1999"," This movie is the greatest!!!
","I love this movie! I've literally watched it hundreds of times, and every time I notice something new. Tony Perkins gives his best performance as Norman Bates. All of the other performers do a great job as well. This is my absolute favorite movie. It still has the ability to shock people today, which is a testament to its power. The shower scene is one of the most effective murder scenes I have seen, all without actually showing the knife penetrating the skin. That just goes to show that today's slasher movies are going about scaring people the wrong way.This is a movie that is impossible to become bored with, no matter how many times you have watched it. This is Alfred Hitchcock's best film."
"bkoganbing","9","6","10","18 October 2006"," Cleaning Up After Mom
","During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.<br/><br/>Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter, he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.<br/><br/>But for better or worse, Norman Bates became his career role and it's what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcock's direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.<br/><br/>Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them. <br/><br/>Simple enough, but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after you've seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leigh's legendary shower stabbing, but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.<br/><br/>Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things, the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.<br/><br/>It was repetitious for him, but a treat for fans."

The chilling music from Bernard Herrmann I can't forget. I love the scene in the shower, which was later in dozens horror films and the killing of detective Arbogast. I must see Psycho soon again. The sequel was also good, but the color was for me disturbing. Parts 3 and 4 was bad and the new version was very bad. Why make the same movie with bad actors? Vince Vaughn (as new Norman Bates) is better in the film Clay Pigeons. There he is also villain and I can this movie also recommend."

","I have watched this film about four times now, and I can safely say that this is the best horror movie ever. The actors are the best thing about it. Anthony Perkins is superb as the shy, gorgeous, boyish Norman Bates. His twitchings and stammerings are scarily flawless, and the scene where the car stops momentarily sinking into the swamp, and he stares with a look of pure terror in his eyes, then ultimate relief when it continues are unforgettable. His ""...I wouldn't even harm a fly"" face at the end is inimitable. As for Janet Leigh, she couldn't have gotten into her part more. She looks genuinely desperate when confronted by the police officer. Hitchcock controls the audience as if he were pressing keys on a piano with this film. Everything is perfect about this film, and has become one of my personal favourites. If you haven't seen it, see it now."

She decides to stay at a hotel, cleverly named The Bates Motel (Vacancy). Run by a timid, yet sweet man whose name is Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), now this man, is attracted to this woman, asked her for dinner, she declines. Now for the most famous scene in a horror film, she decides to take a shower, while he watches. He hears his mom calling him, so he goes up and sees what's wrong. While Marion Crane is taking a shower, the mother comes down and brutally stabs her to death. After all this, and people start to notice that she is gone, her sister and her boyfriend, decide to check out this motel. They hire an investigator to look into it. He finds nothing wrong with the place. What happens to him? Well you'll have to see the movie. Anyway, the sister and boyfriend, investigate and find out what Norman Bates really is. The film is extremely well-acted, not to mention directed by the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock.

","Psycho is a movie with an incredible twist-turned plot that throws the audience's perspective of the film way out of proportion. It is Hitchcock's best, without a doubt. His nervous and jittery Norman Bates is outstanding. If you can guess the ending of this timeless classic, you are considered a genius in my opinion. I have watched this movie a number of times and still find it enjoyable to watch again and again, I also learn something new about the film every time I view it. Look for the various mentions of birds in the film (i.e. Marion Crane, stuffed birds). It is not a scary movie, so don't expect to be terrified of showers or of hotels-maybe this wasn't the case in 1960 though when the movie came out.

The two movies that affected me most as a child were: ""The Amityville Horror"" (I've had more dreams about that house than any other thing..ever!) and ""Psycho"". After watching ""Psycho"", I never viewed ANYTHING as being 100% safe. No castles, no zombies, no monsters. Normal people in risky situations exposed before all. Everyone has skeletons in their closets. Even those who seem to be as harmless as a fly. (Such as Norman Bates). This movie not only changed the course of movie history, by killing off the apparent heroine 1/3 of the way through the film (making history) but, proved that their was absolutely NOWHERE to be totally safe. It revealed inner demons of the two main characters which reflect on the entire world and maybe the truest description of how the world really is. Deep down we all have these bad thoughts, but unlike Norman Bates, most of us can bottle them up inside and carry them to the grave.After all, ""we all go a little mad...sometimes""."

"Snow Leopard","Null","9","17","29 May 2001"," Thrilling & Masterful
","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is so well known for inducing suspense and terror that it is easy to overlook what a great achievement it is in many other respects.  It works so well as a thriller because everything fits together perfectly - the directing, acting, and music all help to turn a good story into a great movie.<br/><br/>The plot begins when ...  But anyone reading these comments has either (a) seen ""Psycho"" already, perhaps several times, and thus knows everything that happens, or (b) has not yet seen it, in which case the less you know about the plot, the more you will enjoy it when you do see it.  While this is a movie that you can thoroughly enjoy over and over, some of the surprises are especially good if you aren't sure what to expect.  So this comment will avoid any plot details at all.<br/><br/>Although ""Psycho"" is usually remembered as a shocker, there is actually very little violence, and it is not especially graphic.  Its effect is maximized by skillful build-up and by the atmosphere that Hitchcock so carefully created.  The pacing is masterful, slowly building up the tension and only releasing it when it will have the maximum effect - that is why it creates such a sensation.  The main settings - the Bates Motel and the Bates' old house - are perfectly designed to create an atmosphere full of possibilities.  (Hitchcock also made a terrific trailer in which he took the viewer on a tour of the house and motel.)  And it is not possible to say enough about the famous Bernard Herrmann score, which always fits the mood and action perfectly.  The exciting music makes even the opening credits fun to watch.<br/><br/>The fine cast is led by Anthony Perkins, who is simply outstanding in a very challenging role.  The movie would not have been quite the same without his underplayed but thoroughly memorable performance.  Janet Leigh is also particularly good as the kind of complex, mysterious woman that she excelled at portraying.<br/><br/>All this together makes for one of the greatest of all movies, and a genuine must-see for any fan of quality cinema."

","One of my favorites and I think Hitchcock's best film. Made relatively low-budget with his TV-show crew, this movie has haunted me for years and not because of the shower scene. Actually, the best scene is just prior to the shower scene and it's in the parlor with Norman and Marion. The only human connection moment in the film that doesn't show selfishness or ulterior motives. Quiet and full of info, as the camera looms over them, this scene is masterful in writing and acting. Perkins gave his best performance as the timid and lonely Mr. Bates who really is clueless. Janet Leigh is perfectly cast as the sexy, intelligent woman in over her head. The rest of the cast is top-notch and this film should have cleaned up at the Oscars in '60, but was considered too creepy for most folks.<br/><br/>A 10 out of 10. Best performance = Perkins. Brilliant editing and cinematography (b/w) with The Bates Motel a wonderful set. This film is highly undervalued and I don't consider it a horror film. Dashed illusions, loss of essence, and money-will-fix-it attitude while suspicions fly all over the place. Great stuff!"

","**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**<br/><br/>                              This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!<br/><br/>                              Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!<br/><br/>                              10 out of 10 OF COURSE!!!!!!!!"

It's a masterpiece of that era, not in the modern era sadly! Alfred Hitchcock in my opinion, is like Steven Spielberg of horror films because he started a trend and change in the genre!

","What a fantastic movie! A visual stunner with great camera work, superb acting, a wonderful script, and one of the greatest scores of all time. The term ""masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot today but in this instance the glove fits. Hitchcock pulled out all the stops for this one and made a horror movie that can still frighten an audience today. Anthony Perkins' performance is fascinatingly perfect as Norman Bates. The duality of his role must have been difficult to act with but he pulls it off beautifully.<br/><br/>The one qualm I have is a common one. The exposition scene towards the end where the psychologist practically spells out the movie for you as if the audience are idiots who haven't been paying attention at all. I guess at the time psychological thrillers were far less common and the 1960's audience needed an explanation as to why Norman would dress up like his mother, but today this scene sticks out like a sore thumb. Despite this, I still give this movie a 10/10 for an (almost) perfect hour and a half of cinema."
"MCandy14","10","3","4","13 November 2014"," My favourite film of all time!
","By far the greatest work of The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. When I watched this film for the first time aged 16, I was sucked in by the plot, the characters, Bernard Herrmann's score and the terrific acting. I went in knowing one thing about the movie, and that was that there is a shower scene. It was the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen and it was the first mystery/thriller I'd ever seen. Now I am a big fan of both Hitch and the genre.<br/><br/>The best aspect of this movie is the fantastic acting. What can you say that hasn't already been said about the performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates except that it's a tragedy he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His delivering of the script, his shyness and sudden twists is one of the best acting performances I've witnessed. But that doesn't take away from the rest of the cast. Janet Leigh is wonderful Marion Crane, and supporting talent from John Gavin, Martin Balsam and especially Vera Miles, make for a film you can watch over and over.<br/><br/>This is the first film I ever saw where afterwards, I wanted to know everything there was to know about it. I watched all the making of documentaries I could find, I wanted to watch all the sequels (Psycho II is also very good by the way) and I even chose the film as my specialist subject in a quiz we did in my college.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing write till the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen. You're engrossed by these characters and the plot that you don't want to miss a second.<br/><br/>Suspenseful, sophisticated, chilling, thrilling and an absolute masterpiece of film making."

","In a long line of great films, Psycho has got to be Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining. Despite being a horror movie, and having its fair share of genuinely frightening moments, Psycho has always struck me as being made to have a certain lighthearted charm. I have to imagine when Alfred Hitchcock made this film he was having fun and wanted the film to be as fun for us as it was for him. It's one of my favorite scary movies, but when I look back to it I don't think of it at all like I do the others on the list. This movie is just a good time.<br/><br/>If Psycho was a person, and its fun, creepy atmosphere was its skin, and Anthony Perkins was its face I guess, Its structure would be a crazy adamantite skeleton and its pacing? Well, synthetic cyborg muscles of course. For a horror film to maintain the feeling it needs to keep its viewers attention in the events leading up to the scares, it needs to have a solid setup for the plot that goes on long enough for it to not feel rushed but not so overlong that it becomes boring and takes away from the impact of the scary moments it's building up to. It needs to be interesting enough to not feel like a chore, but still understand its role as a vehicle for the frightening moments in the films. The story takes a back seat to the scary stuff in a horror movie. The good ones understand this, but the best of them do it in a way that doesn't compromise the quality of the story. Psycho is a shining example of a balanced and well executed horror film narrative. It's the king of this technique. the events leading up to Marion Crane's trip to the Bates motel work exceptionally well, and her encounters with the police officers at the dealership and on the road do an amazing job of establishing the spooky feel of the film in a seamless way and work to keep the viewer interested in what's to come. The ease with which Hitchcock leads into the events that take place at the motel are a huge part of what allows him to make the film such a good time.<br/><br/>You can't sing the praises of Psycho without applauding the incredible work Anthony Perkins does as the film's criminally insane leading man- the one and only Norman motherloving Bates. Perkins' ability to personify a person with such a severe case of dissociative identity disorder is so unbelievably good you'd think this guy went home at the end of the day and lived life as Norman Bates instead of himself. Not only does he have such an intrinsic ability to play the psycho, but he does such an impeccable job of committing Norman's crimes as well. When he sneaks up on the woman in the legendary and absolutely immortal shower scene, he does so like he was made to be a movie monster, and when he rushes in to attack the detective to the sound of Bernard Herrmann's screeching soundtrack he could scare a banana straight out of its goshdang peel. And bananas don't even have eyes or ears or even watch movies in the first place.<br/><br/>I love this film. it's a champion of horror. In a genre where so many films can only be fun by sacrificing the scares or just by being low budget bargain bin Netflix dumpster movies, Psycho triumphs in its ability to conquer everything important to entertain horror fans. Alfred Hitchcock's talent is so palpable in this film it may just as well turn itself into a big spoonful of Bates flavored gelato and fly its way right into the brain mouths of everyone watching. Gelato only has half the calories of regular ice cream, too. You ever try it? It's like ice cream pudding. It's great. Just like this film."

","Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.<br/><br/>To pigeonhole this as a thriller would be wrong as per me. It has a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, a huge amount of drama, and even a family backdrop. With all such elements, it would be wrong if I were to categorize this as merely a thriller. Yes, it is filled with thrills and for the 110 minutes of running time, there is hardly any dull moment.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie, a number of times before and each time it had a terrific impact. Also, I have always found something new, maybe a new frame, new shot or a new background sound. The discovery does not seem to stop. This I attribute to the many elements that are involved in this film.<br/><br/>From placing the camera, composing the shot, revealing the right emotion and making the audiences wait till the shocking aspect is revealed, Hitchcock is at his best in this film. This is indeed one of the more simpler stories he dealt. Yet, he made it so impact full that it continues to surprise audiences even today. Thanks to the music by Bernard Hermann, whose contribution to the film is very important. I cannot imagine this film without the music and I believe that it's because of the music, that the resonance was acquired.<br/><br/>If it's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impact full. Now, I do not want to reveal those and give away some details. I can simply say, I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else. <br/><br/>The cast is perfect equally, Anthony Perkins does a wonderful job as Norman Bates. He is cold blooded and yet looks so deceptively humane as an extremely caring human. This film and ""The Trial"" are perhaps the most important films in his career. <br/><br/>It is the first psychological thriller of it's kind as I read in various other sites and perhaps it is also the most violent films made. Though the violence comes for less than 10 minutes, it haunts so brutally, as if it was there all through the film. <br/><br/>It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest films of all time by one of the greatest directors.<br/><br/>http://braddugg.blogspot.in/"

At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is aided by some excellent performances. Anthony Perkins is calculating menace personified as Norman Bates.

","Another favorite. I'm pretty sure this film is to blame for my early and unending love of thrillers and horror films (only the good ones though). As usual, the photography is my favorite part, as well as the editing, since both aid each other extremely well. I'm not even going to touch the shower scene, that's been analyzed to death (but I do love it). My favorite part of the photography is when she's asleep in the car, and the cop comes and talks to her through the window. The close ups in that scene are amazing. A+ acting too, perfect amount of tension. I also like when she's driving and all the bright lights are blinding her from the other side of the road. I'm so pleased they decided to film this is b&w.<br/><br/>There are a couple other things I'd like to mention too. First, this film totally flaunts the code, right from the opening scene. I normally wouldn't have noticed it as a casual viewer but bearing in mind film history, this is the beginning of the end of the code (finally!). Second, the score is absolutely brilliant. About 90% of my music collection is film scores and I've been a fan of Bernard Herrmann since realizing he did a great number of soundtracks for Hitchcock films (North by Northwest is great, and some non Hitchcock films like Mysterious Island are good too). But wow, the Psycho score is really quite amazing. It's so unobtrusive yet brilliantly sets the mood. And I'm not talking about the screeching strings, even though they're the most famous."

"Red-Barracuda","10","3","4","28 March 2014"," Psycho changed everything
","You would have to say that Psycho was the start of something new. Alfred Hitchcock was at the height of his powers before he made it and it was only because of his standing that it was made at all. The studio was appalled by the idea of the film and released it very grudgingly and with the minimal of assistance. Hitchcock had to use much of his own personal wealth to fund it and released it in black and white, with a far lower budget than he was used to. Despite all this, when Psycho was released it changed everything.<br/><br/>Released in 1960, it heralded the arrival of the 60's in more ways than simply date. It's extremely daring content was an early marker that indicated the coming changes in cinema. Sometimes people think that Hollywood truly changed in the late 60's with the release of Bonnie and Clyde. While it's impossible to argue against that film's influence, it can easily be argued that Psycho was even more ground-breaking and a full seven years older. Taking into account the cinema landscape of the time it was released, it's quite a wild uncompromising concoction that Hitchcock brought to the screen.<br/><br/>There are several boundaries it pushed against. It opens with a scene of an unmarried couple – the woman partially undressed - in a hotel room just after sex. This was taboo at the time. Furthermore, the girl is introduced as the nominal heroine, even having her character's name displayed on the film poster. Yet she is brutally murdered less than half-way in. The disorientating nature of this is almost as shocking as the act of violence itself. Cinema audiences are just not prepared for a main character being disposed of like this. It throws us, confuses us and makes us realise we have no idea what is going to happen next. It's an utterly audacious move to do this and, incredibly, one that really has hardly been used since in the intervening fifty plus years. Hollywood still seems reticent in killing off its A-Listers in this way but Hitchcock was unafraid in subverting this 'rule' and the impact of Psycho is profoundly more effective as a result. Then there is the violence. The expertly filmed shower scene remains one of the ultimate shock moments in cinema and with some justification. For its time, it's incredibly brutal and it's here that Psycho pushed boundaries in the most direct and obvious way. In fact, Hitchcock partially decided on black and white, as he knew this scene would never get past the censors in colour. Now people died with their eyes open. Marion Crane stares at us dead on in a way that allows us little respite. And finally, there is the open depiction of sexually deviant behaviour. Normal Bates disturbing secret life is very psychologically dark, yet he is presented quite sympathetically. The direct presentation of these dark impulses was again quite unfamiliar to audiences of the time.<br/><br/>The story has Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a secretary from Phoenix, Arizona, stealing $40,000 from her employer's client. After a couple of days on the run she ends up at a motel run by a nervous young man called Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). The structure of the narrative initially suggests that this will be a crime story of a woman on the run with a bag of money. But we have been cleverly misdirected and the seemingly standard thriller suddenly and jarringly changes into something altogether more sinister. Really, Psycho was a watershed movie in that it brought the horror genre into a recognisably real world. Beforehand, the genre always had the distance of either the supernatural or science fiction. Psycho stripped away this protective layer and in doing so made the horror more real and more terrifying. Amazingly, it has retained the palpable tension even today. This has ensured that it still feels quite modern and hasn't really aged at all. But it would be misguided to not acknowledge the black humour that is interspersed throughout and that only becomes apparent on re-watches. This is a result of a clever script but also excellent performances. The real stand-out dramatic scene being the late night supper between Crane and Bates, where there is such an uneasy and strange chemistry. Leigh and Perkins make this work so well; the latter is particularly brilliant in this film. So good it would unfortunately type-cast him forever.<br/><br/>There are other collaborators too who need to be acknowledged too. Firstly, there is Saul Bass who is the legendary credit sequence guy. His work here is pretty simple and straightforward but striking nevertheless. And then there is, of course, Bernard Herrman whose score is one of the greatest in cinema history. Everyone knows the famous screeching that accompanies the murders – rightfully so because it's genius – but the melodic main theme is quite beautiful and truly evocative. But in the final analysis the bulk of the praise has to go to Alfred Hitchcock, as this incredibly provocative work of cinema art would never have been made without him and I think it stands as his greatest achievement."

","Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40k from work, and runs away. In a stormy night, she stops at the isolated Bates Motel where she meets creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).<br/><br/>This one has Alfred Hitchcock as the master salesman. It's the biggest show in show business, and he's the master of ceremony. He pulls out all the stops like the secrecy and the refusal of entry to late arrivals. It helps to have the most iconic movie scene of all times.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh isn't just a damsel in distress or a shrinking violet. She is a woman with a dark side. The fact that she's an A-list star used to mean that she'll last until the end of the movie. When the super creepy Anthony Perkins joins her, it was set up for a prolong creepfest. Then comes the most well made important scene in history. The second half does have a little struggle to reclimb that peak, and I didn't like all the pontificating at the end. But those are tiny problems in a great movie."
"dougdoepke","Null","3","4","2 September 2013"," A Key Scene in Depth
","In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation.<br/><br/>Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. <br/><br/>From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. <br/><br/>At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escape—how we ""scratch and claw"" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. <br/><br/>At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like ""in an institution or something"". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's ""harmless"". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go ""a little mad sometimes"". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable façade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one.<br/><br/>This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. <br/><br/>Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face.<br/><br/>To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated."

","Hereabouts there be spoilers.<br/><br/>I don't usually bother with warnings that some reveals will be revealed because so few films actually HAVE twists in them that are in any way shocking. Many mysteries, possibly most, have surprises waiting at the end but they rarely leave you dumbfounded. ""The Crying Game"" is one of the exceptions, however, and ""Psycho"" is the mother of them all.<br/><br/>There isn't much point in going through the plot again, so I'll just note a few impressions that have lasted over many viewings.<br/><br/>One is that there are a couple of usually ignored people in the crew that deserve medals. One is the production designer, who is responsible for the overall look of the picture. His work could hardly be improved upon, from the oppressively bleak landscape surrounding Janet Leigh's car when the CHP officer wakes her up, to the haunted mansion on top of the slight hill, surrounded by gardens of weeds.<br/><br/>The other neglected contributor is the set dresser. Of course the director, the punctilious Hitchcock, decides questions of props and camera placement, but -- that soulless and bourgeois real estate office with its potted plants and its large picture of a sere landscape that perches over Janet Leigh's desk; the stuffed birds suggestive of Poe (a raven) or a menacing nocturnal predator (an owl), and the pictures of birds, juxtaposed with pictures of roly poly naked nymphs, some in the act of being violated. In Bloch's novel and in the film, the untitled book that Vera Miles examines in Perkins' little-boy bedroom is filled with pornography but it couldn't be shown on screen.<br/><br/>The murder in the shower doesn't need to be described but I've never been able to watch this without a sinking feeling that Janet Leigh really doesn't NEED that shower at this particular point in time and space. Leigh is a fine actress. When she's driving away from Phoenix and the camera is on her face, minuscule expressions come and go across her features, reflecting the conversations she's fantasizing about. There's even a hint of a wry smile when she imagines the outrage of Cassady, the fat and self-satisfied millionaire, when he discovers that Leigh has absconded with the money he flaunted, as in -- ""Take that, you bastard."" There's something aptly birdlike about Janet Leigh too. She's narrow shouldered and long legged, a little stork-like, as well as being just the right age. She has the desperation of a woman facing forty. Of course to a man who's spent the last ten years alone with a corpse, Leigh is an object of Paphian interest. She's old but not too old yet, just as she's a star but not too big a star to torpedo the movie when she is eliminated from it.<br/><br/>Two shots stand out from a multitude of originals. (1) When Balsam finds Leigh's fake signature in the motel's register, the camera is looking up at Tony Perkins, who is nibbling some candy. Balsam says, ""Oh, yes. Here she is,"" and invites Perkins to examine the fake. The camera doesn't cut away but remains on Perkins' jaw as he leans over the unseen book and we watch his jaw and adam's apple working nervously away. (2) Perkins decides to move Mama from her bedroom to the fruit cellar. The camera follows him very slowly as he climbs the stairs and enters her room, but inside of going through the door, the camera rises about the transom and pivots around, an extraordinary movement, so that when Perkins exits lugging mother in his arms, we are too flabbergasted by what the camera has done to notice any discrepancy between the reality Norman has constructed for us and any reality that most of the rest of us might recognize.<br/><br/>(3) Just to be wanton, I'll throw in that shot of Janet Leigh's dead eye. The camera first follows a pale stream of blood down INTO the bathtub drain, then dissolves to Leigh's staring iris, then draws back along the floor while deliberately righting itself from a slight tilt to the proper vertical. (Check out the remake. The camera apes the original shot but practically twirls on its axis.) Two weakness or, let's say, things I wish Hitchcock would have done a little differently. One is that car gurgling and sinking into that accommodating swamp. You only find those swamps in the movies and Louisiana. The second is that experimental scene in which Martin Balsam tumbles backward down a rear-projected staircase. The director was more proud of the mechanical difficulties behind that shot than he had a right to be.<br/><br/>You know what occurs to me sometimes, when I'm watching this, or when I'm watching some of the garbage that now fills our screens? I wish that the people writing and directing movies like ""Saw II"" would rescreen ""Psycho"" so they could get some hint about how to make a truly horrifying movie with practically no blood, no monsters with chain saws and no teen agers screaming and running round in panties. Man, have we lost our grip, or what? And while we're at it let's have no more girls named Jillian or Megan, either. I'm tired of them. Bring back the old days when movies had little blood and girls had sensible names like Mary and Hepzibah. Oh -- and let's get rid of that hand-held electronic junk too. No more iPods or Pseudopods or whatever they are. No Blackberries or Strawberries either. Whatever happened to whitewall tires?"

","50 years ago, Alfred Hitchcock released Psycho. Girl is having an affair with this guy, she runs away with $40,000 that she was supposed to bank for her employer. On the road heading for California to be with her lover, scared, guilt ridden and exhausted, she pulls into the secluded Bates Motel for a night of rest. There she meets the affable Norman Bates, girl takes shower and cinema got a jolt to the system.<br/><br/>What can you say about Psycho that hasn't been said before? Well nothing in truth, it's been dissected and discussed by all and sundry since its release in 1960. From critics to film makers and from the man in the street to the King Of Siam (probably), Psycho is known and largely admired by most in this day and age. However, the initial reaction to it on release was mixed, the words ""gimmick movie"" were even used in some quarters, while in others it was labelled as a stain on the great director's career. Made for roughly around $800,000 in just 30 days, and using his basic crew from his TV show, Hitchcock adapts the Robert Bloch pulp novel with cold hearted glee. Manipulating the audience as he lays out his American Nightmare, Hitch deals in fluid camera movements, jolting shock tactics, the ""mother"" of all twists and garners two incredible performances from Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the process. Not only that but he's also got Saul Bass helping on the visuals and Bernard Herrmann providing a terrifying stab string score that has long since gone down in the annals of greatness.<br/><br/>The proof is in the pudding, that the film is still today, 50 years on, regarded as belonging to the upper echelons of classic cinema, is its lasting legacy. An original and genre bending piece of genius film making from a master of his craft. If you haven't seen it then you should do so at your earliest opportunity, and one can only hope that the surprises the film has in store have by some miracle not been spoiled for you thus far. 10/10"

","I've heard so much about this film before I watch it. Luckily i didn't know the ending of this film, if not, things would be so different. I think this is one of Hitchcock's best movies. If you've seen the film, you'll know that this kind of plot could easily turn out to be banal. This revealed the splendid skills of Hitchcock in handling such kind of movies. Apart from this, i must say that Anthony Perkins did very well. He was made for the role of Norman Bates. This is my favourite film of all times. Everyone who hasn't seen it yet, better watch it NOW."

","The hardest movies to review are the accepted classics. What can be said that hasn't already been said? And how can I write a glowing review that offers up genuine love and appreciation for the film, and not just regurgitate some propaganda that Psycho is the greatest slasher ever made? Well, here goes nothing . . .<br/><br/>From imitation and its popularity among film scholars and horror buffs, Psycho has no more surprises left  that's a given. However, Sir Alfred Hitchcock foresaw this problem and infused Psycho (as well as his other pictures) with the more effective element: suspense. We know where, why, and when the murders take place. So what? The key to Hitchcock's famous bomb analogy is that suspense comes from the audience's knowledge of the bomb, not a lack of knowledge. We know, but the characters do not. That's suspense.<br/><br/>I watched Psycho again just recently, and felt an unprecedented excitement as those famous Bernard Herrmann strings began playing and Saul Bass' credits filled the screen. I was watching one of my favorite movies again, and I couldn't wait to dive into the film, itself. I couldn't wait for that opening shot of Phoenix  I looked forward to seeing that look of horror on Marion Crane's face as her bosses crosses the street in front of her car while she's escaping to Fairvale. I wanted to see Anthony Perkins to appear on screen with his brilliantly subdued performance of Norman Bates, and I leaned closer to the screen and smiled when he says, ""We all go a little crazy sometimes."" <br/><br/>Needless to say, I love this movie.<br/><br/>What amazes me about Psycho, and I didn't consciously realize this until reading the Truffaut book ""Hitchcock"", is how the film manages to smoothly switch protagonists midway through the film (from Marion to Norman). As Hitchcock and Truffaut talk in the book, when the car is pushed into the swamp and it stops  the audience's heart stops. We want the car to sink, and we want Norman to succeed. More amazingly is how even after knowing all the revelations the film has to offer  the truth about Norman Bates and his mother  we still want that car to sink. We still sympathize with Norman Bates in that moment.<br/><br/>That, in my opinion, is what truly separates Hitchcock's Psycho from the pack. Sir Alfred actually made us care about his killer. I can't think of any other slasher film that attempts this and succeeds. Most slashers are content to have a killing machine under a mask, but only Hitchcock has the balls to show us the face of his killer. Only Hitchcock would dare to make his killer a full-fledged characters with intelligent thoughts and complex emotions, and only Hitchcock was good enough to pull it off.<br/><br/>As if that's not enough, in the final act Hitch plays the audience like an organ and switches our sympathies once again (from Norman to Lila)  and all the while, the audience never really consciously recognizes that their loyalties fly from character to character on a whim. We want Marion to succeed because the man she's stealing from is a prick, we want Norman to succeed because of the love for his mother and his humanness in reacting to the murder, and we want Lila to succeed because we want to know the truth behind Norman Bates' mother.<br/><br/>One of my favorite moments in all of cinema occurs in Psycho. Watch the film while Sam Loomis is searching and calling out for Detective Arbogast at the Bates' motel. Then Hitch cuts to a slow fluid push in on Anthony Perkins at the swamp, and Perkins looks up at the camera with a mixture of emotions in his eyes. It's one of the simplest camera movements in the film. Perkins doesn't say a word - he just quietly looks on. Yet it's one of the most effective shots in the entire film. A simple movement and silent look is all Hitchcock needs.<br/><br/>When the marketing gimmicks have all been forgotten, when all the surprises are known, and when imitators have sucked away and blatantly stolen whatever they can get to work for 45 years, Psycho still stands as solid as ever. It did not need the shock of killing its star, nor did it need the shocking revelation at the end, it didn't need the gimmick that ""audiences won't be admitted after the start of the picture."" Psycho works just as well without them because Hitchcock delivered great characters played by competent actors, and he let the audience know there's a bomb waiting to go off that none of those characters know about."
"Neve_Fan","10","4","6","11 August 1998"," Greatest horror movie of all time!
","Psycho is just unbelievable!  The dialogue, the camera work, the suspense, the music!  Everything!  Just seeing how disturbed Norman Bates is, is a very creepy thing.  Hitchcock filmed this without one imperfection.  He used a lot of mirrors in Psycho, and I personally think the scariest scene in the entire movie is where Marion's sister goes up to ""Mrs. Bates"" room, and she thinks she sees someone behind her, and turns around, but its just herself in the mirror.  Another very interesting thing about Psycho was all the bird references.  Marion's last name is ""Crane"" Norman even says to her ""You eat like a bird"" and Norman's office is filled with stuffed birds.  Psycho's shower scene is by far the most suspenseful moment in the history of film.  I think so anyway!  To finish this up, I'd just like to say that Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a classic, and no one should be remaking it!!! !!"

","A young lady, Marion,who decides to take $40,000 just received from a rich client goes on the run ending up taking refuge at a remote lonely motel and its creepy owner Norman Bates. Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, wonderfully played and delivers a fine performing main iconic role. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is very seemingly charismatic on first impressions. Yet is very troubled and eccentric. Sneaky and sideways glancing. With his strange hobby of stuffing birds. All the characters are extremely detailed. The film has so many clever aspects. Atmospheric, orchestral, suspense, the music alone provides all of these essential key areas as well as the visual side. Then there's the mysterious, nagging, possessive mother of Bates who you don't see who dominates him. Strange how bird references come up in this, Hitchcock's fascination. Loved his cameo near the start. The shower scene comprises of utter genius in how it is shot. A stabbing, thrusting, shadowy figure relentlessly going crazy with a deadly blade. Marion's outstretched hand leaving a shocking farewell to her life cruelly ripped away. A close up of her eye, the final montage. Again it's extremely clever how the whole shower scene leaves a bitter taste yet never shows us anything in the regions of graphic violence. Leaves the audience, the viewer's mind to fill in the blanks. A shocker twist regarding the killer and a final revelation at it's peak. An intelligent film from the old master Alfred Hitchcock. Best thriller ever done."
"gus81","10","7","13","6 March 2005"," If there is one single film that can claim to be THE best of all time, then this is it....
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*, if there can be in a film as famous as this....<br/><br/>Psycho probably has the most famous (and/or infamous) scene in the history of movies - the shower scene. The shower is in the Bates motel, run by Norman Bates, and his 'mother'. Even today, if someone looks freaky, many still say he looks like Norman Bates. If someone has a clingy or naggy mother, many a Norman Bates allusion is referred to. Psycho has become etched into modern culture and become a household name. Why?...because the film was a milestone, not just of gore, but of cinematic effect and technique. Psycho is, all at the same time, taut, mesmerising and terrifying. It is a textbook example of how to captivate an audience, and then shock them right at the very end.<br/><br/>The film starts by introducing a love-lorn and frustrated heroine, complete with a dead-end job, and a relationship that needs a jump start. The audience is introduced to her and her troubles; we follow her, and feel for her - then she is murdered right in front of us. The array of characters introduced in the first half of the film - the arrogant 'Texan' guy who flashes forty thousand dollars, the bumbling boss, the suspicious highway cop, the dumbfounded used-car salesman - all amount to nothing. This pioneering change in plot has the same effect as a tree which you collide with after pulling up the handbrake on a speeding car.<br/><br/>Then enter Milton Arbogast, the private detective who begins the search for our slain heroin Marion Crane. He investigates the Bates Motel and finds something amiss. He reports the news to the worried boyfriend and sister of Ms Crane - they all develop some trust and repartee. Then he's dead. Then enter the local town cop who doesn't believe the boyfriend's and the sister's suspicions, while all the time the audience knows what really happened and why people are dying at the hands of an 'evil old lady' who the disturbed Norman Bates is desperate to protect.<br/><br/>The whole film was a totally new way of writing a plot, and of manipulating a storyline. The supposed lead character is killed early on, a replacement protagonist suffers the same fate; and all the audience are then left with are the utterly desperate and confused Lila Crane (sister) and Sam Loomis (boyfriend), who have only their suspicions and fear to drive them toward finding the truth. The audience feels for them, because we know that Norman's mother murdered Marion Crane.....or at least we think we do.<br/><br/>Psycho only runs for around an hour and a half. It is the tautest thriller I've ever seen. Not one scene is wasted on being filler. Each scene is purposeful, powerful, and extremely economical. The pace is cracking when it needs to be, and slow and hypnotic when emotion and fear need to be emphasised; note the long scene as Norman Bates cleans up the murder scene - this allows the horror of what just happen sink in.<br/><br/>The script is rattling, with some flourishing dialogue that even overshadows some wooden acting from John Gavin. The cinematography is brilliant, with great use of lighting and shadows. And, of course, the directing is just simply cutting edge, even for today. Anthony Perkins does a perfectly chilling job as the psychotic Norman Bates, and Martin Balsam is a completely natural private eye. And famously, to complement these ground-breaking plot twists, are the chilling and perfectly executed murder scenes.<br/><br/>And finally, the chilling revelation of what really happened at the Bates Motel is kept right until the blood-curdling end, and is realised through a ear-splitting scream, a rotting skull, and a naked swinging lightbulb; a scene which leaves the audience shocked, terrified and thrilled after such a roller-coaster of a movie. For those few people to whom the 'spoliers' warning at the start of this piece applies, go and rent this film. It is simply a must for everyone. It is a defining moment of modern popular culture, and as such if there ever was a convincing candidate for the greatest movie ever made title, well then this is it."

"Barry-44","10","7","13","19 February 1999"," You Can't Just Watch It Once !
","Psycho is the kind of movie that entices you to watch it over and over.  It demands you study the camera angles, facial expressions, background of the scenes, clothes, paintings on the walls, etc.  Simply put:  the movie is a masterpiece.  I get so wrapped up into the movie that I forget that it's forty years later and the actors/actresses in this flick are now all old, or dead.  Anthony Perkins, the man who plays the mysterious Norman Bates who struggles with the love of his mother, died in the 1990s.  Anthony Perkins shows the talent of an actor that is second to none.  His performance is brilliant.<br/><br/>Vera Miles reminds me of the nosey best-friend that each one of us has. She's not a totally lovable person but her character shows that deep down, she is a caring person.  She has more guts than me when she goes to the house to visit Norman's mother.<br/><br/>John Gavin's role would be the role that most of the men watching the movie could relate to the most.  He appears as a clean-cut man who just so happens is having an affair.  He plays the character of Sam. John Gavin, the actor, is complicated, however.  You will understand when you watch the movie.  He really doesn't speak a lot but his body language is excellent.  I would love to know more about Mr. John Gavin but there's very little information about him on the internet.<br/><br/>Patricia Hitchcock is the director's daughter.  She plays the role of an office worker.  Her acting is totally believable and I found myself watching the scene in which she appears over and over.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's famous movie Psycho is my favorite-all-time movie and every time I watch it, I see something else in a scene that I did not see before.<br/><br/>Lastly, Janet Leigh plays the woman who checks into Bates' Motel  and it's a visit which the viewer will never forget.<br/><br/>I love this movie so much that I wish it were possible for me to shake the hand of every actor and actress who starred in this classic tale.  Once you see the movie I think you will agree.<br/><br/>The camera men deserves a special pat on the back for their fine work."

I would certainly see it on the silver screen, perhaps along with countless other ""PSYCHO"" fans across the WORLD.

This film invented shots that are used today and some that lesser-skilled directors just don't know how to use.

"Semih","9","6","11","6 June 2000"," Owes much of its quality to Bernard Herrmann's score.
","Ofcourse Hitchcock is a great director. But try watching this movie without Bernard Herrmann's score and it will lose almost everything about it. Hitchcock wanted to shoot the shower sequence (most memorable but over-exagerated scene) without any music. Big mistake. Mr. Herrmann thought so too. And now it has become a masterpiece. Talking about the shower scene being over rated; my favorite scene in the film is where the lady is driving at night and it starts raining and she turns on the wipers and she keeps looking at the rear view mirror and then she finally ends up at the motel. That whole sequence is brilliant film making that owes much of its brilliance to Herrmann's score. You feel her anxiety because of her feeling of guilt for what she has done, and we as an audience have a feeling that there isn't something that pleasing awaiting her at the end of the road. How do we know that? Pay attention to how the fast pace of the string ensemble comes to an abrupt change with pizzicatos and low resonance bows, once we see the sign of the motel. And notice how the cue leads up to that part; pure genius at work here, ladies and gentleman. If it weren't for Herrmann's musical score, this film would be just an average movie."

The direction is extremely original and credible and the adapted script is one of the most interesting, in that the main character within the movie fluctuates. I think this is a very interesting and clever idea which makes ""the shower scene"" more shocking. The music is also infinitely effective in creating atmosphere within the film. If you haven't seen this movie try not to find out too much about it - although I guess it's inevitable because it's a genuine classic.

The direction is amazing (and very much ahead of its time), Bernard Herman's score is possibly the best piece of music written for a motion picture, a true work of art(and it's a pity there is not a soundtrack album out) and of course Perkins' performance is totally out of this world. And forget about the famous (and too much copied) shower scene, or the detective's murder; the most horrifying scene is the one at the end where Norman Bates sits alone, thinking  his mother's  thoughts, and then gives to the camera THAT look- it has me scared sh**less every time I see it.

","Lock your bathroom doors when you take a shower. This chilling horror classic by the master of horror, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, is probably his finest film. The cast is stellar featuring the unforgettable Janet Leigh in her Oscar nominated role as Marion Crane who steals 40 thousand dollars and takes to the road. She ends up at the Bates Motel operated by Norman Bates played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins. The rest of the cast is first rate like the wonderful Vera Miles as Lila Crane, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam as the private investigator. I believe the actor who Sam, Marion's cash-strapped lover, is also quite good in the role. Frank Albertson and Lurene Tuttle and Pat Hitchcock also round out a supporting cast. I won't spoil the plot but the classic should not be tampered with as it is simply one of the best thrillers ever made."
"RobertF87","10","5","9","16 January 2005"," Among the Most Influential Films of All Time
","This film has to rank as probably one of the most influential films ever made. It's one of those films that is referenced constantly. By the way, this is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the more powerful it is. In fact in the original advertising, Hitchcock asked viewers not to reveal the film's shocks to their friends afterwards, and also that viewers had to be seated from the beginning of the film (when ""Psycho"" was released people were in the habit of walking into movies at any point). As a result, i will try my best not to give too much away.<br/><br/>Based on a fairly good thriller by Robert Bloch, inspired by the life and crimes of real-life serial killer Ed Gein, this movie constantly unsettles the viewer. Hitchcock knew about suspense and he knew how to manipulate an audience which he does here brilliantly. Almost everything in this film is pitch perfect and the shocks are still striking. The actors, especially the brilliant Anthony Perkins, are all superb. Special note has to be taken of the famous score by Bernard Herrmann.<br/><br/>Whether or not you're a horror movie fan, this is a must-see."

","Psycho is more than just one of the best films of all-time. It is the inspiration behind a great number of films since and will forever be THE ultimate in both plot twists and suspense. Who would have ever imagined killing off both the main character and what seemed like an interesting story only a third into the film? Well, Hitch did and even told the moviegoers at the time to show up for the beginning of the film or else miss the wonderful Janet Leigh.<br/><br/>Psycho has it all. A great story, well two as a matter of fact. One of the greatest scores by Bernard Herrmann (how many people don't know the skreetching violin and deep tuba sounds that really make the shower scene a classic?). The acting is superb with the chilling, almost-too-real portrayal of Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins and the running scared, almost-too-clued-out portrayal of Marion Crane by Janet Leigh. The supporting cast complete the film like few other casts do. Vera Miles makes the role of Crane's sister, honestly real and more than just a plot device.<br/><br/>This film succeeds in all aspects, including the ending which is often said to be overlong and unecessary. Without hearing the inner thoughts of Bates, however, would leave a gaping hole in the production. The double image of Bates face with his mother's scull remains chilling, even in today's glorified, Natural Born Killers-like ultraviolence. Hitch's direction and shot techniques are as innovative as those seen in some of his earlier films like Vertigo and North-by-Northwest. Next time you watch Psycho, slow down the shower scene just to see how many separate shots Hitch put together to make it so great. Quite calculated.<br/><br/>It's a shame that a film like Psycho had to have been marred by a few sequels and a terribly awful shot-by-shot remake. Unlike a continuing storyline like that of ""The Godfather"", this story should have ended here.<br/><br/>Full recommendation.<br/><br/>9/10 stars."

","Anything i would say has already been said but still it's worth crediting this masterpiece again. What else would you want with a movie great direction, superb acting,great set,great story With one of the best acting performances of our time Anthony Perkins created something that other actors have never been able to accomplish that is successfully he made someone you'd never suspect. Sure you might have thought him to be the one when you first saw it but he crafted a man whose emotions you would think would definitely help his mother but wouldn't join with her Hitchcock who is also the best director of all time sends a never again greatly crafted 100 K Diamond to the screen with a magnificiant  SHING!!! of the blade"

","What more can be said about ""PSYCHO"",Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic that spawned an entire genre...the slasher film. To prove that this masterpiece truly stands the test of time,I recommended it to two of the 7th grade students that I teach (who have been subjected to the whole ""Halloween-Friday The 13th-Nightmare On Elm Street-Scream"" recycling bin)...and they loved it! The black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous,and the legendary musical score by Bernard Herrmann has never been matched (with John Carpenter's creepy ""Halloween"" score as a worthy runner-up). The 1998 remake is a pointless,cheap,waste of time (as it wastes the enormous,combined talents of Vince Vaughn,Anne Heche,Julianne Moore,William H.Macy,Philip Baker Hall and Robert Forster). As a movie buff and horror film addict,I cannot recommend ""PSYCHO"" enough...it is the definitive slasher film,and in my opinion,the best horror film ever! I'm not going to waste any time summarizing the now-familiar plot. Let's just say that no one twitched like the late,great Anthony Perkins,and the only actress to match Janet Leigh's shower scream is her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis of ""Halloween"" fame. **** A+ (10/10)"
"e-jane","8","5","9","26 December 1998"," Horror classic that lives up to its reputation.
","The best way to approach Psycho would be with no previous knowledge at all. As it is, the shower scene has become one of the most notorious film shots of all-time, and the secret of the Bates family is no longer quite so secretive.<br/><br/>However, even with this in mind, this is an amazing classic : the original horror movie.  Hitchcock has always been the master of suspense, and Psycho is just about his most sinister ever.  From the Gothic setting - the imposing mansion on the hill - to Norman's boyish manner and tortured intensity, Psycho delivers.<br/><br/>And if it doesn't make you scream (or at least think twice before talking to that self-effacing stranger), nothing will.  Psycho truly is an incomparable portrait of a mind twisted into homicidal mania that fully deserves the accolades it has always received."

","This movie is fabulous. Sadly, I haven't seen much of Hitchcock's other works (aside from the reruns on Nick-At-Nite.) so I cannot really compare.<br/><br/>The directing, acting, and everything else is fabulous. Hitchcock uses some of the best camera angles ever in filming this. The shower scene was filmed perfect and was very scary.<br/><br/>The end of it when ""Mother"" is discovered is so scary. You will never forget the end of it.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins is truly scary. He has a feel to him that is just frightening.<br/><br/>The re-make is good but this is a classic.<br/><br/>The novel and re-make may be very good, but this classic surpasses them all."
"Bill-247","Null","5","9","13 December 1998"," One of Hitchcock's best films...a masterpiece!!! score: 9 (out of 10)
","No one on Earth has captured the art of ""horror"" or ""suspense"" on film better than Alfred Hitchcock.  His three best films that come to my mind are ""Vertigo"" (1958), ""North by Northwest"" (1959) and this one...his all-time greatest masterpiece, although some people think ""Lifeboat"" (1944) is his finest film to date.  I can remember when I first saw this film...my friend's mother refused to let her son watch such a stupid, slasher film.  I laughed.  This is not a typical ""slasher"" film, but a story about embezzlement, greed, adultery, and murder...all of the ingredients that make up a Hitchcock movie. The ""Friday the 13th"" movies are what make up a typical ""slasher"" movie simply because there is no plot other than the constant ""slashing"" of people.  This Hitchcock movie has a plot, of which I am not going to go into a lot of detail.  After devising a scheme to embezzle her boss out of a chunk of money, Marion Crane winds up fleeing town, and her job, for her lover (John Gavin).  During a terrible rain storm, she finds vacancy in the Bates Motel, which is run by the shy and innocent Norman Bates.  What I found so interesting about this movie is the pace, the tone, the timing, the music, the house where Norman lives, and the confines of a simple motel room, and of course, the shower...all of which lead to murder and mayhem in a stylish, provocative manner.  Roger Ebert's review of the movie is correct...at the end...the shrink's description of Norman is dull and overblown.  If Hitch could have tightened that scene up just a bit...the film could have been totally flawless."

Anthony Perkins did an incredible performance as Norman Bates, may god have mercy on Vince Vaughn's soul.  This has definitely persuaded me to go rent the rest of Hitchcock's movies.  I'm not old- 14 years old to be exact- but I know quality filmmaking when I see it. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie, you don't know what you're missing.  I sure didn't."

","PSYCHO (1960)-- Grade: A+<br/><br/>WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>It's amazing how some films are kind of icons not only for a decade, but forever. If you don't go to the movies just for fun, answer me: what is the first name that comes to your mind when someone talks about suspense/mystery films? FRIDAY THE 13TH? No. SCREAM? No. Wes Craven? No. John Carpenter? No. Brian De Palma? No. Of course the answer would be ""Alfred Hitchcock"", if you really like cinema. Hitch is an unanimity today among film critics even more than 20 years after his death, something that never happened even with Kubrick and Buñuel, for example. Not every film of his is a masterpiece, but at least one is an unquestionable classic, an icon when you think about suspense films: PSYCHO. It was released in 1960, shocking audiences and slowly becoming a classic. Considered by the American Film Institute the 18th best film ever and being one of the most well-known pictures of the American cinema, it was obviously ripped-off lots of times, even remade by Gus Van Sant in 1998 scene by scene. But, in opposite of what we would expect, it never became stale. It's still the same PSYCHO, an unique, chilling, spectacular work of art that entertains audiences and makes them think. A masterpiece!<br/><br/>It's amazing how this film still remains unique 40 years after its release. Every generation enjoys it, every person who watches it for the first time has a strong opinion about it, it is always a good subject for talking. Some of the most remarkable moments of the cinema are on PSYCHO, at least one: a shower scene. But first let's get back to the beginning of the story. Marion Crane works as a secretary and her boss gives her a huge amount of money to deposit. Her boyfriend has to pay some debts and they want to live together without trouble. As the smart girl she is, Marion decides to run away with the money. She knows she is doing something wrong, so she changes her car and keep going on the road. On a rainy night, she realizes that is difficult to drive more and decides to stop at a motel she doesn't know: the decadent Bates Motel (""12 cabins, 12 vacancies""). There, Marion is received by a young man named Norman Bates, the motel owner, and checks in. He invites her to come to dinner, but Marion hears the voice of Norman's mother, who refuses to let the girl enter at her house. He takes to her a small dinner on his office and they talk a little. Norman lets to know that his mother is invalid and was involved in a tragedy on the past, and he works with dead birds. He seems to be an insecure person because of his mother attitudes. They finish to talk and Marion goes to her room in order to have a shower. That seems to be a calm place, uh? Well, Marion is taking shower and... you know what happens... Poor girl! Norman gets disturbed with the fact and hides Marion's car with her body (and the money) on the swamp. Some days later, Lila Crane, Marion's sister, and Sam Loomis, Marion's boyfriend, are searching for her. A private detective, named Arborgast, will appear to help them. The secret they will find out involving the insecure boy and his mean mother is something very, very weird.<br/><br/>With an unusual story, Hitch made the one that is the best film of his brilliant career, along with VERTIGO. The story of PSYCHO could turn into a mess, but the screenplay is perfectly written, with all the ingredients to surprise and scare us. At the screen, what we see is even better. Not one disposable scene, great situations, involving characters. And Hitch... it is not even needed to say. Helped by a wonderful cinematography and Bernard Herrman's chilling, unforgettable score, his camera takes and the angles he uses are just brilliant! The two murder scenes are just perfect, especially the one in the shower, which I don't need to say that is one of the 3 most well-known scenes of the American cinema, and also one of the 3 best, scariest etc. Oh! And the actors! Who could think that Janet Leigh would be killed on the first half? And who could think Anthony Perkins was such a mad guy? The conclusion goes to the right way, being smart and haunting.<br/><br/>I could write all my impressions about PSYCHO, but I don't want to take this much longer. It is one of the films that most influences the American cinema of our days. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. And that's it.<br/><br/>
To finish, I just wanted to make a parallel between a scene in PSYCHO and a similar one in Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL, obviously influenced by it. When they sum up the crime in PSYCHO, the police officer say that Marion Crane was kind of an alert for the mother to show up into Norman Bates-- the rigid mother who wanted her son only for her. In DRESSED TO KILL (you may think I'm a perverted), Kate Miller and Liz Blake were alerts for the psychiatrist's male side to show up. He wanted to change his sex, but they were obstacles to him because he got ""excited"" with them. I don't know why I'm writing that... That's interesting, but forget!"
"Hitch-26","10","5","9","9 September 2000"," The First Modern Horror Classic
","Revolutionary in its time, Hitchcock's Psycho still shocks today when viewed.  It is the standard that every horror movie is judged by.  Filmed in black and white, everything in this movie--the music, the dialogue, the scenery, etc. is perfectly in sync and is a big reason this movie is a classic.  One bad thing is that I read somewhere that one of the goofs in the movie is when Janet Leigh is killed in the bathroom and staring at the camera, you can see her adam's apple moving.  I had never noticed that, but after reading that I noticed it the next time I watched it and it sort of ruined the illusion for me.  Oh well, that was about the only thing wrong with this movie.  Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam are all outstanding.  Herrmann's score is one of his best, and there are so many memorable scenes that you just need to go watch it right now. One of Hitch's 5 best."

From the splendid performances by the entire cast (especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in their most famous roles) to Bernard Herrmann's eerie and famous music score to Hitchcock's use of unusual camera angles to the site of the Bates Motel and the creepy house that sits above it to the dark humor that is presented and to that unforgettable shower scene, ""Psycho"" is a brilliant horror film that will live on for years to come.

The 2nd and 3rd viewings will put interesting questions in your mind like ""Will Marion go with Norman or Sam?"" or ""What ever happens to Norman later on?"" (of course two sequels were made to solve this one)but most of all this movie should be remembered for being based on probably the greatest murderer of our time named Ed Gein (who is even more psychopath than this movie describes him as).

"Greg Lord","10","5","9","2 May 2000"," A touching tale of a young man & his mother
","CAUTION: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>It's hard to realise the magnitude of Hitchcock's achievement with this film with the handicap of hindsight; I wish I could somehow erase all knowledge of it from my mind so I could view it as if for the first time: I think only then could I appreciate just how revolutionary & subversive this film really is.<br/><br/>It seems Hitchcock deliberately set out to change the film-going habits of the Western world, & it also seems that he succeeded. Apparently when it was made (1960) filmgoers were in the habit of wandering in & out of films at the theatre irrespective of the film's starting & finishing times. Trailers for Psycho' blazed the message: ""Make sure you watch this film from the beginning"". Those who heeded this advice could have been forgiven for wondering why: a young woman (Janet Leigh) steals a large sum of money from a business partner of her employer. On the road, she stops at the Bates Motel in order to divert attention from a suspicious cop, & with her boyfriend, her sister & a private detective also on her trail. The proprietor is one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who, although a little edgy, seems basically OK  apart from a slight maternal fixation. What's the big deal , they might ask  psychological drama, girl on the run etc. etc.: so far, so Hitchcock. After chatting with Bates for a while she retires to her room for a shower, which in hindsight was probably not such a good idea<br/><br/>In an age when Hollywood was still largely dominated by the star system, half an hour into the movie Hitchcock takes his main lead - an attractive, curvaceous blonde - & kills her off, & with a savagery rarely portrayed on the big screen. He then takes what seemed like a fairly conventional movie & turns it on it's head. No longer is the lead character an attractive yet vulnerable young woman on the run, it is now a twitchy nervous antithesis of a Hollywood or even a Hitchcockian leading man (i.e. Cary Grant, James Stewart, Gregory Peck); no longer is the film a run-of-the-mill crime thriller, it is now a journey into the mind of a madman.<br/><br/>I have heard that Hitchcock himself regarded this film as a comedy, & although I've never seen it this way myself I wonder if this is where for him the humour lies: the delight of taking accepted movie conventions, turning them upside-down & inside-out & yet still producing a hugely successful blockbuster by mangling all the rules. I'm sure it made him laugh anyway!<br/><br/>Mention has to be made of Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates - he is simply magnificent & puts in one of cinema's greatest performances. His representation of an unhinged madman masquerading as normal is brilliantly done & totally believable: his desperate attempts at normal behaviour & conversation are overlaid with a nervy touchiness; & his twitchy, constantly changing facial expressions make it clear before you know anything more about him that you're looking at a man torn with internal conflict. He delivers lines such as Mother isn't quite herself today' with a superb drollness that is somehow also loaded with hidden meaning, & in hindsight also quite funny. The end scene where we finally see Norman in his true colours done by anyone else would just look silly (i.e. the recent remake) but he makes it extremely chilling  for me one of cinema's great scenes.<br/><br/>The directorial craftmanship is equally suberb: who else but Hitchcock could come up with anything like the famous shower scene? Shot over 7 days using 70 different camera set-ups for a minute or so of a naked girl being stabbed in a shower - & yet not once is there visible any of the girl's naughty bits' or of the knife plunging into her flesh, such was the attention to detail. In my opinion it probably still is the greatest cinematic sequence ever made.<br/><br/>The scripting, the cinematography, the acting, the sets, but particularly it's subversive delight in turning conventionality on it's head to stunning effect make this film a masterpiece by any standards, a description that still applies 40 years later & I think will do for generations to come."
"stevenfallonnyc","5","15","38","22 July 2007"," Good, but overrated and unintentionally funny
","""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.<br/><br/>I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending. <br/><br/>The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.<br/><br/>The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.<br/><br/>And the ""shocking"" cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When ""Mother"" is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the ""Psycho music"" at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.<br/><br/>It's unreal to think ""Psycho"" was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?<br/><br/>And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, ""ok, I think we all get it now!"" You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, ""ok, does everyone understand now?"" <br/><br/>Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The ""Making of"" documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed. Janet Leigh is still very sharp though, and still looks great."

","Psycho (1960) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>There's really no point in giving a synopsis for this film. If you don't already know what this movie is about then you really need to stop reading this right now and go watch the movie. I've seen this movie dozens of times over the years from VHS to DVD to Blu- ray and I've seen it at least five times on the big screen and for my money this is Alfredy Hitchcock's greatest film and one of the greatest ever made. I know VERTIGO, a brilliant movie, gets all the love and respect but for my money this here is his greatest film.<br/><br/>Where do you start with a movie like this? Everyone knows that the budget was slashed on the director and it certainly helped the film because had this been in color or had it been lavished with a big budget then it just wouldn't have the same feel. The movie has some of the most historic moments in film history that everyone knows about. These moments are of course the shower sequence as well as the ending. Both certainly deserve to be mentioned whenever you discuss brilliant scenes but for my money the greatest sequence in the movie is what happens before the shower sequence and it's the discussion between Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) as they discuss what is basically holding them back.<br/><br/>The performances between the two actors are just so flawless and this scene is so important because it tells us everything we need to know going into the second half of the movie, which is pretty much after the shower scene. The first portion of the movie we're worried and caring about the Crane character but we get the shock of what happens and then our sympathy immediately turns to Norman and him helping his mother. The way Hitchcock pulls this off is rather remarkable but the shocks keep happening with one terrific twist after another leading up to the ending.<br/><br/>What's always amazed me about this movie is how your initial viewing is nothing but pure shocks and gasps but then on repeat viewings, even when you know all the secrets, you can enjoy it just as much because you can then enjoy the film by watching a master handle the material. You can watch for the clues and see all the winks that Hitchcock is giving the viewer. No matter how many times I watch this film I can simply sit back and enjoy it on so many levels. It's a movie where you brain knows what's going on but the film is just so great that you can enjoy everything and wish that the character's fate changes somehow.<br/><br/>Everything from the performances to the score to the cinematography are flawless. This is without question one of the most impressive movies ever made. It's certainly a ground-breaking picture that has its legendary director at the top of his game. PSYCHO has been copied countless times over the past fifty-five years but nothing has come close to its impact."

She performs realistically and she is beautiful and radiant. The story of a young woman in love, who gets her hand on some money and wants to be better off in life with her lover. The scenes with her and the cop were absolutely thrilling. I was expecting the cop to search her bag and bring her to justice. The shower scene in the hotel room is a classic. How many films we know have tried to copy it!! And the scene which was shot from her eye was haunting.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates was absolutely wonderful and terrifying in the end. He made me care for his character who was under his mother's subjugation and did what any son who loves his mother would do (atleast, to him it was true. I would have been scared out of my mind).<br/><br/>Also, the little things in the movie do count. Milton Arbogast as the private detective, I wanted him to leave Bates alone as Norman was such an understandable character. Hitchcock delivers horror in a movie which has no gore. I never thought this old movie could be this awesome. I mean, the score was chilling and its still used today with all kinds of variations. This is the one of the films which spawned every horror filmmaker out there to follow the footsteps of Hitchcock and be as great as him (unfortunately, there are only a few).<br/><br/>Words don't do justice to this movie. Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. He is brilliant by making the climax so scary. I really didn't see the ending coming. It was sheer brilliance on the part of Hitchcock. We still got films that have the same theme recycled over and over again. But, nothing is as good as the original. As they say, ""old is gold"" (I never thought I would say that). Hitchcock's decision to make this in black and white is impressive as it is more scary without the colours.<br/><br/>Do yourselves a favour and make your kids watch this film before they can get brainwashed into thinking today's horror films are scary. The smile at the end by Norman Bates (I'm so awestruck and scared by it) - so creepy. I loved it..!! <br/><br/>10/10"

If you have seen this movie, I am not sure if you remember seeing Alfred Hitchcock in it! One of the office scenes he was standing outside!! It is a fact that in all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies that he made a cameo appearance in each and every one of them!!

The film ""Psycho"" evokes an eerie genre to the entire make-up of the movie!! Personal problems become a potpourri of predicaments with all of the major characters in the film, Remaining impervious to the thought patterns of a psychotic serial killer gives way to the potential of artistic creativity!! The complexity of emotions in this movie wound up captivating the American public!! Any enormously classic scene in a film, makes this film a masterpiece of the American cinema!! ""Psycho"" ""North By Northwest"" and ""The Birds"" all had classic scenes which endeared millions to these three Hitchcock films!! 1960 was a year for change in America on so many dimensional playing fields... Start with the fact that that was the year that I was born, I do not think that the world was quite ready for me!! I still have my doubts about that one actually!!! 1960 was the year ""Psycho"" made it's debut, and it is considered by virtually every movie expert to be one of the greatest films ever made!!

","Alfred Hitchcock takes over an hour and a half in his movie masterpiece, Psycho, to set up the audience for the dénouement scene, i.e. the scene in which Norman Bates' mother first reveals herself. The truth about her is so unexpected that it startles the first-time viewer into immediate and involuntary contemplation concerning the nature of the relationship between her and Norman.<br/><br/>The first-time viewer is virtually coerced by Hitchcock to start thinking and theorizing in order to satisfy the viewer's own inherent need to make sense out of what is happening in the movie. It is reminiscent of some of William Faulkner's best work, in that it conjures up all sorts of unshown images in one's mind.<br/><br/>The most amazing aspect of this great movie consists of its utter believability from beginning to end. These bizarre events could all really have happened! Go see this movie on the big screen. Don't talk to anyone who has seen it about its many secrets. You are best advised to discover those secrets for yourself, in due course. You will be artfully manipulated and mesmerized by the unexcelled genius of Alfred Hitchcock, in a way that is only rivaled by the likes of the great Orson Wells.<br/><br/>If you have heart trouble, don't go to this movie.

","I can't decide whether ""Psycho"" or ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock's best film. My answer on any given day is usually dependent on which one I've most recently watched.<br/><br/>There's no need to go into the performances, or the shocking story, or the Bernard Herrman score (one of the best ever in film history). All that's been covered. Having just watched this film again in honor of Halloween weekend, I was struck fresh by the movie's frankness, which had to have been beyond uncomfortable for film audiences at the time. Supposedly film executives on screening this film were shocked more than anything else by the shots of the toilet in the hotel bathroom. If that was enough to shock, then what about references to transvestites, sexual arousal and release, and the blood-splattered bathroom that Hitchcock shows Perkins cleaning up in rigorous detail? The movie is so honest about the human body, its more unpleasant urges and physical qualities, that when the camera follows a swirl of blood down the shower drain, you half expect to see a big clump of hair sticking out of it. And to think this film came out at the same time as Douglas Sirk was making his films, in which women are as carefully painted and polished as china dolls.<br/><br/>The true test of a great film is how well it stands up to the test of time, and whether or not you can revisit it and find something new in it each time you do so. By that measure, ""Psycho"" is truly one of the greats.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"arthurclay","10","4","7","14 June 2005"," Hitchcock's most famous film
","Loosely based on the real life serial killer Ed Gein ""Psycho"" is considered by many to be the best horror movie ever. Janet Leigh supplies the best death scene ever and Anthony Perkins supplies the most twisted sick crazed character ever. Norman Bates (Perkins) is a simple yet somehow complex man who runs the Bates Motel. When a beautiful young woman ends up at his place of business after stealing from a client and on her way to meet her fiancée to be, he proceeds to give her supper and tell her about ""mother"". A film known for the infamous shower scene and of course the ultimate twist ending. Hitchock even received an angry letter from a woman whose child would no longer take a shower after watching this film. Hitchcock pointedly asked her why she would let such a young child watch his film? A staple of the American horror genre and the top five best horror film winner."

","I love Psycho so much I can't begin to describe what it means to me. The trouble is it has been over-sold in the last twenty years or so that it is known as the film with THAT scene in the shower. There's so much more to it than that. It is arguably the most influential film ever made, and the best directed one at that. Without it, there would be no Jaws, no Godfather, no Star Wars. Psycho may not be the greatest film ever made, nor the scariest film ever made, but is probably the best crafted thriller and a fine example of cinematic manipulation. Psycho continues to influence filmmakers. Look at the Psycho references in 2005's Houseof Wax (preservered mother, twin sons/ split personality, scary house on the hill.) Psycho is simply Great."

","I was first introduced to Alfred Hitchcock when I was very young, however, it was not until now that I knew what a monumental influence he had on film. In my college film class we had the chance to view Psycho and i have to admit at first, i was not extremely excited about it. However, I was hooked in the first five minutes of the film and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I love psychological thrillers that make you wonder and think ""outside the box"" and i think this was one of the best i have ever seen. I think that Alfred's choices for the movie, (director, characters, etc.) were great. I thought all the characters did a fabulous job. The story line and plot were very creative too. I felt like i was being surprised every five minutes. I also like that this is an old black and white film. I don't think that it would have had the same impact on me if it was a modern story in color. It is definitely a classic!"

","This had to be Alfred Hitchcock's best movie. In fact, it was my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie. This movie was perfectly executed by Hitchcock. The acting was unbelievably tremendous. Each actor did an excellent job(especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh). The screenplay was great and the writing was tremendous. It's a movie about a woman(Leigh) who is out driving on a rainy night(after stealing a lot of money) and she stops at a motel where the owner has a mother, but is very lonely and befriends her. When she takes a shower, the figure of an old lady walks in and stabs her to death in the shower(this is remembered as the famous ""shower scene""). This was excellent and I give it a perfect 10 out of 10."

"mrgray83","10","4","7","19 February 2005"," Hitchcock has yet to disappoint me.
","I consider myself relatively new to Hitchcock's films. Before Psycho, it was The Birds and Vertigo. Vertigo got me hooked, so I decided to give the 1960 Psycho a day in court after seeing the 1998 remake. I now see why a remake was such an infamous move, at least remaking it word for word and scene for scene. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho stands rightfully so as one of the greatest horror/psychological flicks of all time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction as always is on point and the acting is wonderful, especially the Norman Bates character. A truly deranged individual. If you pay enough attention, you can piece together the ending before it actually happens, but even then it's still shocking based on Hitchcock's amazing shooting style. I give this a 10/10. A definite classic in my book."
"robocopssadside","10","4","7","18 February 2005"," For what it is, Psycho pretty much is a perfect film.
","It's very disappointing that Anthony Perkins was type-casted due to this performance. I think he proves here that he could play any type of character. With Bates alone you get more than one personality, and he plays them all up well. One of the best scenes in the movie is the dinner with Bates and Marion. It's a really well-developed sequence. And it shows Bates from both sides of the spectrum. A lonesome nice guy with a bit of sadness, then out pops a slight hint of perhaps madness or insanity.<br/><br/>Watching this movie over and over, it still doesn't get boring to me. The build-up of Leigh's character being washed from existence doesn't become boring to me after multiple viewings. It's a Hitchcock movie. His style of filming leaves so much beauty to look at before the horror begins here. I found myself wandering all over the sets while re-watching this. And I think the first 45 minutes gives you a perfect introduction to Marion. At first you think she is going to get away with her spir of the moment crime, then you learn that the good in her knows what she did was wrong, and that she wants to go back and make the best she can of her mistake. Sadly, she never gets to, and one of the most iconic death scenes in horror history is born. And that character that became so solid in your minds that you are just so certain is the lead heroine, is gone. Watching it now and still knowing of the scene in the shower still gives me disbelief that that's how it went down.<br/><br/>Richard Band owes a lot of gratitude to the movie's film score. When I watch Re-Animator, the opening of Psycho immediately comes to mind.<br/><br/>I'm no expert on film, and I like some real bad crap and no brainer films. But I look at this film as a flawless masterpiece."
"ryan_kuhn","9","4","7","13 February 2005"," ""A Boy's Best Friend Is His Mother...""
","Psycho is an exercise in bait-and-switch by the maestro of playing an audience, director Alfred Hitchcock. What begins as a story about someone stealing money becomes one about murder in a seedy motel shower. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary who is supposed to deposit a huge sum of money, but instead takes it and leaves Phoenix, Arizona, headed towards California. Along the way, she is shadowed by a cop (the classic Hitchcockian theme of distrust towards police) and finds her way to a rundown motel off the old highway, The Bates Motel. Running the once popular, now with ""12 cabins, 12 vacancies"" motel is Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins in wonderful manic weirdness. You know something is askew with young Norman in the very first scenes we see him, but we can't quite put our finger on it. Is it his stuffed bird collection? Is it how he talks about his mother? Is it the way he communicates to Marion Crane in their uncomfortable conversations they have? It's probably the combination of all of the above, but whatever it is, Perkins portrays Bates in such a manner that we know something is wrong with him. In perhaps the most famous scene in movie history, the switch to the money is made. The star of the film, the Marion Crane character is killed off while taking a shower by Norman Bates' mother in brutal fashion. We the audience think we see a lot more than we actually do, if you look at the scene carefully. The scene is 45 seconds long, but features over 90 individual cuts and camera angles, leading to a manic and desperate moment in the movie. The music during the scene, almost as famous as the scene itself, is cutting with the violins, replicating the action in the scene itself. The shower scene in Psycho is pure movie making, showing the audience what the director wants them to see, and in what he hides leaves the viewer to imagine, and sometimes think they saw what they think they saw. The rest of the film plays as an investigative film, as Marion's loved ones try to piece together what happened after she ran off with the money. The star of the second half of the film is Norman Bates as he tries to cover up the murder by his mother, and his paranoid ways really show up during this period. The film benefits from being shot in black and white and the violin-only musical score adds much more depth to the mood of the film. Made for less than a million dollars, Psycho is also an example of what a director can do for cheap. This movie touched a nerve with the movie-going public, as many people feared taking showers for months after seeing Psycho. It has been said that star Janet Leigh still, to this day, has never taken a shower since filming Psycho."
"pumpkinhead_lance","Null","4","7","9 February 2005"," One of the Best Films of All Time ***** out of 5
","This is film-making at it's absolute best.<br/><br/>Bernard Herrman's score is terrific and will stick in your head forever. Anthony Perkin's and Janet Leigh's performances seem truly genuine and real all the way through. The shower scene is undoubtedly the most memorable horror moment in film history. There's something about that scene that makes it hard to watch even to this day. Notice when 'Mother' opens the shower curtain how you can just barely make out the eyes that stare so coldly at Leigh before the knife comes down on her. And the brief moment where we see 'Mother' leave the bathroom. The entire scene is just masterful. It never gets old, never will. It will remain the definitive piece of film-making and will remain the granddaddy of all horror pictures.<br/><br/>On another note, Psycho II and III are actually worth watching, despite what some people may say. They aren't the masterpiece that the original is of course but the filmmakers wisely don't try to duplicate it. They are very different stories from the original. They are a (especially Part II) quite intelligent continuation of the character Norman Bates. If you are interested in seeing what happens to Norman in the years to come, they are indispensable.<br/><br/>As for the remake... I'm not sure it's worth mentioning. As a movie, it stinks because it's already been done, and it just proved that the original can't be beat. Then again, I've heard it should be just looked at as a tribute. But what raunchy way to pay tribute to the greatest horror film of all time.<br/><br/>So, in closing, let me say that if you haven't seen Hitchcock's masterpiece, go now and buy it. That's right, don't rent it, buy it. It's a certainty that you will love this film."

","Psycho is the one true horror film, it's better than other great horror movies like The Shining, Halloween, The Exorcist, and it's better than Hitchcock's classic The Birds. This is the movie with the shower/murder scene that is possibly the most referenced scene in movie history. Everything about that scene is classic, from the camera angles, to the music, to the blood running into the sink(which was chocolate syrup since the movie was in black and white).<br/><br/>This is a very difficult film to write a review on. What I can say is take the advice given by Alfred Hitchcock at the showing of this movie when it was in the theater. His advice was to not even enter the movie if it had already started, because it can only be seen from the beginning. That is exactly how this movie is meant to be seen. Despite being in black and white, this movie is still a shocking experience. I think it should have been a crime to do what Hollywood did, they made a remake of this. When Hollywood does a remake of such a classic film like Psycho, then you know that they are very desperate to make money. <br/><br/>Everybody should see this, it is almost a perfect movie and is still shocking today."

","One of the most influential films of all time, this is also arguably the best directed film of all time. Hitchcock brought a number of new techniques out in this film, and many clichÃ©s of the thriller genre originate from what was original when this was first released. The amazingly discreet shower scene is one of the best-filmed sequences of all time, put against the chilling music score by Bernard Hermann that haunts the whole film. The acting is also top-notch, especially from Anthony Perkins, who has never had a better role, and most importantly, it is a film that is thoroughly entertaining, even after multiple viewings."
"hokiemo","Null","4","7","1 November 2004"," Timeless Thriller
","Psycho is an excellent thriller no horror fan should miss. Alfred Hitchcock knows how to create chills without gore. The film being in black and white also adds to the spooky mystique. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are perfectly cast. Leigh's character makes you sympathetic for her despite her criminal intentions and Perkins' portrayal of a serial killer ensnaring his prey is brilliant. I can't imagine why this film was remade in the 1990's --- the 1960 version is just so perfect that I wouldn't change a thing.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend this film. It's so good you'll want to watch it twice in a row."
"DocD456","9","4","7","20 February 2004"," Genius
","This psychotic thiller is a work of genius by the director Alfred Hitchcock. Made in 1960 this film was well ahead of its time.  The movie stars Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, a curious motel manager, Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, John Gavin as Sam Loomis, and John McIntire as Sheriff Al Chambers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Psycho forever changed the way films were made in Hollywood.  Alfred Hitchcock's genius shaped this masterpiece in such a way to draw the viewer in and keeping them on the edge of their own seat.  With his experience in movie making, Hitchcock knows just how to influence and play with the mind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock is considered `The Master of Suspense,' and has earned that name rightfully.  He created movies that one would have to watch over and over again in order to get all the little details of a film. Psycho is a perfect example of that, using lighting and camera angles to give the watcher a feeling of being anxious, scared, or weary of what is about to happen.  One might notice that when any certain scene is shown, the camera gets closer and closer to the actor or actress's face, making it very uncomfortable to watch.  Every aspect of this film is amazing for it's time, with a score that has been nominated to be one of the top 100 most influential pieces of music in American history. <br/><br/>
Overall, I give Psycho a 9 out of 10 stars, for being a good movie in general.  It's a powerful film that goes deeper than just scaring people. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves old horror classics."

"SKG-2","10","4","7","15 March 1999"," Set the standard
","1960.  Alfred Hitchcock is, for his time, king of the world, with a string of hit movies, a hit TV show, and even growing critical respect (from ""auteur"" critics like Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut).  Flush with all of this success, did Hitchcock continue making the glossy entertainments he excelled at in the 1950's?  No.  Instead, he made a low-budget film which was obviously influenced by B-movies (notably the ones made by William Castle) and what he had learned on TV.  The result was PSYCHO, and it's safe to say movies were never the same again.<br/><br/>Many articles have been written claiming Spielberg and Lucas have been responsible for the decline of movies today, and have been responsible for more cheap rip-offs than anyone else.  It seems to me Hitchcock and PSYCHO have inspired (if that's the right word) more rip-offs than Spielberg or Lucas put together.  Not just the obvious ways, like the many horror films which pay homage to it (DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN), or the films which have spoofed it(HIGH ANXIETY).  There's also its influence in narrative(speeding things up, instead of taking time to tell the story), its reliance on fairly thin characters, sparse dialogue, and of course, that music.  Someone more qualified than I could go at length at how Hitchcock's technique here has echoed throughout moviemaking today, but that influence to is undeniable.  I guess to sum up, PSYCHO does what Spielberg, Lucas, and every blockbuster film have been accused of doing; making a B-movie on the scale of an A-movie(of course, Hitchcock had a lower budget, but he did have stars like Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, and well-known actors like John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles).<br/><br/>As the rip-offs shouldn't put you off the Spielberg and Lucas films, nor should the rip-offs put you off of PSYCHO(I haven't seen the remake yet, but I still want to).  No matter how many times you've seen it before, the shower scene still packs a wallop.  So does the climax in the basement, and the final shot of Norman.  Perkins avoids the mistake most movie psychos (pardon the expression) make today by hamming it up; although you suspect something, you're prepared to dismiss him until you find out the truth.  This isn't my favorite Hitchcock (that honor goes to NORTH BY NORTHWEST), but it's a classic."

On her journey she finds the Bates Motel and decides to stop there for the night. She then meets a great villain played by Anthony Perkins, Norman Bates. As she gets to know him she finds he is quite terrifying while talking. He mentions his mother and says ""She just goes mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes!"" Anyway, later she takes a shower, and everyone remembers seeing the stabbing of her, and the star is dead. The film continues this psychopathic story by having first Det. Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who is murdered, and then her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) come and look for her. Hitchcock has done a superb job in creating suspense and horror, I especially loved the dead mother in the chair, and the great score by Bernard Herrmann, particularly the famous high screeches of the violins (like knives stabbing). Hitchcock's cameo is a man through Leigh's office window, wearing a cowboy hat. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography.

When Marion is changing her clothes in her bedroom, you see her shower head peeking out...foretelling things to come.<br/><br/>3.

","The definitive film from Hitchcock's library that just does not age at all. It is probably more terrifying and disturbing now than it was over 40 years ago. Janet Leigh (Oscar-nominated) seems like an ordinary woman, but she has a few skeletons in her closet: she is having an affair with a married man and she takes it upon herself to take a large sum of money from the bank where she works. A frantic getaway is now the only option, but the weather impedes her progress. Maybe a stay in the Bates Motel is what she needs. Enter suspicious inn-keeper Anthony Perkins and his unseen elderly mother who torments him. Trouble awaits for Leigh now. Sister Vera Miles becomes worried after Leigh's disappearance and Leigh's boyfriend also joins the search (John Gavin). The search leads to the spooky Bates Motel and the suspense builds. Private investigator Martin Balsam also joins the search but no one's safety is assured. Hitchcock is in top-form here all the way. The film is tense and it wraps itself around the audience.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","5","4 March 2009"," The Ultimate Psycho
","Been meaning to watch this reputed 'masterpiece' for years and finally I got hold of it. Is it as good as everyone says? The thing is, nothing can describe the experience. Even though I have watched almost countless psychological thrillers over the years, nothing really compares to 'Psycho'. One would have to experience the film in order to find out the answer to the aforementioned question. Luckily, I haven't watched the remake which is said to be a scene by scene copy.<br/><br/>An atmosphere of darkness is set right from the beginning where one witnesses Sam and Marion who have just made love in a hotel room. Nothing particularly happens in that scene but there seems to be a lingering doom that will follow one of the characters soon. The black and white seems to work towards the film's benefit and stress on the chilling atmosphere. The closeup shots are especially effective. For example, notice the policeman wearing the sunglasses looking as though wearing a cold unsympathetic expression that creeps out Marion.<br/><br/>All the actors do a great job in that department. John Gavin is quite dashing as Sam Loomis. Janet Leigh is sensual and sophisticated. Vera Miles is terrific as Marion's concerned sister. Martin Balsam too leaves a mark and Anthony Perkins immortalizes Norman Bates.<br/><br/>The dialogues are clever and the editing is sharp. The twists are great as they 'make sense' with the story. Although I saw the ending coming, it fits well with everything. Hitchcock's film is very much an atmospheric piece and he has succeeded greatly in drawing the desired response from the viewer (even by forbidding cinema halls to not allow customers who arrived late). The sense of chill looms over, especially after viewing the final scene."

","Alfred Hitckcock is the master of suspense and mystery. I have now seen four of his movies and I have to say that Psycho is not only among his best of film, but also among the best of the horror genre. Hitchkock's direction was simply marvelous in the 1950s and 60s, and still is today. From the intense facial close-ups to the distant and unusual camera angles, it is impeccable. The music by Bernard Herrmann also adds much to the suspense to the film. I was on the edge of my seat with every beat of the score.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins is simply remarkable as Norman Bates. He isn't the full scale, murder, blood-seeking type of villain that most Hollywood villains are depicted in modern-day horror flicks. He appears as a normal person but has a secret and dark personality. He's creepy and disturbing but yet subtle and calm. He can be pitied, but also feared.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh, I will never forget her scream as she faces her inevitable death in the shower sequence. She was also superb in supporting as Bates' first victim. But in my opinion, I felt the shower scene was a little corny. I kind of felt myself laughing at the chocolate syrup that was used for the blood, which I expected to be in more quantity like in Raging Bull. Perhaps I'm just to the blood/gore of the 1980s and modern-day cinema. Then again, it was common for most movies in the 50s and 60s for people on camera to die without spraying an ounce of blood.

Act III deals with the investigations into Marion's disappearance, not only by the police but also by her boyfriend Sam, her sister Lila and a private eye named Milton Arbogast.<br/><br/>Many people have felt that Act I, and indeed much of Act II, is a gigantic red herring. Certainly, Hitchcock seems to be leading us to believe that Marion is to be the central figure in this drama and the stolen money the ""McGuffin"" around which it will revolve. Her murder midway through the film must have come as a great shock to the audiences who watched the film in 1960, not only because the shower scene was, by the standards of the day, graphic in its depiction of violence, but also because the violent death of the central character so early in the film was almost unprecedented. Marion is young, attractive, blonde (like most Hitchcock heroines) and played by a major star; just the sort of film character one would expect to survive a murderous attack. Moreover, in Janet Leigh's portrayal she emerges as not altogether unsympathetic, despite her crime. One gets the impression that she is not, fundamentally, a wicked person and that she stole the money in a moment of madness. The man from whom she stole is a seedy sexual predator, seen flirting with her and making veiled sexual suggestions. When she is threatened by that sinister-looking traffic cop in his dark glasses, we are just praying for her to get away with it.<br/><br/>This is probably the darkest of Hitchcock's films. Many of his films have a straightforward pattern of good triumphing over evil, ending with the villain dead or in police custody and the hero safe and free to marry the beautiful blonde heroine. ""North by North West"", the film which Hitchcock made immediately before ""Psycho"", and ""Spellbound"" are good examples of this pattern. In some films, such as ""Rebecca"", ""Notorious"" or ""Strangers on a Train"", there are elements of moral ambiguity, but in ""Psycho"" ambiguity seems to be replaced by a straightforward triumph of evil over good. Bates might end up under arrest, but not before he has murdered Marion and several other people.<br/><br/>There is a clear contrast between this film and ""Spellbound"", another film which shows Hitchcock's fascination with psychology. In that film the character played by Ingrid Bergman is a ""healer of souls"", (the literal meaning of the Greek words from which ""psychiatrist"" is derived) a force for good who is able not only to cure Gregory Peck of his psychological traumas but also to clear him of unjustified suspicion of murder. In ""Psycho"" the psychiatrist is a more neutral figure, able to explain why Bates committed his crimes, but unable to cure him or to suggest how such crimes might be prevented.<br/><br/>Yet on a deeper level there is more ambiguity about ""Psycho"" than appears at first sight. The character of Bates, with his split personality, symbolises the duality of good and evil in the human soul. Bates originally committed an evil crime- the murder of his mother and her lover- but has been driven mad by remorse. In his madness, the two aspects of his character have crystallised into two distinct personalities. His ""Norman"" personality (shown in a brilliantly subtle performance by Anthony Perkins) is that of a polite and inoffensive young man. His timidity, his apparent domination by his mother and his odd hobby of taxidermy might make him seem creepy, but never threatening. (His speciality is stuffing birds, and several examples of his handiwork decorate the motel, adding to the eeriness of the film and foreshadowing Hitchcock's next film, ""The Birds""). Bates has, however, unconsciously projected the evil side of his character onto his dead mother, and it is when the ""Mother"" personality takes over that he commits further evil deeds. One of the things that make the film so frightening is that the crimes are committed by a seemingly inoffensive character.<br/><br/>These two aspects of Bates come out in his dealings with Marion. The ""Norman"" side befriends her, the ""Mother"" side kills her. Before she is killed, however, she is persuaded her she must return the stolen money. One of the last things she says is that she must return to Phoenix ""to get out of a trap I've gotten into"". Unwittingly, Norman has persuaded her to cleanse her soul. He destroys her physically, but might have saved her spiritually. If that seems an over-portentous interpretation of this film, we must remember that Hitchcock was brought up as a Catholic and that themes of sin and redemption play an important part in his work. (Think, for example, of ""I Confess""). There are also, of course, two sides to Marion, symbolised by the change in colour of her underwear from white to black after she has committed the crime.<br/><br/>Two things remain to be mentioned. One is that harsh, driving Bernard Herrmann score which fits the mood of the film so well. The other is Hitchcock's direction and his use of black-and-white photography to convey a threatening mood. He said that he used black-and-white to make the film less gory; in fact, it seems far more eerie and frightening than a colour version ever could. (A pity that Gus van Sant did not understand that before embarking on his ill-advised remake). Overall, this is a superb chiller, undoubtedly the best ""slasher"" movie ever made and my personal favourite among Hitchcock's work. 10/10."
"FilmOtaku","9","3","5","5 August 2005"," Incomparable
","The plot of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film ""Psycho"" is by now the stuff of legend; Marion Crane (Leigh), a secretary in Phoenix is desperate to marry her boyfriend Sam (Gavin), only Sam is still paying off debts from his previous marriage. One Friday a man comes into her real estate office with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for his daughter. Instead of taking the money to the bank as her boss directed, Marion packs her bags and leaves town with the money, presumably to give to Sam so they can finally make a life together. After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer. Unfortunately they all find that as one mystery begins to unravel, another one, more quizzical and shocking is ready to take its place, and none of them are safe from the danger of the Bates Motel.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that there isn't much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said; ""Psycho"" being one of the most studied and analyzed films in film history. (I myself took a class in college that examined parts of the film frame by frame, and have read books analyzing the film) However, I have to wonder if the sensation of the film and the fact that it is an instant classic, regardless if someone has seen it or not (truthfully, I have heard people say, ""Oh, that is such a classic."" And then later admit that they haven't yet seen the film at all.), sometimes waters down its mastery and the impact this film had (and continues to have) on the film industry as a whole. If you ever get the opportunity to see the art exhibit ""24 Hour Psycho"", wherein the artist slows the film down to make the running time span an entire day, or if you were to read the excellent book Shower Scene in Hitchcock's Psycho: Creating Cinematic Suspense and Terror by Philip J. Skerry, you can see how incredibly impeccable each frame of the film is. If you were to lay out any scene in the film and look at it frame by frame, you would have some incredibly compelling photographs, and that was exactly how Hitchcock intended his presentation to be.<br/><br/>Aside from being a work of art, it is well known that ""Psycho"" changed the way that moviegoers attended the cinema. Because of the big event that occurs halfway through the film, Hitchcock could not have people continuing their normal practice of strolling into the theater whenever they felt like it. If any of these people came to see a Janet Leigh picture, they would be pretty confused at that point. So Hitchcock, ever the showman (and his own greatest publicist) announced that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie began. This was HUGE for its time. Besides changing the attendance factor, it was one of the greatest publicity stunts of its time. If people weren't going to go to the film before, they sure were going to check it out now. I'm sure that ""Psycho"" doesn't have as much of an impact to people who grew up on slasher films or other horror films, but despite the fact it was released 45 years ago, its secrets are now the stuff of general film knowledge, and personally, the fact that I have studied it clinically, when I went to see it at the classic movie house two weeks ago, I still found that my heart was racing and the hair was standing up on my arms during the very last scene of the film. Even more of a testimony to its impact is the fact that a friend that I attended the film with, who isn't much of a film fan, much less a classic film buff not only said that he was so tense during the film that he was on pins and needles, but that he wanted to see it again, and soon. Why does this film have such a forceful impact nearly five decades after it was first released? I'm sure that one of the several hundred books written about this film and Hitchcock's filmography could give you several reasons at length. But a simple answer may sum it up best for now: It's simply a damn good movie. 9/10<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","(Some Spoilers) Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror thriller about murder and madness at the deadly and infamous Bates Motel managed by the weird but seemingly harmless son of the motel owner Mrs. Bates Norman, Anthony Perkins. <br/><br/>The film ""Psycho"" starts out inside a darkened hotel room on a broiling Friday afternoon in December in the city of Phoenix Arizona. Marion Crane and Sam Loomis, Janet Leigh and John Gavin, have just finished off an afternoon quickie as they both get dressed to get back to their individual jobs after their lunch break. Depressed at having to meet and make love in the secrecy of a hotel room instead of at home like a married couple is getting both Marion and Sam very upset but they don't have the money to get married as well as raise a family. With Marion having a job as a secretary and Sam as a warehouse manager and also being very deeply in debt. <br/><br/>Marion later that afternoon is called into the office of her boss George Lowery, Vaughn Taylor, and given some $40,000.00 in cash from a client of his Tom Cassidy, Frank Albertson,to put away at the local bank for the weekend. It's then that something clicks in Marion's mind where she decides to steal the money and use it to skip town and later marry Sam. <br/><br/>Trading in her old car for a new one at a car dealership with $700.00 of the stolen cash Marion drives out west to California and as night falls it starts to rain very heavily and with the visibility next to zero she goes off the main highway on to a small country road that leads to the Bates Motel. Getting a room from Norman Bates at the motel Norman starts to become friendly and falls for the pretty sweet as well as obviously distressed Marion. This makes Norman's old and infirm mother Mrs.Bates very angry with him for not paying any attention towards her. Mrs. Bates also develops a very vicious and violent hatred towards Marion for what she thinks is her stealing Norman away from her.<br/><br/>Later in her motel room Marion has seconds thoughts about her taking the $40,000.00 and plans to return it the next day to her employer back in Phoenix after having a good nights sleep at the motel but the bitter and vengeful Mrs. Bates has other ideas. Horrific film that has you at the edge of your seat and by the end falling off it. With the murderous Mrs. Bates on a knife wielding rampage attacking and slashing Marion as she's taking a shower leaving her to bleed to death on the floor of the bathtub. <br/><br/>The shower scene is one of the most terrifying horror sequences ever put on film. The scene slowly builds itself up as the crazed Mrs. Bates enters Marion's room and creeps up to her in the shower. Quickly pulling the shower curtains apart Mrs. Bates lays into Marion with a large kitchen knife that had people in movie houses back them, 1960, choke on their popcorn and candy bars. Alfred Hitchcock set the scene up in a deliberately slow and deadly pace but when it exploded it left those watching, like poor Marion, in a state of first shock and then sheer terror. <br/><br/>Even more effective, but not as popular with the movie going public, is when Mrs. Bates confronts private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who was hired to find Marion,at the top of the stairs in the Bates house. All at once when you, and Det. Arbogast, never expected it Mrs. Bates lashes her knife into Det. Arbogast face cutting it open. As Det. Arbogast falls to the bottom of the staircase Mrs. Bates pounces on him, like a cat, and savagely finishes him off. This all happened so fast that you, like Arbogast, didn't even have enough time to anticipate it which made it that much more effective. <br/><br/>It later turns out that the insane Mrs. Bates had already murdered a number of people, before she murdered both Marion and Det. Arbogast, over the years and had them and their cars sunk in a nearby lake with the help of her willing son Norman to hide the evidence. <br/><br/>The shock to end all shocks comes near the end of the movie when Marion's sister Lila, Vera Miles, goes down to the basement of the Bates house and finds out just who and what Mrs. Bates really is and who was the real person behind the bloody and brutal murders at the Bates Motel."

","Psycho is one of the great movies because of the way it manipulates the audience. Everybody these days has at least an idea of who Norman Bates really is and what he does, but the movie still has the power to fascinate and to induce terror no less than poor Miss Crane's. The use of amazing photography and lighting schemes, the classic score, the ""McGuffin"" of the stolen money, and captivating performances by all actors (especially Janet Leigh and, famously and typecasting-ly, Anthony Perkins) add to the mix, pushing the audience's emotions one way and then another: tension, humour, humanity, terror, confusion, and a final horror. Ultimately, it is a visceral but above all highly entertaining experience."
"Quinoa1984","10","4","8","21 February 2000"," Shocking
","Psycho is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films ever made and is one of the few horror masterpieces in film history. That's the main-line, given stroke of it. But what it comes down to is that, really, seriously... it's Psycho - the one and only (that we acknowledge, screw off, Gus Van Sant). More than anything why it's Hitchcock's triumph as a commercial filmmaker - past the shower scene and the camera tricks and the notorious finale - is that it's (not so) secretly a monument to what we hide in all of us.<br/><br/>What I love about the movie seeing it again after so many years is seeing how in her own way Marion Crane is a bit of a psycho, just not quite at the level of 11 that Norman Bates is. There's an interesting parallel to make to how voice-over is used; Marion's imagination gets the better of her for a moment as she drives along and she makes up what the cop that pulls her over, her boss, her boyfriend, etc, all say. Watch as her face contorts into a little grin, almost against her better judgment, when she imagines the more twisted portion of the dialog. Frankly, I've had dialogs going in my head like that, imagining the worst that could happen from a mistake or bad deed, and almost taking pleasure in the more morbid aspects (I mean, hey, I directed Jealous Jerzy, what does that tell you? But I digress).<br/><br/>So keep that in mind when it comes time for the end of the movie - hell any portion really with Norman and ""Mother"". But mostly that last scene. After what is an amusing parody of exposition (the psychologist goes on for so long that it's the only logical explanation aside from dated, clunky writing - I prefer to think Hitchcock was smarter than that and was mocking what would or could be an exposition on Norman Bates + Mother and then just ""Mother""), Norman/Mother is in his/her room, and the camera closes in as the voice-over gets intense, plotting, paranoid, not wanting to swat a fly. Perhaps Hitchcock wants to draw the parallel, though there is a distinction: Marion imagines other people talking, while Norman isn't even in the equation: it IS Mother. Yeah.<br/><br/>Such great stuff. And if you haven't seen it before... what are you reading this for ya dummy!"

","Sorry, but I've never understood why ""Psycho"" is considered by so many people to be the best horror movie of all times (I give it only 7/10). Very influental it is, yes. Maybe also I've just seen a bit too many dozens of mass murderer movies based more or less on ""Psycho"", that the original doesn't feel so special anymore?<br/><br/>I think that a good movie must stand time and can be watched many times over and over again. Why should one want to watch ""Psycho"" again? The plot is so easy to guess even when seeing the movie first time that I find there not too much excitement.<br/><br/>What's the plot and idea of this movie? Some nut just goes killing innocent people, because he's crazy, and that's the whole story. Period. Scary? Well, as much as irrational violence is scary.<br/><br/>I also find it disgusting that in many horror movies psychotic people are often portrayed as the cause of all evil, when most of them are only very sick and mostly not particularly harmful to anyone. What is really scary - in real life or on a film - are people basically having everything ok and a good mental health, but still often doing horrible things, including irrelevant violence. Most violence in the world is done by such ""normal"" people.<br/><br/>I think that Hitchcock has many better movies than ""Psycho"". For example ""Rear Window"" is a true classic in its minimalism, though maybe not particularly scary, at least in the way modern horror movies playing mainly on special effects are. Anyway, there you have just an ordinary guy, could be your nextdoor neighbour, who cruelly kills his wife etc., Now that's a scary idea, and the plot makes you think too."

"jmholmes-73727","10","2","3","1 October 2018"," First movie of the modern era
","Young audiences today no doubt find it hard to believe that a horror classic such as this could have been made without a thought toward youngsters going to see it. But PSYCHO was made when nearly all top quality directors were making movies routinely for adults. It would be another 8 or 10 years before studios would discover the youth market as perhaps an answer to their financial woes. Flash forward to the present when adults have to hunt for the elusive independent, unpublicized gems that are available today for them.
 Hence this thriller makes the audience wait 45 minutes for the first scare. That script would never get shot today. But when that scare came, it was a pip- killing the star off half way through! Something new had happened here, and Hitch became the first to insist no one be admitted to the theater after the movie had begun. At that time it was common for patrons to walk into movies at any time and stay to see the start of the next show up to the time they 
had come in. Hitch changed the way audiences went to the movies.
 It suddenly became okay for major stars and directors to develop nasty or violent projects that would always be a thorn in the side to conservative producers. Eight years after PSYCHO, Bonnie and Clyde would break new ground too with its technicolor bloodshed in that film.
 After all these years, it's still painful to decide which of his films is his best. Is it the cold brilliance of this, or the hauntingly beautiful tragedy of Vertigo - or the terrifying, inexplicable The Birds?"
"abbydigion","10","2","3","29 September 2018"," Psycho review
","Psycho was a very interesting and startling film. The Director used non diegetic sound during the shower scene to add suspense, which was brilliant, because the audience got to experience a thrill. The Director used the name "" Bates Motel"" to warn the audience that something is wrong about this certain Motel. The Director wanted to use a name that sticks out and will be remembered. Through out the whole film the Director uses clues that lead up to the most startling part of the film. The Director uses an Aerial shot when Norman Bates carries his mother out of the room to let the audience know something intriguing is going to happen. Near the very end of the movie the audience gets the shock of their lives, because when the detective went down to the cellar there was a chair in the middle of the room. When the detective turns the chair around he and the audience discover a Skeleton sitting in the chair! The Skeleton was Norman Bate's dead mother. Norman killed his mother and kept her Skeleton! At the very end of the film the audience soon discovers Norman Bates has a mental disability and his brain took the form of his mother's personality."

","PSYCHO is a psychological thriller with elements of horror in which tension is gradually giving way to a sort of creeps. It is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch.<br/><br/>During a lunchtime in Phoenix, a real estate secretary discusses with her boyfriend how they cannot afford to get married because of his debts. Forty thousand dollars in cash accidentally come into her hands. This is a great temptation for a young and unhappy woman. Her boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank. She instinctively takes the money and plans an escape to a new life. California is a famous destination of most of the fugitives. She has, because of the strong cuff, decided to spend the night in a small motel. A pleasant dinner with an attentive owner of the motel will be the last in her life...<br/><br/>The story is very tense and shocking. It has offered some of iconic climax in the genre. Mr. Hitchcock did not give up from a classical narrative. He has managed, regardless of the situation and the probability to transfer tensions from one character to another. Hitch has paid attention to small details. The secret of the main plot lies in these details. <br/><br/>A ghostly atmosphere has completely corresponded with violence, deviant behavior and sexuality. The soundtrack is excellent. All the protagonists are changing throughout the film. It is a kind of trap by Mr. Hitchcock. Compassion and understanding toward one of the antagonists in the film are certainly possible. However, a viewer loses a firm stance with regard to any kind of identification with the main antagonist. We hear a voice of the killer, we know some of his features, we are witnesses of his murder, but we do not see a clear character.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates has offered an excellent and intriguing performance. The duality in his character has reflected through a family melodrama, violence by parents and a psychotic obsession. His unpredictability and alienation can cause a fear and admiration at the same time. <br/><br/>Janet Leigh as Marion Crane is quite convincing in the role of an insecure and nervous woman. <br/><br/>Both characters are in strong conflict with themselves. Norman has struggled with obsession and fear. Marion has tried to overcome her own passion and discomfort. He is completely disturbed person, who can not make decisions alone. She is an unfortunate woman who tries to escape from everyday life.<br/><br/>The film has become unique in the combination of a sophisticated music and upcoming murder scene. Hitch has, in an intriguing way, played with the human psyche."

Hitchcock brings out his best direction techniques and methods in this movie. Everything about this movie just stands out, its cinematography, acting, direction, story telling.. just everything. The plot, though simple, is created with so much suspense that you'll be submerged into the movie. The climax may well be the best we have ever seen (not even comparable to climax in The Usual Suspects). For the climax alone i would rank the movie 10/10.

It is kind of dark to say the Marion got a heavy dose of Karma when she is killed in the shower, but this is where things get interesting. We learn that Normans mother, Norma, has been dead for 10 years. The realization that Norman took his mothers persona was interesting. This film is based on a true serial killer, Ed Gein, who did similar things to Norman. Music was important in setting the mood for specific scenes. Lighting was key in this film with the placement of shadows on the characters. Shadows were important also to show movement of shadows. Editing was important for some of the montages that were used in this film. Overall the film is considered a classic and has set a standard for horror films.

I think these quotes are sure to be of some interest to anyone who is at all familiar with this film and its legacy to the genre of horror.<br/><br/>(1) ""Hitchcock thought of Psycho (1960) as a comedy. When it first came out, it was greeted with screams of laughter. People laughed all the way through, so much so that he declared it was the first time he had ever been out-thought by an audience. He knew it was going to be funny, but he didn't realize it was going to be that funny."" <br/><br/>(2) ""Not many people know this, but I was in New York rehearsing for a play when the shower scene was filmed in Hollywood. It is rather strange to go through life being identified with this sequence knowing that it was my double. Actually, the first time I saw Psycho and that shower scene was at the studio."" <br/><br/>.... Well, there you have it."

","I had seen the shower-scene, I'd seen small parts of it, but never really the whole film in a dark room, until recently. The movie from the 60's, made by one of the best known horror movie creators, Alfred Hitchcock is probably the scariest movie I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The guy who took horror to its new higher levels, Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense. It all began in 1957 when a farmer named Ed Gein wasn't considered much more than a local eccentric was visited by the police. They were working a missing- persons case, found a bloody body in his barn, four chairs upholstered in human skin, a vest made out of a woman's torso and a soup bowl carved from half of a scull. Gein told the police that he liked to take things apart, to see how they worked. Robert Bloch, an author, read the newspaper stories and got the idea for a mystery novel. The first would be that the person likely to be a heroine, a pretty, impulsive thief named Mary, and a crazy woman who would turn out to be a crazy man. <br/><br/>The movie ""Psycho"" begins with titles informing us of the exact place, date and time. The script developing quickly we meet Marion Crane, a young secretary who's just finished up her hotel-room ""quicky"" with Sam her lover. If we're watching real close, we can see that she's wearing white underwear, the pure and angelic color. She goes to her office and hears a vulgar client brag about the house he's about to buy in cash as a wedding present for his daughter. We don't really think that Marion is going to run off with the money, because she seems so nice, so honest, but off she goes with $40,000 to marry Sam.<br/><br/>On the run she eventually calls it a night and goes to the Bates Motel, meeting Norman, a nice, charming young man who kind of takes care of Marion, giving her food and is very happy about seeing her. The dialogue between Marion and Norman is wonderful, if you listen carefully you'll hear all about ""private traps"", ""going a little mad sometimes"" and ""struggling to escape and never budging an inch"". When she's in the hotel, she's wearing black underwear, and I think that it kind of is a symbol for the contrast between her pure and good, and then when she's taken the money her underwear is black, dark and bad. She goes into the shower, and all though it's been analyzed endlessly I think it looks far more disturbing for what it really means. <br/><br/>Marion has at this point, decided to return the money and face the consequences. So, does she really deserve to die? Hasn't she just decided to make amends? Norman who unknowingly tosses the $40,000 away, cleaning up his mother's work, doesn't he deserve to make the escape Marion couldn't? I think that in this movie, deserving something has nothing to do with it. It kind of reflects upon if our lives have a divine purpose or not. That we're just pointless spans driven by primitive needs. Are we animals?<br/><br/>Look at the names, she comes from Phoenix (a bird), her last name is Crane (a bird), Norman keeps a stuffed owl in his office, her room is full of pictures of songbirds. Why does Norman say ""You eat like a bird""? If we look at Hitchcock's next movie, ""The Birds"" he kind of showcases that birds are weird creatures, moving by instinct. Just as likely to fly into their own death as away from it. Hitchcock so often capture the characters facing each other in matching profiles, Marion and Norman are kind of alike names, and Sam, Marion's lover looks a little like Norman. Actual mirrors are everywhere, surprising us and the characters with unexpected reflections.<br/><br/>And as I was watching it I couldn't help but think; is Hitchcock just teasing us with the theme of multiple personalities? I don't know, because he doesn't provide us the answers. The private detective who goes looking for Marion falls down the stairs after being slashed, Lila, Marion's sister snoops around and finds an album in Norman's bedroom, but Hitchcock cuts away before we can see the inside. Lila finds the ""mother"" in the end, and we get explained why Norman is the way he is by an ""expert"" who's explanation is so flat and unconvincing that I actually started to think that it was the whole purpose, because then we get to see Norman, or ""mother"". <br/><br/>The movie is strange and goes against all of the normal plots. We liked the heroine, she got killed 40 minutes in. The detective was saving the day, he was killed too. Then we thought, okay, so Sam and Lila will fall for each other, no they didn't. A happy ending at least? If you think that the bad guy, or woman now, smiling in the end of the movie is a happy ending, well, then you got your treat, but I think it's rather scary.<br/><br/>I was scared to be honest, I mean, the worst horror movies are the kinds that are realistic, the ones where we kind of think that it could actually happen. I mean, think about it for a second, how much more realistic is it that there's a man living next door who's a serial killer, a real psychopath rather than a corpse climbing out of the dark? I think that what makes this movie scary, is that it's totally realistic, and it shows us that the darkness of this world, of the human mind can be just as scary even though it was a low-budget film."

","PSYCHO (1960)<br/><br/>Directed By: Alfred Hitchcock<br/><br/>Book Base: Robert Block Screen Play: Joseph Stephani<br/><br/>Music: Bernard Hermann Cinematography: John Russell Film Editing by: George Tomasini<br/><br/>Cast: Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates),Vera Miles (Lila Crane), John Gavin (Sam Louis), Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)<br/><br/>Psycho is an astounding film produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock is known for Movies with surprise endings while keeping you wondering what will happen next. This film is a must see for everyone, even those who do not like horror movies.<br/><br/>The movie is about a woman, Marion Crain (Janet Leigh)who seems to be a little on the naughty side, but honest. Marion is honest until the day she decides to steal $40,000 in cash from her employer. Marion leaves town by vehicle to be with her boyfriend who is penniless. Marion travels a long distance and starts to get tired and pulls into the Bates Motel. She has a surprise waiting for her there. The plot thickens from here. I will not go into plot detail for those of you who have not viewed the film, but the suspense is uncanny in the way Hitchcock directed the movie.<br/><br/>Hitchcock uses music and lighting in a way that draws the audience's full attention and makes the viewers become a part of the film. The suspense in this film is beyond comprehension, in the way that a person has not lived until you have viewed this film. No film of this time has been able to top this suspenseful thriller. The fact that the movie is in black and white makes the film unusually dramatic. Viewers thought Notorious was good, but Psycho is even better. Hitchcock has plenty of surprises and keeps his audience guessing. The dramatic lighting, camera angles, and suspenseful music make Psycho one of his best.<br/><br/>If you have seen the 1998 version of this film, it does not do Hitchcock's 1960's version justice. The camera angles and lighting are much better in the 1960 version and keep the audience in suspense throughout. The newer version has dead zones, and the suspense is broken up. The coloring in the later film does not give the audience the feeling of standing in the scene watching what is going on. The acting in the newer film is extremely poor and boring.<br/><br/>The 1960's original screenplay, Psycho is almost guaranteed to make you hang onto your chair throughout the movie, even if you are viewing a movie on a cell phone. I would not recommend watching this film alone for sure.<br/><br/>Reference: Hitchcock, A. (Director),(1960) Psycho (Motion Picture)."

","Part of me wishes I could have watched this version in color (is there even a version with color? I'm not sure), but it's great without it. This movie does such a great job at leading you on, and just smiling at you once you hit a dead in (such as when you think the girl is the first protagonist, when she's really not). The plot twist at the end was certainly uncalled for, and I enjoyed that a lot. The movie tries to make you connect towards some of the characters, mostly with the son, and I almost went with it. Almost. My favorite scene, probably along with most other people, was the shower scene. Very well done, and I loved the movement, the expression, the sound, it was all working. Crisp and clear, this movie has become one of my favorites in the horror-thriller genre."
"jferraro3","9","2","3","8 December 2014"," Psycho
","This is a wonderfully made horror classic that laid the ground work for the slasher movies of our time, which have become so common. This film is filled with creepy in-harmonic sounds that we have becomes so used to in horror and suspenseful films. The build up in the suspenseful scenes really have feeling uncomfortable. Hitchcock knows how to get his viewers on the edge of their seat and we see that in full effect in this masterpiece. This film is one of the greatest written story lines and has such a fantastic dialog. This is an art that has been completely lost in our modern genre of ""horror"". Character's seem to have no depth and the killing takes priority over the plot in our more recent slasher type films. Psycho has done so much for the genre of horror. Horror movies need to step up their game because this film set a crazy high standard in 1960 that may not have been toped."
"jsaunders8","Null","2","3","4 December 2014"," Psycho (1960)
","This is a classic horror film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. When talking about Hitchcock, people most refer his directing towards this film.<br/><br/>This is a black and white, which stars Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates), Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) and Vera Miles (Lila Crane). The movie itself is an icon for all other horror movies. The house on the hill can be recognized by all, and when questioned, you'll hear a response- the house from ""Psycho"" You basically have a woman who's on the run for stealing money from her boss (Marion Crane). A motel owner, who has psychological issues (Norman Bates)and a woman who is in search of her missing sibling (Lila Crane).<br/><br/>In a nutshell you have a man who commits murders, while dressed up as a woman. However if you never saw the film, you would suspect that it was a woman...and would point fingers at Norman Bates mother.. however that is not the case."
"Geeky Randy","10","2","3","25 October 2014"," Geeky Randy's summary
","Ahead of its time for its content, unconventional story structure, false protagonist and the presence of a toilet, Hitchcock's genius direction and Herrmann's chilling score is still gripping as many people today as it did in 1960. Janet Leigh is graciously brilliant in her role as an ordinary woman who is suddenly on the run for making a spur-of-the-moment snatch of $40,000 ($318,875.14 when adjusted for inflation), and Anthony Perkins is without a doubt equally memorable as the underwhelming, well-mannered, codependent manager of the Bates Motel. One has a fair argument at accusing the final sequence of telling-not-showing, but why pry at it when every scene before it meets the definition of perfection? <br/><br/>**** (out of four)"
"mtckoch","10","2","3","29 August 2014"," Hitchcock's thriller masterpiece
","As such a famous film, Psycho has stayed in people's awareness for fifty four years for good reason. The haunting score, chilling atmosphere, and grisly murders struck a chord and created the horror genre of film. For 1960, it deals with then-scandalous matters like domestic abuse, voyeurism, and ""split personality"" very well. Everyone remembers the shower scene, but what has always chilled me is the venomously possessive mother-child relationship. Mrs. Bates berates her son mercilessly, showing a sadistic pleasure in emotionally torturing him. So well before murder rears its fatal head, we knew something evil was happening in that lonely house on the hill. Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates perfectly as the young man with darkness behind his odd, shy manner. Janet Leigh was excellent as Marian. Yes, this film is as good as they say. If you one horror/psychological thriller film, see this one, the absolute best."
"skybrick736","9","2","3","24 August 2014"," Psycho
","I think it can be safe to say Psycho is Alfred Hitchcocks most notorious film and for great reason. He had a gift of such pristine direction and writing that will suck the viewer into the movie like I'm virtually watching the events happen. Janet Leigh's character rules, a strong women already, but just completely tail spins into situation after situation that digs herself deeper and deeper. It's at the Bates Motel were the consequence of her mistakes plays out, which then focuses the movie on Norman Bates played by Anthony Perkins. Perkins role of momma's boy with insecurity issues was played to a tee. Terrific acting, writing, dialog, pacing and memorable scenes all take place in Psycho. In my heart of hearts I feel Psycho may just have been the most meaningful movie to the horror genre."
"Justin765","10","2","3","26 June 2014"," A Masterpiece
","Is Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho a masterpiece? In short yes, and is one movie to define a genre for decades. <br/><br/>Psycho is the story of a young woman running from a bad decision. The film begins with Marion Crane stealing forty thousand dollars from her employer. On the run from a team of private investigators she comes across the Bates Motel, a hotel in the middle of nowhere ran by Norman Bates. Norman lives alone with only his mother, a mentally disturbed woman. This simple story will progress into one of the most thrilling films of the twentieth century. <br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock directs this terrifying tale with expertise; no detail is left to wonder with all credit due to this monumental director. The script is also top notch with every scene feeling unique and engrossing. I have to say there is one scene in particular that will forever haunt my imagination. To compliment the excellent direction is solid performances by all of the actors, the standout being Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. <br/><br/>This masterpiece of the cinema is in every way phenomenal, it will leave you terrified to take a shower and in awe of the plots complexity."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","2","3","16 May 2014"," The original slasher villain
","There's a lot to say about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). For one thing, it would not have lit the fuse to the explosion of other unique slasher villains that everyone comes to know and enjoy at the movies. As crazy as this idea was back in the day, Hitchcock was able to push the boundaries of suspense and create a legend that practically no one can forget. Thankfully everything here is put together in such a way that it amounts to a very clever, creepy and disturbing movie.<br/><br/>The story is about a girl named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is given a huge sum of money and is expected to deposit in the bank. However, she becomes greedy and decides to run off with it. While on her escape, she decides to rest at an old motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). There she learns that Norman is under the strict rule of his mother and that he's a slight bit unsettling. However, she doesn't realize how unsettling Norman really is. Co-starring Perkins and Leigh are several other veteran actors like Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and John McIntire.<br/><br/>The writing is based off of Robert Bloch's work of the same name. Bloch himself had based it off of the disturbing real story of Ed Gein of Plainfield Wisconsin in 1957. What's great though is that Hitchcock kept everything identical to the book. Every scene that is depicted gives momentum to the plot and helps make the tension that much more gripping. The best actor here is Anthony Perkins. Not only are his reactions real but also feel genuine. For example, when telling a lie and then being found out, he tries to cover his tracks. He is able to do so but speaks nervously. <br/><br/>As for the year, 1960 had some graphic violence come into play. Not enough to shock anyone, but creative enough to let the audiences' imagination run wild. Also, just because the film is in black and white doesn't mean for any viewer who doesn't like the ""old"" films, can't be entertained either. With the simplicity of color, there are other things for the viewer to watch and notice. Having only black and white actually simplifies the viewing experience for the audience. Accompanying that is Bernard Herrmann's all string score, with one of the most iconic tunes taking place in a shower scene. If you want to know where slasher films began, it's here.<br/><br/>Norman Bates is the original slasher villain. Audiences will be clinging to the disturbing story, the acting is great and the music is memorable."
"mikerwasd","10","2","3","8 May 2014"," A Hitchcock Masterpiece
","Psycho is the thriller film to compare all other horror/thrillers. It has literally everything you could possibly look for in a thriller. Suspense, a phenomenal soundtrack, glorious cinematography, shocking twists, it has it all. <br/><br/>Each scene in Psycho was created masterfully, from the into graphic to the ending dramatic monologue. To name a few aspects, the cop scene portrayed Hitchcock's fear of cops excellently, the shower scene terrified, and still terrifies it's viewers, and the iconic violins in the musical scores are simply flawless.<br/><br/>Psycho is a cinema classic. Anyone who (somehow) hasn't seen Psycho should watch it immediately. Even if you don't enjoy horror films, Psycho is still worth seeing simply because it is a flawless film."
"Bcrosier1674","10","2","3","8 May 2014"," Hitchcock At His Best
","Alfred Hitchcock delivered a masterpiece with Psycho. The mystique surrounding the film has become almost legendary, if only for the ultimate plot twist at the end of the film. Anthony Perkins, as the one and only Norman Bates, gives an incredible performance of an unfortunately troubled young man, and makes you feel truly sorry for he has endured in his life. Of course, the shower scene has to be addressed, but the music and the events are two special entities. The music, however, is what I feel gives an extra sense of suspense to the already startling moment. This film proves that Alfred Hitchcock was truly an innovator in directing films, and has left behind a legacy that will maybe never be approached again."
"m-visker","9","2","3","5 May 2014"," Psycho 1960
","Psycho is a one of a kind, the fact that there is even a remake of this movie is comical, and the remake compared to the original is laughable. Hitchcock's Psycho is intriguing and suspenseful, however I wouldn't personally call Psycho a scary movie, but it definitely leaves you with an uneasy feeling by the end of the movie. Hitchcock is known for many things, one being his use of McGuffins. A McGuffin is when a movie has an item or piece of information that seems to be important to the story but really has no meaning, it is used for suspense. In Psycho the McGuffin would definitely be the envelope of money, in the start we believe that the whole movie is going to surround Marion Crane and how she will get away with the stolen money. But Hitchcock then throws us off track when our main lead is killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. I liked this aspect of the movie; I found it interesting to spend so much time on the plot only to completely change it, something I personally have never experienced before. Of course many people know the famous shower scene in Psycho, when Marion Crane is murdered. This scene is used as a great example of the use of quick shots, being that this short scene has so many shots, and the shots themselves are so strategically framed. Not once is there any nudity or gore, never do we see the knife cut Marion, but instead we are almost forced to visualize the violence in our own heads, filling in the blank. Psycho is a classic Hitchcockian film; it really shows and illustrates his style and like most of his movies, is very entertaining."
"NBates1","10","2","3","4 May 2014"," Easily the best
","This film belongs with those movies that are set aside from others; those that will never be forgotten. Its impact is overwhelming and its immortality is inevitable. <br/><br/>It is simply Hitchcock's best, as it is different from his previous films (which were all excellent) in suspense. <br/><br/>It is more quiet, more gritty and is set in a remote area in the US. This horror film has meaning and underneath the gore and horror there is something deep and poetic; unlike today's films that are filled with blood, gore and not much more. The idea itself sends chills down your spine.<br/><br/>The performances are fabulous. A crime was committed in not awarding the Best Actor Oscar to Anthony Perkins, who gave a breathtaking and blood-curdling performance that grew to become iconic. Janet Leigh was magnificent as well. <br/><br/>Hitchcock's incomparable directing and story-telling abilities made this film what it is , and the technical effects also help build up the suspense. Who can forget the infamous shower scene and its impact on film-making and suspense movies, where (in my opinion), the finest editing was ever performed in film. I actually believed that the knife was penetrating Marion's body.<br/><br/>The famous score by Bernard Herrmann tripled the movie's impact and was absolutely phenomenal, from the quiet suspenseful opening shot to the romantic theme, to the stolen money and the running away, and finally to the motel, where a quiet and creepy theme takes over, and then, of course, the shrieking violins of the murder sequences of the big reveal at the end. All of these factors helped in making PSYCHO one of the greatest movies ever made.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I generally find the oldest movies are overrated just because they are ""classics"" but this truly is a classic. It may be slower than most modern movies today, although you really follow the plot, and feel the evil and insanity that lies within Norman Bates. The only problem I found with this movie was it had a little bit of a slow start. Once the movie gets rolling though it becomes a suspenseful thriller filled with memorable scenes, some you may have seen with out even watching the movie. The movie contains a great sequel 22 years later that holds up just as good as the first. You will feel like this was the first real horror movie ever made (although it's actually not) This truly is a timeless classic.

","Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to ""torture porn"". <br/><br/>Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. <br/><br/>Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film."

","One would expect little from a film like this. In it, a psychopath murders people. It's pretty much as simple as that. There's back-story, of course, and the characters are three-dimensional, but otherwise, this is the typical thriller. However, it sets the standards for all thrillers to come after it. The exaggerated murder scenes and the music are two of the most copied horror techniques I have ever seen, and they originated in this film, and only in this film are they artistic. What sets this film apart from others in its genre is the fact that it is not all massacre. There's more suspense than anything else; impending doom. The murderer is not even the central character. A series of strokes of bad judgment from Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), the character who really stokes the fires, sparks a sinister chain of events. The people this chain of events involves are performed in such a way that they are real people thrust into a frightening situation, all strung together by the dark, confused thoughts of the title character, of the psycho. Interesting and masterful. Ten out of ten."
"claptonisgod53","10","2","3","29 June 2008"," ""We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes...""
","Psycho takes a lot of credit for starting the modern horror genre. Well, I must say that it deserves it. Before Psycho, censorship was extremely strict. Psycho broke a lot of rules in its day... not only did it go above and beyond with its famous murder sequences, but it also went above and beyond with smaller censorship rules. Psycho was the first American film where the audience could clearly see a flushing toilet in full frame. Psycho was also the first film to show a women walking around in her under-garments for an extended period of time. If Psycho had not come around, it could very well be possible that the idea of Jason stabbing a teenage couple having sex would have been frowned upon by the censorship boards. Psycho changed the way movies where made, which is what opened up the idea of the slasher film, and the horror genre in general.<br/><br/>There had been horror films before Psycho, but none broke all of the rules that Psycho had. All the rules that Psycho broke became rules that everyone broke. For this reason, there have been too many Psycho rip-offs to count. Scream, Friday the 13th, Saw, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, and even Black Christmas are all pure rip-offs of Psycho's success. This could very well be Psycho's only con, and it isn't even the film's fault. Now don't get me wrong, Halloween and Friday the 13th are good films, but if you are at all interested in horror/suspense, you have to view the movie that set new standards for the genre when it was released in 1960. <br/><br/>Today, in 2008, Psycho doesn't seem nearly as well done as it was when it was released. However, it is just as good as it used to be. The only reason it doesn't seem good is because of one thing... publicity. AFI, Youtube, Google... It's all the same. Surly everyone alive today has seen the shower scene somewhere, whether or not they have seen the movie. I had personally seen certain scenes before viewing the film itself, so a large amount of the impact was lost for me. Psycho still left a chill on my back, and worked very well. If you are one of the lucky few who haven't seen clips of Psyhco, I highly encourage that you do not search for any. Search out the movie itself. <br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is purely remarkable. The cast is extremely remarkable. Anthony Perkins is extremely amazing in his role as Norman Bates. Perkin's performance isn't only Oscar-Worthy, it is also one of the greatest performances of all time. It is up there with Anthony Hopkins' role as Hannibal Lector in my book. Janet Leight and Vera Miles are also very good actresses, and fit the role of heroine in Psycho very well. The acting in Psycho doesn't seem dated at all.<br/><br/>The suspense is also spectacular in Psycho. Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant directing and Bennard Herrman's chilling score work together to build up atmosphere and suspense for the film. This is done extremely well. Psycho may very well be one of the most suspenseful movies of all time. Another thing that helps with the amount of atmopshere of the movie is how real it looks and feels. Everything in this movie seems realistic to the viewer. You can relate to the people in the film, especially with the way the characters are developed.<br/><br/>Psycho may very well be the flawless movie. It has everything to not only make it a great horror film, but a great film as well. Any horror fan should check out Psycho, simply because it set so many new levels in the genre. Any film fan in general should check out Psycho is well, simply because it is so well made. Psycho is a must view for everyone. <br/><br/>A lot of the movies from the 50s and 60s seem very cheesy by today's standards of computer animation and slang talk. However, Psycho still fits in with the classics. This is because Alfred Hitchcock directed his movies for the audience, not for the critics. This is obviously why the critics responded terribly to it. There were very few positive reviews for Psycho by all of the huge film critics, yet it still ranks as the 21st greatest film ever made on the IMDb top list. Hitchcock was able to not only make this movie well, but he was also able to make it enjoyable.<br/><br/>Psycho still ranks in with the HORROR classics as well. Perhaps this is due the way it inspired so many films to come after it. This may also be due the fact that Psycho plays with all of the fears that thrilled audiences just as much today as it did in 1960; The thrill of running from the police; The fear of run-down motels; The fear of strangers; The feel of taking showers alone; and of course: The fear of our mother's rage.<br/><br/>For more horror film reviews, check out my channel on youtube: horrorreviews123"
"barnabyrudge","10","2","3","31 March 2008"," A master-class in screen suspense.
","Arguably the most legendary film of all time, Psycho is a disorientating and thoroughly absorbing thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. The film has, to some extent, been hurt by years of imitation and variation. but taken strictly on its own terms it is one of the finest examples of a director manipulating his audience into the exact state of mind that he wants them.<br/><br/>In Phoenix, Arizona, bored real-estate secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is having an affair with a man called Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but fears the relationship will never work out because he is reluctant to leave his wife. She is entrusted by her boss to take $40,000 to a deposit box in the local bank, but Marion senses an opportunity to carve a better life for herself and takes off with the money. She travels towards San Francisco, but en route finds herself in a ferocious thunderstorm. Marion checks into a motel for the night  the seemingly innocuous Bates Motel. Here she is befriended by the shy and nervous proprietor Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who lives in a huge, run-down house overlooking the motel shacks and seems to be very much under the constant scrutiny of his domineering mother. Later that night, while taking a shower, Marion is brutally murdered by a shadowy knife-wielding killer. Norman blames the crime on his mother and in a state of distress hides the body. Later, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam, aided by private eye Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), start searching for the missing woman. The trail leads eventually to Bates Motel, and an unexpected discovery concerning the truth about Norman's mother.<br/><br/>Psycho is an example of pure cinema  Hitchcock doesn't merely follow a singular narrative, but employs every trick in the book (plus a few new ones invented specifically for the film) to extract maximum suspense. For forty minutes or so, the film seems to be a film about a confused woman running away with some money that isn't hers. But the brutal murder - of what we perceive to be the main character - is a masterstroke of audience disorientation. Once the film's biggest star, and the character we have up to that point followed, has been killed how can we feel safe and secure about anything that is to come? The shower scene itself is incredibly powerful  Hitchcock turns us, the audience, into voyeurs. It's hard to believe that there isn't a single shot of the knife actually making contact with Marion's body  via brilliant editing and sound effects we are actually convinced that we have seen all that happen, but most of the horror exists in the viewer's mind. Bernard Herrman's strings-only score is quite marvellous and adds additional suspense to an already thrilling film. And the acting is simply superb, with Perkins the obvious stand-out as the complex and enigmatic Norman Bates. The film has been written about, celebrated and analyzed so much that some of its novelty has been slightly diminished.. but for anyone who has the slightest interest in the mechanics of a ""real"" thriller, this is the ultimate experience."

","This movie is what I consider to be one of the biggest movie milestones ever.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock is truly a genius and this film alone is proof. Who knew this film would still be such a success almost 50 years later? This was a low-budget film, filmed in black and white when there was clearly color available. But the black and white makes it extra eerie. Also, the music and dark tone of the movie makes you on the edge of your seat. There are lots of small things that make the mood. Like Marion's lingerie is white in one scene but black during a much more eerie scene. The storyline is fairly simple but in 1960 was very original. Nowadays, every wannabe movie has the same idea but this is the movie it all originated from. The kills are very VERY memorable. Particularly the first one. Even 50 years later they are remembered. <br/><br/>I must say, this movie shocked me more than many other much more recent horror films, not to say none others scared me but I will go so far as to say Psycho is scarier than much of the crap we see nowadays, like The Ring or The Grudge.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to...everyone. You cannot call yourself a movie lover if you do not see Psycho! Watch the original, not the crappy 90's version! This movie deserves a 10/10."

","I was first introduced to Psycho when I was parts of it on TV, I was about 6 when the shower scene came on, I closed my eyes, and stayed there, hugging my father, tapping my years, it was truly scary. But what actually scared me, wasn't the fact that the killer murders someone in the bath, but the music. The screaming violin tune is one of the, if not, the most famous tune ever, which was copied to other films such as ""Carrie"" and ""The Amityville Horror"".<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins does a great job of the motel owner - Norman Bates. He seems sympathetic, a nice young man, but being tormented by his sick mother, who always stands seating there, staring from the bedroom window of the ""Psycho house"" is also a great shot.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh is great in this movie too, when she's running away from the police, you really can feel her fear, and it seems as she's also driving to madness!<br/><br/>This great Hitchcock film, while, in the future, many other horror films will be forgotten, will stand up, and will remain known as one of the greatest films ever made!"

","Definitely a major classic! This film by Hitchcock is for sure one of the major classics of all times in movies' history. The argument is very good, the plot is well constructed and if we forget about the dated production we really have a great film.<br/><br/>It's a mystery-horror story that grabs you until the end. Of course that I already knew the final twist even before watch it (because of this film being so fairly known), so it wasn't really a surprise; but I guess that if I was seeing it for the very first time without knowing anything about the movie it would be different I bet I would be surprised! <br/><br/>Anyway, the story is good, the characters are quite known (who didn't heard about ""Norman Bates""?!), the acting is fine and the soundtrack is a classic! Fantastic! Those string sounds are effective to create suspense! <br/><br/>There's no doubt that this movie is ""the father"" of the modern horror!

"HelloTexas11","10","2","3","30 December 2007"," Hitchcock's best
","'Psycho' has long been a favorite of mine, though for a long time I was unable to explain exactly why. It wasn't a horror film, at least not in the way I generally thought of them; there's no monster and there are no supernatural aspects. It fits more into the murder mystery category. But it has the feel of a horror film and of course today is usually regarded as such; in fact, many regard it as the best horror film ever made. Alfred Hitchcock, it seems to me, knew exactly what he wanted 'Psycho' to be and didn't worry about categories. An aura of desperate fear and paranoia permeates the film from start to finish, enveloping all the main characters. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane, in particular, is the very picture of someone on the edge, constantly looking over her shoulder, always afraid of being discovered. Her character is all the more believable because Marion Crane seems like the last person one would expect to behave as she does, stealing $40,000 from the office she works at so that her lover (John Gavin) can pay off his debts and they can be together. It is a rash act for a woman who initially seems like your typical office worker, leading a humdrum existence except for the stolen moments she shares with her lover. But she acts on her dream because she is desperate, and desperation drives her. 'Psycho' is atypical in many ways. For one thing, Crane, who is clearly the focal point of the film, is killed fairly early on. The emphasis then shifts to Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), his mother, and other characters who are trying to determine Crane's whereabouts. Bates seems to acquire Crane's mantle of paranoia, at first certain no one will ever come looking for her and even if they do, will never discover that his 'mother' killed her. Seeming a quirky but harmless momma's boy in his early scenes, Bates is slowly revealed to be insane- the 'psycho' of the title. Shot in black and white on a modest budget, 'Psycho' didn't seem to be anything special upon release. Most critics were less than impressed. But audiences certainly took to it, making it one of Hitchcock's most successful films; it grossed $32,000,000 (a huge sum at the time) and subsequent re-issues and television showings added to that figure. And since then, its reputation has grown with each passing year, with reams of film criticism devoted to it and dissecting it. Regardless of the category one wishes to fit it in, horror/thriller/mystery/crime drama, it has long since passed needing such labels, now simply regarded as Hitchcock's most well-known work, possibly his best, one that regularly makes all kinds of cinema 'top ten' lists for best film ever. Bernard Herrmann is easily as crucial to the movie's success as any of the actors; his music score has become irrevocably linked to key moments in 'Psycho,' the shrieking violins almost a trademark. The infamous 'shower scene' has become a part of pop culture history, discussed and parodied countless times. And Anthony Perkins will rightfully be remembered always as Norman Bates, forever reminding us that ""a boy's best friend is his mother."""
"icfarm","10","2","3","10 July 2007"," ""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly . . . . ""
","In the opening, scene, rather risqué for its time, Marion Crane (beautiful Janet Leigh) and boyfriend Sam are about to end a lunchtime rendez-vous in a no-tell motel. After the bra-and-slip clad Leigh does some final cuddling with her shirtless man (didn't I tell you, risqué?)we learn that she is tired of being his lover ""on the down-low"", as we would say today, and is getting anxious for him to make an honest woman out of her (in other words, marriage). But Sam is in tight financial times due to his ex-wife and doesn't want to marry Marion when he can't offer her a very comfortable lifestyle.<br/><br/>Shortly after returning to her office, Marion is trusted with $40,000.00 cash given to her boss by a client, which she is supposed to deposit at his bank for him. After getting permission to leave the office early . . . well, she has the money there in her car with her, she and her man need it to start a real life together . . . you see where this is going. Marion is by no means a thief by nature or a hardened person, but this is more temptation than she can withstand. She heads to Phoenix to her boyfriend, imagining all kinds of conversations in her mind: Her man's reaction when he sees her unexpectedly, her boss's reaction when he realizes that both she and the money he had given her are missing, not to mention the irate client "" . . . I'll track her down, never you doubt it. I'll get that money, and if any of it's missing, I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh."" Yikes! But Marion is in for a change of plan. You see, she's pulled off onto a back road and ended up at the Bates Motel, where she meets its proprietor, Norman, and (sort of) his Mother . . . .<br/><br/>What can I say? Simply one of the most genuinely scary films ever made and perhaps Hitchock's masterpiece. The shower scene is a classic example of ""what you don't see is scarier than what you do"". And Bernard Hermann's music? Please. The man was brilliant.<br/><br/>Perhaps what chilled me the most, though, is the final shot. The look on the great Anthony Perkins' face is absolute genius. And, as another reviewer pointed out, if you look carefully, you'll see Mother's skull superimposed over her son's face before the final shot of Marion's car being pulled from the swamp.<br/><br/>With all due respect to the equally great Sir Anthony Hopkins and his brilliant performance as Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates should have been named the greatest villain of all time.<br/><br/>A final note - AVOID the remake. Nothing is on par with the original movie and the director added a couple of unnecessary and gratuitous touches (in the motel scene, Sam is completely nude, and in the ""peeping"" scene, Norman masturbates as he secretly watches Marion get undressed before taking her fateful shower - did we need to see THAT to understand that Marion had become the object of his repressed desire? I don't think so). The original, however, is a MUST SEE, whether you are a horror aficionado or not. Best watched on Halloween night, but friggin' creepy any day of the year. Cheers."
"marissas75","9","2","3","18 February 2007"," A horror film that I actually admire
","More so than with most films, it's impossible to watch ""Psycho"" these days in the same way that its original audience saw it, unaware of the shocks that lay in store. We all know what happens to poor Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) when she makes the fateful decision to stay at the deserted Bates Motel; maybe also the psychotic pathology of the motel's young proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). ""Psycho"" is widely regarded as the granddaddy of today's horror films featuring outlandish serial killers, after all. For this reason, though I'm a Hitchcock fan, I avoided ""Psycho,"" as straight-out horror is not my favorite genre. It's not that I get nightmares, it's that I dislike cruelty or exploitativeness. Fortunately, when I got around to watching the movie, I found it very impressive, and not at all gleefully bloodthirsty.<br/><br/>For ""Psycho,"" unlike a cheap blood-and-gore flick, actually has a philosophy of life to go along with all its horror. In the world of the film, sin, such as Marion's stealing her boss's money, will always be punished. And the long conversation between Norman and Marion over dinner (very well acted by Perkins and Leigh) probes some pretty serious psychological depths. ""We're all caught in our private traps,"" says Norman, and the movie illustrates how first Marion, then Norman, gets trapped. What's most shocking about Norman is how pitiable he is, especially when compared with the villains/killers of other horror movies.<br/><br/>Even though ""Psycho"" was made on a relatively low budget, having Hitchcock behind the camera makes for lots of subtly effective shots, images, motifs, etc. He orchestrates two frightening death scenes (I won't spoil it, but there's another, less famous killing that is just as effective as Marion's), a suspenseful beginning that fools you into thinking that Marion is the protagonist, and a quietly chilling conclusion. Bernard Herrmann's score really is as good as everyone says, and not only the shrieking violins during the famous shower scene. In particular I liked the scene where Marion is debating whether to steal the money, and the music mirrors her indecisiveness.<br/><br/>I was very impressed by ""Psycho,"" but I'm not sure if it'll ever be one of my favorite Hitchcocks. There's at least one serious flaw: the lengthy scene where a psychiatrist over- explains Norman's psychoses, which is much too prosaic. Also, this is mainly a personal preference, but I tend to like Hitchcock better when he's indulging his love for working with iconic movie stars in glamorous scenarios. Still, I now have a new favorite horror film whereas before, I didn't have a favorite horror film at all."
"jamiecostelo58","10","2","3","15 January 2007"," THE horror film!
","Psycho is THE ultimate horror movie. What a brilliantly told story and equally powerful acting from all concerned. This movie details the aspects of shock and the macabre to chilling effect, and surely scared the wits out of cinema-goers back in 1960! Of course back then, a gruesome murder wasn't really seen on film before, not such a gruesome killing anyway, but it's highly common today. Hitchcock delivers a heart-stopping, gripping movie which doesn't let down for a single second. It's much better that the film was released in black and white; had it had been in colour, the fear and suspense may have been lost to some effect.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh portrayed Marion Crane with wonderful agility, but we all know the real star of the show was (and is) Anthony Perkins. Norman Bates is probably the most twisted and scariest characters in the history of film, and Perkins delivers the vulnerabilities we see in Bates to stunning effect. I have huge respect for Vera Miles, and she was also well cast as Marion's concerned sister, Lila. A shame she has retired from the acting world...<br/><br/>The suspense to Psycho starts right from the word go, what with the extremely haunting music to the opening titles, which continues in certain scenes throughout the film. An equally powerful and shocking ending too...<br/><br/>Psycho is simply the ultimate horror movie, it hasn't been bettered, and cannot be bettered. The gruesome 'shower scene' featured not one violent shot - just illusion. But boy what illusion! Terrific, brilliant, excellent, superb, I can't go on enough!"
"classicsoncall","9","2","3","13 January 2007"," ""My hobby is stuffing things...""
","Chances are that if you go into this movie cold without knowing anything about it (I know, that's almost impossible), you'll be about a half hour into the picture and wondering what the title might be all about. Sure Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) seems highly erratic when questioned by the patrolman, but hardly psychotic. It's not until director Hitchcock suddenly pulls the rug out from under the forty thousand dollar robbery setup, and Marion falls victim to the frenzy of a slashing knife accompanied by the now historic soundtrack that's been indelibly identified with ""Psycho"", that we get the idea that this is not your standard mystery.<br/><br/>This is a classic and historic movie, the first on many levels to create a new kind of horror film. Hitchcock was a master of thrills and suspense without ever relying on violence. Here he allows a slight departure from that formula, but without overemphasizing the gore. When the naked Marion Crane is attacked in a shower, completely helpless, it was the birth of a new genre, which unfortunately has degraded into the sensationalist slasher schlock of present day. In ""Psycho"", you never see it coming, except for that shadowed figure behind the shower curtain, but by then it's too late to gasp, you're caught up in the on screen event, and it leaves you breathless.<br/><br/>Some viewers call it a perfect film. I don't know if I would go that far, as I've thought about things I might have changed in telling the story. When Marion leaves the used car lot under scrutiny of the highway patrolman, it makes you wonder why he didn't follow up his instinct that there was something fishy going on. Then at the end of the film, the way the psychologist explained in detail the nature of Norman Bates' psychosis, made it seem like it wasn't enough to let the viewer arrive at a conclusion for oneself. But those nitpicks aside, one has to give credit to the principals for pulling off a great psychological and horror thriller. Anthony Perkins couldn't have been smoother, and it's not until at least a second viewing that you realize how wonderful a set up you have to the film's dire outcome. Sitting there talking to Marion among his menagerie of stuffed birds, Norman Bates gives a subtle hint as to the horror about to unfold - ""You know what I think..., I think that..., we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out...""<br/><br/>Watch this one alone..., at night..., in the dark."
"itamarscomix","10","2","3","6 July 2006"," She couldn't even hurt a fly
","Psycho remains the greatest thriller ever made. I consider it Alfred Hitchcock's last great film (apologies to all Birds lovers out there  I'm sorry, but in Hitchcock's standards that movie really was mediocre at best) as well as the best he had made, and the one in which the efforts of terrific films like Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest finally culminated into one timeless masterpiece. Hitchcock knew what most of today's directors of thrillers and horror movies have forgotten  how to build up tension and sympathy for his characters. In no film did he do it better than in Psycho. And so, even if it doesn't seem half as violent and horrific as it did four and a half decades ago, and even if the shower scene isn't as convincing as we'd like to remember, it's still one of the scariest and most effective thrillers ever made.<br/><br/>Psycho was clearly years ahead of its time, and it laid the groundwork for modern thrillers from Taxi Driver and The Conversation to Fight Club, Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Other than the fact that it's a perfectly constructed film, from the opening titles (by the great master Saul Bass) and the wonderful music (by the irreplaceable Richard Herrmann) which compliments and build the tension and horror to perfection; to the editing, the subtle dialog and the construction of each scene and each shot  Psycho stood out for the focus Hitchcock put for the first time on the villain character, to whom the heroes  Janet Leigh as the victim, John Gavin as her lover, Vera Miles as her sister, and of course the great Martin Balsam as the investigating detective  all take second place.<br/><br/>Norman Bates is not only a lifetime performance for the great Anthony Perkins; he is the single greatest creation in the entire Hitchcock catalog, and one of the most fascinating villain characters in film history. It may be remembered that in Hitchcock's previous films  Rear Window in particular springs to mind  the 'madman' or villain character was the most unsatisfying and undeveloped element of the film. The murderer's motives are tackled here head on, and in this way it foreshadows many of the greatest thrillers of the 70's, 80's and 90's. Psycho is not about discovering the identity of the killer  that much can be figured out by any viewer from the first time Norman Bates is on screen. It's about exploring Bates's mind and psych; his dialog is written to perfection and Perkins's performance goes without a hitch.<br/><br/>The only scene I still have problems with is the one in which Simon Oakland appears as a psychiatrist to explain to us Bates's motives and his story, thus spelling out what it seems an observant viewer can figure out for himself. Still, maybe viewers in 1960 weren't as immersed in psychological thrillers as we are today and so needed the explanation. This scene  anticlimactic and slightly too long  aside, the finale is still one of the most memorable and chilling in film history, and in my mind more impressive that the famed shower scene, making the entire film an unforgettable experience and one of the most effective ever made. Psycho is an essentiality to any cinema lover."
"laika-lives","10","2","3","14 May 2006"," Janet Leigh - Hiding In Plain Sight
","There's very little to be said about this most analysed and rewatched of films that hasn't been said multiple times before, but I'd like to draw attention to a great performance that, I think, has been unjustly and perversely neglected. Whilst most commentators (rightly) praise Anthony Perkins for his astonishingly nuanced performance, many overlook the subtler, more measured work done by Janet Leigh.<br/><br/>At first, it seems paradoxical that Leigh could be overlooked in what is certainly her most famous role (one of the most famous roles in American cinema, in truth), but it is that very fame that causes people to overlook the actual quality of the work she is doing. After all, the part of Marion Crane is seen almost entirely in relation to the plot's structure - the heroine who is killed half way through the film, and leaves us and the camera somewhat stranded in the Bates Motel, where we begin to follow the story of Norman Bates. It doesn't help that her death scene is probably the most iconic film sequence yet recorded (the Odessa Steps sequence in 'Battleship Potempkin' doesn't have the pop culture cache, trust me). Who notices the actress when Hitchcock's structural and technical experimentation come together with such incendiary force? And yet Leigh is extraordinary, giving what might be the performance of her career. She'd proved herself a winning comedienne and musical star in the fifties, but often seemed to be left on the sidelines - as in the enjoyable 'Scaramouche' and the turgid, tacky 'Black Shield of Falworth' (which nevertheless shows her at her most beautiful - the improbably gorgeous black gown she wears in one scene is the epitome of 'devastating'). Of the three dark thrillers she made in the late fifties and early sixties, she would be excellent in what amounts to three scenes in 'The Manchurian Candidate', and had been perfectly cast but arguably peripheral to the story in 'Touch of Evil'. In 'Psycho', she disappears after forty minutes, but for once gets to hold the screen absolutely in the time she does have.<br/><br/>It's a precise performance that shows no strain. She's controlled, immaculate, yet also believably sexual. Mores were changing, and 'Psycho' was at the forefront. There's something oddly shocking about seeing Leigh in her underwear (it would have been taboo under the Hayes code only a short while before), let alone in the shower, but Leigh betrays no discomfort. It's all done so casually, it barely seems as though anything new is being done.<br/><br/>What's striking about 'Psycho' on repeat viewings is how melancholy it is. It may be the saddest film the Master ever made ('Vertigo' is bleak in a different way; it has the structure of Tragedy. 'The Wrong Man', meanwhile, has a forced happy ending). A large part of this is down to Leigh, who has to make us care about this woman in a short space of time. She succeeds, but she also succeeds in drawing out the kinkiness and oddness of Marion - the smile she gives when she imagines what is being said about her, for instance, before it gives way to worry and even fear (I've always thought that Leigh was rather wasted as good girls and would have made a great femme fatale - those big eyes and heart-shaped face are perfect - and as Marion she plays on a lot of the qualities that would have made her ideal).<br/><br/>A small word here for Vera Miles here, too. Her role is more restricted, but her brittle, guarded performance is another overlooked gem, probably because she isn't warm or sympathetic. Her character is flinty and highly competent, Marion's more respectable counterpart. Their performances resonate with each other astoundingly well given that they don't share any screen time - they really are believable sisters, despite not looking that much alike. Lila Crane is, in many ways, Hitchcock's most straightforward, unkinky heroine. She's also one of his most uncompromising, not brooking argument from Sam Loomis or the Sheriff. Only Arboghast ruffles her. She penetrates to the heart of the mystery with ruthless efficiency. And in a film well known for its ironic one liners, my favourite is Lila's 'I can handle a sick old woman', which works differently depending on whether you know the secret of the film or not (she can't handle that sick old woman - but actually, it isn't a sick old woman at all)."

The music is shrill, obsessive.<br/><br/>We float in through the window on two lovers breaking up. A tailing police cruiser drifts out of the rear glass while we watch the girl watching her mirror. The camera floats out of the girl's dead eye, pulls back on her face frozen in fear, it swings around, pulls in on the newspaper, then swings away to the haunted madhouse on the hill. It levitates up the staircase, focuses on the 'conversation' in the next room, backs away and upwards and views the hallway straight down, all in one movement...a more impressive minute than the entire contents of many other movies.<br/><br/>Required film school viewing, absolutely. But also for us more casual viewers, this is a key movie we all need for understanding where visual vocabularies come from. <br/><br/>The later borrowings from this are uncountable. The most literal borrowing from the shower scene is in the ""Raging Bull"" Lamotta/Robinson bout, matching the cuts from angle to angle and in the same rhythm.<br/><br/>Brilliant vision and music, medium story and acting, though Perkins made every tic and stutter count."

","Being an avid movie fan, I have seen too many motion pictures to even bother trying to count. I love all types: drama, comedy, action, sci-fi, foreign and horror. But I would have to say that my favorite genre is suspense. Something about thrilling audiences without the use of special effects, and creating realistic settings which cause a sense of dread for the audience. And nobody, in my opinion, accomplished this with a greater sense of style, polish, and dignity than Alfred Hitchcock. His films are full of great dialog, well-rounded characters, and genuine and original shocks.<br/><br/>Of all of his films, my favorite would have to be ""Psycho"". This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.<br/><br/>What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.<br/><br/>One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off. See it for the first time (and even a tenth) and enjoy a master director at the peak of his craft."

","Alfred Hitchcock guarded the plot of PSYCHO against publicity, and in 1960 audiences came to the film without being able to anticipate the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. More than forty years later, the movie's fame is such that even those who have not seen it are often able to sketch the basic outline of the story in a few words. This demonstrates the film's fame; what demonstrates it quality, however, is the fact that even those who know the plot before seeing it are seldom disappointed.<br/><br/>Very loosely based on Robert Bloch's pulp novel, which was itself very loosely based on killer Ed Gein, PSYCHO presents us with the tale of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)--who, in a moment of madness, steals forty-thousand dollars. Running scared, Marion checks into the out-of-the-way Bates Motel. And there, as production notes for the recent DVD release gracefully state, she becomes the most grossly inconvenienced hotel guest in cinema history.<br/><br/>The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a deluge of low budget and badly made films that commanded box office business via tawdry subject matter, and according to lore director Alfred Hitchcock was curious to see what might happen if he himself made such a film--but made it well. Working with a remarkable script and gifted cast and crew, the result was a masterpiece. Although it is often described as a horror film, PSYCHO is less horror than it is a study in paranoia and suspense, and certainly a lesson in the fact that one need not bother with graphic gore or big budgets to impress audiences.<br/><br/>Much of the film's success is in its detail. Joseph Stephano's script is memorable for its repetition of verbal motifs and its extremely disquieting tone; Bernard Herrman's famous all-strings score builds tremendously upon it. The simple yet meticulous sets communicate building unease, and the strangely flat, semi-documentary black and white cinematography has a voyeuristic edge that is extremely disturbing.<br/><br/>There are elements that can be justly criticized--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about. But in the end, this is the film for which Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin will forever be remembered... and one of the several films that will forever be associated with one of the twentieth century's most masterful directors.<br/><br/>Gary F.

","'Psycho' is Alfred Hitchcock's true masterpiece.  Every frame of this movie is intentional, and as a film student, I highly recommend it to any person who is interested in directing or simply in viewing movies as art instead of entertainment.  Hidden within every moment, every camera angle is a metaphor or foreshadowing of what is to come.<br/><br/>The unusual plot structure (I will not go into details, I do not want to spoil anything) is just another reason why this movie merits at least one viewing.  The acting by Anthony Perkins is stunning, bone-chilling, unforgettable.  This movie scared me half to death, and the surprise ending shocked me; there is nothing predictable about 'Psycho'.<br/><br/>And whatever you do - do NOT compare it to the sequels or remakes.  This is a masterpiece as it stands ALONE.  Still, despite those unfortunate rip-offs, 'Psycho' is a classic - and for good reason."
"ShanghaichickS","10","2","3","20 February 2004"," FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","For being known as the `Master of suspense' Hitchcock is definitely successful to fulfill the title he has been given. Psycho wasn't exactly a horrifying experience, however for its time is was quit a spooky film. The techniques used for lighting, camera angle, and music are absolutely phenomenal and very powerful.<br/><br/>	For example in one scene of this film, the main character is driving her car and the camera is angled at her face head on. The lighting outside of the car is gloomy and somewhat dark, and the music was extremely intense. The entire mood and atmosphere of this scene made everyone migrate to the edge of their seat, and their knuckles white from gripping their arm rests.<br/><br/><br/><br/>	Also very powerful, and wise, was the symbolism that Hitchcock used throughout this film. For example in the beginning we see the main character sleeping with a man in her hotel room. She is clothes with a white skirt, and a white bra. A few scenes later, after she has commited a robbery, she is back in her hotel room wearing a black skirt and a black bra. The fact that she has just commited a sin, and is now dressed in black, is a great example of powerful symolism. <br/><br/>	The camera work was most definetly phenomenal. Part of the movie takes place in or at a hotel complex, and the house that the owner lives out is at the top of a little hill right behind the hotel. The house looks incredibly frightening but the angle that the camera shoots at makes it even more scary, and definetly gives you the chills. <br/><br/>
	I do not wish to get into any more detail regarding this film, because I don't want to spoil it for the viewer. However, I would definitely suggest watching psycho.

"Infofreak","Null","2","3","6 March 2003"," A modern suspense classic and one of the most influential movies of all time.
","'Psycho' is one of the most famous and talked about suspense movies ever made. In fact it has been copied, ripped off and parodied so many times it's often easy to underrate it, but every time I watch it it really works for me. No matter how many times you view it you will notice something new, some shot or bit of business that impresses. Of course there's hardly a movie fan on the planet who doesn't know the major twists in the plot (like the original 'Planet Of The Apes' even people who have never seen it know what's going to happen), but that doesn't really matter, there's more than enough going on here to enjoy. Hitchcock's direction is masterful, and the movie has been hugely influential. Not just obvious films like William Castle's 'Homicidal' or Brian De Palma's 'Sisters' (and let's not even mention Gus Van Sant's misguided remake of some years back!), but Italian giallo and the whole slasher sub-genre wouldn't be the same without 'Psycho'. Even film makers outside the horror/suspense field have been influenced by it, Quentin Tarantino for example. One very famous shot in 'Psycho' is deliberately quoted in 'Pulp Fiction'. The cast of 'Psycho' are all very good, particularly Janet Leigh ('Touch Of Evil') and Vera Miles ('The Searchers') as the Crane sisters, and Martin Balsam ('Cape Fear') as Detective Arbogast. The real stand out performance is by the late Anthony Perkins ('The Trial') as Norman Bates. He is absolutely superb and surely deserved an Oscar. 'Psycho' is one of THE great American movies and should be watched and enjoyed by any movie fan. Hitchcock made many outstanding films, but 'Psycho' must rank with the best of them. A classic movie that has stood the test of time, I don't doubt that it will influence generations of film makers to come."

"Hitchcoc","10","2","3","5 October 2001"," Tight and Terrifying
","When Hitchcock tells a tale, he engages the mind of the audience. We don't need to see knives tearing into flesh, people being strangled on the screen, or gunshots ripping through a brain. And still, when we are finished, we are more uncomfortable than had we watched the actual murder. In Psycho, it's all about vulnerability. Janet Leigh is in a state of great agitation and needs to trust someone. Unfortunately it is the master taxidermist, Anthony Perkins. His Norman Bates, with his nervous tics, his analytical surmises, his understatement, are master-pieces of madness. This film is what every student should see. It is montage; it is tautness; it is the best kind of storytelling. <br/><br/>The things which were still with me a month after seeing this for the first time were as follows:<br/><br/>1. The house. That ominous house, peering down, Poe-like from the hill above the motel. How can architecture better capture threat.<br/><br/>2. The scene with the patrolman.<br/><br/>3. The conversation Norman when Marion first stops at the motel.<br/><br/>4. The shower scene. I can still hear the theramin (used again at the end), and the blood flowing down the shower drain.<br/><br/>5. The killing of Martin Balsam on the stairs (he also used this perspective in Vertigo and Topaz).<br/><br/>6. The ""conversations"" with Mother.<br/><br/>7. The naked light bulb swinging as the rocker turns around and Norman coming into the basement.<br/><br/>What a great director. He saw everything and knew how to fill every minute with suspense. A truly masterly film."

","Hitchcock does his best work when his stories allow for twists and turns. The ability for a filmmaker to kill off his lead halfway through the movie is something I have not seen in a film ever.

","How to begin talking about Psycho... It was the first movie to show a toilet! Beginning with the toilet, like many things in this movie the showing of a toilet showed the boldness's Alfred Hitchcock was willing to do when making this movie. Psycho may have been rated R but even as an R rated movie this movie when above and beyond any horror movie that had been made before it. The usage of black an white color in order to by pass restrictions on showing blood was a great idea that added so much to this movie. Of course how can you discuss this movie without talking about the infamous shower scene? Originally the shower murder was going to be completely without music, however what has become one of the most parodied movie scenes in movie history was most likely thanks to the inclusion of the ere and creepy music played during this scene. The shower murder itself was very bold like much of the movie, while nothing to revealing is shown, we do see and believe Janet Leigh is full blown naked while being realistically stabbed. Where this movie slows down a little is the explanation scene at the end which was a little awkward, long and boring. Psycho is very interesting movie worth seeing, this movie did so many firsts which overtime has really payed off as Psycho is one of the most well known and beloved movies."

","""Psycho"", in my humble opinion, is the best of Director Alfred Hitchcock's films. It has everything that you would want in a thriller love making, theft, fear, murder tension and unexpected twists. It's divided into three parts, the theft of the $40K, the aftermath of the first murder and the solution of the crime.<br/><br/>Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary to a real estate agent George Lowry (Vaughn Taylor). Marion has been meeting boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) for some ""afternoon delight"". They are unable to marry due to Loomis large alimony payments. Lowry has been selling a home to Tom Cassidy (Frank Albertson) and the two have been out celebrating the sale. Cassidy insists on paying the $40K sale price in cash and brings the money to the office.<br/><br/>Marion is asked to take the cash to the bank, She asks for the rst of the day off and decides to yield to temptation and flees with the money. She heads for the California town of Fairview (I think) the home of Loomis and his hardware store. On the way Marion pulls over to the side of the road to rest.<br/><br/>The next morning a Highway Patrol Officer (Mort Mills) in sinister reflective sun glasses questions her. He becomes suspicious of her nervousness. In the next town, Marion pulls into a used car lot and trades her car in. The salesman Charlie (John Anderson) is curious as to why she is in such a hurry. The Highway Patrolman pulls up opposite the car lot and unnerves Marion.<br/><br/>Marion proceeds on her way and gets caught up in a rain storm. Only miles away from her destination, she pulls off the road into an out of the way motel...""The Bates Motel"" There she is greeted by a personable Norman Bates who checks her into her room. Norman offers to make a snack for Marion. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother. When Norman returns, Marion tries to talk the momma's boy Norman into leaving the abusive old lady. He refuses. However in telling each other their troubles, Marion sees the error of her theft and plans to return the money the next day.<br/><br/>Marion with a clear conscience, decides to take a relaxing shower when a shadowy figure creeps into the bathroom and unexpectedly murders her. Norman back at the house on the hill, sees blood on his mother mnad rushes to Marion's room. He is shocked at what he finds but decides to protect his mother nad cleans up the crime scene. He places Marion's body in her car and sinks it in a bog behind the motel.<br/><br/>A week later, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) arrives at Sam's store trailed by private investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam). They both are concerned over Marion's disappearance and feel that she is hiding somewhere in town. They soon realize that something more serious has occurred. They go to local sheriff Al Chambers (John McIntyre) for help. They explain the situation. He informs them that Norman's mother has evidently been dead these past ten years.<br/><br/>Arbogast, hired by Lowry, checks all the local hotels for a trace of Marion and ultimately arrives at the Bates Motel. He becomes suspicious of the nervous Norman and decides that he will try to interview Norman's mother. As he goes up the staircase in the house he receives a big surprise.<br/><br/>When Arbogast fails to return, Lila and Sam decide to visit the Bates Motel themselves. They immediately become suspicious. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house in search of Mrs. Bates. Norman overpowers Sam and races to his mother's aid. Lila is searching the creepy old house and descends into the basement when Norman returns. What she finds is the answer to Norman's secret.<br/><br/>I envy anyone seeing ""Psycho"" for the first time and experiencing the shocks provided by Mr. Hitchcock for the first time. I mean, how in how many films is the leading lady murdered early in the story?<br/><br/>The performances are universally great with Perkins standing out. Leigh and Miles give strong feminine interpretations to their roles. The film is populated with top character actors of the day. In addition to those already mentioned, we have Simon Oakland as the psychiatrist who explains all, Lurene Tuttle as Mrs. Chambers and Pat Hitchcock as Marion's co-worker. And watch for Alfred Hitchcock's cameo at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>And the score by Bernard Hermann............WOW! It's just like another character in the movie.<br/><br/>Followed by two sequels and a TV movie over twenty years later."

","A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and while on the run encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.<br/><br/>This is probably Hitchcock's most famous movie- memorable for being creepy as hell, shot in black and white long after colour films became the norm, one notoriously violent sequence, and two great plot twists that you probably know by now because they've been referenced so many times. Watching Psycho without knowing anything about it would probably be one of the most amazing cinematic experiences ever, so in a way it's kind of a pity that certain scenes have become so iconic and so well-known. Check this film out anyway, regardless of whether or not you know the twists. The suspense isn't constant, and the films' two very distinct halves don't necessarily gel together well, but this is still must-see cinema, and also one of Hitchcock's best. 8/10"
"j-howard-91663","10","1","1","22 April 2020"," Psycho Analysis
","Cinematography and lighting of the film are well done; because of the angle of the camera and shadows cast by the light, it's hard to tell that Norman is the murderer dressed up as his mother. In the two murder scenes, you can only make out the female hairstyle and feminine clothing of an older woman, making the audience assume that Norman's mom is the murderer.<br/><br/>The use of non-diegetic music throughout the movie adds immersion and suspense to what's happening in the scene. An example of this was when Arbogast was murdered in the house, for the last few minutes of that scene, suspenseful music was played, adding into the build-up. All of a sudden, the music becomes loud and intense, similarly to the action in the scene. It's even used to share the emotional energy of characters to the audience. This is felt when Marion is trying to leave the city with the money she's stolen. You can feel the rush of anxiety that Marion is experiencing as she locked eyes with her boss. This moment along with the fast and loud music playing, expresses the ""oh no"" moment Marion is having."

I think this film has quality cinematography. The sound effects used, really added to the spooky vibe this film gives off. This film has many camera angels, short shots, and clean transitions. The editing and directing was outstanding. Throughout this film I felt like I was on the edge of my seat and had an eerie feeling. ""Psycho"" makes me think twice before staying at a motel. This film uses psychological and physical aspects to make this film original and thrilling. I really enjoy the plot line, and I think the characters really made this film feel realistic. Also, I really enjoy the television show ""Bates Motel"" that was inspired by this film. I would recommend this film to people who love horror films. It is really good, and entertaining."

","Last night we did The Birds, tonight it's Psycho. I always think of these two being connected, it must be because I discovered them close to one another as they've nothing in common. Psycho has that edge that The Birds doesn't really bother with, largely I suspect because of the shower scene and the abundance of stabby stuff. It's a much smaller cast and simpler in its aesthetic, also black and white. I adore the black and white though, I can't imagine it in colour, one of the many reasons the remake was unwatchable. It starts of course with Saul Bass' cool tiles, maybe only rivalled by North by Northwest in Hitchcock films. Saul Bass is a genius. I'll admit I'd forgotten quite a lot of the early scenes, the scary policeman, the voice over exposition as Marion Crane leaves the city in her car, on the run with her ill gotten gains. It's all about the motel and the house though isn't it, but as we get there that fateful stormy night and as much as I love the shower scene, it's Arbogast's interrogation of Norman that always felt more of a pivotal scene, as Norman gets caught in his lie and his (or his mother's) crime begins to unravel. The tension built with the noir P.I. and his death scene on the stairs I always thought was cooler than the shower... although credit to the shower, Tomasini's cutting is superb. I'd forgotten also quite how much happens away from the Bates Motel with Marion's sister and boyfriend trying to find her and the money she stole, but again this all just helps to make the pacing work as well as it does. Psycho always feels dumbed down to Janet Leigh's famous demise and Bernard Herrmann's groundbreaking score, but there's so much more going on and I love Anthony Perkins' performance. Hitchcock characters can often feel a bit flat, all surface, the lights are on, but Perkins as Norman is genuinely creepy and nails pretty much every scene... apart from maybe that last one as he bursts into the basement with his mum's frock on. Psycho is far from Hitch at his best, but it's still a gripping watch. It had my first time viewing partner switching from ""It's not that scary"" in the shower, to ""Oh my God, don't go in the basement!!"" for Mother's big corpse reveal. Not shocking by today's standards sadly, but every bit the timeless classic."

","What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.<br/><br/>You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.<br/><br/>Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.<br/><br/>He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.<br/><br/>If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.<br/><br/>It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.<br/><br/>Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.<br/><br/>Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready."
"krational66","7","1","1","7 April 2020"," A model of parallel montage shooting
","From the perspective of a thriller, suspense and horror movie, psycho is definitely a success, at least in my eyes.
The plot of the bathroom murder in psycho has long been a classic scene in film history, which was later called the model of using parallel montage. In the entire murder scene, although there is not even a picture of a knife inserted into the body, but through the use of montage techniques, the audience is still scared, to bring the audience a naked thriller. 45 seconds, 78 shots, knife, human body, sprinkler head, curtain, lower water hole, repeatedly switch between the murderer and the murdered quickly, the knife stabbed at the body of the different positions of the group, coupled with the switch between the water in the sprinkler head and the curtain, lower water hole, produced a kind of thriller effect the director is eager to get. As Hitchcock put it: ""the most intense thing is not the disgusting way people die, but the atmosphere that simmers before they die.""
Made up entirely of close-ups and close-ups, the murder scene is fast, fast-paced and powerful, creating an impressive sense of terror and excitement. It's worth noting that there is no dialogue in this scene, only action, expressed on the screen in cinematic language. It is therefore horrifying, frightening and exciting, which is completely conveyed to the audience by the tension and information of the images."

","""Psycho"" is a masterpiece of both filmmaking and storytelling, and it's also probably one of the most influential films ever made (no hyperbole needed). While Alfred Hitchcock's career is stuffed to the gills with thrilling, horrific stories (""Frenzy"", ""The Birds"") and intriguing mysteries (""Vertigo"", ""Rope""), this film is sort of the best of both worlds; it starts off as one thing and morphs into something entirely different. ""Psycho"" has some of the best subversions of expectations I've seen brought to screen, and that's only looking at this movie from a storytelling standpoint; from a filmmaking standpoint, this film is a technical marvel, and that infamous shower scene is to this day being touted as one of the best edited minutes of cinema history (if you've got the time, check out the documentary ""78/52""- about the seventy-eight setups and fifty-two cuts used in the scene). This is my personal favorite of Hitch's films, and I think it's also the best thing he ever made (sorry ""Vertigo"", ""Notorious"", ""Rear Window"", ""North By Northwest"", and ""Rebecca"")."

","Fed up with life, Phoenix-based secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is entrusted to take an important client's $40,000 to the bank one Friday afternoon. However, Marion sees this as the perfect opportunity to leave her old life behind and start afresh. After driving for a long period of time, Marion decides it's best to get a good night's sleep and checks in to the Bates Motel which is run by mild-mannered Norman and his domineering mother.<br/><br/>I watched this film for the first time a number of years ago and remember being totally blown-away by it. Well it's fair to say that time has mostly being kind to this film as it is still quite an experience.<br/><br/>Hitchcock wasn't called the master of suspense for nothing; of course much of the suspense comes later when we get to the Bates Motel, but there is one scene earlier in the film involving a policeman that achieves this effect with no dialogue (it literally is just a police officer staring at Marion from across the road, but it still managed to be pretty creepy). I also thought the voiceovers of conversations that are taking place in Marion's absence discussing her behaviour, motives etc were an excellent touch. A lot of filmmakers would have cut back to the office or to the car sales yard so we could see these people talking, but seeing it as a voiceover whilst Marion was driving was more suspenseful and tense and was a good move by Hitchcock.<br/><br/>However, it's when the action moves to the Motel when the film really picks up a gear and this is mainly down to the wonderful duo of Hitchcock and Perkins; Hitchcock with his masterful direction in which he leaves a lot to our imagination (I remember the first time I watched this film how much I wanted to see inside the Bates house and how I was on the edge of my seat when Martin Balsam starts to creep up the stairs). However, in front of the camera the film most definitely belongs to Perkins and I think what I liked about his character is that, despite his nature, there is a certain vulnerability about him. Instead of being cool, calm and emotionless when under scrutiny he starts stuttering, mumbling his words, avoiding eye contact etc which are traits your average Joe would exhibit under the same sort of pressure. His nervy performance mean you don't always feel the way you should feel about him. Add to all this the wonderful score by Bernard Herrman and you really do have one hell of a film here.<br/><br/>I originally rated this film with the perfect score when I last watched Psycho (which was before I started writing reviews). However, I had to knock a star off for the psychiatry report at the end - although it helps us gain an understanding of Norman's mind-set it went on for too long and for me tarnished the film slightly.. More so given the memorable ending prior to said psychiatry sequence."

","Psycho is as much a meditation on fear as it is an outright horror film. The master's most well known film is a masterclass in case and character study. With the exception of Halloween, no latter-day horror/thriller has been capable of generating as many goosebumps. The black-and-white photography is perfect for the film's tone and mood - the starkness of color would have blurred the nightmarish quality. The painstaking care with which Hitchcock composed every scene is evident in the quality of the final product. Psycho may not represent the master director's pinnacle, but it is the motion picture for which he is best known, and its legacy is inarguably one of the most far reaching of any film to come out of a Hollywood studio. With Psycho, Hitchcock dabbled in cinematic taboos, pushing the censorship envelope. This is a film that s rightfully considered a benchmark and a milestone of horror."

Hitchcock is a master of not only coming up with a great story, but telling that story perfectly. Hitchcock finds the perfect balance between terror, suspense, and mystery in all his films, and Psycho is certainly no exception. It is no surprise that one of the most iconic scenes in Hollywood history is in this movie. To top it off the acting is phenomenal as well. Often times with films at the time scenes of strong emotion would be excessively dramatic and over the top. However, in psycho, these scenes are not as often, and when they, the over the top dramatization seems appropriate, considering their lives are usually at stake.
If you want to watch a fantastic movie, watch Psycho. If you want to fall asleep tonight, don't watch Psycho"

","Psycho is a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, the suspense and thrill I felt watching this movie was great. This film has great suspense while not going into the horror genre. The editing and camera cuts to different angles really builds the suspense. This music used in the film really deepens the eerie feeling you get while watching. This movie shows Hitchcock at his finest, the shower scene is now iconic and the twists and turns in the plot make this movie unpredictable in the best way."

","A quite famous film known as Psycho is one of the classics made by Alfred Hitchcock that was released in 1960 and is very iconic to many people still today. I can certainly understand why. I personally love watching movies and could watch them ten times over and still not be bored. I truly enjoyed viewing this film and was interested the whole way through. Although, I can admit that certain parts of the film were not as enjoyable, but I think that is just because of the age of the film. I couldn't find much at all to complain about this film. That aside older movies are truly unique because it shows the building block to where we have come today in the movie world. Psycho is an outstanding film because it gave me a variety emotions all throughout it, I found myself irritated, on edge, and truly shocked. While viewing this film I caught myself almost yelling at the TV because of what the characters would do. Ms. Crane is a great example because while she was alive in the movie she seemed to make every single wrong and stupid move possible. For example, when she fell asleep in her car on the side of the road and the officer came up to her window the first thing she does is jolt up and start the car. This instantly makes her look incredibly suspicious, which is the last thing she should be doing considering she just stole 40,000 dollars. In my opinion I think Ms. Crane is so stupid the whole time she is alive, but every thriller needs a victim. This is also her character that Hitchcock gave Janet Leigh to play the role of. Ms. Lane is definitely the protagonist in Psycho because what we can take from the movie as in what she says and does. When I was watching the movie I was on edge waiting to find out what happens next. I couldn't believe that an old black and white film would have me as interested as I was. Ms. Crane goes through pretty much the entire movie struggling with her internal thoughts, which gives the film internal conflict. Hitchcock incorporated this element to convey how guilty Marion felt about taking the money. Even though Psycho is an older film, it's really amazing how it can still capture the attention of a modern day audience. When Norman's ""mother"" was sneaking up on Ms. Crane in the shower I found that to be very suspenseful. Hitchcock did a great job at building suspense for the viewers of Psycho. This movie also really shocked me because I wasn't expecting this old 1960 horror film to be such a great movie. This was the first time I have seen this movie and I really enjoyed it, when at first I was critical. Psycho was a great film in my opinion and I took a lot from this viewing experience. I really enjoyed the movie and all it had to offer. More times than not movies have awful endings, but in this case I actually favored the ending because he was at least caught. To summarize, this film was well worth the watch!"

","No one actor will ever recapture Anthony Perkins performance as Norman Bates. No one director then or after will recapture on film a slasher tale of Hitchcock proportions. One must think how bold a topic mental illness was for 1960. Well, Hitchcock masterfully created an authentic horror story filmed in black and white and entirely iconic using mental illness as the catalyst. So much homage is due to Hitchcock and his 1960 masterpiece, Psycho. No monsters, no supernatural powers just a boy and his bestfriend."

","A masterpiece, and for my money, one of the greatest films of all time. From the moment Hitchcock tells us it's 2:43 pm and Janet Leigh's character skipped even eating her sandwich to spend three hours in carnal bliss with John Gavin's, to that penultimate shot on Anthony Perkins with a twisted smile on his face, it's quite simply one five star scene after another.<br/><br/>The tension never lets up, there is that extraordinary shift from one main character to another mid-film, and there is more than one misdirection that keeps the first-time viewer guessing. The voyeur scene, the abrupt killing of a main character, and the entire concept of the mental condition were all very original in 1960.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic, from Perkins (who should have gotten an Oscar) and Janet Leigh (easily my favorite Hitchcock lead actress) all the way down to that cop who stops for Leigh and then later stares at her so perfectly from across the street while she's with the used car dealer.<br/><br/>There are so many other little moments of tension: Leigh's employer seeing her in her car when he thought she was going home, the car that doesn't sink into the swamp all that easily, and the searches into the ominous old house. There are also those big moments too, a couple of which need to be included in any discussion of the greatest scenes in film history. The other aspects of the film keep up too - the score is brilliant, and Hitchcock gets plenty of great shots, including the one from the underside of Perkins's face while his jaw twitches nervously and many others. It's hard to imagine a better executed film, and this is one that I never get tired of watching."
"ChocolatePrince","9","1","1","11 November 2019"," Psycho
","Psycho is the iconic horror movie that created the slasher genre. This seminal film has influenced everything from Halloween to Scream. It has a great script, great direction by Hitchcock, an iconic score by Bernard Herrmann, and a chilling turn by Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. The only weak link is the exposition dump delivered by the psychiatrist in the last ten minutes of the film I found it totally superfluous. Now I know the monologue was meant to explain Norman Bates's pathology but it comes across as way too expository. I guess audiences back in 1960, needed to have that monologue to understand Norman Bates' psychosis. In today's climate movie goers are far more sophisticated, so I guess that speech was acceptable back in 1960. Anyway I digress, Psycho is a great horror movie that every film fan should check out."

","Since the greatness of such a Director as Alfred Hitchcock can be said endlessly, then I, perhaps, focus my attention on acting. Psycho is definitely a Thriller with a capital letter. It is indisputable that it is quite difficult to judge the films that have passed through time, because of our impregnation with the culture of modern cinema. In addition, many Hitchcock classics may seem quite ordinary black and white picture. This happens to people whose eyes fundamentally do not perceive black and white classics. I must say that they lose a lot. Me same this the film hit immediately.<br/><br/>In General, I tend to evaluate the film, first of all, from the point of view of acting. I would like to highlight Anthony Perkins ' performance. Let me remind you that his hero is a psychopathic killer who lives as a hermit, creating even more fear about his image. It is necessary to pay tribute that such an image of the main characters of horror films, in turn, is often used in modern horror, which, above all, speaks of the classics of this picture. To be honest, the game Perkins hooked me not childishly. So I watched, literally with my mouth open. This eye that draws you to the screen, monotonous and at the same time sharp movements that speak about his unstable psyche of his character and cause a contradictory first impression, the famous smile - all these details, observed by both Hitchcock and Perkins, deserve praise. And what the film's production and acting do together is difficult to describe in words. I am a fan of non-standard acting. Expressiveness and emotionality used by actors is alien to me. Most of all in the game I like realism, when purely individual qualities of the actor help him not to overplay, that is, to adhere to the Golden mean. Perkins, for the most part, manages to intrigue the viewer thanks to his incredible male charm.<br/><br/>As for the work of Vera miles, the role of the weaker sex in A. Hitchcock is, first of all, the embodiment of femininity, which brings its unique charm to the picture, and therefore, speaking about her game it is difficult to find fault or comment on something. Women are an integral part of Hitchcock thrillers, and to me, her acting is no different from that of grace Kelly or Joan Fontaine. In his works, they act on a special pattern-either in danger or in the arms of a man. Thus, women in his films are an integral attribute, but not the basis.<br/><br/>Speaking of the film as a whole-it is certainly a masterpiece. It's all so coherent, clear and while watching there is a strange feeling that you-not the only observer, for the most part, because of the use of unusual angles. And, of course, the saddest thing that makes me think about this kind of classic is that such films are one of a kind and some techniques in modern cinema are no longer used."
"andrewmerritt-31652","10","1","1","4 November 2019"," A horror masterpiece
","Psycho stars Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The story revolves around a Phoenix secretary who is on the run after stealing $40,000 and checks in to the Bates Motel. This is my favorite horror movie and is also Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. I could really feel the passion he took to make this horror masterpiece instead of making a horror-movie-of-the-week. Also I want to point out that making a horror movie, a horror movie doesn't need to be in color all the time. A horror movie can have any color tone and still tell an interesting story, which is where Psycho succeeds, and having the black and white tone to it makes it more dark, ominous, and spooky. I felt that tension all around this movie as every department cranks their category from 0-100, that I was sucked into the world of Psycho. Norman Bates is my favorite serial killer. The reason why he's my favorite serial killer is because unlike most serial killers depicted in horror movies, Norman Bates doesn't try so hard. When we first meet him he's charming, handsome, and he's very friendly, but that scene where he and Marion are having a conversation, he becomes a slightly different person, and that's when we realize that something is not quite right with him. And maybe this is just me, but even though he's a serial killer, I still feel compassionate towards him in some twisted way, that made me believe that he isn't a bad person after all. But what I find genius is that the script tricks us into believing that Marion is the main character, but it isn't until the second act, that we realize that she isn't the main character anymore. Its as if the script department were separated into two categories where one half was responsible for developing Marion's character, while the other half was focused on the events after Marion's death. I know I've posted spoilers about this movie, but this movie is too good to pass up on some spoilers. So in the end, this is my favorite horror movie, and I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the horror genre. Because to me this is the one that started it all and made other horror movies take inspiration."

","""Psycho"" (OV) is a 1960 horror thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock starring Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles. There aren't many old films that are still relevant decades after their release, but if there's one it's definitely this thriller. It's the textbook example of suspense and classic horror and in terms of excellence still unreached. It's known that Hitchcock was way ahead of his time and it really shows. How many other films from the early sixties start with a woman only seen in her bra? Also the shower scene shows a lot of nudity compared to the standards of that time. It really shows how daring the director was in his directorial style. To be honest, it all was for the better. The film may have a longer first act that introduces us to a side character, but simultaneously he tricks us into thinking that Marion Crane is the protagonists and makes her death (one of the best scenes) shocking and gives it even more momentum. But in the context of the whole film the storytelling is absolutely well paced and never loses it's perfectly balanced level. Additionally, the virtuoso score by Bernard Herrmann, probably the epitome of suspense, supports the overall enthralling atmosphere from start to finish, sinks it's teeth into your head and won't let you go until the film has ended. The most notable thing about this film though is Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates. I've never seen such an incredible performance, he perfectly masters every single character trait of his disturbed nature, as he plays both the shy and somehow insecure manger of a motel and the insane and malicious psychopath, with a strange and oedipal relationship towards his mother, with such excellence. To be honest, this is one the best representations I've seen in my entire life that personally inspires me as an aspiring actor. Just the way he manages to dominate a scene for almost 15 minutes without saying a word, only with his mimics and charisma are enough to prove my thesis. Also the final stare into the camera in the end literally gave me goosebumps. Besides this one-man show, the supporting actors still deliver great work nevertheless, but Perkins stole everyone's show. With unusual camera angles the director thoroughly captures the haunting atmosphere of the horrifying story. Next to iconic scenes, the final twist is one of the most magnificent conclusions of all time. All in all, this horror classic is as outstanding as it's claimed. It combines all, a packing plot, a haunting atmosphere and superb actin and in the end, I sat there with tremendous joy and awe. A day later, I still think about how awesome it is. An unforgettable experience of pure excellence that you won't forget. This is one of the many reasons I love my hobby!"

Psycho sets a creepy and often unsettling atmosphere throughout the movie and Alfred Hitchcock shows the audience that he is in full control of his craft. Psycho can feel slow at times but it is definitely worth it and just adds to the tension of the film.

Thing is Marion decides to take the money and drive to her boyfriend in Fairvale. Before she gets there she decides to stop at the Bates Motel for the night. There she meets Norman Bates (amazingly played by Anthony Perkins) and this is where this truly great film gets even better.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh garnered an Oscar nomination for her role which she richly deserved as I thought she does an amazing job really in caring the first half an hour of the film as we follow her and only her. The fact that Anthony Perkins did not even receive an Oscar nomination for his multi-layered in-depth portrayal of Norman Bates is beyond mind-blowing to me.<br/><br/>The music as well by Bernard Hermann is truly one of the greatest not only in the history of horror, but of all-time films. It has been ripped off, attempted to be duplicated a number of times, but when you hear others be inspired by it you can tell exactly where the music is coming from.<br/><br/>Screenplay by Joseph Stefano from a novel (which I have read and did enjoy) by Robert Bloch. Also starring Vera Miles as Marion's sister Lila, Martin Balsam as Arbogast, Simon Oakland as Dr. Richman and look fast for Ted Knight right near the end of the film.<br/><br/>In my all-time list of greatest horror films this masterpiece stands only behind Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING in my mind. There is so much to look at and dissect and go over in your mind. Probably the most influential horror film of all time.<br/><br/>Followed by three sequels (all of which were never equal to the original), a TV movie, a yucky shot-for-shot remake and a TV show."

"CinematicGarbage","9","1","1","8 May 2019"," Still the greatest horror movie today!
","Psycho was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and was released on June 16th 1960. It was such an iconic scene which made Hitchcock known as a master of making such a horror masterpiece. It wasn't just a horror movie, it was also a thriller and a mystery which made us really curious about the crimes. We always wanted to know who commited it, who was the victim and what clues were left behind.
It was about a Phoenix secretary embezzles forty thousand dollars from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. Hitchcock's Studio, Paramount Pictures, wasn't sure enough and disliked the film so they denied him a proper budget and the it was $800,000. The movie was in black and white. They even built a Bates Motel mansion at Universal. Psycho was Hitchcock's best work while he had done some thrillers and horrors like Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963). All of those were one of Hitchcock's greatest works.
Hitchcock also made rules for audiences for watching this film.
""You must see PSYCHO from the very beginning. Therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. We say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager's brother, the President of the United States, or the Queen of England (God bless her)!""
-Alfred Hitchcock-
They were really strict and lucky for me, I'm not a person from the 60s so I can watch whenever I want.
The performances were excellent and I mostly like Anthony Perkin's role of Norman Bates. Perkins was good-looking and that's exactly how Hitchcock wanted it to be just like that so Bates would look like a very likeable person with a charming character and made audiences believe him. They would think about him. Bates even disguised before he kill so that the victims would think it wasn't Bates maybe? He could have not dress because the victims would be dead and they wouldn't know. The way the iconic scene: the shower scene was pretty scary with its noise and when Marion Crane opened her eyes dying made the scene more terrifying and the way she was buried in the swamp was mostly frightening. She was naked and her things were in there. I knew it would be a good idea to bury your victim like that. What a genius! The story was told in a unique way. Even though the movie didn't have much violence, but the mystery were also dreadful and made us worry about what really had happened. It's also a great idea to shoot this movie not in technicolor but still remained black and white. That way would make Psycho a horror masterpiece no one could make like that.
Psycho was really influential, the greatest work of Alfred Hitchcock and also the greatest horror movie and it still deserved that title until today, it's still terrifying and scared a lot of audiences. It's also a combination of horror, terror, violence, mystery and thriller. I would recommend this a must-see for horror fans.<br/><br/>My ratings: 9.7/10"
"alcrpntr7","10","1","1","5 May 2019"," A Descent Into Madness
","Like many Hitchcock films, Psycho plays upon the theme of an emotional mood or effect. Much like Hitchcock's The Birds, the eerie silences create tension and suspense leaving the viewers in anticipation of what might be coming next. Hitchcock further immerses the viewer into a state of suspense with clever editing that accentuates the character's perspective and puts the viewer in the place of the characters on screen.<br/><br/>Psycho follows the story of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and the unfortunate events that follow her meeting of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion Crane works a normal day job in Phoenix, Arizona but is unhappy in her romance with the Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is facing a great deal of debt and doesn't have the financial means to get married. On one normal day at the office, Marion is asked to make a $40,000 cash deposit on her way home from work. Marion decides to pack her suitcase and take the money in hopes that this will allow her and Sam to run away together.<br/><br/>Once on the road, a heavy rainstorm forces Marion to lose her way on the road. She decides to stop at an isolated hotel off the road. Marion checks into the Bates Motel and meets Norman Bates. Norman is a seemingly nice young man who tends to the hotel and his ailing mother who lives in the house just behind the motel. Marion and Norman have a meal together and after hearing Norman's tale and thinking about her own decisions, Marion decides she will return to Phoenix with the money in the morning.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while Marion is taking a shower a shadowy figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Norman runs to the room and discovers Marion's lifeless body lying on the floor. He collects her belongings and with the body, loads them in the trunk of her car and disposes of the vehicle in a local pond. Weeks later, Lila Crane (Vera Miles), Marion's sister, arrives to speak with Sam to determine whether he knows the whereabouts of Marion. The two are approached by Private Investigator Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) who has been hired to return the money to Marion's employer.<br/><br/>Milton Arbogast is convinced that Sam and Lila are unaware of Marion's location and he decides to start checking on all the roadside motels to determine if she stopped anywhere. Milton Arbogast finds his way to the Bates Motel where he meets Norman Bates. After a tense conversation, Milton discovers that Marion had indeed stayed at the motel. He finds a pay phone to let Sam and Lila know that he will be checking in with them, but that he had to check out the hotel again. Milton Arbogast decides to check out the home above the Bates Motel to speak to Norman's mother. As he walks up the staircase, a woman comes out of a room and murders him.<br/><br/>Sam and Lila go to search for the missing Arbogast and arrive at the Bates Motel. They meet Norman and create a ruse for Sam to occupy Norman, while Lila goes to the house to look for Arbogast. Norman figures out what's going on and knocks out Sam. Meanwhile, Lila searches the house and finds nothing. As she hears Norman entering the house, she hides in the basement. In the basement, she finds the corpse of what appears to be Mrs. Bates. As she screams, we see Norman wearing his mother's clothes coming at her with a knife. Sam arrives just in time to stop Norman. The police take Norman into custody, where we find out Norman's mother personality has taken over his mind.<br/><br/>Psycho is an excellent film that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seats. The audience will delve into madness with Norman and make you forever cautious of stopping by a roadside motel."

","""Psycho""- A review of Hitchcock's slick, insight into an alternative psyche.
""Psycho"" is Hitchcock at his finest, the film was realised in 1960 and was met with staggering adversity. However, as the years passed people recognized it as a masterpiece. The plot centres around a women named Marion (Janet Leigh), who embezzles a large sum of cash, in order to run off with her ""star-crossed lover"". However, midway through her excursion she decides to check into a vacancy for the night at the elusive ""Bates' Motel"", run by the reclusive Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).
One of this films aspects that deserves an abundance of acclaim is its spine-chilling and accurate portrayal of a psychopath. Hitchcock masterfully manipulates the mind of the audience into perceiving things which are not actually shown on screen. Primarily in the notorious ""shower scene"".
Hitch's direction is magnificent and seamless, the characters are well established, the film is littered with cleverly thought out and well placed symbolism and to conclude it all a jaw-dropping/disturbing twist, which will haunt you for the rest of the evening.
In conclusion, those looking for a mindless ""slasher"", then ""Psycho"" is not the film for you! ""Psycho"" may be classified as a ""horror"" but in my mind it will always be a ""psychological thriller"". Simply as must see for any film fanatic- It is also my favourite film. It is unsurprisingly a 10/10.

","This is one of the finest horror movies ever made. This is unlike most horror movies out there. Psycho had such an interesting story to tell. The movie had so much suspense. It was so interesting. Everything was literally perfect right from the very beginning. The timing of every scene was beyond perfect. You could tell just how perfectly well everything fell once the movie starts. Norman Bates is the highlight of this film. He's as psycho as you can get, and the amazing thing is that he looks all so innocent. That scene in the shower was pure gold. Whenever people hear, think of this film, I'm sure one of the very first things they can remember is that shower scene with the lady screaming. The other being Norman Bates of course, who is probably one of the greatest movie villains in all of world cinema. This movie is unpredictable, and that's why Psycho was such a great film. I was shocked with the ending. Never for one moment, something like this would happen, and in some ways, I was actually disappointed by it despite being really clever. In other words, mother was terrifying to say the least."

"ferbs54","10","1","1","21 June 2018"," The Modern Horror Era Begins
","It is not every filmmaker who can manage the difficult trick of coming up with four consecutive masterpieces, but that is just what British director Alfred Hitchcock was able to do as the late 1950s segued into the '60s. His 1958 offering, ""Vertigo,"" took time to find its audience but today is recognized by the British Film Institute's ""Sight and Sound"" magazine as the single greatest motion picture ever made; 1959's ""North by Northwest"" is surely one of the all-time great entertainments; 1960's ""Psycho"" practically jump-started the modern-day horror industry all on its own, and remains the director's most well-known film; and 1963's ""The Birds"" is still a baby-boomer favorite to this day. But of those four films, all of which reside on my personal Top 100 Favorite Films list, it is the third, ""Psycho,"" that remains my favorite after all these years, and indeed, I personally feel it is the greatest bit of work that the so-called ""Master of Suspense"" ever gave to an unprepared world. The film was a far cry from its predecessor, ""North by Northwest,"" a big-budget movie that had been shot in lavish wide-screen VistaVision and Technicolor and featured a sweeping, transcontinental story, replete with action and comedy and Cary Grant at his suavest. By contrast, ""Psycho"" was filmed on the cheap, utilizing Hitchcock's crew from his television program ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents""; the entire production was completed in just a few months at a cost of a mere $800,000 or so. But such was the power of the film, and its clever advertising and promotional gimmickry that insisted that no audience member would be allowed admission after the picture had started, that the box office for ""Psycho"" was enormous: around $50 million, a smashing amount of money for the time. And did it ever deserve it!<br/><br/>I generally try to not include spoilers in these little minireviews of mine, but in the case of ""Psycho,"" I will go on the assumption that everyone knows the big reveal that comes at the picture's end, while at the same time endeavoring to be a bit coy, for the sake of those poor unfortunates who have NOT seen this masterpiece. As most of the world seems to know by now, or should, the film shows up what happens when a pretty secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh, in perhaps her finest hour), who works in a Phoenix real estate office, absconds with $40,000 of the company's money and hightails it by car to meet her lover, Sam Loomis (future U.S. ambassador to Mexico John Gavin) in California. Forced to take refuge during a sudden downpour, she stops for the night at the lonely Bates Motel, meets its gawky and awkward proprietor, Norman Bates (Tony Perkins, in the role that made him a star), and is later knifed to death--apparently by Norman's mother--while taking a shower in her room. (This, by the way, was not the first film to depict a woman being attacked while in the shower; indeed, just two years earlier, in the film noir ""Screaming Mimi,"" Anita Ekberg had been attacked in a similar manner, but the difference was, hers was an outdoor shower, with somewhere to escape to, and she was NOT killed during the attack.) Worried by her sister's disappearance, Lila Crane (Vera Miles) arranges to go with Sam to investigate. The two hire a private detective, Milton Arbogast (the great character actor Martin Balsam), to help in their investigations, and the trio eventually tracks Marion's disappearance to the motel, where they discover the grisly secrets that it hides.<br/><br/>A bit of personal history here...and I may be revealing my age a bit by doing so. I am old enough to remember when ""Psycho"" was first released, in June of 1960, although I was just a wee lad at the time. I remember seeing the trailer for the film in a theater, although I did not realize until many years later, when I saw the trailer again as an adult, what it had been. And I remember the effect that this film had on many of the grown-ups in my neighborhood, particularly on one woman, Tika, who would not take a shower again for many months after she first saw it. The picture, of course, was a genuine shocker for film audiences of the era. Never before had a movie star of the magnitude of Janet Leigh been so suddenly killed off...and just 40 minutes into the picture! Today, naturally, anything goes, and any star can be unceremoniously knocked off in any manner. We've pretty much seen it all at this point, what with the advent of slasher flicks and torture porn films, but back in 1960, this kind of thing was brand new. People today just cannot imagine how shocked and stunned the 1960 audiences were at the time; what a sensation this film was. The word of mouth was terrific, leading to the box office figures mentioned above. As a youngster, I took all this in but of course was not allowed to see the film by my parents. It wasn't until I was in my very early teens that ""Psycho"" was first shown on television, and by then, I was more than primed. Thus, having been dared by some friends that I would not have the courage to ever see this film alone, I sat down to do so one night. My parents and sister, for some reason, were not in the house, and I manfully plunked myself down on the floor and watched this celebrated horror legend on my ownsome. After all, I figured, I'd already seen 1959's ""House on Haunted Hill"" any number of times (a good preparation, as it turned out!), and how much scarier than THAT could this picture be? Well, the shower scene of course frightened me, as did the shocking murder of Arbogast on the stairs (one of Hitchcock's greatest set pieces), but it was the final revelation of Mrs. Bates in that damp and musty fruit cellar that really got under my skin. Still, I made it to the end, and breathed a huge sigh of relief; I had made it all the way through, and had something to discuss with my friends. In the intervening 50 years or so, I have watched ""Psycho"" God knows how many more times on both the big screen and small, and it never seems to get old for me. (That, by the way, is the hallmark of all of my Top 100 films; the fact that I can watch them over and over and over with undiminished enjoyment.)<br/><br/>Today, ""Psycho"" manages to hold up very well indeed, despite the fact that we are all aware of the film's secrets and know just when the jump scares are about to pop out. At this point, there is very little to say about the film that has not been said before. It has probably been discussed and analyzed more than any other Hitchcock film, and the books and articles written about it are legion. As a matter of fact, just last year, a new documentary, ""78/52"" (respective references to the number of setups and editing cuts), was released that centered on just the shower scene alone! I could certainly not improve on any of those commentaries, but would especially recommend to those who are interested Danny Peary's very informative article on the film, to be found in his indispensable reference book ""Cult Movies 3."" (It was Peary who first made me realize that the film gives us a woman named Crane who becomes the victim of a man who likes to stuff birds, and how the director makes his audience feel guilty by making us all feel like voyeurs throughout the picture.) The film contains so much to love that it is difficult to know where to begin. But let's start with the wonderful script that Joseph Stefano--who would go on to even greater fame a few years later as producer/writer for the classic TV show ""The Outer Limits""--was able to come up with, based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel. (Interestingly, the Norman Bates character in the novel is something of a big fat slob, on the order of a Victor Buono type; thus, Perkins was a very unlikely choice to play this particular role.) It is a wonderful script, witty and penetrating, that intersperses its shocks at just the right moments, and is perhaps never better than in the telling scene in which Norman and Marion converse in the parlor before she takes her good-night shower. The actors in the film are all marvelous, down to the smallest bit parts, and Hitchcock's manipulation of his audience, and the way he moves and places his camera (as in the spiraling descent into Marion's dead eyeball after the murder, and the overhead shot of Mrs. Bates attacking Arbogast), are by now legendary. Perhaps best of all, though, is Perkins. What a wonderful job he does here! Notice his hips sway as he ascends the stairs in the creepy Victorian mansion that is the Bates home, or the look of fear and then relief on his face as he attempts to sink that corpse-containing car in the nearby swamp. Amazingly, the audience sympathizes with him as he covers up for his homicidal mother, and that is no small feat. And, oh, let's not forget one of the most key elements in the entire film, that sensationally frightening score by the great Bernard Herrmann, composed solely of strings (violins and cellos); surely, one of the most instantly recognizable film scores ever created, and so very influential on future composers for horror pictures. ""Psycho"" was a groundbreaker and a trendsetter in many departments, but here's something that you may not have heard before: It was also the first film that ever showed the inside of a toilet bowl, a fact that caused all manner of uproar among the decency and censorship groups. (Isn't it funny what some people will choose to get upset about?) I could go on forever about this film, but I will leave you with this one fun fact: The shower curtain that I have right now in my bathroom at home is a clear one, and come to think of it, I have been purchasing see-through shower curtains for many decades now. Is this a subconscious effect brought on by this truly remarkable film? Could very well be! After all, if the Bates Motel had featured clear shower curtains in its rooms, Marion Crane might still be alive and well today...."

","When Psycho was first released in the summer of 1960, it became Hitchcock's most profitable and successful movie of all time. It changed the face of movies, and horror, forever. I've seen it so many times on TV as well as on VHS and blu-ray. It's a superior movie to the remake as well as the sequels and two tv series. The title in the movie refers to the psycho killer named Norman Bates (Tony Curtis) who's main target is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who gets killed by a knife set to the loud music of Bernard Hermann and some scary editing. But the movie doesn't end there, as the killer goes to his mom in the famous psycho house and tells what he had did before he gets caught red handed by cops after he kills his brother. In the end, Norman is in a ward, looking at a fly on his hand, before his car gets removed from the muddy lake. The End."

The shower scene movie.<br/><br/>And yet, if that's all you know the movie from, you're missing a lot. The shower scene was scandalous back in its day, much like the rest of the film in general, but it doesn't encapsulate the film all that well. It happens near the middle of the film and a lot happens after it. Sure, it is the most striking scene in the film, but I would personally put more weight on the overall performances of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh as Marion Crane.<br/><br/>With these two powerful actors Hitchcock manages to tell a truly haunting and nerve-wracking story. Because, to be honest, nowadays the movie would be a bit boring and a lot predictable. The viewer is never truly confused as to where the film is going. But in a way that even enhances the experience. Because you can so clearly see why these characters would make these decisions given the amount of information they have.<br/><br/>Add in some masterful camerawork, some really insightful use of surroundings and shadows, the two main actors and a one of the creepiest scores ever produced, and you have a masterful film in your hands.<br/><br/>A must see film for all fans of horror and still a really, really good experience all around, despite its age."
"charbelelaro","10","1","1","4 April 2018"," Groundbreaking
","Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is a crime thriller which follows a woman who unexpectedly steals money from her boss with the intentions of running away with her boyfriend, so they can start a new life together. Although her plan takes drastic turns as she is faced with many unforeseen complications and danger. This film is a clear example as to why Hitchcock is praised as being the master of suspense. Psycho keeps you captivated for the entire runtime. The script manipulates the audience with sharp obscure dialogue. The incredible screenplay is accompanied by oscar worthy performances, particularly by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. His character of Norman Bates is easily one of the most compelling aspects of the film. His peculiar nature makes him such a complex and well established character. The music, cinematography and editing work together beautifully, creating such an uneasy and eerie tone. For its time, Psycho was groundbreaking. It subverted the formulaic structures of the crime genre, as well as pushed boundaries surrounding what was tolerated during its social context. Psycho is still insanely nail biting and truly horrifying. It holds up incredibly well, in terms of entertainment value. But beneath all that it is one of the most well made movies of all time. Psycho is outstanding and that is why I give it a 10."

","Often referred to as the most famous and influential horror film of all time, Psycho broke down all barriers of comfort and escape when going to the pictures. With people fainting and screaming uncontrollably in their seats at the time of release, the film is still as unsettling and nerve-wrecking as it was 50 years ago, and has cemented Alfred Hitchcock as the true master of suspense.<br/><br/>Adapted from the significantly less successful novel from Robert Bloch, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a young attractive woman who has stolen $40,000 from the bank where she works, in order to runaway with her already-married lover. After driving all night in pouring rain, she stops at the Bates motel off the freeway for a night-in, and meets the nervous, bumbling Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is quite taken with her upon first sight. In one of the most staggering sequences in film history, she is stabbed to death while taking a shower, and as she is reported missing and people begin looking for her, the truth of Norman Bates and his 'motel' will be revealed.<br/><br/>Never before had the main character been brutally murdered only halfway through - let alone an attractive leading lady - and never before had such a brutal antagonist been so normal, relatable and above all, human. Beautifully shot in black and white and carried by an unforgettable score from the late Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock in all his genius draws us in with a twisted concoction of sex, murder and madness, never letting us forget even to this day that real horror may be right around the corner. All the performances are top-notch, particularly that of Perkins who as cinema's most unlikely serial killer stumbles through the film with every breath of confidence stripped from him by his overbearing invalid mother."

It also show that we can never know what is hiding in minds of people, even the one we know very good (Not just Norman twisted mind, but Marion Crane's ""betrayal""). Movie has very original story lines, it's not just some ""stereotypical horror movie"" on what are we accustomed when it come to them.

","Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a god tier horror movie and I'd say its probably the best example of classic horror. The story has at this point been told and remixed 1000 different ways over the years but because of Alfred's understanding of human fear and his incredible skill as a director no other film maker can come close to creating as captivating of a psychopath as the infamous Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). I love the symbolism in the very last scene where Norman sits alone in the chair and claims he'd never hurt a fly. Very clever and unorthodox camera angles keep the viewer on the edge of their seat while watching this film especially during the scenes where Norman attacks his victims and the famous shrieking sound effect begins to play. If you have never seen this movie and enjoy horror movies it is definitely worth watching. Even though compared to current film it may seem dated because of the lack of special effects and computer animation the rawness and great use of music and sound effects by Hitchcock make this slasher flick stand the test of time."

","Welcome to the Bates Motel. 12 cabins, 12 vacancies. What are you doing here? Running from the police? Alright, well enjoy your stay and see you in the morning. Or maybe not. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most influential and fiendishly wonderful movie makers of the twentieth century. Before ""Psycho"", I had seen exactly 22 of Hitchcock's pictures. Most of them I enjoyed but none of them were as memorable as this piece of work. It is not just a cinematic accomplishment but also of successfully portraying someone who is indeed psycho. This movie was a shock when released in 1960 because of the way the movie was laid out. For example, it was unthinkable for a main character to be killed so early in the film. The goal was to put the audience on edge to the point where they had no idea what would happen next. And Hitchcock indeed pulled it off. In fact, he was sure to make clear that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie had begun. You must watch it from beginning to end. I am not going to tell you the plot because the less you know, the better. They don't call Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing."
"colm-hearne365","9","1","1","14 November 2012"," Hitchcock's Best Movie Ever!
","Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favourite directors and I've seen a lot of his movies and this is truly his best work. I mean before I saw Psycho, all I really knew about it was the famous shower scene which I saw references to in parodies or cartoons or something like that. But this movie turned out to be one of my all-time favourites even though I'm not that big into horror films.<br/><br/>I like how Hitchcock decided to do the film in black-and-white because it makes it darker and suspenseful. The story starts out somewhat slow, but I like the conversations going on as Marion is driving on the highway, one of the most suspenseful parts of the movie. But the magic really begins when it gets to the Bates Motel. <br/><br/>I'm surprised Anthony Perkins never got an Oscar or even a nomination for his portrayal of Norman Bates, I mean he was born to play that role! I can't imagine any other actor playing him. I mean you can see that there's something suspicious about Norman but you can't figure it out. But he just seems like a nice, friendly person who ""wouldn't even hurt a fly."" And what surprises me even more is that he didn't star in any other well-known movies after Psycho. That just shows how underrated he is as an actor. But I'm glad at least Janet Leigh got a nomination for playing Marion Crane and won a Golden Globe.<br/><br/>The one scene that really freaked me out, and still does, is when Lila Crane discovers Norman Bates's mother's corpse in the fruit cellar, and then Norman comes in dressed as his mother and carrying a knife and revealing that he is the murdering mother. I wasn't expecting that in anyway at all. I can just imagine what people would've thought about that because movies were much tamer back then. This movie makes me afraid of walking in a dark room because I always have the feeling a shadowy figure might pop out and stab me to death. <br/><br/>I've also watched the two Psycho sequels that were made in the 80s and they're good enough to watch but they're nothing compared to the original. But I still think the work well.<br/><br/>Overall this movie has everything that makes a movie a masterpiece: excellent acting, excellent directing, excellent writing, excellent cinematography, excellent suspense and even an excellent twist. It's pretty much perfect in every way. <br/><br/>In conclusion, thank you Alfred Hitchcock for creating this movie and may you rest in peace."

The opening scene was really intimate and interesting because it showed a versatile side of the main character. Some of the camera work was over the top but it is meant to be that way.

","Psycho is a suspense/horror film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano is based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The novel was loosely inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein,who lived just 40 miles from Bloch.<br/><br/>In the 60's,Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense when he released Psycho and forever changed the shape and tone of the screen thriller. From its first scene, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel, Psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint. <br/><br/>The film depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane,hiding at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner and manager, Norman Bates, and the aftermath of their encounter.Marion is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and frustrated in her romance with hardware store manager Sam Loomis. One afternoon, she is given $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank. Minutes later, impulse has taken over and Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her purloined nest egg. 36 hours later, paranoia and exhaustion have started to set in, and Marion decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel, where nervous but personable innkeeper Norman Bates cheerfully mentions that she's the first guest in weeks, before he regales her with curious stories about his mother. <br/><br/>There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, but while the shower scene is justifiably the film's most famous sequence, there are dozens of memorable bits throughout this film.Obviously,it remains a horror classic as it was filmed with tact, grace, and art as well as blends a brutal manipulation of audience identification and an incredibly dense, allusive visual style to create the most morally unsettling film ever made."
"jackhamel1987","10","1","1","30 August 2011"," The original low budget slasher film.
","It's 1960. Alfred Hitchcock had just seen huge success with North by Northwest, and he was considered a master of slow burning, suspense cinema. He could have had any budget he wanted, any cast he wanted - in fact he could have done anything he wanted.<br/><br/>So what did he do? He took a cheap TV crew, a virtually unknown cast and a script that a lot of people weren't keen on and he filmed it. He was the only one sure that it would work - so sure that he traded his standard paycheck for 60% of the net profits (earning him the equivalent of $150 million in today's money).<br/><br/>The result...? The original slasher film that instantly changed the concept of horrors, thrillers and villains. This might not be as complex as Vertigo, or as relevant as Rear Window, but this is the film that changed cinema and paved the way for the likes of The Exorcist, Scream and most other slashers, horrors and thrillers. Hitchcock created a piece of cinema history with this film, and you would be hard pressed to find any film maker since who hasn't at some point used Psycho for reference.<br/><br/>Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a lost woman. She wants to get away from everything - her job, her home, her boyfriend, her life. Her chance comes one afternoon when a rich tycoon leaves $40,000 in cash as a deposit for a house. Instead of taking the money to the bank, Marion steals it and goes on the run. After two days, she finds herself a little lost, but near a motel - The Bates Motel. She meets Norman Bates, a shy man who is looking after his invalid mother. She and Norman have a conversation, where she decides that she should go back home and face up to what she has done. However, that night, she is violently murdered by someone, and this coincides with an investigation into her disappearance - an investigation that leads to the best of Hitchcocks's climaxes.<br/><br/>What makes this film so good? Well, Hitchcock said it best himself ""It wasn't a message that stirred the audiences, nor was it a great performance...they were aroused by pure film."" This film exists only to terrify us, entertain us, move us, thrill us. There is no message, there is no moral lecture. This film is about one director's vision to take an audience on a roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills. And this film does that to perfection. Nearly all of Hitchcock's most memorable action is in this film (the infamous shower scene is just one), and they are handled so incredibly well that even now they can't cease to entertain. The direction is the winner here. The carefully planned shots, the black and white images, the lighting, the shadows - nothing here has been left to chance and everything has been thought out so, so well. Stanley Kubrick is often accredited with the 'Kubrick stare'. Yet it might well be that he took that idea from Hitchcock, who's final shot of Norman Bates is one of the most chilling and unforgettable shots in film.<br/><br/>Of course, whilst this film is brilliant almost exclusively because of Hitchcock's expert direction, we can't forget the cast. Janet Leigh was immortalised in her role as the ill-fated Marion Crane and she does a wonderful job as the woman who is essentially lost in her own life. Martin Balsam adds a touch of class with his portrayal of Arbogast, the private detective. And Vera Miles is strong and effective as Marion's worried sister.<br/><br/>But, this acting in this film is virtually owned by Anthony Perkins as the truly chilling Norman Bates, who is arguably the best villain in film. Every second that he is on screen, you know there is something wrong, you know that this sweet, innocent, shy man is hiding a terrible secret. You're afraid to know what it is, but Perkins uses the screen to tease, to make you want to know more about him even though you know it's horrific. Perkins was so good in the role that it actually typecast him and hindered the rest of his career.<br/><br/>Between Hitchcock's direction and Perkins acting, there is enough horror to last a lifetime. But added to the strong cast, the wonderful plot and the exceptional soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, and what we have here is something that is truly original, truly groundbreaking and remains a huge milestone in cinema.<br/><br/>This is pure cinema at its best. No lectures, no messages. Just action."

"namashi_1","9","1","1","3 August 2011"," A Terrific Film!
","'Psycho' is a Terrific Film, in all respects. It's chilling, it's captivating & it's memorable. Directed by Maverick Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock, this 1960 classic, is indeed time-less!<br/><br/>'Psycho' depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, hiding at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner and manager, Norman Bates, played shockingly by Anthony Perkins, and the aftermath of their encounter. <br/><br/>Adapted from the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' begins with a bang, and ends with some haunted images. Norman Bates is a person, who is described as disturbed & neglected. In my opinion, Norman Bates is a person, who became the animal he was, because he lost his innocence too soon. He wanted to live, but when he thought he couldn't survive anymore, he took up violence to breath. It's a twisted personality, that shocks you & leaves you numb!<br/><br/>Joseph Stefano's Adpated Screenplay is nearly flawless. There is hardly a moment when the film loses it's momentum. Alfred Hitchcock's Direction is spell-binding. The master storyteller directs this psychological thriller, most convincingly. John L. Russell's Cinematography is chilling. Each Frame looks haunted. The Lens-Man has done a masterful job. Editing by George Tomasini, is superb! Art-Direction, is scary!<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, shockingly. What Perkins achieves by playing Norman Bates, is nothing short of an embodiment. Perkins performs as if Norman Bates, was actually waiting for him to play him on celluloid. It's a Hall-Mark Performance, that is above any praise! Janet Leigh is fantastic. Vera Miles, John Gavin & Martin Balsam leave a mark, as well. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Psycho' is much more than it's infamous shower scene. It's a film that leaves you haunted, with it's sheer power!"

","I have only recently saw this movie and before I seen it, I have to admit I was very sceptical. Though, I was very wrong, this has turned out to be one of my favourites movies of all time.<br/><br/>I was told by many that it was a very scary experience though I personally do not find it that ""scary"" I find it more creepy than anything, Anthony Perkins performance as Norman Bates is phenomenal the acting he delivers is incredible, every time he spoke I had a chill run down the back of my spine.<br/><br/>The other performances throughout the movie, are great as well not as good as Anthony but still great. The script was also fantastic, and the camera angles were also perfect there were no over the top moments, they were just right. And finally, the soundtrack to this movie was amazing.<br/><br/>Though there are a couple of complaints I have got and one of them is that there is a couple of scenes which were totally pointless and some of the effects were quite, how shall I put it, 'shabby'.<br/><br/>Overall though this is one of my new favourites I would have to give this a 10/10. Though I still do like The Shining just a little bit more."
"BruceWillisBlows","Null","1","1","14 December 2009"," Psycho
","The 1960 suspense/horror film, ""Psycho"", is yet another Alfred Hitchcock classic. To say i wasn't completely caught up in it would be a lie. The storyline of this film can simply be described as incredible. With all the twists and turns throughout the whole movie, and as the suspense intensely grew, i just sat there in awe. Hitchcock is a master at what he does, and uses lighting and sounds to his advantage. Even though certain elements of his creations aren't very realistic, they seem to become more scary and memorable. The angles he uses are amazing and he has become one of my favorite directors. I give, ""Psycho"" 6 out of 6 chicken nuggets."

","None better than this. It had great setting, background score, cast and acting. There is not a single fault in the movie, except the title which reveals some of the suspense. But still it is one of the best horror/thriller. There aren't many killings in the movie but one single killing should scare you enough of a lifetime.<br/><br/>It just looks like such a simple runaway movie but just explodes suddenly into a real horror movie. The acting was superb from perkins. He just seems at so much ease changing from scared young man to a violent killer. The remaining cast did really well, but they are just so easily outdone by perkins acting. <br/><br/>The background score was excellent, it keeps the thrill during the small amounts of silence in the movie. You can just keep watching it again and again and would still be mesmerised with action every time."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","1","4 July 2009"," when a film can still shock and horrify an audience after nearly fifty years, it deserves to be remembered
","The master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, is a director famous for a great many films. His movies and his passion for the crime of murder cemented into our collective consciousness images of terror and panic that even people who have never seen his movies can identify and pick out. Hitchcock made a stream of remarkable films over the course of his legendary career including the thrill ride ""Rear Window"" (1954) and his ultimate psychological masterpiece ""Vertigo"" (1958), but the film everybody remembers and relates to when discussing Hitchcock is his notorious 1960 box office smash ""Psycho"" and the scene everybody remembers is the one that made many people, including one of its performers, Janet Leigh, think twice before taking a shower again.<br/><br/>""Psycho"", adapted from a novel by Robert Bloch, is the classic story of a woman from Phoenix (Janet Leigh) who in order to marry her financially-stressed lover (John Gavin), embezzles $40,000 dollars from her employer's client and finds herself on the run, fearing and panicking every face that looks in her direction. During her flee more or less from her morals, she checks into a desolate motel run by a handsome but strange young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What follows is the film's infamous ""shower scene"" and a long chain of thrills, frights, and terrifying images that people, to this very day, never forget.<br/><br/>A film can be viewed as a true work of art when it has the same effect on an audience as it did nearly half a decade again. It has been forty-nine years since ""Psycho"" was first released and to this day, it still terrifies and appalls people very much like it did in 1960. To some, such as Walt Disney himself, ""Psycho"" is just too much. It's really the ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) of its day. But to those who can appreciate art and storytelling, this is a motion picture that simply cannot be refused repeated viewings.<br/><br/>The pivotal performance of the film is, without a doubt, Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins. The acting by Perkins is so iconic and so creepy and so off-putting that he really set the standards for slasher villains and frightening characters. It is so ironic that an actor so harmless-looking, so timid-sounding as Perkins could, in an instant, turn himself into the image of a sick, bloodthirsty psychopathic monster. He can become creepy without apparently even making an effort, as though he were in real life as deranged as his character. Perkins' Norman Bates is like the Charles Foster Kane of horror movies. He's been mimicked, but never matched or overpowered. The only real contender for a match is Hannibal Lecter by Anthony Hopkins. Whoever is creepier is up to you, but it's nevertheless a very close match.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" is not a film that is about character development, but it doesn't need to be. In fact, extreme character development would get in the way. Norman Bates is strongly developed, but the other characters are established exceedingly well and then play from that point on. Janet Leigh, in particular, who takes up the first third of the movie almost entirely by herself, gives a great performance even though her character is very simple. Hitchcock used Leigh as a personification of the human fears and sins: guilt, panic, fear, envy, and lust. The film also features a well-cast Martin Balsam as a private investigator who tends to, like Hitchcock felt about some of his producers, get in the way too often without understanding fully what or whom he's dealing with.<br/><br/>And of course, we can't leave out the thrills of the movie. Hitchcock used his techniques of shock, horror, and suspense to their fullest in this film. He uses the two main horror procedures: alerting an audience of an impending threat without telling the character or simply having the scare jump out and ""render you speechless"" as some of the ads for ""Psycho"" claimed the movie would do. And there is certainly more than just the infamous shower scene. It's not just the brutal killings. Again, there's Anthony Perkins in the landmark role of his career, and the black-and-white photography is notably far more effective than if Hitchcock had decided to shoot the movie in color (look at the dismal 1998 shot-by-shot remake for proof) and of course there's Bernard Herrmann's iconic all-string music score that rivets and lunges out at you.<br/><br/>Although it is an intensely frightening film and ends with one of the creepiest final lines of all time, ""Psycho"" is so much more than just a horror story. Apart from the dawn of the slasher genre and a montage of spine-tingling images, it is a work of art done by one of the true geniuses of the cinema: Alfred Hitchcock. And while I don't feel this is his all-time best motion picture, it's certainly his most famous and deservedly so. When a film can shock and terrify an audience nearly fifty years since it was first released and tags an excellent story along with it, it deserves to be remembered."
"tjsdshpnd","10","1","1","16 June 2009"," A Milestone in the Thriller Genre
","Director : Alfred Hitchcock Cast : Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the most popular movie created by the genius Hitchcock, Psycho is a masterpiece from all aspects of film making, be it the plot, screenplay, cinematography, sound and above all direction. It is a very intelligent thriller and keeps the viewer engaged and enthralled until the last frame.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a highway motel and it's caretaker and owner Norman Bates, his sick and somewhat spooky mother, a woman who steals large amount of money from her employer to improve her love life with her boyfriend and who comes to stay at this Bates motel . The proceedings that follow are extremely interesting and enthralls the viewer. We get to see perhaps one of the best murder scenes ever shot in cinematic history, the famous shower murder of the lady who stays in the motel . The protagonist of the movie Norman Bates character has been very well written and performed by the actor concerned as well. Sometimes we as an audience feel pity and sorry for him and after knowing his mental condition, this feeling increases even more.<br/><br/>In short, Psycho is one of the milestones of this particular thriller genre. Many thriller movies either based on this or influenced by this have come in many large numbers, but the charm and the greatness of this particular movie will remain in the minds of cinema lovers for eternity.<br/><br/>Rating : 9/10"
"bobsgrock","10","1","1","31 May 2009"," Without serious rivals as the greatest thriller ever.
","One of the most famous of all films, so much so that people who have never seen it know about the shower scene, or can quote, ""A boy's best friend is his mother."" Yet, Psycho is so much more than ""that scary movie with the shower scene."" In fact, it is not even a horror film by any stretch of the imagination; Hitchcock was too sophisticated for that. This is a mystery thriller, the first part being thriller and the second being mystery.<br/><br/>One of the elements that make this a timeless piece of cinema is the way Hitchcock sets up the back story to the character of Marion Crane and the relationship between her and Norman Bates. From the moment these stories begin, we start to get involved without knowing that Hitchcock is toying with us. I cannot ruin any spoilers, since this is a film to enjoy the first time and then maybe a second time. But, it is important to know that even though this has influenced practically every horror movie since, it is nothing like any of them. Hitchcock shot in black and white to not appear gory and used old-school tricks like music and editing to create images in our mind much scarier than on the screen.<br/><br/>Speaking of music, has there ever been a more perfect score written for a film since this masterful work by Bernard Herrmann? In every scene it is used, it underlies the drama and increases the suspense in a way no modern director could ever do with blood and grotesque imagery.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful, especially Janet Leigh as Marion and Anthony Perkins as Norman. As good as Leigh is in bringing us to her side, Perkins gives arguably one of the greatest performances in all of cinema. The little details, the stuttering, the twitching, the eyes moving all around go unnoticed the first few times. Then, after awhile you notice it and see that he almost completely makes us sympathize with this character. If you've seen this before, you know what an incredible job it is, although it is a shame Perkins never got out from under Bates' shadow. What is even worse is that they made three sequels to this movie, focusing more on Norman and the violence that I am sure ensued. Forget those attempts to capture your attention and be sure to view this masterpiece at least once. That's all it takes before you will look at your mother a little differently."

The owners name is Norman Bates... From here there isn't long until the famous shower-scene, and that's even just the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so great is the tension, the uneasy feeling that something isn't right, present throughout the whole feature. The key-factor in this tension is the soundtrack, one of the greatest ever. One would have to be a psycho like Bates himself to not feel uneasy when listening to ""Murder"" by Bernard Hermann<br/><br/>When I saw the whole movie for the first time last night, I actually knew the story first. Still, because of the immense power of ""Psycho"" i had trouble getting to sleep. I saw Norma Bates in every corner of my room.

"winner55","10","1","1","4 September 2007"," a brilliant puzzle game
","*SPOILER* ""Psycho"" is something of a puzzle game, like the '3 dimensional chess' played in the old Star Trek TV show. When we think the film is moving in one direction, we find it has caught us up from behind on another level.<br/><br/>On one level, the film is about guilt, but not in any way most people think about it. Janet Liegh's hapless victim is actually guilty of a number of old-fashioned sins - illicit sex, theft, lying, sloth, waste, hubris and self-obsession, all of which is soon to be discovered (after the film's end) when her car is dragged from the swamp revealing the stolen money in the trunk along with her body. Of course, the audience knows that she would have repented, had she lived, but nobody in the film will.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins' character, on the other hand, is guilty of - nothing. That's right, not a thing, nada, zip. That's because he's crazy: even his voyeurism is merely a manifestation of his psychosis. This is not simply a rule of Anglo-American law, by the way - it dates back at least to St. Augustine's Civitas Dei and his definitive statement that where the will is absent, there can be no guilt. And one cannot have will when the mind is so wholly disordered, it can no longer discern a choice to be made (that part is Aquinas).<br/><br/>Perkins' psychopath thus becomes mere act of nature to the people he kills. If Leigh's character had decided to drive to a church for confession to a priest, and then suffered a fatal heart-attack at the wheel, the moral sociology of this would have been the same for her, discovered in a car with stolen money and no immediate sign that she repented of her sins.<br/><br/>Does this make ""Psycho"" a heavy lesson in Christian morality? Absolutely not! Because Hitchcock is not playing just the one game, but several. As to the morality, for instance, it would certainly be a heavy message if it weren't so dam'ed obvious that Hitchcock doesn't take it seriously! The Freudian explanation, and Perkins' final dissolution into the persona of the dead mother form a bizarre bit of comic relief, intended to provide quick and easy explanations to any audience needing these.<br/><br/>It may help some viewers to know that Hitchcock said that the only really frightening moment in the film - for him - was the sudden cut to a close up of a state trooper wearing sunglasses when Leigh awakes in her car. Hitchcock was almost paranoid about the police (it actually does show up in a number of films, beginning with ""Blackmail"" from '29). This is one reason his characters frequently seem to have nowhere to turn when they find themselves in legally questionable or suspect situations. And it is this state trooper who first suggests to Leigh that she ought not to sleep in her car but find a bed for the night - which suggestion finally leads to her decision to visit the Bates Motel....<br/><br/>Well, who's guilty now?"
"bw92116","10","1","1","13 July 2007"," The craft of film-making brought to perfection
","There is no finer example of the craft of film-making than ""Psycho."" Every aspect of the production is brilliantly executed, and contributes to the film as a whole, rather than detracting from the whole. The script laden with double meanings, the note-perfect acting, the astonishing camera work and editing, the background music, the sleazy, run-down atmosphere - it all coalesces into one unforgettable excursion through the prurient, dishonest, anxiety-ridden substratum that lies just an inch beneath the supposedly placid, polite surface of American society. Hitchcock masterfully manipulates not only the audience's emotional states but its train of thought as well. The viewer is kept in a subtle state of confusion and bewilderment as to what is actually happening, what is going to happen, and what the characters' true motivations are - while at the same time the story is propelled forward at a brisk and steady pace. Even though I have seen this film all the way through 6 or 7 times, I always find myself irresistibly drawn into it all over again whenever it is shown. This is one of the true masterpieces of cinema, in that it exemplifies masterful film-making in all the disciplines required to produce a great film."

","I recently bought this DVD on Ebay and thought it was a brilliant film. This is my favourite Alfred Hitchcock film. Psycho is one of my favourite movies of the 1960's along with Wait Until Dark, My Fair Lady, Mary Poppins, Two For The Road, The Sound Of Music, Breakfast At Tiffanys, Oliver, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, West Side Story. In my opinion I thought it was more a scarier film than the Audrey Hepburn film Wait Until Dark. Anthony Perkins was great as Norman Bates and I found him scarier than Alan Arkin in Wait Until Dark (not that Alan Arkin wasn't scary in Wait Until Dark). The music playing when Marion (Janet Leigh) got stabbed in the shower was freaky.I found the scene where the detective Arbagast (Martin Balsam) gets killed unexpected."

Truly Hitchcock's greatest ever.<br/><br/>Well it starts off when Marion Crane, an employed woman is given duty by her office to carry $40000 to a place. She sees this as her best opportunity to change life forever and live it up to the most. Like any other cunning human being, Marion steals the money and heads to Phoenix in Arizona. On the way, she is forced to change her car to avoid any suspicions by anybody about the crime she's just committed, as the thought goes through her mind every minute. Somehow managing to exchange her car to a pre-owned one, she carries on when suddenly there is a huge storm and finds no other choice but to stop nearby at Bates Motel near the highway, an isolated place. The owner of the motel, Norman Bates escorts her to her room and even offers to have dinner with him. The two have a long conversation, Norman mostly talking about himself and his dear old mother. Marion listens with interest and finally ends up going back to her room for a shower, where the story begins....<br/><br/>Remarkably the greatest horror or thriller movie ever made, Hitch's best. Like ever, no scene in this movie is imaginable for any first time viewer. Hitch being intelligent ever to make it black and white adds to its brilliance. My all time favorite."
"anna_kouremenos","10","1","1","3 February 2007"," Chilling and totally unpredictable
","This is rightly considered Hitchcock's greatest film. The black and white cinematography, combined with low key lighting in most of the (indoor)scenes, gives the story a mysterious look which is reminiscent of the film noir genre of the 1940s. The film score is at its most powerful in Marion's driving-in-the-rain scene and in the famous shower scene. Anthony Perkins is really perfect as the psychotic killer, having just the right combination of rage, vulnerability, fear, and compulsion. The finale, where the psychologist explains the character of Norman Bates,completes the film very well. All in all, one of the greatest films ever made."

I instinctively knew there was something deeply truthful in this film. Just like ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Disturbing - but absolutely credible.

"LoneWolfAndCub","10","1","1","13 August 2006"," Quite simply my favourite horror film which still manages to scare me!
","Psycho, ever since I first saw it, has stuck with me. It is my favourite horror film and I can confidently say it always will be. Nothing comes close to the sheer thrills and chills Psycho delivers. From Hitchcock's masterful direction to Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins' flawless performances to Bernard Herrmann's unforgettable score, Psycho is the ultimate in real horror.<br/><br/>Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her employer's client and leaves town intent on starting afresh. While on the run she stops by Bate's Motel where she meets the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). They dine and converse for awhile then she returns to her hotel to get ready for bed and make amends for her crime. However, she takes a shower before this during which she is brutally stabbed to death by an unseen assailant. Her absence does not go unnoticed, as her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), and her sister Lila (Vera Miles) begin to question her whereabouts. Also hot on her trail is Detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam).<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho traded the supernatural beings of the genre's past (vampires, werewolves and zombies) for a human monster. The film made Norman Bates a household name in the world of horror and movie villains. Hitchcock does not rely on cheap, hokey scares to terrify his audience, but uses various camera angles and tracking shots to heighten the tension and then, accompanied by Herrmann's shrieking score, lets lose a shocking image. Hitchcock is quite simply, as his common title suggests, the Master of Suspense. He knows how to tap into the movie-viewing public's collective psyche: By making his monster seemingly normal and by blending sex, madness and murder in a sordid tale.<br/><br/>The cast is spot on: Janet Leigh, in one of her more famous roles, is the naÃ¯ve ""leading lady"" who meets her demise in the now infamous shower scene. Anthony Perkins gives a chilling performance as Norman Bates, his deceptive normality which masks his madness could not have been more convincingly done. Vera Miles and John Gavin provide excellent support in the last half, they both had great on-screen chemistry! Herrmann's famous score is arguably the best of any horror movie (it has been parodied and imitated countless times) and Hitchcock's direction is flawless (just look at the ending, which still shocks me to this day)! 5/5"

","This film is no doubt Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film, but it is my belief that this film is the greatest film ever made. What film has given more inspiration to directors down the years. From the opening scene to the brilliant ending no film gives more tension and brilliance than this masterpiece. Its one of those perfect edge of your seat films that's brilliant every time you watch. Like even a scene where Janet Leigh is just driving a car is Scary!! So tense. Its such a great film because it starts of with what you think is a lady (Marion Crane) having an affair with a hardware store owner (Sam Loomis) Marion wants to run away with Sam so she steals some money from a bank she works in and takes of to meet Sam. Whilst on her Journey she has confrontations with a policeman and a car sales-man but nothing could have prepared her for her stay at the Bates motel. A huge mistake. This is where the story totally changes she's murdered in the shower! but who did it? In the words of Mr Hitchcock ""don't give away the ending""."
"QuenyaSpeaker","9","1","1","4 January 2006"," Simply Chilling
","You've never experienced chilling until you watch PSYCHO. Alfred Hitchcock was and is the Master of Suspense. The shower scene is one of the most chilling and blood-stopping scenes of all time (especially for its day). However, the real reason the shower scene was so chilling is because of the music. The music is classic and extremely recognizable. Interesting fact: Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) was originally discouraged by friends and family about taking the role of Marion Crane, saying that because she died the role wouldn't be good for her. Well despite all that negative energy from family and friends, Janet took the role. Now that is her most famous role she ever played. As a matter of fact, few people can name any other film she WAS in besides PSYCHO. <br/><br/>If you like to be scared but don't like all the gore of many now-a-day horror-suspense films, then PSYCHO is a great Film.<br/><br/>*Alexander Smith*"

","There is a before and after of this movie in the history of movies. Hithcook may be the director with more ""new things"" in his time. Is difficult to know how big could be he now in this special effects time. Psycho is a perfect combination of a great director, a great cast and a great script. Perkins makes his best job in this movie. Norman Bates is a legend. A lot of people did not see Psycho but everybody knows who is Norman Bates. The movie has a lot of symbols and the music is the best. Hitch confirms in this movie that good actors and good staff is enough to make a good movie. North by Northwest was excellent, but it cost 3 or 4 times more than Psycho. It is more than a cult film. Psycho is really a masterpiece. Psycho is a movie that you can watch 20 times and every time that you see it, found new elements. Is full of details. The subliminal presence of the mother figure is present in all the movie. The color of the under ware of Marion changes to black after she left the town trying to express that she feels dirty. And the scene of the bath... is maybe the most famous scene in the history... is difficult to perceive after that yo never saw a naked body and never so a knife inside of the victim. But during the sequence you're sure that it is happening. Psycho is magic... is a lesson to everyone who loves movies. I think that is necessary to watch this movie before to comment another one."
"jluis1984","10","1","1","14 December 2005"," The Master shows how to make a film
","According to history, at the end of the 50s Hitchcock saw that many low-budget films were gaining many audience; knowing the flaws in those films, he decided to try to make a low-budget film and see what happened when in his words ""an experienced director"" does a low budget film. The result was ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>Loosely based on Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, ""Psycho"" is a superbly done film in almost every aspect, and shows the perfection of Hitchcock's technique. The Master was at that time at the peak of his art.<br/><br/>Scripwriter Joseph Stefano makes a different take on Bloch's novel and tells the story of Marion Crane, a woman who in an impulsive act steals $40 thousand dollars from her boss; in her escape, she spends the night at the Bates Motel, only to discover the dark secret that hides the owners, Norman Bates and his mother.<br/><br/>Done with a budget of $800,000, ""Psycho"" is perfectly conceived as it never goes too far from what it pretends to do. Hitchcock worked closely to Stefano in order to know exactly what type of take he was going to do.<br/><br/>Filmed in Black and White in a time when color was already the dominant format, the sharp contrast between light and darkness is a beautiful remark of what lies hidden inside Bates Motel.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, Marion and Norman respectively, give an outstanding performance in their roles. Perkins clearly dominates the character of Norman and it is obvious why was he type-casted as Bates, his performance and the character is so well developed by the script that is impossible to not feel empathy for him.<br/><br/>Many words could be written about Psycho, but all that must be said is that this film shows what film-making is about. The perfect mixture of art and entertainment. Now, after many parodies, homages and sequels, the movie still retains its power and it is definitely, one of the movies every person in the world should see at least once. 10/10. Masterpiece."

","What more can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's most popularly received(perhaps not his best,quality-wise)film?<br/><br/>Perhaps this: some forty-five years after it was released,it's still referenced and easily accessible movie in regards to movies creating visceral dread and natural shock. Even though Hitch wanted to make this as spare and nuanced a movie as he possibly could(note that this was a B&W film in 1960,when most movies had gone to color and various forms of ""Sens-a-round"" type cinema gimmicks of the period to capture.""shock"" and ""thrill"" moviegoers),the amount of care put into matching Bernard Hermann's tense score with the seemingly common-place events leading towards the horrors being hidden in the Bates Motel. <br/><br/>Lastly,the show is a veritable maze of curiosity,where the film begins as a tracking of the moral quandaries of one MArion Crane(Janet Leigh,beautiful and haunting as a VERY weak and corruptible character here),who,working a dead-end job and having an affair with a married man,decides to abscond with $40,000 of an investor's money. Her run from,well,everything,leads her to the seedy BAtes motel and one Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins,whose long career boiled down to this role). The rest is pretty well-known by anyone familiar with this movie.<br/><br/>This is a must-see for ANY film-lover. And in all likelihood,this movie will stay with the viewer,images AND sounds,long after one has viewed it."
"lubylou40","10","1","1","6 October 2005"," Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Classic Horror
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is arguably one of the most classic horror movies ever made. A great deal of iconography associated with the horror genre these days, for example eerie orchestral soundtracks and use of shadows and simplicity, appear to have originated in this movie.<br/><br/>The narrative follows Marion, a young female secretary, who steals a large sum of money from her employer and runs away with the intent of building a new life with her lover. On her journey to her boyfriend's place of work, however, she decides against this action but as it is too dark to either go home or continue the journey she stops to spend the night at a motel. Namely the 'Bates Motel'... <br/><br/>Many of the scenes that follow have become infamous in the world of cinema. When Marion is being shown to be stabbed in the shower very little is seen of the murderer and there is very little noticeable blood. Hitchcock clearly knew the way in which to create real horror is through what is NOT seen. Audiences' imaginations tend to scare them the most. <br/><br/>The film continues to scare the audiences until the very last scene, which is unusual for a horror film. In typical, mediocre, horror films a new equilibrium is usually created and the horror dead or over. But although the film does typically end on a note of normality (albeit with characters having been murdered) Norman Bates is still alive and as creepy as ever, if not more than to begin with. The film works on a number of levels. It fulfils many different categories of horror, in the sense that it displays blood and murder, but also has psychological disturbances and thriller tendencies. It has continued to scare from the sixties to the present day and i am sure it will carry on scaring future generations to come. <br/><br/>I am currently making a Horror Film Trailer for A Level Coursework and will try to feature many ideas from this film in my project! A classic horror film that could only be made by someone of Hitchcock's genius."
"BillyBC","Null","1","1","14 March 2003"," For better or worse, slasher movies would not exist today without this movie.
","(***** out of *****) This is, more or less, the original slasher film, and, in spite of some unfortunate aging, it's one of the scariest and most manipulative thrillers of all time.  Janet Leigh plays a secretary on the run after embezzling money from her boss.  After a narrow escape from the law, she winds up at the run-down Bates Motel (and she was afraid of prison!)  At this point, the movie takes a detour from its rather-tame opening half hour and takes viewers on a frightening ride of murder, madness, nagging mothers, stuffed birds, skeletons in cellars and ill-fated showers.  Hitchcock's direction is top-notch, and the editing during the murder scenes is almost as schizophrenic as the title character.  The only part that doesn't work quite so well anymore is the needlessly extended epilogue sequence, where a psychiatrist gives us all a lengthy explanation about split personalities and transvestism.  But, otherwise, this should be studied as a textbook on how to make a horror film -- make the audience uncomfortable and uncertain, then gradually reduce their expectations and get them relaxed again, and then -- WHAM! -- knock them over the head with the flat side of an ax. Anthony Perkins (unsettlingly brilliant here, but forever-after typecast), as mama's boy Norman Bates, is the original, cinematic psycho killer and Leigh is the original scream queen.  Also stars Vera Miles as Leigh's suspicious sister, John Gavin as the concerned lover, and Martin Balsam as the too-snoopy-for-his-own-good detective on the case.  Aside from the infamous and oft-duplicated shower scene, there are a number of shocking and suspenseful sequences, and all of it is punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's classic, frightening score.  Based on Robert Bloch's novel, who loosely based his character on real-life serial killer Ed Gein.<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHT:  The shower scene's too obvious, so I'll throw another one out here:  The scene where Norman tries to get rid of a car with one of his victims inside by pushing it into a lake.  This is a darkly clever scene, because, when the car initially refuses to sink, we feel an inexplicable pang of concern and sympathy for poor Norm, in spite of the grisly severity of his actions."

The shower scene is not extremely violent but none-the-less very effective especially for that time period.

","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN*<br/><br/>Throughout my Life, I have heard many things about this movie. My grandma, a big Hitchcock fan, used to class it as one of her favourite films of all time, and I used to always see it on the 'Horror' or 'Thriller' shelves of the video store. I guess I knew that it would be good, but never really wanted to get it, as it was old for my generation, being made in 1960, and it was in black and white. Films like that just don't suit most kids in my generation. When I first discovered the IMDB a few years back, I saw it in the Top 250, and thought that it would have to be good. And just yesterday, in fact, I finally got around to seeing it, and was I in for a treat.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Phoenix bank worker, Marion Crane (portrayed very well by a young Janet Leigh) spending her lunchtime with her boyfriend who owns the hardware store, Sam Loomis. They both want to get married, but Sam has to pay his ex-wife's alimony, and Marion isn't exactly Bill Gates. That day at work, Marion is given $40,000 in cash by a man who is purchasing a new house for his daughter who is getting married. Her boss tells her to put it in the safe, and they'll get him to give them a cheque on Monday, as they can't have that kind of money just lying around. After work, Marion takes the money with her, and runs off. It is raining very heavily, and she can't see where she is going. She takes a wrong turn off the highway, and ends up at a place called The Bates Motel, where she decides to stay for the night. There, she meets a nice young man by the name of Norman Bates, who runs the motel, while his 'mother' lives in the house up the hill from the Bates Motel. At first, Norman seems like a nice enough guy, but soon, Marion discovers that he is rather peculiar, and may not be all he is cracked up to be. When Marion does not come into work on Monday, and the money is gone, Sam and her sister Lila investigate, as does a Private Detective Arbogast, who has cracked onto Norman, and learns that kindness is only skin deep.<br/><br/>The ending was not a surprise to me, as I had already read a review of it by someone who hadn't bothered to put a spoiler warning on it, and it was not as much of a shock to me as it could have been, so even though I have put a warning above my review, I will not ruin the awesome ending for those of you who have not yet had the pleasure of viewing this cinematic gem. Hitchcock chose to film in black and white to give it more of a scary feel, and he has done a great job. I must admit, it wouldn't have been half as thrilling if it was in colour.<br/><br/>One of the first great scary films. Recommended for genre fans of any sort.<br/><br/>My rating: ***** out of *****"

I started watching it when Janet Leigh was getting ready to leave about fifteen minutes in.<br/><br/>Terrific, flawless acting and directing jobs are done here. WHY DIDN'T IT WIN ANY OSCARS? I have repeatedly been asking myself this question. The adapted screenplay was awesome as well, and the ending was ABSOLUTE GENIUS (but I'm not gonna tell you what it is).

Alfred Hitchcock puts in so many little details that are noticable and not noticeable that make it interesting to look for the little things.

","This movie is really the earliest horror film that everyone knows. It deals with a young man named Norman Bates managing a motel that his mother once owned. What role does the mother play in this film? A big one! Even though we only see her one time in the entire film she is one of the main characters. (Possible Spoilers) Norman Bates killed his mother and her lover in bed because he was jealous of her. After he killed her (as stated in Psycho IV) he still needed her and wanted her around so he stole her corpse from the grave and talked to her as if she were still alive. When the film starts we are first introduced to Marion Crane who steals $40,000 from the real estate company that she works for, she then darts for it and before you know it she ends up at the Bates Motel. When she first arrives she is charmed by Norman, offering her sandwiches and milk. But soon she hears Norman's mother talking and realizes that he has a rather dark side to him, the say goodnight and go to bed... or so you think. Soon after we see one of the most well known death scenes in cinematic history-- the macabre shower scene where Marion is stabbed to death by an unknown woman like figure which in the end turns out to be Norman Bates dressed as his mother. When Norman's mother first does the killing he has no idea what he is doing because the ""mother"" in him takes over and Norman blacks out and after he awakens he cleans up the bloody mess in which he believes that his mother has commited. There is much that this film has to offer, Alfred Hitchcock is a true genius! Psycho is one of the most horrific films in history. It is my favorite series of movies.

It introduced us to the ""slasher"", in the form of Anthony Perkins' off-balance Norman Bates and his ""Mother.""  It bought the horror film firmly into contemporary times by being set in the present.  It also took a very unique approach to psychology and murder in a way that no film had done before, and few films have done since.<br/><br/>What is the most significant about PSYCHO's celebrated shower murder, besides the literal knife-edge editing and Bernard Herrmann's classic shrieking strings, is the way Hitchcock depicts this scene.  So many slasher films entirely miss the point of that scene, focusing only on the (limited) blood.  But Hitchcock manipulates the film in such a way as to make this scene LOOK much more graphic than it really is.  It is a brilliant feat of movie-making on the part of the cinema's ultimate Master Of Suspense.<br/><br/>Even the much-criticized final scene involving the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) isn't very bothersome; he brings up the first real honest-to-goodness explanation of a disturbed killer.  As he relates Norman's story, he tells the group there in the room, ""He was never all Norman.  But he was often ONLY Mother.""<br/><br/>Scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, and loosely based on the case of Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn (which also inspired the 1974 cult masterpiece THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), PSYCHO remains a masterpiece to this very day, even after more than four decades of sequels, imitators, imitators of imitators, and an atrocious remake.  No self-respecting fan of horror or suspense movies should be without a copy of this genuine fright classic!"

","What made me love this movie was Norman Bates. He seemed like a such a nice every-day type guy...that just so happens to be psychotic and stab people in their showers. Janet Leigh (who is a much better actress than her daughter) was a great choice for her character. On the other hand, I really hated the whiny girl they cast as her sister. What made psycho work as a thriller/ horror phenonemon was the way it was marketed..because, let's face it--the shower scene isn't THAT scary. The reason why its so memorable is because of the way it shocked people who didn't know what to expect. I mean if you watch the old trailers, it doesn't give away much. So Psycho really should go down in history as a classic."

"cary16","7","5","12","21 September 2006"," The difference between GOOD and GREAT
","""Psycho"" is hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, but I just don't view it as the amazing film others do. Before I had even seen the film, I was told how great a job Hitchcock did. I'm sorry but any director who uses a corpse THAT fake looking didn't do enough. Instead of putting little motifs in every scene he should have looked at the simple things. By simple things I mean stuff like the indent in mother's bed and of course that corpse. Plus I'm sick of hearing how great the music score was... yes, the music DID fit the movie well, BUT it was one of the most redundant scores I have EVER heard, and frankly it had gotten very annoying 30 minutes into the film(I laughed when the music started again when the cop chased Janet Leigh). On a lighter note, I thought that Anthony Perkins was extremely good and Janet Leigh wasn't bad herself. I also found myself rooting' for John Gavin's character, Sam Loomis. The directing(apart from the props) was good... I was impressed with all the motifs and imagery(even though I have a sneaking suspicion that a lot of those genius acts Hitchcock took were product of over-analyzation). I am a big fan of Hitchcock's decision to film in black and white. I feel that black and white is much more expressive(especially when you have the option to film in color). I also have a small problem with some pieces of the plot that are very unbelievable. Ex: Marion's receipt found next to the toilet(like hell they would find that), Sam being knocked out by a shot to the back with a pot, the lack of emotion shown by Lila Crane when she finds out that her sister is dead, etc...<br/><br/>I know my review sounds bad, but don't get me wrong I did enjoy the film. My position sounds bad because it is easier to point out the bad than the good. I feel that this is a fine film it just has too many holes and pet peeves for me to recognize it as one of the best. I gave ""Psycho"" a 7/10 although I wanted to give it more around a 7.5 or 7.75. I think you should see ""Psycho"" for yourself and draw your own conclusions because whether you like it or not it IS a classic."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","4","9","9 December 2009"," A film that you see once, and never forget...
","I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, and have really liked all of the movies of his I have seen so far. My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.<br/><br/>Psycho is a film that you see once and never forget, and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.<br/><br/>Other pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all, a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","From the past one month, I went all gaga about watching the 'classic' movie Psycho. I kept reading about it. The effect it had caused on all. My grandmother told me that it was really creepy and scary and my father warned me that I would wet my pants!<br/><br/>I roamed all around Vadodara, my birthplace in India but couldn't find even a single shop that sold the DVD or the VCD of the movie. Finally, God had heard my prayers. Psycho was going to be shown on the television.<br/><br/>I watched it with my mother and sister. My sister went all huddled in a blanket from the very beginning. Overacting, that's what she does, and I got wild at her whenever she talked loudly while the movie was going on, asking spoilers; how the movie would end? Why did she do that? Who was the mother? And what not!<br/><br/>And I kept waiting for something the fright the s**t out of me throughout the movie. Unfortunately, I did not find it eerie, scary, frightening at all. But I kept reminding myself that it was a movie of the 60's when there were inadequate means of adding special effects and the video cameras too would have been old and therefore not much effects could be added.<br/><br/>I thought the black and white color of the film would make it more frightening but unfortunately it too didn't help that much. Till the end, I kept making excuses, siding the film, about how not much facilities were available at that time.<br/><br/>It is a timeless classic and therefore, it is hard for me to give a rating more lower than this. But after watching movies like King Kong where the inhabitants of the Skull island were unfathomably creepy looking, the skeleton of the Mother didn't make me even shiver a bit or make my heart thump faster.<br/><br/>The story too was nothing too extraordinary, but an excuse I can give for this is that maybe there are a lot of movies after Psycho which have borrowed somewhat the story from the movie and therefore I found the story of Psycho a bit lame. But I feel that the story could have been better, especially the ending, because Agatha Christie too was I think, alive at that time, and the suspense in her books gave me creeps and made me perplexed. An excuse: Don't read any suspense books before seeing Psycho.<br/><br/>But I loved the script, though the story was a bit lame. The dialogs were crisp, especially Anthony Perkin's famous quote:- "" A boy's best friend is his mother"".<br/><br/>The acting was superb and all the actors were at the top notch. But no one could make my shift from my place, because I heard a lot that its a creepy film.<br/><br/>I would give it a seven out of ten, but still, I felt that it should have been scarier, or rather, it is my err that I was born in 1993 and watched this film in 2007, when loads of special effects enhanced the horror in films."

","PSYCHO truly is an excellent film, a movie which, along with the same year's PEEPING TOM, managed to kick start a new genre of psychological thrillers which continues to this day. It's perfectly made, with an excellent story (thanks to the reliable schlockmeister Robert Bloch), a great script adaptation, and assured direction from Hitchcock.<br/><br/>It's hard to know what stands out here the most: the brooding cinematography, in which features such as the Bates Motel become characters in their own right, or Anthony Perkins's most famous role. Perkins encapsulates Bates perfectly, making him a bogeyman far more frightening than the OTT fantasy creations of a Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees.<br/><br/>Watching it today, it's tough to imagine sitting through it without knowing the various twists beforehand, but they must have been mind-blowing to newcomers. And one of the things I like best is that the film is already great, and thrilling, even before the action shifts to the Bates Motel. Add in a great Martin Balsam performance and you have one of the greatest masterworks of 20th century cinema, in my humble opinion."

The justly famous shower scene and the murder of Arbogast are still shocking. The music score by Bernard Herrmann fits the film perfectly too. It's all well-done...but I'm not crazy (sorry) about it. Maybe it's because of my first time seeing it. I saw it in third grade on late night TV. The shower scene was completely cut out as was the explanation at the end! I was totally lost. So I thought it was a stupid, pointless movie. It's neither of course but first impressions are hard to ignore.<br/><br/>This is one of Hitchcock's true horror films. It was made in black and white on a low budget with a crew taken from Hitchcock's TV show. Also most of the cast took a cut in pay just to work with him. No one thought this would work but it's now considered a classic. I like it a lot but I find some of the acting stiff (Vera Miles and John Gavin especially) and some boring sequences. Let's face it--we all know Norman is his mother so that sort of lessens the movie. Leigh is good in her role and Perkins is just incredible in his. He rightfully plays Bates as a shy awkward little boy--but you see the madness lurking inside him. A truly great performance that came far too soon for Perkins and (sadly) destroyed his career. It's worth seeing of course but I consider ""Rope"" or ""North by Northwest"" as being much better films. Ignore the stupid R rating this still carries--it would get a PG-13 today.

","Alfred Hitchcock has no sympathy for the victims in ""Psycho"", and he views them dispassionately. This relatively low-budget film is in silvery black-and-white, eerie and beautiful, with gliding camera-work and clever production touches which warrant repeat viewings, however it is much too merciless towards its characters to be a black comedy. It's also not much of a murder-mystery (we have an early idea of what's going on), yet the suspense in the third act is mounted with cunning precision. Mostly, Hitchcock seems curiously fascinated with plot-exposition and details, although the picture is still quite chilling. Anthony Perkins' tightly-controlled performance as Norman Bates is hypnotizing: his boyish good looks can be taken either way--gangly or crazily disconnected--and his eyes, which are frantic, dart around like an impatient child's (it's the role of a lifetime). I didn't much care for Simon Oakland's psychology report at the end, but the final shots and the voice-over are masterfully pulled-off. *** from ****"

I'd like to compare to Agatha Christie's best story, the 6th most sold novel of all times, Ten Little N*****s aka And Then There Were None: there is something crude about both productions.

On the way there however, the weather had turned very bad and she was forced to sleep at a remote motel where she meets Norman, an innocent young man who seems to have a strong relationship with his mother, who is the owner of the motel, and he also seems very harmless. When Marion goes missing however Sam and her sister investigate her missing together and they come to a horrible conclusion. <br/><br/>*SPOILERS* When the private detective Arbogast goes to investigate the house of Norman and his mother but he gets killed as well. Sam and Lila (Marion's sister) go to the deputy's office to find out about Normans mother but the deputy tells them that Normans mother is long dead and buried. They go to the motel in disguise as a married couple and search Marion's room, Sam is suspicious and starts to interrogate Norman and tries to make him confess to the murder but Norman knocks Sam out, in the meantime Lila goes to the house on top of the hill and starts to look around there. When she sees Norman approaching she hides in the basement and she finds Normans mother there in a chair but she is dead and rotten. Suddenly Norman comes in from behind with a wig similar to his mothers hair and also clothes that look like his mothers, just before he can stab Lila Sam comes in from behind and subdues him. The shot then changes into a police station where you can see Norman in a chair and talking to himself like he is his mother. *ENDING SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Psycho was a rather revolutionary film when it came out. This was because of the shocking ideas, the good camera-work and new ways of producing. Nowadays the ideas aren't shocking anymore and the new ways of producing isn't new. The camera-work is still interesting though. Combined with the music and the special effects it created a lot of tension in some parts of the movie. Because of this the producer Alfred Hitchcock is sometimes called: The master of suspense. It is too bad that the movie had a slow progressing plot, because this causes people to lose their attention. Things like this show us how old the movie actually is, nowadays movie-plots progress really fast to keep the attention of the viewers, but at that time Psycho had a fast-progressing plot. The standards for movies have changed. In our opinion Psycho is getting past its expirations date. <br/><br/>The setting of the movie is mostly at the motel of Norman Bates. The place has a dark atmosphere and especially Norman Bates house. The camera-work in the film was good because it was focused on a lot, for example in the famous shower scene over 70 different camera positions were used so you know the director worked hard on the scene to make it as good as he could. The film is also a first of its kind in many aspects, a toilet being flushed and seeing Marion in her underwear, of course nowadays this is not really special to us but back then this was very revolutionary. The use of sound in the film was good because it created a lot of tense moments an when the music started to play you knew something bad was going to happen. The special effects were bad for us though because we automatically compare them to the special effects that are used in films now even though we try not to and they are really laughable. Editing was used effectively in this film and it had to too, because if we again look at the shower scene you never see Marion actually get stabbed but because the film was edited in such a way you automatically know she did get stabbed this is also the case in the scene where the private investigator got stabbed. Then there is the plot, the part of the film that made the film so bad for us, the plot progresses very slowly and it was hard to not get distracted while watching the film, if there was any action which was rare it would only last for a couple of seconds or minutes if you were lucky. <br/><br/>We thought the film was not that amazing for us. The film was hard to understand and it was a very slow story. You have to watch it several times to understand everything in full detail. This is very usual in Hitchcock's films so we could have expected this. The film was not very action packed in comparison to today's standard, nowadays we have much more action in films than there was in psycho. The special effects are not that special, but again that has to do with the standards from today. It was not an interesting movie for us however if you look on the other side of things psycho was a renewing movie. Everything was original at that time and the movie was made from a low budget. It set the standard for thriller movies today and the film will always be an example. You will like the movie if you want a good story but if you want more action and adventure we would not recommend this movie."
"xander34","7","2","4","29 October 2007"," Works because of the performances
","Reviewing Alfred Hitchcock's famed black and white opus Psycho from a 21st century perspective gives the film less credit than it deserves. For it's time, it was revolutionary. Now, it is just a well acted, yet somewhat dated horror film. The editing in the shower scene has become a clichÃ© in pop culture, but one cannot deny the original brilliance of the scene. The movie really only works as well as it does because of the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Perkins never really had another role he was better in, save Mike Nichols' Catch-22, a personal favorite. After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.<br/><br/>Psycho also created the character of Dr. Sam Loomis, a name later used in the other revolutionary horror film, John Carpenter's Halloween. Overall, the movie doesn't age as horrible as some other select black and white 50's-60's horror films, but nevertheless it does age a reasonable amount, leading to many cringe worthy and laughable scenes, most likely due lackluster performances by the rest of the cast, low production values, and shady effects and ""skeletons."""

","A young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 (roughly a quarter million today) from her employer and runs off to meet her boyfriend. But along the way she stops at the Bates Motel, and meets the charming Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion and her money might not make it back to her boyfriend Sam in perfect condition.<br/><br/>Yes, after 47 years of this film existing and being a horror fan for well over 10 years now, I finally broke down and watched what is widely considered to be Hitchcock's best film (I had previously seen ""Lamb to Slaughter"", ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" -- and have now seen many more since). Boy, was I missing out on something! Now I cannot wait to see ""Psycho 2"" and ""Psycho 3"" (which I own for some reason). I have seen parts of the Gus Van Sant remake but was not impressed.<br/><br/>The acting was very good, especially from Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He did a great job as a friendly boy-next-door caretaker. Vivian Leigh was also good as Marion Crane, and I am sorry she had to have a hermaphroditic child like Jamie Lee Curtis. All other parts were fine. I hear they called the actor who played Sam Loomis ""the stiff"" and boy are they right! Later in the film he loosens up a little bit, but in the opening scene he seems so wooden.<br/><br/>The bird symbolism is nice... especially with Hitchcock's other big horror film being ""The Birds"". And the main character being Marion ""Crane""? Is she going to get stuffed like the other birds in the parlor? I will not say, but you probably already know (since pretty much everyone knows about this film even if they never saw it).<br/><br/>Most startling for me was Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the main theme (not the knife noise). I had long heard rumors that ""Re-Animator"" ripped off the ""Psycho"" theme and I thought they meant it was a variation on the theme. An homage, perhaps (because who would try to steal from such a famous film). Well, the music is exactly the same. I mean, really dead on. So now I do not know how to feel about ""Re-Animator"", which is practically my favorite horror film (with all due respect to ""The Janitor"")... which shakes up my whole foundation and makes me rethink movie history! <br/><br/>My only complaint was the confusion (at least for me) of where the Bates Motel is. Marion drives all Friday night and then arrives Saturday evening, implying it is a great distance from Phoenix. Yet, when the detective investigates the motel, he tells someone on the phone he is less than an hour from them. Where is he based if not Phoenix?<br/><br/>Well, if you have not seen this, you should. It is a classic and with good reason (as I typed this the first time, it was ranked the 22nd greatest film of all time on Internet Movie Database and still lingers around 25th three years later). Not just a great horror classic, but also a great film with great directing and cast. Plus, if you are from Wisconsin like I am, you'll love the Ed Gein storyline.

"Fiona-17","Null","2","4","4 August 2001"," The best horror movie of all time
","Nowadays we have been exposed to scarier horror and macabre to find Hitchcock's classic frightening.  However, there are certain elements which make this film the best horror movie of all time.<br/><br/>Considering the era (1960) Hitchcock used innovative camera angles to build up the tension and fear in Psycho.  For example at the beginning the camera pans down on the motel giving the impression that the house is watching the motel.  This personification (that the house is alive) is used again when Marion's sister (Lila) approaches the house near the end.  The camera changes from objective to subjective numerous times to give the impression that the house is watching Lila.  More camera actions which are innovative is when Bates and Crane are talking over supper.  The low camera angle gives the impression that Norman Bates is bigger and therefore more menacing. This is an early indication of the horror which is to come. These are just examples of the clever use of camera.<br/><br/>The music and lightening is a major strength of the film.  For example when there is the scene with the corpse the mummified mother is a mixture of dark and light.  This represents the good and evil side of Norman.  Moreover, there is light shining at the backs of the eye sockets which makes the corpse appear alive.  Hitchcock innovated with the signature tune (""screeching violins"") and that builds up the suspense.  Such directors as Speilberg have copied this idea (e.g. Jaws)<br/><br/>Symbolism is a good part of this film.  For example Bates has an unusual hobby of stuffing birds.  By analyzing Anthony Perkins performance he perches on the edge of his chair as if he is a bird seeking his prey (i.e. Crane).  He also acts like a bird when he twitches his head from time to time.  Another clever use of symbolism is when Lila picks up the book in the Psycho house.  She is unsure which side is what as they are equally patterned.  This represents Norman's character; you can't determine his side as he has two personalities. More symbolism is Marion's change in underwear when she packs her case; white represents purity and black represents evil/wrong doing.  Symbolism like this is also used when the camera shows the stuffed bird towering over Bates when he becomes uneasy with Marion's conversation.  This represents his mother watching over him and changing his personality.  By watching the film other examples of symbolism can be depicted throughout.<br/><br/>What made Psycho so remarkable at the time was realism.  The setting was a realistic place and familiar to American and worldwide audiences (i.e the motel, the city - Phoenix, Arizona) rather than fictional places like Transylvania.  Also, Norman had a medical condition (he was a psychopath). This was a breakaway from the previous unrealistic films, such as Dracula. This made the film even more frightening and people were scared that such events could occur with ""real"" people.  Also what was realistic about this film was that the characters were neither ""goodies"" or ""baddies"" - they had transformations.  Marion was a mixture of good and bad (the color of her underwear she chooses represents this and the color of the car she buys.) This makes the film more realistic as it shows that people all have good and bad in them, which is true.<br/><br/>Moreover what stood out in the film was what happened to Janet Leigh.  She was killed of very early into the film and this shocked audiences that the A-list Hollywood actress was so brutally murdered.  This is nearly on a par with what Drew Barrymore chose to do for Scream when she chose to be Casey. This fact shows Hitchcock has influenced the thinking for other horror movies.<br/><br/>Therefore, although you will be better of with Scream or Scary Movie to scare you this film is an example of cinematography at its best."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","2","4","31 May 2000"," In my opinion, Psycho is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, if not THE greatest.
","Psycho is one of the few films that have created countless numbers of spinoffs and attempted duplications. Anthony Perkins was perfect as the timid and charming but psychotic Norman Bates, and Hitchcock's direction molds Robert Bloch's novel into a timeless thriller that is as satisfying to someone seeing it for the first time as to someone who has seen in 50 times.<br/><br/>
Even though I am a pretty serious film fanatic, I did not see Psycho for the first time until late 1998 - I actually saw the re-make first. I enjoyed that film, and decided to finally see the original to see what was so great about it. Psycho made a tremendous impact on me, and it was the only movie I have ever seen that I wanted to rewind and watch again as soon as it ended.<br/><br/>
Excellent acting, amazing psychological direction by Alfred Hitchcock, the most famous murder scene in film history, and Bernard Herrman's hypnotic score all come together in Psycho to produce a truly wonderful and intense cinematic experience."

","The movie art of the 1960s was set against a black-and-white screen with a high-level texture, which also justifies the suspenseful atmosphere.<br/><br/>Regarding this movie, I would like to talk about the detailed hints of the film and the functions of these hints in the movie. Of course, if it is more true, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is explicit.<br/><br/>Because the language of the camera has always been a must-have reminder to the audience: This person has problems and this place is not right.<br/><br/>Where is the specific problem and what's wrong? Read on.<br/><br/>Let me talk about Cran first. Since Cran decided to run with her boss's $ 40,000 cash, her character traits have become prominent. What is it? It is ""panic"". And this ""panic"" has been running through her character until the moment before she died.<br/><br/>On the way to escape, Kran spent the night in the car and was woken up by the patrolling police early the next morning. Her panic look instantly caught the attention of the police: a beautiful woman who parked the car by the road alone overnight, although she insisted that she did not encounter any problems and did not need help, but was very resistant to the police. ask.<br/><br/>When the car dealers traded for the old ones, the car salesman had planned to spend a lot of money on the sales. As a result, Cran rejected the proposal to test the car, asked the price straight away, and did not make a counter-offer. There was only one request, and the driver was delivered immediately. This even led the car salesman to suspect that her own car was coming from a wrong direction.<br/><br/>The heavy rain was unable to move forward, and Cran had to choose the Bates Motel by the night. At this time everyone knows that the feature film is about to begin. why? Because the audience can guess without any effort, the hotel owner Norman will not only officially launch as a transitional group performance, but as a major player identity.<br/><br/>Regarding Norman's character traits, the director didn't hide it, and three or two lines and shots came out. The masked gentleman with a sensitive and emotional instability hides the meaning and is dangerous.<br/><br/>So when he peeked at Klein's bath, the audience wouldn't be surprised, because this behavior was in line with Norman's character.<br/><br/>However, when it was discovered that Crane was killed in the bathroom, his performance surprised the audience.<br/><br/>At first he appeared a little panicked, this is the normal reaction of ordinary people. But the duration of this panic is very short. He calmed down quickly, and quickly packed the scene, the corpses disappeared, a series of actions, too smooth and skilled!<br/><br/>But this time, back to the topic I want to talk about. Before that, I have been analyzing the details and hints. Now I can talk about the clever and misleading part, because the audience's sense of violation appears.<br/><br/>The murder happened, the next step is to confirm who the murderer is.<br/><br/>Who is it? The motel is equivalent to a closed space during a downpour night. In this space, there are only three people, the victim tenant Cran, the motel owner Norman, and Norman's sick, but full-hearted mother .<br/><br/>The audience's first impression was that Norman was first ruled out, and the murderer could only be Norman's mother. why? Because we all heard, Norman's mother didn't like Cran, she had the motivation to kill.<br/><br/>Drawing such a judgment means that the previous details hint that it has come into play, and the audience is misled unconsciously.<br/><br/>However, there must be evidence for convictions, and we cannot guess by sentiment alone. So the audience looked down and found out that Norman 's mother was an elderly person with no mobility and resistance. How could such a person kill a young woman and a middle-aged man with a knife What?<br/><br/>By this time, the audience actually had a vague guess as to who was the real murderer, only to wait for the movie to explain why the murderer did this and how.<br/><br/>Finally, we know who raised the knife, but we are not sure who the murderer is."

"michaelaezell","7","0","0","9 December 2019"," Psycho Review
","I think that Hitchcock's Psycho has a great plot, but it does not quite fit the genre it is categorized as. The plot has a lot of elements that make it great, such as the many surprises it contains that keeps the viewer intrigued. The film makes us believe that one thing is happening when it is really another that is completely different. Norman is a good example of these surprises as we learn more about his character. Norman is a very dynamic character; in the beginning of the film the viewer would see him as a poor hotel keeper trying to make a living. As the film progresses the viewer can start to see the weird things Norman does and they start to question his character until the end when they realize what is actually going on. Marion's character is also a great example of how the plot is able to keep the viewers interested with its many surprises. Viewers would see her as an innocent worker at the beginning of the film and then she takes the money and makes a run for it surprising the viewers.
Despite Psycho having a great plot I don't believe it should be categorized as a horror film. During the whole movie I never found anything to be particularly scary. The film did have a creepiness to it, but nothing made me feel frightened. The scene I feel is supposed to be the most terrifying is when Marion is killed in the shower, but I didn't find it scary and thins could just be because of the horror movies I have grown up with. Another scene that I thought was supposed to be terrifying is the scene at the end when Norman is staring into the camera. To me this scene was just creepy but I'm sure when the movie came out people probably thought that it was almost like he was in the room with them so it would have been more scary. There were no jump scares and not really any blood or gory. This may have been a great horror movie when it first came out but compared to today's horror movies this film is not a horror movie."

"ccamp89","8","0","0","28 June 2018"," Iconic and masterfully executed, though thematically slight
","Psycho is a perennial horror classic for good reason. Its best scenes are among the most iconic in the genre and remain potently suspenseful and visually arresting even if they aren't quite horrifying by today's standard. Going toe-to-toe with the ""scare"" scenes are a couple of tense dialogue exchanges that are just as compelling thanks to Anthony Perkins' layered and chilling performance.<br/><br/>The highs are incredibly high, perhaps to a fault. Connective tissue scenes in the film which have the misfortune of resting before and after some of the best moments in horror can feel a bit mundane by comparison. There is an unevenness that has become more pronounced with repeat viewings, as I find myself looking forward to the best moments rather than enjoying each on its own merit. It may be a consequence of the fact that this is a film that is somewhat heavily reliant on its mystery and eventual twist, with many moments dedicated specifically to throwing the audience off the scent. Once you've seen the movie, the tricks take on a transparency that betrays the slightly shallow nature of the story. The execution makes up for these shortcomings convincingly, but Hitchcock has certainly made other thrillers that are much richer thematically (Rear Window, Vertigo), and less reliant on a central gimmick.<br/><br/>Regardless, Psycho absolutely shines in its best moments thanks to the excellent performances and Hitchcock's masterful direction. It certainly deserves its classic status in both Hitchcock's filmography and the horror catalog at large, even if it lacks the consistency and substance of some of his other classics.<br/><br/>Strong 4/5"

She stops by the Bates Motel for a rest, little did she know it would be her eternal resting place. An investigation arises into Norman Bates where certain ominous discoveries are made. This was completely unconventional back in 1960. To kill off the lead protagonist halfway through the film was bold. I'm talking massive kahunas. It was groundbreaking. Hitchcock had the audience right on his fingertips, like a puppeteer. His directing style was better than perfect. I've never seen such inventive camera techniques that clearly has influenced filmmakers today. The shower scene switching back and forth between the knife and Janet Leigh screaming, only to then watch the blood drain from the pristine bathtub. The slow panning as Vera Miles searches Bates' house, how every room concealed many secrets. Then the climax. The big reveal. Simply unforgettable. Hitchcock's natural talent of creating suspense and tension has yet to be exceeded. All performances were classy and felt natural. Leigh and Miles exhumed elegance. Balsam plays the private investigator with complete control. But Anthony Perkins...wow. His ability to switch from creepy psychopath to normal human was masterful. I couldn't take my offs of the screen. Finally that musical score evokes nightmares. Sharp, high pitched notes to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film's entirety. Some of the thrills were inconsistent and the build up to these crescendos take slightly too long, but the characters are developed enough to prevent the build up from being boring.

After seeing the corpse of Mrs.Bates, it is revealed that Norman Bates killed Marion; however, the murder was not done by Norman, but by his mother's persona that he adopted when she died.<br/><br/>One of the best component about the movie is the suspense that the movie provided to its audience, which was executed by its film angles, sound track, and composition of the shots. Looking at the first suspenseful moments of the movie, when Marion was leaving town with the money, the angle of the camera switched between her facial expression and the road ahead of. In this segment, the audience can easily tell that the she is worried and panicking about being caught by the law, also by showing the her view we can tell that she is try hard to stay on the road and get further away from her town as she continued to drive in the rain and night. In addition to the camera switching angles between Marion and her perspective, the background music gave the scenes a sense of urgency and was played louder when she was near the police that pulled her over. Making the viewers believe that she was going to be caught. <br/><br/>At the Bates motel when Marion encounters Norman, the suspense that the movie can display shined when the two characters alone at diner. Here, Hitchcock had the camera angled in a way to make it seem like Norman is looking down at Marion and the audience, while he discusses the situation about his mother and what he would like to do. Simultaneously, the composition of the scene and music added to the suspense. As viewers see Norman talk, the taxidermy of animals can be seen in the background hanging ominously. Hitchcock deliberately placed the taxidermy of animals, the stuffing of animals, in the background to emphasize Norman's statement about doing potential harm to his mother and death. By talking about how his mother would become cold and lifeless, viewers are able to imagine his mother being dead; in addition, the taxidermies were used to foreshadow that Norman's mother is already dead. Lastly, the low violin tune played when Norman stated his view on institutions gives viewers the idea that he has a spite towards institution, and would potentially do something to Marion because she mentioned it. All of this made viewers in suspense as they think that Norman may attack Marion.<br/><br/>Even though the examples that I used to mention the suspense that the movie is able to demonstrate well were from the beginning of the movie, it does not decrease the ability that the movie displays. In order for a movie to be successful, the movie's beginning needs to be executed well to capture viewers like how this movie was able to do with its tune of suspense.Hitchcock knew his components of film well because he made this film a huge success; evident by future films, even recent ones, which make reference to this movie, showing the impact that the movie was able to do on cinema as a whole."

","My favorite of Hitchcock's films. Anthony Perkins was way ahead of his time as an actor. You could literally transport him into the present day and drop him in just about any movie and he'd shine. I'd give the movie a 10 if it weren't for some 1950's dialogue moments with the detective. Maybe I should look past that? Otherwise, perfect movie."

","Psycho is a slasher/thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. This film follows a young Phoenix secretary named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). She embezzled forty thousand dollars from her employer so she can get away with her secret lover. During this, she tries to avoid a police officer that is suspicious of her by taking back roads and stops at the Bates Motel. She meets the owner of the motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). At first, he seems like a polite man, but as the film moves on she becomes unsure of him and his intentions. <br/><br/>My nitpick with this film comes from the beginning of this film. In the beginning of this film, Alfred Hitchcock does a great job of establishing the character, as he always does. The beginning of this film uses the setting, her job, the things around her, and all the smallest details of her character to do so. This makes her stealing the forty thousand dollars feel like a very believable move for the character. Hitchcock continues to do this and it pays off as the character sees great development throughout the first half of the film. Although, as this happens, this film is simply without an identity and even when Norman Bates arrives on the scene, you can't help but wonder what kind of film your watching.<br/><br/>This is quickly shoved aside when you learn what kind of character Norman Bates is and what his intentions are. From here on the film feels perfect. Bernard Herrmann gives a chilling score that becomes even more effective in the second half of the film when it compliments intense murder scenes and Anthony Perkins terrifying performance. Anthony Perkins simply gives one of the best performances ever. He gives a truly disturbing one that still keeps the viewer wanting more. Anthony Perkins takes over this film by himself.<br/><br/>The second half of this film moves smoothly and is very unpredictable. This film boasts great character development, an unexpected and fulfilling plot, and one of the greatest performances ever seen on film. This film has one or two negatives that are only nitpicking and doesn't take away from the film. For me, this is a near perfect film, but this is mostly due to Anthony Perkins performance. My score: 9.5/10"

"powermandan","10","0","0","11 November 2017"," Finally, A Horror Movie With Actual Brains and Really High Intelligence!
","Of all the genres, horror is the one where the amount of truly good movies are few and far between. It is the genre that's taken the least seriously. Its true that this is the single worst genre of all. Horror movies are clad with a over-abundance of blood, death, bad acting and no point. Of course horror is supposed to make people scared, but 95% of them fail. While Psycho is not scary like it was 57 years ago, it is still one of the smartest films ever made. And the type of genre that the genius film is, happens to be horror.<br/><br/>Psycho is best known for the infamous ""shower scene,"" something everybody knows about. That happens to be the turning point. The movie is very good before, and even better after. The ""shower scene"" is not even the best part in the movie.<br/><br/>Psycho starts off normal drama with a romance story worked in. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary whose life could be better. Her fiancée is Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and their wedding is on hold due to his debts. She is willing to start life anew and steals $40000 in cash. This happens minutes into the movie as it turns into a road thriller. She plans on evading Phoenix and use the money to build her new life with Sam in California. She knows what she did was wrong and is scared of being caught. We the audience hold our breath in hopes of Marion not being nabbed. Tired, she stops in the Bates Motel just for the night. She meets and gets to know the timid owner, Norman who has a domineering mother. She sees that Norman has low self-esteem and has a change of heart. Can her self robbery get redeemed?<br/><br/>Then the film REALLY switches gears and becomes the horror movie it promises. There's the ""shower scene"" that derails the movie away from Marion stealing money and into Norman Bates. The ""shower scene"" had many cuts and changes of angles, with perfect cinematography so that the figure of Mrs. Bates would not be seen. Norman is devastated, but loves his mother dearly, getting rid of the evidence.<br/><br/>Marion's sister Lila and Sam hire a detective to search for her. Lila and Sam are worried since they haven't heard from Marion, and they found out about her stealing the money. The detective checks out motels, ultimately landing at Bates. Norman's agitation and inconsistency has him suspicious. Lila and Sam make their way to Bates. They discuss Marion's situation with others in the area and wonder who killed for the money. When they find out Norman's motives and who his mother really is, the level of genius that this flick has kicks into overdrive.<br/><br/>When Norman gets sent to an insane asylum, a psychologist explains his mental state. This is the best scene in the movie. One of my 10 favourite scenes in all of cinema. Norman and his mother (who really was domineering) lived as though they were the only two people in the world. She started dating again ten years earlier and Norman killed them both. Unable to cope with her death, he keeps her corpse well treated and acting like she was still alive. But that wasn't enough, he created an alternate personality of his mother and would sometimes dress up as her to maintain the illusion. Since he was jealous of her and her lover, he assumed she would be too. So when moments of passion would arise in Norman's life, the ""mother"" part of him would take over and kill. Norman fell in love with Marion and ""mother"" killed her. He had not idea about the money. If Norman felt any real sense of danger, the ""mother"" part would kill. ""Mother"" the detective. The ""mother"" part has consumed Norman's life.<br/><br/>The whole flick is a psychological lesson in the mind of a madman. There are many other instances of intelligence that branch off. Although far from being the scariest film ever, it should still forever remain the best horror film ever.<br/><br/>4/4"

","Alfred Hitchcock was considered a master of suspence and Psycho was considered his masterpeice of all of his work and it has been considered one of the best that he has directed in his carrer and i would agree with people who say that.
Psycho follows Marion Crane a asssistant who after getting a whole lot a cash from one of her bosses customers ends up running away and eventuallu running apon the bates motel on her travels and from there her fate is sealed. Janet Leigh is Marion Crane our leading lady through Psycho and she has such a iconic role that it has cemented her in pop culture forever and she is amazing and one of my favorite scenes with her is when she is in the car and she is thinking of all of the senarios of what people say after she goes missing and her facial expressions are perfect for describing what she is thinking in her head. Anthony Perkins is Norman Bates and he has one of the scariest preformaces in cinema as the errie owner of the motel who is haunted by his over protective mother and she is a looming part of his life and even in facial expressions alone this guy can be scary and one of the best parts of this movie.the cast also has amazing supporting stars like Vera Miles,John Gavin, Martin Balsam, john McIntire and Simon Oakland the cast that is more supporting is also as good as the main two stars who get plently pf screen time.
Psycho is by far my Favorite Hitchcock movie Psycho plays on peoples fears and also makes some afried of going in the shower and that was only thought of because of Psycho and it is one of those moves that has become so iconic that it's a movie that is a must watch for horror fans and for any movie buff or general movie watcher and i would recommend it as it is a Hitchcock movie that lot's of people were talking about and still haven't stopped talking about and that is why i rate Psycho 10/10 it is supurb"
"chimera3","10","0","0","8 September 2017"," An Undisputed Masterpiece
","Ever since I was a kid, I always loved watching vintage horror movies. When I got older, my mom started telling us more and more about Alfred Hitchcock's movies and invited us to watch as many as we could. If my memory serves, the very first two Hitchcock movies that I ever watched were ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds."" Like Stephen King after him, Hitchcock made you unable to trust your surroundings, whether it be something simple like a motel or just walking down the street and see a group of birds sitting on power lines.<br/><br/>What angers me about this is that it was poorly remade later on and it just didn't have the same type of scares as the first one. You do not need a horror movie to be in color to have it be scary. ""Psycho"" was done exclusively in black and white and that's all there was to it. If something like this can scare you once, it can certainly scare you again no matter how many times you watch it. ""Psycho"" is definitely a masterpiece that no matter how many times you try to do it, you cannot duplicate it. It has been parodied many times on TV shows and music videos, which goes to show that people will keep coming back to it to get the daylights scared out of them. <br/><br/>In the end, let me say this: if it isn't broke, don't fix it. If you want to truly be scared out of your wits and be paranoid about checking into a motel, watch this."

","I just recently seen this film for the first time ever. I didn't know much about in terms of story, actors, or really much of anything except it is considered Hitchcock's most popular film. After nearly 60 years later the film still has an impact. One thing is for sure, it inspired modern horror. A smart, bone-chilling, suspenseful horror film. No other horror film has had as much gravitas as Psycho before it, or since. The film is practically flawless starting with a sinister performance by Anthony Perkins. It doesn't take long once we meet him that something is definitely amiss with him. That's one of the things that Hitchcock does so well is he constantly cranks up the suspense, and twists our nerves and minds until it can't be tightened anymore than he lets loose. Revealing twists and turns no other director would ever think of. Psycho perfectly represents that, as the characters are well thought out, and each scene is cleverly put together. This film also holds some of the most iconic moments in cinema. Along with the creepy wrenching music by Bernard Herrman, which adds a whole new level of tension, to bring these wonderfully eerie scenes to life. As no other film before or since has ever reached the magnitude to Psycho, and it will stay that way for decades or even centuries to come.

Because of that, I thought not only Norman but also his mother was psycho. Third, I thought Norman's name express not only normal but also strong connection with his mother.

Moreover, the sound track gave us the feeling of impatience and tension.<br/><br/>I think that ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"" have something in common with women. In ""Vertigo"" Scottie tried to appropriate Madeline for his personal use by making ideal woman. Whereas in ""Psycho"" there is the description comparing women to stuffed birds from Norman's lines. I felt that these express the men's will wanting to make women their own. I wonder if women are passive compared with men is really the case.<br/><br/>Also, this film shows strange relationship of gender, because Norman and his mother have the reference of incest in Norman's brain. Of course mother and son are not lover but family by thinking about blood relationship from commonsense. So the love of between parent and child is ""abnormal"".

","I think that Hitchcock's films often have the meaning on every scene. For example, he used a mirror and tried to show double sides of a human, or in Vertigo, he reflected the Coital Tower at love scenes. However I thought that ""Psycho"" had scenes that played games with me. They were the parts that Marion Crane had run away with the money of her picked of a man. In that part, policeman picked on her action and shadowed her car with his car. It seemed that his tailing is persistent, but anything did not happen after all. I have another instance. She had been driving in heavy rains until she has arrived at BATES MOTEL. Maybe, the audience thought that something would happen, but it was just heavy rains. Anything have never happen. Are those Hitchcock's mischief? I thought he had kidded the audience. Next, I noticed about Psycho's soundtrack, ""The Murder"". This tune is pretty shrilling. People tend to feel the nervous to the register. So this music matches ""Psycho"". And it is exaggeration that this music makes the film become famous. In Japanese TV shows, it has been often used on the scary shots. I really think that influence which ""Psycho"" brought the world of movies and TV was so huge!"

Even the actor's clothes didn't seem particularly dated - apart from those bras of Lila Crane (Vera Mills) - but hell, Madonna was wearing those things only a few years ago. What I love about Psycho (and a lot of the older thrillers/slashers) is that it manages to invoke fear and intrepidation without gallons of blood spurting around the room, bones being sawed with grizzly sound effects, close ups of heads exploding etc. Having said this, Psycho did set a new bar for 'violence' and 'sexuality' in movies (apparently Hitchcock had quite a time persuading the studio to let him make the movie). The music is such an integral part of this movie and hits just the right tones denoting 'something really scary is about to happen' or 'it's OK,no one's about to be hacked to death but don't let your guard down'. I did 'jump' on a couple of occasions and that's kudos to Hitchcock's brilliant mastery of suspense. Vera Mills was extremely good but I found her 'guilty' acting a little overblown. What can I say about Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates? Nothing really, he was fantastic. He portrayed the many sides of his troubled character perfectly and was extremely convincing as an 'innocent, sensitive, naïve Mummy's boy'. Other elements that make Psycho so revolutionary and 'deep' include the exploration of family 'bonds', the results of introducing a new family dynamic, and the idea of 'split personality disorder'. If you haven't watched Psycho in a couple of years, I urge you to rent it again and re-visit what I can only describe as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces."

","Okay, so I am obsessed with horror films. Even though this film is quite old and the effects are a bit dated. I would definitely have to say that this horror flick is way better than some out in theaters today! The music went well with the scenes. There were a great deal of lighting and contrasting used to create a sort of eerie feel. The plot was outrageous but not too far fetch. What made this film so great is that it is believable. All the incidents that happen in the film are things are not fantasy. The actors played their characters very well. Their words, feelings and emotions they portrayed felt authentic. The editing allowed for discontinuity during murder scenes, where certain images were a bit choppy. Overall , I give this film an A."

","Alfred Hitchcock, One of the most famous names in the industry comes through with a thoughtfully done masterpiece of a thriller here. <br/><br/>Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, has just stolen money from her boss. Marion leaves town and is forced to stop at a motel, called the Bates Motel. <br/><br/>The The owner of the motel has a weirdo son named Norman. Norman, played by Anthony Perkins, is a loner and a very strange man. Perkins does a great job of creating an eerie feel with Norman, he's just very creepy and you can feel yourself getting lost in the film because of Norman. <br/><br/>Of course the famous shower scene is amazing when you think of the Hays Code. Hitchcock did a wonderful job of pushing the limit to create one of the best scenes in movie history."

","I absolutely LOVED this film. Every single part of it. The pace was perfect and I never got bored watching it.<br/><br/>First off, the cinematography was spectacular. The cinematographer used many high angle and low angle shots to emphasize fear or other feelings throughout the film. The angles paired with the lighting made for some really unforgettable shots in the film. I also enjoyed the sound. Although there was very minimal music, I thought it was really effective every time it played. You would just get relaxed while watching the film, then the classic horror music plays and jolts you back into awareness. I'll also admit that the huge plot twist at the end completely threw me for a whirl. I don't know how I didn't see it coming, but it really surprised me when it happened. <br/><br/>The acting was really great too, especially from Anthony Perkins. His performance as Norman Bates had the perfect amount of subtlety and and crazy that made for a truly unforgettable character. Honestly, if the movie had been made with any other actor than him as Norman, it just wouldn't have been the same. <br/><br/>I thought the simplicity, yet complexity of the final scene was also really great too. That paired with the internal dialogue coming from Norman was just excellent. I would recommend this movie to anyone."

","This movie is a great horror movie! I was hiding behind my blanket the entire time and I loved every second of it. I am so glad that I finally had the courage to watch it. The storyline is great and totally unexpected. I always heard people talking about this movie saying how amazing it was and how it was a classic slasher film, so going into it I thought it was a typical slasher film. Little did I know there was a twist at the end, the name Psycho really suits the movie. Bates who is played by Anthony Perkins is the perfect ""psycho"", he played crazy so well. The dark sharp music definitely added to how scared I was! As much as I hate being scared, I loved this movie!"

","Its tough to review one of the greatest movies of all time, just because of how over reviewed it is. Psycho is a classic tale of suspense that I had heard of as a kid, but only now go to experience for myself. And what an experience it was. Every shot of this movie is brilliant, it leads your eye and your mind, constantly keeping you on edge, but not with horror like modern films. I did not find Psycho ""scary"" in a typical sense. It was suspenseful, but it rarely scared or startled me, and that is part of what makes it great. Its a murder movie with no blood essentially, and of course it features the most violent stabbing with no actual stabbing I have ever witnessed. Overall a great story of suspense, one that continues to thrill all ages."
"t-covino","10","0","0","8 May 2013"," Psycho
","One of the most classic horror films in history. It is a Hitchcock film in which a beautiful women finds what she thinks is a very nice proper man but is wrong. He was abused and dominated by his mother as a child which lead him to become the Psycho.Hitchcock plays the code very well and uses different shots and angles to show the horror of his film instead of directly showing the killings. A scene that is almost always mentioned when talking about horror films is in this film the epic shower scene. Which has seemed to be adopted by a lot of horror films after Psycho was made. The story itself is pretty intricate for a horror film and i really enjoyed watching it."
"v-colarusso","10","0","0","5 May 2013"," Cinema's finest moment
","Psycho is a timeless, well-respected classic. It's a pop culture icon and a household name. Just hearing the movie's title will inspire the image of Janet Leigh screaming in the shower. Hitchcock did this movie flawlessly - it almost seems silly to review this film because it's common knowledge how perfect it is. The acting is absolutely impeccable. I would almost say that Tony Perkins played Norman Bates too well because he was never really able to be anything ever again. The similar paradox of Bela Lugosi, who could never escape his ""Dracula"" image. I was lucky enough (lucky only for the fact that it gave me an extra element of analysis ability of the original) to see the re-make of Psycho. The movie was pretty much a duplicate, yet just not as good. It's sometimes hard to identify perfect acting, because that's the whole point of it: to not notice the acting. But after watching the shot-for-shot remake and realizing it was no where near as good as the original, my respect for the actors and the black and white cinematography grew even deeper than it already was. Hitchcock's ability to do horror without gore is fantastic."

","This is a top notch film by Alfred Hitchcock. As most of his films, there great twists to the story and your never quite sure how it's going to end. Anthony Perkins played a great role as Norman Bates and i read that he actually was able to contribute his own personal ideas to his character. The music really made this movie as well. I watch a clip of the shower scene without the music and it didn't feel even half as climatic. The cinematography through out the film was very well done. The famous shower scene of course but there are also some great over head shots and panning shots as well. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and would be surprised to hear of anyone disliking it."
"Amadeus_Smith","9","0","0","23 April 2013"," Hitchcock's Best
","I envy anybody who is watching this for the first time; 'Psycho' is a tremendous staple of directing performances, horror movies and cinema in general. Alfred Hitchcock's quality in ability makes itself known with the famous 'eye shot' of Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) and the most perfect examples of suspense in films.<br/><br/>But the greatness doesn't end there, the eerie and gloomy exterior shots equal to notable cinematography, Norman Bates' (played by Anthony Perkins) sense of growing insanity and subtle desperation equals to one fine acting performance, and the well-acted dialogue scenes equal to the growth of plot suspense and magnificent character development. As mentioned, Anthony Perkins delivers a great display as motel owner Norman Bates, a great display of acting that keeps the audience in deep suspense. What's more prolific is the iconic 'shower scene', which makes use of the excellent orchestral string stabs along withwell, actual stabs.<br/><br/>One of the greatest and most influential stories in the history of fiction, along with insanely eerie outcomes, 'Psycho' really is a must- see for any movie fan."
"bcaulford","Null","0","0","22 April 2013"," Not the goriest horror movie you'll ever see
","Overall I found this movie very suspenseful and interesting. The fact that Norman was dealing with a split personality was a very strange way to explain the murders but at the same time I didn't see it coming. One thing that was somewhat pleasing but at the same time somewhat discouraging was the lack of blood and gore that you would typically see in today's horror films. During the scene of the first murder of Marion you could clearly see that she was being stabbed but at the same time you didn't see her cut up body, open wounds, or blood pouring down her body. You could only really see blood being flushed down the drain and even then it wasn't a lot of blood. I also found the cinematography to be good as well because during the murder scenes you could make out a shadow of the killer which made one believe that it was a woman because their hair was tied in a bun and you could clearly see women's clothing however that played an important role in making the murder unsuspecting by the audience and adds to the wow factor or the twist of who the murderer really is. Overall this was a well out together film and yet still suspenseful."

","""Psycho"" is simply the best horror film ever made. The story is incredible, the acting is near perfection, the cinematography is awesome, the soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find is the Inability to stand the test of time. One of the Reasons the shower scene has become so notorious Is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in the shower was something no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing double-Jason Spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. Psycho its nothing like that, it's more! Aside from this though, the movie is flawless, the cinematography it's just incredible. The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh to the beautiful and sexy Marion Crane; Vera Miles to the Concerned sister; Lila Crane excellent; and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins to the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates. The film not only scares you a lot, but leaves you stuck on screen until the end of the movie, and only the strong survive's the insane dialogs, mentally, in the end, it will haunt you to the end of your lives, because ... I'AM NORMA BATES!"

","Directed by Alfred Hitchcock<br/><br/>Starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin.<br/><br/>Written by Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch<br/><br/>'A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and subsequently encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.'<br/><br/>Upon the arrival of the new hit series 'Bates Motel' it has gotten me in a 'Psycho' mood. This was my first Alfred Hitchcock film and I must admit when I watched it, I broke the legendary Director's first and only rule : ""The picture you MUST see from the beginning... Or not at all!""<br/><br/>'Psycho' is one of those films I put with the elite like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Amadeus and The Godfather Series. These films changed my perspective on film in some form or another and when I speak about Psycho, I'm referring to storytelling and camera usage. Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job creating this film. Everything works! The story, the acting, the cinematography and the music! Hitchcock's efforts with the camera reminded me of 'Taxi Driver.' Often, the camera stole so much away from the actors' efforts when creating emotion on screen. There were positions and movements I've never seen before. The classic 'Shower Scene' reminded me a lot of Scorsese due to the fact of the quick cuts throughout and I'm not surprised Scorsese would take a few notes from Hitch.<br/><br/>The acting in this picture is something people never really emphasize and it is deservingly so. Not taking anything away from the actors/actresses but it was how 'Psycho' was shot that people will remember forever. But the cast was great! I will point out that I really enjoyed Anthony Perkins' fantastic performance as the legendary Norman Bates. When you see Perkins on screen, it's as if he has an extra layer around him that you want to rip off to reveal something you shouldn't know. You can see he's hiding something of some sort and you want to just shake it out of him. He keeps you on your toes throughout the film and you won't be able to blink without missing a detail.<br/><br/>Out of all the aspects I pointed out about 'Psycho', the music comes out as the triumphant winner. It's suspense at its finest! As Janet Leigh's character tries to escape with the $40,000, the music itself tells you everything you need to know about the emotions running through her body. The quick beats and violins' running imitating a heartbeat gives you goose bumps. But nothing is more terrifying than the screeching violins playing throughout the 'mother' scenes. A nice test everybody can attempt is to play the scenes without the music, you will see the impact the sounds has on the film. As every screech is heard, you flinch back and back with discomfort and want it to stop. Truth be told, Hitchcock originally wanted those scenes silent and we can all agree he would've made a huge mistake! It's absolute magic!<br/><br/>Psycho is a film that everybody should experience not only for entertainment purposes but as a history lesson in terrific filmmaking. It's difficult attempting to review this film without giving away anything but if you haven't seen 'Psycho', don't make the same mistake I did. Watch it from the beginning and don't stop"

","Everything about this movie is excellent. The genre of horror/thriller movies are always fun to watch, either alone if you're daring, or with a group of people to make it more fun. Hitchcock is a truly talented director, with many good movies, but this one is definitely up there on his list of great movies directed by him. The plot of ""Psycho"" is extremely engaging. It has a viewer on the edge of their seat during the entire movie. This movie also has some major plot twists that cause the viewer to question what in fact they are actually watching, but since it is a Hitchcock film, that should be expected. All in all though, this movie was great because it had a plot that kept an audience invested in the film, and the acting w as good too."
"gwnightscream","8","0","0","29 March 2013"," ""Mother Knows Best!""
","Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and John Gavin star in Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 thriller based on the novel. This begins one afternoon in Phoenix, Arizona where we meet woman, Marion Crane (Leigh) and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (Gavin). Marion is a bank teller who decides to take a great sum of money from a very important client & friend of her boss in order to help Sam pay his debts. She runs away and drives until she checks into an isolated motel owned by mild-mannered young man, Norman Bates (Perkins) who lives with his ill mother. After Norman confides in Marion, she's brutally murdered in her motel room. Miles plays her sister, Lila who eventually meets Sam and together they learn what she's done and try to find her. The answers lie in wait when they go to the Bates motel and discover the truth about Norman and his mother. This classic forever changed the way we take showers and has inspired many slasher films such as John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" where the kitchen knife, the name, Sam Loomis and Leigh's daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis were used to pay homage. It's definitely Hitchcock's signature film featuring a good cast & excellent score by Bernard Herrmann. I recommend this."

","My first time watching this movie was in high school. We were learning how to become a film critic. So in order to become a film critic, we needed to learn about the history of films. Psycho was a film that we needed to know the history of. Not being a fan of scary movies, watching this over and over again never gets old. The fact that this film was such a success to Hitchcock's life makes it a better watch. Also the fact that this is the film that all other films, including horror films, make reference to this very movie. The references stem from the music that plays, the scenes that were made, and the shots that were created. This film is the godfather of all horror films, to say the least. The history behind this film makes it a phenomenal film. Seeing the new released film Hitchcock, about the making of the movie with the leading star Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, has the original Psycho make so much more sense to those who haven't had the opportunity to study the history of this film. Both movies, recommended see."
"christophe92300","9","0","0","14 March 2013"," Probably Hitchcock's best
","Unlike most of Hitchcock's movies, everything in Psycho is excellent.<br/><br/>The script is consistent, coherent and captivating from start to finish. The actors are very convincing, special mention to Anthony Perkins who delivered a brilliant performance. Finally, the direction and mise-en-scène are of a high level as always, with great attention given to details.<br/><br/>But the most surprising thing is the two distinctive parts. The plot and main character defined at the beginning of the movie aren't the same at the end, because after about 30 minutes, the script takes a big turn, for the viewer's delight. How could one have anticipated such a twist so early in the movie and that shift in the story ? This is probably the best aspect of Psycho.<br/><br/>If there were any reproach to make, it would be about the lack of realism of the murders, especially the shower scene which incomprehensibly remained the token of the movie.<br/><br/>But it's minimal and Psycho remains probably the most accomplished feature of Hitchcock."

","A truly excellent piece of filmmaking; yes, it's a bit 'wordy' in places, but that was the style back then. There are equally many scenes in which there is no dialogue at all and these are even better in my book. Hitchcock knew just how much to show the audience to intrigue them and I so wish there were more filmmakers around today who were as adept as he was. The performances were all excellent; particularly Janet Leigh as the conflicted felon and Anthony Perkins as the mentally tortured motel owner. The only thing I felt let it down was the very long explanation towards the end; where every nuance of the condition afflicting Bates is exposed. I didn't feel that much detail was needed; but I could be nit-picking a bit here. It's a great piece of filmmaking and one every fan of the movies should see at least once.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED <br/><br/>My score: 9.4/10.<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","It depressed me when I accepted that I am probably the only one in my entire class who liked old, classic movies. True, it's kinda geeky, but it is still one of those things that I've always loved. In this same way I became interested in Alfred Hitchcock and his work, specifically Psycho. The first time I watched it, I absolutely loved it. The story, acting, screenplay, writing, art direction, everything was spot on and beautifully executed. I literally found no flaws with this movie. I was telling my friends about it and they didn't seem interested when I told them that this movie was made in 1960. After a few weeks, I went over to a friend's house and I made them watch it, no matter what. They think they've seen scary movies, (TCM, Friday the 13th, etc.) but when they watched Psycho, I've never seen someone so involved in a movie. They, just as I was when I first watched it, were yelling at the screen, covering their eyes, gasping every so often, and when it ended, they agreed that it was one of the best movies they have ever watched. They were completely intrigued by diversity of the movie compared to today's horror and thriller movies that they love. I asked them if they would watch more Alfred Hitchcock and they said, ""Of course!"" What I'm saying is that this movie is amazing, certainly Alfred Hitchcock's best work and the greatest thriller/horror of all time, and that if anyone who is reading this and is in the ""youth of America""; give classic (old) movies a chance!! It might be something you have to get used to, it being in black and white and all, but look past that and focus on the story and characters, and I promise you it will not fail to impress."

","Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was a revolutionary in the horror genre when it shocked audiences back in 1960. Watching it again on blu-ray I can say confidently it has held up extremely well. It stars Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin, all in strong performance, especially Perkins whose creepy yet vulnerable Norman Bates led to him being typecast as that character for the rest of his life. But without the touch of the master Hitchcock it would have been nothing more than a very decent thriller. The atmosphere is amazing, tension builds perfectly, and even if you know the outcome the shocking turns will leave those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing it with their hearts racing.<br/><br/>Marion Crane has stolen some money, a lot of money, in the irrational hope she can use it to help her boyfriend. After arousing the suspicion of a cop and a car dealer she arrives at the Bates Motel where she meets the odd but seemingly kind owner, Norman Bates. The rest, well spoiling anything else is either unforgivable because it's so huge or pointless because so many people, even without having seen it, know the major twist going in. I knew the shocker before I first saw the movie, but if it dampened the experience it didn't do it by much. Every scene has a purpose (yes even that ending that some think was unnecessary), every character is meaningful and many shots are unforgettable. This one of Hitchcock's best and arguably the greatest horror film ever made."

","I enjoyed this movie very much. I thought the plot was excellent and really held my attention. Hitchcock is known to make great movies and I don't think he fell short of that with this one. It is a great horror film, and a great film noir. The way it is edited is unique too. For intense, the bathroom shower scene. You never actually see the knife cutting into her body, but the way it is filmed and edited, you know what is happening and feel the intensity of the moment none the less. Another unique, and definitely Hitchcock aspect, is when the private detective falls down the stairs after being stabbed. It is a very dramatic and non-believable way of him falling, but it is done in a unique Albert Hitchcock way. The photography in this film is well done too. The use of low-key lighting helps with the suspense and dramatic feel that Hitchcock is looking for in this film."

This movie also shows that you don't need blood and gore to get your point across and scary and audience. Such a fantastic set of actor playing well in dept characters that really make the movie.

The movie has some of the best plot twists toward the middle I've ever seen, the control of climax and character study, their psychology and manners is impressive. There's a pleasurable amount of photographic technique and detail, of precision throughout the film and that makes it lasting. There's very little gore or violence which is great, because it leaves that up to the imagination unlike other films. Some of the actors come across brilliantly in their creepiness and darkness, and their motives aren't always exactly known, the thrill is skillfully and cleverly composed and arranged and released throughout the film, it lives up to its name."

","I don't have much to say about Psycho because it's already so well known, and I'll probably ruin it for those who haven't seen it; so I'll keep this brief. Psycho is probably the greatest horror movie of all time. It broke new grounds in film violence with its famous shower scene, and launched the slasher genre. No more atomic age, bring on the psychopaths. Now, this movie isn't like The Exorcist or The Shining, where you'll have nightmares over it; but unlike those movies, this movie keeps you on edge constantly. The whole time, there's just this nervous energy, and you never know what to expect. Hitchcock always believed that there's no terror in the bang, just in the anticipation of it. There are these long scenes that just have you biting your nails the whole time. By the end of the movie, you'll be wondering what happened to your fingers. The movie doesn't rely on cheap horror movie gimmicks. It's not gory, it doesn't use jump scares; the horror lies in the dialogue, the performances, the cinematography, the lighting, the music, and the story. This isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but I still believe it's the greatest horror movie of all time. Why? Because it's the classiest the genre has to offer. Today, the horror genre is so dumbed down, and so unoriginal, that it's nice to look back and see that the horror genre can be done well, and respected for something other than blood and nudity. Psycho is one of the greatest, most suspenseful, most controversial films of all time, and I love it. Hitchcock really knows how to bring on the scares."

It was superbly done, much like John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween where the musical score is what gave everyone the fright<br/><br/>***DIRECTING***<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's directing of the film was superb. Many regard this as his best film and even though I have not seen any other Hitchcock film, I can understand why. The pacing, the dialogue, the correct casting and the right plot and characters were handled exceptionally well by Hitchcock. <br/><br/>***STORY***<br/><br/>The story here was extremely interesting and made sure you wanted to watch the end of the film. The way the entire story unfolds by the end and the twist it takes was so well done that most film experts wouldn't have guessed it coming.<br/><br/>***CHARACTERS***<br/><br/>Unlike many stupid slasher films such as Friday the 13th where half the characters are complete jerks and you honestly don't give a s**t what happens, the same does not happen here. Every character has some problem during their life: Sam, Marion and Norman. When characters such as Abergast and Marion die, you feel the certain pity. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is exceptional. Those who haven't seen it, please do yourself a favor now and watch it."

","Psycho is a respected classic for being the first slasher film. Its great and you must respect it for starting a new breed of films. But it seemed to be a bit boring. Now I'm not saying its not great, but for a suspenseful movie it was boring. But it is a movie from the 60s so it is still pretty amazing for being a classic. Plus the acting is great and Anthony Perkins does an amazing job presenting himself , he is just chilling to the bone. All critique aside, I love this film. In particular, the shower scene. It is easily one of the most chilling horror scenes of all time, and I'm sure audiences who first viewed it were floored. It is so effective because the viewer never sees the knife actually penetrating the victim's skin. Its all left to your imagination."

","Psycho is one of Those Movies that you always hear about but rarely manage to sit down and see for one reason or another. I'm honestly thrilled that I took the time to do that for my cinema class, because I've discovered yet another incredible movie I probably never would have watched any other way. It's a perfect example of a late code film that's trying to deal with mature subject matter. I find the use of cuts and editing and lighting to keep a murder mystery to Code really fascinating to watch, and I have, over and over again. While at times the movie has a certain ""underexposed"" feel (very dark, that is to say), that hardly detracts from the plot. In fact, it adds to it. You really feel the imposing darkness at night, the dim lighting of the house above the Bates hotel, and the brightness of day. Also, the use of sound is really interesting not with the voices or the various background noises, but the score itself, especially in the iconic ""Shower scene"". Truly a must-see."

","I went to see this movie with no big informations about it-- I only knew it was directed by Hitckcock and had a scary shower scene. I didn't even know it was black and white. Let's start praising the story: it is completely original and surprising. No one would guess she'd be killed by Norman, nor would imagine this guy had a double personality. All scenes are very entertaining, specially in Norman's house. Directing does its best to thrill the spectator, and I can affirm that two or three scenes are quite scary and suspenseful. I really don't know what else I can describe about this movie; this is excellent and everyone should watch it at least once. Period."

","The cinematography for this film stood out to be as near perfection. The shower scene for which Marion is stabbed to death is deemed to be as skill-full as cinematography could get in this time period. The storyline was interesting and served as a bit of a mystery to the viewer. The acting was believable and they could not have possibly cast better actors for each role. The grim and sort of scary storyline stood out to among the films i've viewed from this time period. I liked how it was kept a secret until the end that Norman's mother was dead, although I kind of started to suspect this in the middle. It was unusual for the ""main character"" (Marion) to be killed off so early on, and this came as a bit of a shock to me. And surprises in films are what make them successful as opposed to predictable plots.This film is legendary in the history or horror films and set the bar for scary movies to come."

","Finally a good thriller. Horror movies are by far my favorite and I must say Alfread Hitchcock did a great job of casting a sense of fear. The movie started off a little slow, the story line was kind of boring to follow,and the acting really wasn't the best; but for some reason I still found the movie entertaining and convincing. During the horror scenes and the ending is when the movie really got interesting and even though the music was incredibly cheesy it worked well with the film. I enjoyed the fact that this movie didn't just focus on murder, it also played with the idea of being a true ""psycho"" by portraying the murderer with multiple personality disorder or maybe even schizophrenia.I can understand why this movie is a classic horror film and I think any fan of the genre needs to see this film, if they haven't already. It sets the framework for may horror films that have been produced later on and gives a certain standard they have to meet."

","Psycho Is about a young woman, Marion, who steals $40,000 from her employer in order for her to start a new life with her secret lover. On her way to him she is forced by sleep and rain to stop at a motel. Here she meets this young man that is controlled by his mother. Psycho is very well known for its famous shower stabbing scene. Alfred Hitchcock made the scene seem so real, but without even showing Marion getting stabbed. Marion's sister and friend come looking for her and soon find out the truth(which i will not give away). The ending was very unpredictable, and well done. I give this film a 7 out of 10 because I thought Hitchcock did a very good job creating this film, but it did not really keep me entertained."

","There's no denying Psycho's classic horror status. Hitchcock had done creepy Gothicism before, such as in Rebecca, and he'd done charming murderers before, such as in Strangers on A Train, but he hadn't done a slasher.<br/><br/>Psycho is what it says on the tin: it's about a psycho. Exploring the deep psychosis of a murderer was not something that had been done in Hollywood film before. We all know the shower scene but not everybody knows the nature of Bates' psychosis so I won't say anything on that topic. The psychiatrist at the end is a clumsy clunky Hollywood addition explaining the blatantly obvious. I fail to see that in 1960, the audience wouldn't have worked it out. It's a testament to Hitchcock that he still manages a creepy final scene. Bates may be a psycho but we can't dismiss him in the way that we may have dismissed previous psychotic villains.<br/><br/>Of course, the star of the film is Anthony Perkins. Everybody else is either bland or annoying and quite frankly, you want them all to die (maybe not the hot guy). Janet Leigh as Marion Crane...thank god we didn't have to spend too long with her. She spends most of the film in her bra (now a horror cliché)and steals loads of money from her boss. It's interesting that Hitchcock chose to make her so unsympathetic.<br/><br/>Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, the proprietor of the motel that Marion checks into. He looks just like a creepy bird but initially he's quite sweet. It took me a minute to clock that he was going to be our psycho. One thing I will say on his psychosis was that the psychiatrist says he is straight, which I don't entirely buy. I think that's just to placate the audience.<br/><br/>Now, Psycho has been compared to Peeping Tom (or rather, Peeping Tom has been endlessly compared to Psycho. See my review on Peeping Tom for more info). Peeping Tom came out a few months before and on the surface it has a lot in common with Psycho: both have a handsome man who is psychologically disturbed with parental troubles and murders women. However the major difference is that Psycho cemented Hitchcock's reputation and Peeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's illustrious career. So what gives? Psycho has lingering shots of a woman in a bra, gore and explicit horror; Peeping Tom has no blood, only brief nudity and no explicit horror. Surely if any film was going to shock the critics, it would be Psycho? Yet the only thing that the British censors objected to in that film was a flushing toilet.<br/><br/>Actually, no. Hitchcock was famously the master of suspense and had dabbled in types of horror before- it was obvious that he would progress to something like Psycho. Powell was known for his partnership with Emeric Pressburger, making beautiful innocent British films (although at times some of them are very dark). He threw a curve ball and we couldn't take it. In some ways, Psycho is a mystery story and in the moments when the boyfriend and Marion's sister are exploring the motel, it brings to mind some of the creaky mystery moments Hitchcock had in his earlier films (Stage Fright, for example). Peeping Tom is not a mystery story. Bates is a main character but Mark Lewis is our protagonist. We see everything through his eyes. Both characters are handsome and polite but once we know something's up with Bates, we don't view him in that way. We always know that something's up with Mark Lewis and yet he's so adorable and polite and we never want him to get caught. Ironically, there are many moments where he almost gives himself away and we're shouting at the screen telling him not to.<br/><br/>As for the psychology, Psycho explains everything. Bates is a classic textbook psycho. Lewis is a very disturbed pervert but he's more than a Psycho. His problems stem from the sadistic experiments his father does on him. We see some, but not all. What we do see is horrible but it's only scratching the surface. It's a more interesting imaginative bit of psychology than Psycho.<br/><br/>Finally, the cinematography. Both films do brilliantly here- there's lots of creepy jump cuts and close-ups in Psycho. A particularly creepy moment is when Bates is framed by lots of stuffed birds glaring down at him. And it's all in scary black-and-white but not the cliché lurking in the shadows. But for my money, the cinematography in Peeping Tom is better. It's filmed in garish seedy colour, which makes it all the more scary. There's a clever bit of filming where Mark is looking through a grill with a birds eye view of the room and then the angle changes so we see the pens from his pocket falling down. The whole premise of Peeping Tom is a guy who kills with his camera and the cinematography takes full advantage of this. Filming in shadows and gloom is a cliché- luckily neither film does that.<br/><br/>Psycho is still a scary film- dated in its treatment of the secondary characters but modern as ever with its treatment of the psycho. Loads of thrills and chills to be had here. This film changed the horror genre in America forever."

","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" still stands tall as one of the most riveting shockers ever made. At the time, it was an interesting experiment for the director, having been filmed on a low budget and in black & white. It introduced characters and scenes that became an enormous part of the popular culture and influenced a GREAT many films that followed.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Robert Bloch (itself inspired by the exploits of real-life madman Ed Gein), it manages one of the absolute best twists in plot to be committed to film, making us believe it's about secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her impulsive theft of her boss' clients' money, only to jerk the rug out from under us in a now legendary ""shower sequence"". Marion makes the fateful decision of seeking shelter in the way-out-of-the-way Bates Motel, run by peculiar young man Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly wimpy person who's dominated by his shrewish Mother.<br/><br/>It's a testament to how powerful and endlessly entertaining ""Psycho"" is, that it can continue to enthral us no matter how many times we see it. Hitchcocks' murder set pieces are the kind you never forget, and they're made all the more so by the most infamous (and imitated) of all of Bernard Herrmanns' music scores. It really helps to drive the movie forward, and Hitch and company create some truly delicious atmosphere, especially when it comes to *that* house, looking sinister and foreboding up on its hill. Screenwriter Joseph Stefano does impressive things with dialogue and a top notch cast memorably brings the characters to life. Perkins is just tremendous in the role of Norman, so tremendous that the role and performance would loom large for the rest of his life and career. Vera Miles is wonderfully feisty as Marions' sister, who'll stop at nothing to find her, while John Gavin makes for a stoic hero. Leigh is winning in the role of the larcenous Marion and her scenes with Perkins are superb. Great character players like Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Frank Albertson, John Anderson, Mort Mills, and Simon Oakland round out the cast, while Hitchs' daughter Pat plays the role of Caroline.<br/><br/>They all help to make watching this a rich experience, one that can look even better after repeat viewings, with elements (the bird imagery & references, for example) one might not fully appreciate on the first viewing. This is a movie milestone that everybody ought to see at least once.<br/><br/>Followed by three sequels, the TV movie 'Bates Motel', a remake, and the 'Bates Motel' TV series.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","I would recommend this movie to anyone. I'm not one for suspense, but I liked this movie. On the other hand, I personally wouldn't call it a horror film. But for when it was made it is pretty accurate. I thought all the lighting and sound was perfect, I didn't notice anything jumping out at me with those two categories. I thought the camera angles and shots were well done too. What I did notice though, was the pacing of the film. I thought it started out slower and was fast at the end.

","Psycho is widely regarded as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of the first slasher films ever made.<br/><br/>In Phoenix, Arizona, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary who steals with $40,000 from one of her bosses clients. Marion flees the city and goes on a trip where sees ends up staying at the Bates Motel, meeting the owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who has a very unusual relationship with his mother.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is of course the master of suspense and throughout Psycho there is a very intense atmosphere throughout the film. There is constant tension and build up during the film with Hitchcock using long takes and conversations, dark shots and imaginary and that very famous film score. Whilst the film is a horror and slasher, Hitchcock allows us to know the characters and he plays to his strength as a thriller director, particular in the second half. This is not a film about violence and killings like a lot of modern slashers are. It is a film particularly at the time that aimed to shock you with the violence, not for you to linger or relish it.<br/><br/>There is an excellent cast in the film and it is clear why the role of Norman Bates was so iconic for Perkins. Perkins gave Bates a nervous energy with his seemingly shy, nice demeanour which secretly harbours a dark personality and secret. The last shot of the film makes Perkins look very much like Heath Ledger's version of the Joker with his creepy smile.<br/><br/>Psycho was a risky film for the time: bloody on screen violence was rarity, even when it saved a narrative purpose and the woman who is the main character gets killed off at around 50 minute mark. This is a story technique that is still rarity used and most films still stick to a traditional narrative. Because of the killing Hitchcock changes the style of film from a horror to thriller/mystery and Hitchcock is able to blend them together perfectly.<br/><br/>Psycho is of course a classic film and great example that tension and likable/relatable characters are key for a horror film to success. The visions, performances, atmosphere and music were all fitting for the film."
"jose-cruz53","8","0","0","2 October 2012"," Excellent psychological thriller
","That's my current favorite Hitchcock film. Its more of a terror film than a psychological thriller and this is the reason I like it: its the only Hitchcock film that has really managed to scare me. However, I do not consider a film such as this as ""a great film"", simply because I am not the greatest fan of such type of genre. Still, I admit it is a masterpiece of its genre and the fans of such films will certainly love this movie.<br/><br/>Also, given it is a very old film, it has some flaws given its obsolete pacing and structure. The story drags a little in the first half of the film and later it seems to be rushed through. Though in a sense this improves the final dramatic shock of the film. The ending is totally ""holy sh*t this is great!"", though I took off two points out of 10 because of its incomplete nature as a film."
"uswilches","Null","0","0","1 October 2012"," Analysis
","At the starting scenes the camera's subjective eye fly over a town and approaches several windows what gives the audience the feeling that they can choose which window to look through. The way the main character is portrayed at the beginning of the movie shows that Hitchcock wanted the audience to sympathize with Marion, so now the audience experiences Marion's frustration, fear, anxiety. The constant use of imaginative voice-over experienced by the main character's conscience intensifies the emotional sharing. Throughout the movie the music suggests characters are in danger, experiencing anxiety or looking for something. Whenever the scenario presented is not in those conditions, the characters find themselves engaging in normal behaviors with little suggestion about what is prone to happen. Marion, at her workplace, engages in a talk with Cassidy (the drunk client who is buying his daughter a house), the way he acts makes the audience to sympathize even more with Marion's feelings and intentions. Various close face shots: Marion looking at her mirror, a hotel window reflecting Marion and Normal together, suggests some type of voyeurism where questions of privacy are inferred, portraying that a character is never alone and that there is always someone watching/being watched. From the moment Marion is on the run to California to be with Sam, with the money she stole, the scene where she pulls over to the side of the road to sleep and the police officer questions her sets the climate for the rest of the movie where again, close face shots are used and Marion's thoughts can be heard. Marion seeks shelter in a motel by the road when she faces a storm on the way to California, the remoteness of the motel she stays at intrigues the audience with what is about to happen. It's easy to assume that Marion is about to do something she shouldn't due to her reaction when she sees her boss crossing the street. Some events like Marion being by herself most of the time, seeking shelter in unknown places, being in a hurry when trading her car, suggests that she is in danger and creates a powerful suspense due to the fact that by today's standards someone in the situation she is, might be too vulnerable. The killer in this movie, normally portrayed as a ""monster"" to scare the audience, is shown as someone normal, which is scarier and creepier. The audience is presented with Norman's private world towards the end where an investigation is taking place. Masked shots gives the audience a peephole to watch the scenes through what intensifies any association the audience my have with Norman.<br/><br/>This review points out fundamental elements viewed in the movie to link the audience's experience along with the characters' emotions. Elements that might have been unnoticeable for some are explained as the movie has little elements presented that bring the audience to experience what the characters experience."

","They don't come any crazier than Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). This Psycho thriller was a classic horror movie in the 60s, with a score (soundtrack) that is breath taking.<br/><br/>It also had four Academy Award nominations. Psycho is considered one of Hitchcock's best films, and it is ranked among the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Robert Bloch which in turn was based loosely on the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein.<br/><br/>Paramount felt the book was ""too repulsive"" and ""impossible for films"" and they did not like ""anything about it at all"" and denied Hitchcock his usual budget. So, Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions.<br/><br/>The movie was then shot in black and white to keep the budget below $ 1,000,000.<br/><br/>The movie story is about a Secretary who embezzled $ 40,000 from her company, to go share with her boyfriend.<br/><br/>On her way to their meeting place she stops over at a motel, owned by Norman Bates, who has been long under the control of his mother and is out of place in this world.<br/><br/>The famous shower scene, which was the murder of Janet Leigh's character in the shower, is the film's pivotal scene and one of the best-known scenes in all of cinema history. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17 to December 23, 1959, and features 77 different camera angles. The scene ""runs 3 minutes and includes 50 cuts.<br/><br/>Perkins did well and the whole movie actors were excellent in their portrayals, this gave the movie the edge that it had.<br/><br/>I do hope you take the time to see this movie."

","There have only been a small handful of horror films (in my option) to have toped Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (The Shining & Halloween I & II). Well what can I say about this timeless classic? Nothing really but I'll try. But first I HAVE to start off by saying that Alfred Hitchcock truly is the master of suspense and this truly is his masterpiece and he has had MANY great films and a handful of them have made Damian's Top 250 Movies of All-Time (The Birds, Vertigo, & Rear Window to name a few). But anyway there's nothing I can really think of to say about this film so I'll have to go into the story which EVERYONE knows.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend waking up after an afternoon of sex. Then she goes to work and has to drop off $40,000 at the bank (also with inflammation that's A lot of cash almost or about $250,000 in America's currency). But she decides to runaway with it and stops for the night at Bates Motel where she meets nervous but the seemingly gentle Norman Bates who keeps her company and has dinner with her and gives his famous ""A boys best friend is his mother speech"". Then after that we ALL knows what happens next Marion goes to take a shower and the famous ""shower scene"" happens (and I could imagine how it was for people in theatres). So after she's killed by what was seemingly Norman's mother Norman finds her dead body and cleans up the bathroom and puts her body into her car and pushes it into quicksand. So then the second half of the film is basically Marion's sister, boyfriends & detective Abergast trying to find her but he's killed and the. They find that Norman's mother is skeleton and the one that's supposedly ""Norman's Mother"" is Norman himself!!!! So they apprehend him and Norman is taken away and the film ends there.<br/><br/>Now like I said Alfred Hitchcock (may he rest in peace) truly is the master of suspense and this really is his masterpiece and my favorite of all of his films. The acting in this movie is amazing Janet Leigh (mother of successful actress Jamie Lee Curtis who would star in the John Carpenter classic masterpiece ""Halloween"" that was heavily influenced by ""Psycho"") was excellent as Marion Crane, but the real star of the film is the late and great Anthony Perkins (who tragically died of AIDS may he rest along with Mr. Hitchcock) who portrayed Norman Bates PERFECTLY he really seemed like a nervous, shy man who was afraid of his own shadow he played the part down to the T (hell of a lot better than Vince Vaughn in the remake that shall not be spoken of). Hitchcock's brilliant writing and directing has made this one of the greatest films I've ever seen to date and on Damian's Top 250 Films of All-Time this ranks at #29. This film really is amazing. I've only seen this a few times and the VERY first time I saw it the suspense just had me glued to the film and I couldn't look away again and I have to say one more time: bravo Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins may you both rest in peace. ***** Out of ***** Stars"

","¨I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.¨ Psycho is the master of all suspense thrillers and I will include it in my list of masterpieces. It was way ahead of its time and continues to impress today. This is where the term Hitchcockian came from to describe these psychological horror films that have been inspired by the great Hitchcock. It's been over 50 years since Hitchcock directed this film, and horror directors are still trying to imitate what he did. One of the things I enjoyed the most about this film is the way that Hitch fooled us all into thinking that it was going to be about Janet Leigh's character and ended up killing her off in the first half of the movie. I hadn't seen this film before, but had seen the famous shower scene thousands of times before. It's amongst the greatest scenes in film history considering the way Hitch filmed every shot taking the audience by surprise. I always thought that scene was the final one, so I was surprised to see it only 40 minutes into the movie. From that moment on I was sold and on board with what other unexpected turn the movie was going to make. Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates was the highlight of the movie for me. He was excellent in his role and I was surprised he didn't get much credit for it. I think he was much better than the rest of the cast. I also imagine what a surprise the ending must have been for most people during the time since it was something totally unprecedented. I did see it coming now of course since so many films have copied the format, but I can only imagine the initial reaction. Psycho was also the perfect title for the film.<br/><br/>As for the story goes it deals with an office worker from a small town in Arizona named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is in her early 30's and single. She has to meet with her love interest, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in secret during lunch hours in a motel because he is from out of town and buried in debts due to alimony payments. When she arrives at work from her break she stumbles upon 40,000 dollars that her boss hands over to her to deposit in the bank. During a moment of irrationality she decides to keep the money and begin a new life in some other town. She takes off as soon as she can and begins driving away from the city as fast as possible. Tired after the long drive, Marion ends up staying at a motel off the highway for the night. The motel is run by a friendly young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who tells Marion that they don't get many visitors nowadays. He offers her something to eat before she goes to bed, and she accepts. She later hears Norman discussing with his mother about his invitation and discovers that he is dominated by her. Her strong influence over him worries Marion, but she is tired and just once to rest before continuing her trip. Norman may not be the friendly young man who he seems to be after we see him watch her from a peeping hole. What follows is the famous shower scene and then the story continues with several twists and surprises.<br/><br/>I've heard many complaints about the final scene of this great film which was adapted by Joseph Stefano, from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name. I can understand how this scene may seem out of place, especially now because the audience is expected to piece everything on their own, but I consider it necessary for the time because audiences weren't familiar with the psychotic term or connotation. Of course the explanation seems out of place today because we all understand what has happened, but in the 60's this film was way ahead of its time and had no precedents so it was necessary to spell everything out to the audience. I may be wrong, but I still don't have a problem with that scene although I do admit it is one of the only scenes in the film that hasn't aged well. Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors and I wish more directors would make psychological thrillers as well as he did. Psycho is probably one of his most recognized works, but I still think his best movie all time is Rear Window. If you haven't seen these movies by all means go watch them because they are timeless.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"Kane20","9","0","0","1 July 2012"," Review - Psycho (1960)
","Psycho is a good, memorable film. I don't love it, but I do like it; it's a good piece of cinema and is notable for many things. First of all, the black-and-white cinematography is good, and it really contributes to the tone and mood of the film. There are several great camera shots and sequences. The music is good too, and it also contributes to the tone of the film, probably even more so than the cinematography. Finally, and probably most importantly, the film is noteworthy for its storytelling. Alfred Hitchcock broke several Hollywood cinema traditions of the time, and created a film that contains elements that can be easily recycled, yet at the same time is very unique, and is a good mystery horror thriller.<br/><br/>The story isn't all that great, but what makes it good and involving is the way it develops and unfolds. There are a lot of aspects of the movie that are not so special, and ones that have been used again and again over the years. There are some things about the movie that seem cliché, and possibly a bit cheesy. However, despite all this, after all these years, Psycho still has a uniqueness that is memorable and ultimately not copied to this day. Like I said, it's not the most extraordinary story, but it's structured in a great way. It tampers with some traditional narrative elements. It starts out seemingly normal in terms of narrative. Then, we are shocked at the movie's midpoint as Marion, our protagonist for the first half of the movie, is killed, and the course of the film is drastically changed, and what follows is a series of (like I said before) shocking discoveries and twists. The audience's expectations keep being flouted, especially in the second half of the film, especially in two major ones, the second of which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. It doesn't have great story or character complexity, but yes, it's strong.<br/><br/>The stark black-and-white cinematography used in the film is very good, and even further contributes the the tone of the film. Also, by far one of the most important aspects of the film is the music. Bernard Herrmann composed an excellent score for the film. The film works fine with its narrative alone, but the music really brings it all to life and supports everything. The music consisted of all string instruments, and the music is consistently dissonant and tense. The music, like everything else about the film, can be easily recycled in movies, but, like I said before, Psycho still has a level of uniqueness that really can't be matched.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an important landmark in the history of cinema, and it's still a good film, even to this day - not at a four-star level, but still very good. I found it to be a very good movie experience. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do."

","Psycho is by far one of my favorite horror movies. Hitchcock was a phenomenal director, and a phenomenal screenwriter as well. I've never seen a movie with a more perfect script than this. The story is told so well, that i've seen this probably ten times and have never gotten bored or annoyed by it. Anthony Perkins plays a phenomenally creepy mentally insane murderer, who in all truthfulness haunted my dreams for years. I know have a healthy respect for him but only because he plays his part so insanely well. Anthony Perkins is what makes Psycho, Psycho. The shot by shot remake of this film, while identical in every way was missing the most vital thing, Perkins. He can not be replaced, as no one can mimic the character he became to complete this film. The chemistry was seriously lacking in the remake because you copy Hitchcock, but you can't be him, you can't be his genius."

","Who kills the ""main character"" in the first half hour of the film. (By the way, the answer is Hitchcock.) That is just the kind of film making that he is known for, and Hitchcock does not disappoint on this one. <br/><br/>Lighting played a crucial part in this movie. Whether is was Norman staring from his darkened room through two holes cut in the wall or having sandwiches amongst the stuffed birds that adorn the walls, the light really emphasized fear and vulnerability. Even scenes with Norman's ""mother"" are so well lit, they keep that air of mystery.<br/><br/>I suppose that I should talk about the most famous scene in the movie. Other than it being awesome, it has possible the best montage in a movie ever. It is certainly the best done. You have to force yourself to take in the whole thing. The brilliance of the montage is that you will miss something every time, but if you keep watching it, you have the potential to pick something up every time."

","This rated R flick is probably one of the best horror movies I've seen. It is unusual, thrilling and suspenseful all in one. I definitely thought the shower scene was the best part, and I surely won't forget it.<br/><br/>However, I think I agree with the rest of Psycho's audience by saying it is one of the most memorable scenes of all time.<br/><br/>Hitchcock does an awesome job, in my opinion, with combining crime, sex and suspense, but that's nothing new. He takes an unreal and immortal topic to a realistic level. However, it is definitely not for the young ones! It's filled with blood and surprises but it's a definite must for those adult thrill seekers."

","Although his filmography is studded with gems, no other Hitchcock film has lodged itself in the popular consciousness as firmly as Psycho. It provides chills as a ripped-from-the- headlines slasher flick, but its macabre surfaces conceal its deeper mordant cultural resonances. In Psycho, many of Hitchcock's major tactics fall under the wide umbrella of postmodernism. Although made within the confines of the last vestiges of the classic Hollywood studio system, Psycho distinguishes itself as a subversive postmodern cinematic text. <br/><br/>Hitchcock's is the dominating presence in the film. From the beginning we are privy to dastardly deeds done by less-than-savory people. Yet, even as the brutality is ratcheted up (culminating in Marion's death), the audience remains engaged and more specifically entertained. The traditionally positive and pure elements of society when viewed through Hitchcock's lens are rendered resoundingly impure. Caroline, Marion's pestering co-worker, needed tranquilizers to survive her own wedding; Tom Cassidy heartily recommends the practice of ""buying off unhappiness"" to turn it into something approaching happiness; police and detectives fail to provide satisfactory protection; and in the Bates family one certainly begins to doubt that mother knows best. This is contrasted to the immoralities within the film. Sam and Marion's affair, Marion's theft, and Norman's killings are, without exception, attractively presented. The affair titillates, turning Marion into an erotic symbol. By the time of the theft, Marion has won the allegiance of the audience. Even the film's most legendary element, the shower scene, can today be viewed as more giddy than gory. It plays more as symphony than tragedy. It is a feat of timing and rhythm with precise and effective choreography. Traditional horror films dare the audience to look at the screen; Psycho dares us to look away and we simply cannot. <br/><br/>The film itself defies convention and flaunts expectations at every turn. At the end of the first act, it abruptly transfers the mantle of protagonist from Marion Crane to Norman Bates. The transfer makes sense. After all, these are the only two characters in the film that truly matter. In the words of critic David Thomson, ""they are the only two players in the film whom Hitchcock liked or was interested in"". As a mainstream Hollywood director, Hitchcock's interest in these two people, one a thief, the other a psychologically fractured killer is in and of itself subversive of audience expectations. Psycho was released in mid-1960 still very much in the shadow of the outwardly wholesome, domesticated Eisenhower era. To have a film focused on such behavior in the era of Leave it to Beaver was not only bold, it was unprecedented in mainstream American cinema. Psycho's low-rent aesthetic of highway towns and motel rooms is unique in the typically more elaborate and glamorous Hitchcock oeuvre. In an era when films were bought and sold based on star power, Hitchcock bumps off poor Janet Leigh (herself only a moderate star at the time) by the close of the first act. Audiences thought they knew what they could expect from the movies, especially the ones made by ""Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock; but the moment that shower curtain opens to the ascending strings of Bernard Herrmann's score, all bets are off. No one and nothing is safe, not even the lifestyles of the rich and famous.<br/><br/>Apart from its more coy and wily elements, Psycho is also a film preoccupied with surfaces and appearances. By virtue of the funhouse construction of the film, Hitchcock cannot be bothered with traditional character development. The four major characters of the piece— Norman, Marion, Sam, and Lila— act as doubles for one another. In Lila, we find traces of Marion. Both are traditionally attractive blondes, yet the sexual vivacity of Marion that her screen time so effectively showcases is dulled and diluted within Lila, who can seem pestering and frumpy in comparison. <br/><br/>These parallels perhaps could be written off due to the sister relationship between the two, except that the more interesting parallels between Sam and Norman undermine any sort of quick fix. Norman and Sam share a similar facial structure and hair color. Clearly, Sam is meant to represent the more stereotypically strapping male suitor, whereas Norman is best characterized as meek and uncertain. Yet, throughout the film our impressions of the two men are colored in surprising ways. Norman, despite his compulsions, comes off as a caring and compassionate young man, shy but capable of deep and true understanding. Hitchcock, in a move of swift and delicious irony, makes Norman into the most sensitive and kind person the picture has to offer. Norman's final conversation with Marion before her death is the film's most intimate scene. Although the two start the scene as total strangers, it is clear that they have had a deep effect on one another by the scene's close. In contrast, Sam seems increasingly boorish and bullying as the picture unspools. He's certainly less interesting than Norman. Indeed, we learn precious little regarding Sam in the movie's first half. Despite her claims of love, Marion spends relatively little time considering Sam's views of her actions. His hypothetical thoughts never enter her mind on the run from Phoenix. Her deepest emotional connection in the film is with Norman, and Sam seems to share a more matrimonial relationship with Lila than he does with Marion. Yet, in their momentary connection, Marion and Norman shared something more lively and meaningful than Sam seems to be capable of imagining. This lively connection, of course, must end in death in Hitchcock's world. Hitchcock, ever the ironist.<br/><br/>Psycho's endurance as a piece of popular art is quite a feat. In fact, the very existence of the film is worth championing. It is a film where commercial aims exist in equal balance to artistic ambitions, where those goals are allowed to be complimentary. It holds a mirror to a polluted world in order to reveal the cracks in the surface, an impure subject made enthralling through pure cinema."

","this movie is what Hitchcock was all about the over emotional characters to create tension, using the camera as another character interacting with the movie, has characters break cliché'e, and using suspense as information. these things are just some of the things that he really showed within this movie. in regards to the lighting of the movie is quite stunning, when you see the outside of the house he makes look very bright making it look welcoming. though when any character entered the house, it is very dark and mysterious. the contrast he used in the movie were quite interesting. for example when the lady is being killed in the shower the contrast of the blood on the white tile and white tub gives the flow of blood definition. another interesting thing about that scene is you never see the knife make contact with the lady. it always has a jump cut to a blood splatter or it running down the drain. over all i think this is one of his best movies, the way he keeps you on the edge of your seat makes a movie for me and a added bonus is when a movie can continue to do it no matter how many times you see it!"

","Picking the best Hitchcock film to watch is an exercise that will totally frustrate you. There are so many great ones. When it comes to terror, no film can beat this one. Rear Window may edge it out (only by a hair) for excellence, but not for sheer terror.<br/><br/>I really didn't recall the humorous set up in the beginning with Frank Albertson, but it did provide a way for Oscar nominee Janet Leigh and John Gavin to finally find happiness. Hard to believe a boss (Vaughn Taylor) would allow an employee to take the equivalent of $277,000 to the bank alone.<br/><br/>I cannot understand why Oscar nominee Anthony Perkins wasn't at least nominated for his role here. I guess I couldn't think of one nominee that I could replace that year. Burt Lancaster won the Oscar for Elmer Gantry. Perkins did win at Cannes the same year for Goodbye Again.<br/><br/>There were some other great actors in the film: Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Anderson, and John McIntire (""Wagon Train"").<br/><br/>Great direction, great cinematography and a great story."

","The face of Anthony Perkins aka Norman Bates as the psycho has burned itself deep into the mindset of moviegoers since Hitchcock's horror thriller hit the silver screens in 1960. It's essential for a whole genre, as iconic and unmistakable as Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster in Jack Pierce's make-up and will be for many more generations to come. As far as horror movies go it can't get any better than this. Anthony Perkins remains stuck in your mind due to his nervously shy performance throughout most of the film, likable and odd at the same time, and the ice cold twist at the end makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>But the film is much more than Perkins. It's Robert Bloch's excellent script, Bernard Herrmann outstanding score, and then there's the director. Hitch shows his handwriting as the master of suspense in every detail. The black and white cinematography of course is crucial and used to perfection in ""Psycho"", the shadows and tilted angles contribute to an unnerving atmosphere. And who else would get rid of someone introduced as the protagonist after a third of the film? Or take the famous shower scene, where the master demonstrates his cutting edge editing abilities, literally. It's reduced to the necessary minimum, artistically composed for maximum effect. And the mise en scÃ¨ne of the final revelation, the secret that awaits in the basement? Heart-stopping. In short: ""Psycho"" spells the ABC of horror, and rightfully so."

The fact that even the killer doesn't know who he is adds a bigger feeling of mystery, and makes it more difficult for the viewer to find out who the killer is.

The shower scene is not extremely violent but none-the-less very effective especially for that time period.

","A secretary steals $40,000 from her employer and during her escape she stops at the Bates Motel to hide out; big mistake as the proprietor is the one and only Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), a real oddball who tells the girl, Marion(Janet Leigh) that he gets very few customers and that he lives with mother who lives upstairs. He invites her to dinner and she overhears him arguing with her over the proposed date. Mom is the ultimate control freak and she warn him about the evil ways of women. What follows may be the most famous shower scene in the history of cinema, so there is no need to describe it here, as no one since as been able to improve on Alfred Hitchcock's subtle way of making the viewer actually use their own imagination. A standard detective drama follows with Marion's sister Lila(Vera Miles) pairing up with private eye Milton Arbogast(Martin Balsam) to find her missing sibling. Norman turns out to be a severely disturbed individual with an extremely strange secret. If you haven't yet seen the 1960 version of Psycho, see it and marvel at the work of a master director."

","There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low- budget job. With a minimum of complication, it gets off to a black-and- white start with the arrival of a fugitive girl with a stolen bankroll at an eerie motel.<br/><br/>Well, perhaps it doesn't get her there too swiftly. That's another little thing about this film. It does seem slowly paced for Mr. Hitchcock and given over to a lot of small detail. But when it does get her to the motel and apparently settled for the night, it turns out this isolated haven is, indeed, a haunted house.<br/><br/>The young man who diffidently tends it -- he is Anthony Perkins and the girl is Janet Leigh -- is a queer duck, given to smirks and giggles and swift dashes up to a stark Victorian mansion on a hill. There, it appears, he has a mother -- a cantankerous old woman -- concealed. And that mother, as it soon develops, is deft at creeping up with a knife and sticking holes into people, drawing considerable blood.<br/><br/>That's the way it is with Mr. Hitchcock's picture -- slow buildups to sudden shocks that are old-fashioned melodramatics, however effective and sure, until a couple of people have been gruesomely punctured and the mystery of the haunted house has been revealed. Then it may be a matter of question whether Mr. Hitchcock points of psychology, the sort of highly favored by Krafft-Ebing, are as reliable as his melodramatic stunts.<br/><br/>Frankly, we feel his explanations are a bit of leg-pulling by a man who has been known to resort to such tactics in his former films.<br/><br/>The consequence is his denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair. Mr. Perkins and Miss Leigh perform with verve, and Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam do well enough in other roles.<br/><br/>The one thing we would note with disappointment is that, among the stuffed birds that adorn the motel office of Mr. Perkins, there are no significant bats."

","Even amongst classic film legends such as Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963), arguably Alfred Hitchcock's most famous movie is Psycho (1960). Considered a horror icon, it excels in both cinematic tension as well as sheer terror. It accomplishes this through a variety of techniques, such as composer Bernard Herrmann's chilling score, or the ominous low-key lighting of John L. Russell's cinematography. Consider in itself the mise en scene of the creepy Bates Motel itself. But an important factor that some might overlook would be the editing, done by George Tomasini. Tomasini often worked with Hitchcock, this film being one of his major highlights. Though often subtle, but its presence can be detected throughout the film.<br/><br/>The editing in Psycho creates its mood and aids in revealing plot details. Without it, the film would not be what it is. We would be thrown off with Marion's ambitions, and certainly the bizarre and frightening nature of Norman would also be off key. Let alone that, the story itself would be lost in terms of interpretation of time. Each aspect of a film plays an irreducible role, and the same goes for editing."

","""Psycho"" is perhaps the best horror film of all time, directed by the best horror director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock. It has a simple plot, and to describe the events that take place would be quick work, but the suspense and fear the film creates can not be described. Hitchcock was masterful. His direction of this film made something as pedestrian as a police officer approaching a car, or taking a hot shower fill you with a sense of fear and trepidation. Hitchcock let the suspense build throughout the film, while the plot twisted and turned until the shocking climax, that I'm sure no one saw coming. Anthony Perkins was wonderful as the quiet Norman Bates, and the rest of the cast was solid. This film was Hitchcock's magnum opus, that embodied movie making at its finest. From camera work, to acting, to plot, Hitchcock made a film that defines what quality is, while tantalizing and scaring you more than you would think possible."

","Up until a few days ago, the only version of this film I had seen was the contemporary version with Vince Vaughn. That being said, after viewing this original, and obviously much better version, it is safe to say that Hitchcock would roll over in his grave if he could see what his work had become. This film,(the original) is a stunning piece of visual and visceral beauty. It deals with a myriad of issues that affect the human condition, namely greed, love,psychosis, and fear, just to name a few. This film, more than being a first rate horror movie, is at its core, a story about people. Granted, in this instance, we are talking about some truly screwed up people, but people none the less. The film had a gritty, intense feeling, yet a smooth and refined look. Those two contrasting elements went a long way to truly sucking the viewer into what he or she was watching. Additionally, the music was downright eerie; this was so much the case that when I was viewing the movie at home, I paused it to turn on more lights in my house. That music just had some supernatural way of sending chills down my spine. For the characters themselves, Perkind does what one could expect him to do when tasked with such a mentally taxing role, he shines. Perkins plays the part of Norman Bates very well, as does he Norman's mother. Janet Leigh also brings a strong presence to the screen in her role of the misguided heroine. If I had one major critique of this film, it would be that it ended almost too abruptly. There is this slow creeping buildup to the action, to Bates having a showdown at the climax, and then, poof, its over. Norman is jail, clearly still crazy, and thats that. I would have liked to have seen a little more in that realm. Understandably, Hitchcock was a particular man who believed in less being more, but I feel that way all the same. In regards to Hitchcock, not much needs to really be said. This film is cinematic genius that has yet to be rivaled in terms of cinematography and overall mis-en-scene. Everything is modern, yet still very creepy. That is an especially nice touch. So in summation, Hitchcock and his cast delivered a stellar film that I would definitely recommend to any fan of horror films."

","It wasn't a message about psychological abuse or the dark side of the maternal instinct that enthused the audiences, nor was it any particular performance.

In its gut sensation, Psycho fits better alongside shoestring noir like Detour than with Hitchcock's own chic Technicolor thrillers like Rear Window or Vertigo. In this way and in its starring use of Janet Leigh, Psycho is as much a companion piece with Touch of Evil as it is Hitchcock's arguably most socially pivotal film.<br/><br/>But no other Hitchcock film had more effect.

Plus, the internet would've shattered any possibility of preserving the movie's genuine shocks, none of which one could've anticipated Hitchcock had in store without it. Modern moviegoers would've ruined this film for themselves before even walking in. He didn't just direct movies. He directed us. He directed several subsequent decades of movie plot expectations.<br/><br/>Of course, today's generation can still see it as a fearsome, ingenious thriller despite knowing all about the shower scene that would've been like the revelation of Luke Skywalker's father in 1960 terms rather than 1980 ones. It's all owing to Hitchcock's imagination in two matters not as obvious: The pure subjective telling of Marion Crane's story, and her rapport with her new host. Hitchcock's trick is dedicating his thorough concentration and flair to handling them like they'll be expanded upon for the whole remaining film.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins is uncanny in establishing the thorny character of Norman, in a performance that has become momentous. He lets us know there's something deeply amiss with Norman, and yet he has a young man's congeniality, stuffing his hands into his pockets, hopping onto the porch, beaming a toothy greeting. Only when discussion becomes personal does he begin to hesitate and sidestep. He evokes our empathy right alongside Marion's.<br/><br/>Nearly every present-day viewer is spending that whole time anticipating the spectacle of murder in store. However, seeing the shower scene today, various elements are notable. Unlike contemporary horror films, Psycho never sees the knife actually striking flesh. We see no wounds. Herrmann's slicing strings deputize for more gruesome sounds. And yet this remains the most famously shocking of cinema's slasher deaths, suggesting that graphic details are more shocking in our mind's eye and ear depending on their circumstances and creativity.<br/><br/>The terror of the rug being yanked swiftly and completely from beneath us is followed by Norman's painstaking erasure of the whole staggering affair. Hitchcock is subtly swapping protagonists. The new one killed the old one, yes, but we relate to Norman because, if we killed somebody, we'd be devoured by paranoia and remorse, just like him. The car sinks, then lingers. Norman watches fixedly, until it's ultimately submerged beneath the swamp.<br/><br/>Checking one's feelings, it dawns that we want that car to sink, which is what Norman wants. This is one of the most daring exchanges in Hitchcock's sustained custom of stage-managing the audience itself. Psycho's legend and luster will never die because, when innumerable films are over and done as the credits roll, it ties as candidly with our apprehensions as movie-making form can: That any one of us may impetuously commit a crime, our dread and paranoia of the police, our nightmares of becoming the quarry of a madman, and naturally, of failing our mothers."

","When this film was released in 1960, it literally took the world by storm. It was received with mixed reviews but tremendous profits at the box office. The world in 1960 had never seen a film like this, and everyone was taken off guard. Watching the film today, I can see why.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock wastes no time in setting up the proper mood for the film, starting right from Saul Bass' title sequence in combination with Bernard Hermann's legendary score. This mood is accomplished by John Russell's eerie black and white cinematography and the seedy set design, in addition to the razor sharp editing by George Tomasini. Anthony Perkins- what else can I say? He manages to make Norman Bates both sympathetic and truly frightening. Janet Leigh also creates a sympathetic character who meets a grisly demise in the legendary shower scene, one of the most recognized scenes in the history of film. Special mention must go to Martin Balsam as the detective who also meets a horrifying death, and Vera Miles and John Gavin as Leigh's sister and boyfriend, respectively, who go to look for her.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of horror films, but this is one I can watch without getting tired of. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10. Followed by three sequels and a shot-for-shot remake (only for the curious)."

","Hitchcock movies are my favorite! Psycho by far is the best of all of the Hitchcock movies. I am only 47, but have been a fan of Hitchcock movies since I was 19 and saw Psycho II in the movie theater back in 1983. When I saw the black/white clip of Psycho in the beginning of the Psycho II movie, I was hooked and had to see the original that started it all. Movies today don't come close to those made by Hitchcock back then. Remakes can never match the original. The acting was tremendous. I was always a fan of Anthony Perkins' work and loved Janet Leigh as Marion Crane. The filming, the scenery, the old cars, all of it had me hooked from the beginning. Psycho is the best!"
"jarnone822","10","0","0","1 August 2011"," The best suspense motion picture ever made!
","I don't think that any thriller or horror movie can match the quality of the Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". It's a vanguard suspense picture. From the amazing score by Bernard Herrmann to the infamous shower scene, this film will always be timeless. The films opens with the kinetic credits, made up of black and gray lines, done by Saul Bass. The film gains more suspense with the musical score made up only by strings. The film's dialogue manages to keep the film interesting, including the parlor scene, between Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, which lasts about 10 minutes, then finally, there's the shower scene, which took a week to film, and it's probably the best scene in movie history. 78 different shots in 45 seconds and it was shot wonderfully. There are only 2 murders in this film, yet this film was the first ""slasher"", which inspired John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and a couple more. It's amazing thinking that this one movie did that all. I think this film probably has the most shocking ending in movie history. It freaked me out and I could only imagine how scary it must have been seeing it in a theater back in it's original 1960 release. The film's 6 and a half minute trailer, with Alfred Hitchcock giving a tour of the Bates Motel is only a teaser, so it doesn't tell you much about the film, so I wonder how shocking the shower scene must have been. Altogether, ""Psycho"" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, and I think it's probably my favorite film of his. From the amazing acting from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, John Gavin, Vera Miles, and Martin Balsam to the surprisingly small $800,000 budget to the infamous Bates Motel and shower scene, along with the reputation this movie earned (#1 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills and #14 on 100 Years...100 Movies), this film is defiantly the best shocker film from the best director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock."

","IMDb Top 250: 24 Psycho is one of the most iconic films ever. The simple name, the menace, the immortal shower scene. the immortal, impossible- to-form-as- words screech of the violins during the most intense scenes in the movie. Psycho has stood the test of time, even 50 years later.<br/><br/>It's still important to know that this film has aged, but only because cinema evolved. Movies became more graphic and visceral, but Psycho can still ensnare you in its grasp. Hitchcock is a brilliant director, it seems that everything is so easy to him. He has nine films on the 250, more than anyone else.<br/><br/>It's interesting: over a half hour goes by before Marion reaches the Bates Motel,and the film is one hour fifty minutes. Time is taken to set up a plot and develop characters, which happens less and less today. Hitchcock takes his time... and when he strikes, there is true terror. The plot moves along, never taking too much time, and everything wraps up well.<br/><br/>Most of the acting is fine, but Anthony Perkins stands out. 1960 must've been a strong year for him to not be nominated for Best Actor. His casual walk, his kind smile, it's unnerving. Something's up with Norman Bates. But the little things make it: his eye movements, muscle twitches- especially those- make him the star of the show.<br/><br/>Yeah yeah yeah... the shower scene. Truth is, it's probably the most aged scene in the movie. But I won't dwell on something most of you already know.<br/><br/>I was surprised by the music. While the screech is universally-known in film circles, I was impressed with the rest of the music, which fits the film completely.<br/><br/>Psycho is an experience that must be seen by any film fan. If you can picture yourself in 1960, you could be shocked. Psycho is greater than the sum of its parts. 9.2/10"
"policy134","9","0","0","28 May 2011"," The sex
","Off course, this is an awesome movie. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, sadly, never were given better parts. Leigh lived to be nearly 80 years old, so this part must have been somewhat of a annoyance to her. It probably didn't help that she had one of the most famous ex-husbands and daughters in the world. We all know what fate had in store for Perkins.<br/><br/>Seen today, the movie is a bit tame and slow at times, but what it must have felt like for a 60s audience to see a film that was basically about sexual desires, although no explicit sex is shown. Look at one of the first scenes, where Marion is talking to an investor. He checks her out from top to bottom and makes an obvious play for her in full public. I can't recall I have ever seen such a scene from a movie that was made in the early sixties, and have rarely seen it in a movie made up and until 1966. The reaction from Hitchcock's daughter is also rare to see in a mainstream film from that time. She just treats it like it was something that happens every day. That was particularly unheard of during the rather strict 50s.<br/><br/>More talk about sex. Janet Leigh in the white and black bra. I still don't know how they got that past the censors at that time. Hitchcock must have had an enormous field day with those shots. Also, the shots of Leigh's stand-in, where you actually see a very quick shot of breasts. Unbelievable. It's funny to dwell on this today where you can see pornography every minute of the day but for a 60s audience? That took a lot of guts to put that in.<br/><br/>As for story, it is not the most original. Mamas boys were well depicted even to the point of insanity as way back as Jimmy Cagney's part in The Public Enemy. The execution, however, was of course something new. I do think my interest fell a little bit after Vera Miles comes on-screen. She is a good enough actress, but her part is thoroughly bland. So is John Gavin's, although he does match wits with Perkins in a rather smart scene at the end of the film. Martin Balsam as the private investigator is brilliant. In the scene with him and Perkins, you sense just how smart both of these people are. Perkins stumbles a bit in his testimony but doesn't really give the detective any conclusive evidence of guilt either. In a more mainstream film the detective would have been smarter than the crook.<br/><br/>You could analyze this movie to death and many have. What you cannot do is diminish it's importance. Many barriers were broken in entertainment in the 60s and Pcycho is directly responsible for breaking down those barriers."

","Psycho is considered to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's most noteworthy pieces and for many obvious reasons. It is extremely intelligent, a psychological mystery thriller that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat never knowing just what will happen next. The infamous shower scene is shocking and terrifying - definitely one of the most epic murder scenes of all time. The cinematography is incredible. The black and white photography is effective because it adds to the overall creepy/uneasy/something-just-isn't-right feeling of the story overall. The music is simply genius as it underlies drama and increases suspense. Although this film may not have the same impact on audiences today, it is certainly a must-see for anyone who enjoys a classic psychological mystery thriller."

","The story is great, the suspense is excellent, even the score and sounds are perfection. The acting and dialog are extremely realistic and intriguing. This is an absolute masterpiece by Hitchcock. <br/><br/>I've seen many people criticize the first act of this movie for being too boring or unrelated to the rest of the film, but for me, it is actually my favorite part of the movie. Not only does it give some background on Marion and put the movie in motion, but it is incredibly well acted and technically sound. Some of the best interactions and dialog are in this first part, such as Marion and the police officer. The police officer is a dark and imposing figure who sees through Marion's acting and realizes something isn't right. Although he is very kind, professional, and concerned for Marion, Hitchcock is able to still make him seem like the bad guy, and builds suspense. Another great exchange is between Marion and the quirky car salesman, whose innocent lines seem to intimidate the paranoid Marion. Although it the salesman also seems to be concerned for Marion, and is nothing more than a quirky and playful in way, the audience feels uneasy due to what Marion is hiding and feeling."

","Psycho is one of the best horror films, if not one of the best films of all-time. This film became Alfred Hitchcock's signature films and one of the most innovative film of its time. Psycho is not only innovative because of the Hitchcock's mastery of tense moments, cutting between music and silence. But also because Psycho was the first movie to kill off the main actress in the very beginning. Janet Leigh is the star of the film and is killed off almost immediately. This was innovative at that time, because most film goers would show up 10 to 15 minutes late to films. So when these late movie goers arrived, they were shocked to see they missed the big murder seen featuring the starlet. From this time on, people would begin to arrive on time so that they wouldn't miss anything.<br/><br/>This film is well made, scare, and iconic. It is a must see for everyone!"

","I have seen ""Psycho"" many times, and each time I am terrified by both the shower scene and the stairs seen. ""Psycho"" tells the story of Marion Crane staying at the Bate's Motel and her Motel owner. Strange things start to happen and the audience as well as Marion become horrified as to what is going on. Hitchcock's genius comes from the sound effects and music , I discovered. Camera angles bring fear to the audience as well. The scene where Hitchcock delivers an ariel shot of Norman Bates coming out of the bedroom with the infamous ""Psycho"" soundtrack playing is extremely frighting because of the suddenness with witch it happened. What I had noticed in multiple viewings is that the movie is hardly as scary without the sound, hence Hitchcock's masterful use os sound effects and camera."

","An untainted masterpiece, Hitchcock proves superbly that he had no impediments to conjure a classic B-movie like other lionized names like Roger Corman, George A. Romero and Russ Meyer etc., and all the more, he could outshine them by a notch.<br/><br/>The film is an authentic template of a first-rate thriller/horror opus, which I will not bother to outline the details (for instance the over-examined bathroom slaughter scene) inasmuch as there are a wealth of professional dissertations everywhere in the digital era. I simply admire the dexterity of the film in exuding its horror-arousing atmosphere. Hitchcock manufactures one of the most disturbingly creepy-cum-maniac killer in the history of cinema. The Oedipus complex patient Norman Bates is a lively product of the hermetic seclusion amid people and a emblem of the loss of morality, also the kill-after-the-epiphany scenario has never blemished its charisma even after 50 years. <br/><br/>The performance is uneven, in spite of the fact that the film earned the one-and-only BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS Oscar nomination for Janet Leigh (which sounds not equivalent to her monumental fame though), a leading-actress-goes-supporting set-up was an unanticipated stunt for its audience at that time, which is rarely seen presently. Anthony Perkins has such a multi-faced once-in-a-lifetime role and it would be an unforgivable sin if he had ruined it (two sequels PSYCHO II and III are perfectly justifiable spin-offs). Vera Miles, John Gavin plus other supporting roles, on the other hand, are the victims of Hitchcock's ""actor equals animal"" methodology, they are more like props than real flesh. <br/><br/>Arguably this is my favorite Hitchcock's film right now, I think only VERTIGO (1958) and NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) might have the chance to overthrow it from the throne. I know it is definitely my fault and I still don't figure out how could I miss this two. <br/><br/>P.S.: The top-notch status of the film intrigued a faithfully-copied remake by Gus Van Sant in 1998, whose ill-fated destination was preordained, which I am quite interested in as well after watching this original work."
"cbrueggemeyer","10","0","0","21 April 2011"," One of those films that will never be forgotten
","Psycho is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. It is made by the ""Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock, and it is commonly called his greatest work. That being said, most would think that this film already would be great, but great is an understatement as to how awesome this film is. The mix of great suspense, romance, and horror make this movie unique from every film every made. Four characteristics are listed to define a great suspense film: it has to be entertaining, the plot must be complex, it must be strongly visual, and the film must take place in a world beyond good and evil. I think that Psycho definitely has all of these characteristics. <br/><br/>First off, I believe that Psycho is one of the most entertaining films ever created. The mix between action-packed, high intensity scenes and passionate, romance scenes make this movie as great as it is. This movie manages to be action packed even in this generation. Younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. A generation back, most directors tended to build up characters and suspense, so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Even so, Psycho still manages to be very entertaining and a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Secondly, I believe that the plot of Psycho is extremely complex, but not to the point where the audience is completely confused at the end. This films plot has many twists and turns, and it keeps you enthralled throughout the whole movie. One of the reasons why this movie is so complex is Hitchcock's use of ""pieces of plot"". Hitchcock leaves subtle clues around throughout the movie to suggest that they are the main focus of the movie: such as the $40,000 being left on Crane's dresser. These ""pieces of plot"" leave the audience confused as to what the main focus of the story is, and it perfectly sets them up as to what will happen later in the movie. This movies plot is entertaining and complex, and the ending only solidifies the argument that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. <br/><br/>I believe that Psycho is strongly visual. Hitchcock, like many of the great directors of all time, employs the use of great visual imagery in this movie. For example, in the shower scene, one of the most famous scenes of all time, no words are spoken. However, the audience still completely understands what just went on in the movie. Hitchcock's telling of the story without the use of words makes this movie great, and many strongly visual scenes in this movie will be remembered as some of the greatest scenes in film history. <br/><br/>Psycho definitely takes place in a world beyond good and evil. This movie is not just the simple, stereotypical story of woman goes missing, and people go to look for her. Throughout the movie, it becomes apparent that Hitchcock has way more planned for the audience than just a simple cop versus criminal. Bates is a breed of criminal almost never displayed in movies, a mentally disturbed killer. Bates is one of the best-displayed cases of a psychopath ever seen in film history, and the way he does his crimes exemplifies this. The Bates Hotel represents a place completely oblivious from the laws and punishments of society, a place where anything can happen. <br/><br/>Given the evidence of all that happens in the movie Psycho, it becomes apparent that it is easily one of the greatest suspense films ever made. Psycho's uniqueness and overall intrigue made it an instant American classic. Many years from now, films like Psycho will be remembered as classic American films, and it is films like this that will never be forgotten."

"b-gallagher2","10","0","0","4 April 2011"," Movie review
","One of the most influential and innovative horror films ever made!! Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho shows us all just how great of a filmmaker he really was. Strictly one of his best. This movie goes beyond conventional styles of horror films and brings us into the mind of Hitchcock himself. The movie has an exceptional storyline. The movie also does something exceptional that most horror films seem to always lack, CHARACTER RELATIONSHIP! The movie conveys an excellent stylistic form of really working on the characters. Working on them in such a way that we as the audience can actually grow attached to them. So if something happens to a character in Psycho we as the audience actually feel emotion towards these characters and can really relate to it all. This sense of attachment to the characters and our relationships to them is what draws us that much closer to the movie. That's why Psycho is so scary! Most horror movies show us characters in which we don't know so when something scary and bad happens to them, we could care less. In fact we usually just say ""wow, that guy was so stupid for going off alone."" We don't say that in Psycho. This movie actually scares us, we don't feel that the characters are dumb at all. I really found this style so fascinating. Also this movie had one of the most classic horror shower scenes of all time! One other thing I noted when watching this movie was how well Hitchcock developed the core of the entire story. The movie had an excellent core meaning to it and also showed development, progression and movement. Excellent movie. Hitchcock is a legend and so is this movie."

","Imagine if Hitchcock retired before the 60's, after all, his filmography was impressive enough to place him among the all-time greatest film-makers. But the Master had a little surprise for those who thought they've been scared enough and could never be surprised again  <br/><br/>And how wrong they were  It's admirably surprising that such a great film came so lately in a career when most of the directors generally start losing their touch. But this is only one of the numerous unexpected and fascinating aspects that make this simple film, an ""accidental"" masterpiece. And I use this word as a compliment since the greatest masterpieces like ""Casablanca"" or ""The Godfather"" were unintentional too.<br/><br/>The elements that make ""Psycho"" a masterpiece could have been taken as cinematic tricks deliberately inserted to create a feeling of originality, but then, such tricks would have sublimated the film, making it even more glorious and 'cinematic', which is not the case here. And I think I loved ""Psycho"", for the same reasons I disliked ""North by Northwest""  In the former, Hitch used up all the style until it became a caricature: a too contrived plot, a too heroic ordinary hero, a dull love interest, a grandiose climactic scene  ""Psycho"" doesn't have this pretentious elegance and almost looks like a TV or a B-movie  it's the less Hitchcokian stylishly, but ironically, the most defining of his films.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" starts with probably the most thrilling score ever, the linear design combined with the shrill violins' sounds are the perfect illustration of how a music can embody the main feeling of a film, as if Bernard Herrman is already warning us about a horrifying surprise that'll make our hearts pound as fast as this melody  its contribution to the film's emotional impact is indisputable. The next shot transports us to Marion Crane's apartment where we she lies in bed with her lover, undressed and intimate like in a campy soap opera  a lousy apartment with two people without the 'Grant and Kelly' romantic appeal audience got used to. An already classic and politically incorrect start. They're lovers, who probably just had sex, but this is no voyeurism, this is intimacy, a necessary intimacy to feel for Marion, to understand her, to understand her motives for stealing the money in the following scene.<br/><br/>Indeed, the way, Janet Leigh portrays Marion Crane, and Hitchcock's intimate directing, creates an incredible feeling of empathy leading to paranoia. When Marion leaves the town, we don't know where she goes exactly, but we're following her totally hooked, like hostages of her fate. When she accidentally meets her boss, we're shocked  and feel her slow descent to paranoia, from the discussion with the police offer, to the car rental service where every hint of nervousness acts like an accusation. That's the brilliance of Hitchcock's script, at that point: there's just the robbery, and Marion's troubles. We fear that she might get caught, totally unaware that this option would have saved her life.<br/><br/>The rest is legendary; she meets Norman Bates, a young, easy-going and soft-spoken Motel manager, with nothing suspicious in his approach. He's a bit shy and awkward but this only highlights his 'boy-next-door' attitude. Of course, there's this strident voice that shouts at him every time, those stuffed birds, but when you live alone in such a little and boring place, one must find hobbies. Marion is too exhausted anyway to get suspicious and Anthony Perkins's great acting doesn't suggest the idea, even for us, that he's trying to seduce her, although, they're like forming a cute couple, and we almost expect something happening between them, until Bates reveals to be a voyeur, which shocked me as if I was so close to Marion, I felt like Bates spying on me.<br/><br/>We all know the rest of the story, what else can be said? The shower scene is probably the most audacious and shocking plot twist ever committed on screen. It's extraordinary that the character that was driving the film was killed so early. Marion Crane wasn't a supporting character, she was the lead of the first part of the film, and the transfer from Crane to Bates as the new lead of the film is masterfully done. Especially that at this point, Norman Bates is not the official villain of the film, it's like we feel some sympathy for him as he tries to protect his evil mother. We need to feel empathy anyway.<br/><br/>But Hitchcock had to surprise us. The film doesn't have one twist but in fact two twists including the classic, shocking revelation of the mother's identity, a shock starting with the sudden appearance of the skull, even scarier than the shadowy figure behind the curtains. This conclusion is the pay-off of a rather normal part between Marion's murder and the climax, saved by a scene-stealing performance by Martin Balsam as Detective Arbogast, a supporting but pivotal character whose annoying perseverance will indirectly solve Marion Crane's disappearance mystery. The film could have disappointed after Marion's death, the shocking revelation places it among the greatest classics.<br/><br/>And one thing prevented the film from being perfect, and I can't understand how a director like Hitchcock let himself tolerate such amateurish writing. I'm talking of the shrink scene where during 5 minutes, the characters and the audience make one and quietly listen to Bates' biography, as a text, the screenwriter probably wrote before starting the script. It's like Hitchcock underestimated his audience's intelligence. Didn't we have enough hints? Wasn't the last scene meaningful enough to understand that he suffered from a personality disorder? <br/><br/>Thankfully, ""Psycho"" overcame many flaws and managed to be the greatest suspense movie ever, thanks to a constant paranoid feeling, two shocking twists, a memorable villain, and an unforgettable score. ""Psycho"" is an accidental masterpiece, but it's still a masterpiece"

You honestly don't know where it will go until you get there. Anthony Perkins is amazing in this, he's both very human and likable but uncomfortably awkward at the same time.

","Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is often considered to be the first slasher film in that it follows the actions of a psychopathic killer as he stalks and murders his prey in graphic scenes. Hitchcock is a master at making the audience feel what he wants them to feel. He knows when to when to hold back for suspense and when to let it all out for shocks. Hitchcock created one of the most chilling characters in cinema with the schizophrenic Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins. Bates is a quite motel clerk at the Bates Motel who is seemingly dominated by his ""mother"", who is actually his homicidal altar ego.

","Psycho in my opinion is an American classic. It is a heart-pounding movie with good acting and plots twists. Although I felt that the ending was fairly predictable the beginning of the movie definitely had me thinking. I also think that people watching the film back in the sixties appreciate the plot twist and the simpleness of this film. Watching this movie in 2010 the film seems almost jaded but that is because it was one of the better psychological thriller of its time. So the little cliché moments in the movie were at that time probably very scary. For example the shower scene I felt it to be very fake but once again today we see movies such as Saw it is hard to leave anything to the imagination after that.

","There is so much to be said about Psycho, from its profound cinematography to the provocative script. Alfred Hitchcock is well known for his horror films, and Psycho definitely proves why. The plot behind the movie really broke a mold for horror films during the 1960's. Movies were become more ""expressive"", and leaving less unsaid, but Psycho revealed some truths behind sex and violence that weren't discussed in society. Alfred Hitchcock helped to change what society thought of as true terror. There was a realness to his films, unlike the studio era horror films. His use of the camera was truly remarkable. It's obvious that Hitchcock knew how to add suspense and fear. His way of showing the actor's reaction then what they were looking at, makes it feel like you are in the film. Also, the famous shower scene depicts how some things are better left to the imagination. Not because it's too much for the audience to handle, but because it makes the viewer think and fill in the blanks in a way. It was obvious that the woman had been killed, but it's more frightening in a way to leave out the whole scene. It adds that gasp effect. Clearly, Psycho was a somewhat ground breaking film, and really paved the way for horror films in general."

","I absolutely loved the areal view shot of the city in the beginning of the movie. I thought this movie did a great job of being a thriller i felt very anxious the whole time I was watching it. Everyone was very odd, or weird. They all acted strange and antsy. The music helped tremendously with establishing the feel of the mis-en-scene of the movie. As did the vacant hotel, the sketchy police man and the dreary weather. The fast cuts between Marion and the police officer while he was following her added to the ""freaky/ weird"" feel of the movie as did all the birds in the mans office at the motel and the yells that came from the house. If I were Marion as soon as I found out that I was the only one stating there i would have left as fast as I could especially seeing how inquisitive the man was. After seeing the shower scene that was shown as an example in the Hitchcock interview I realized just how complex it really was. I think that scene and the areal view scene were my favorite."

","For my money, you just don't find a better performance of a character than Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins never totally got his due as an actor. The man was brilliant, and Norman was of course his greatest achievement.<br/><br/>One of the interesting things about Psycho now is the not-so-publicized trouble the film had on initial release. Reviews were mixed, to say the least. One British reviewer (C. A. Lejuene) actually quit her job because the movie so offended her. But it was a massive hit with the public, and then critics literally changed their minds. Different world.<br/><br/>That Bates became such an iconic film character is no surprise. Perkins makes that happen in every shot. Norman is about as creepy a character as you can find. Despite being a murderer, he's no killer. He's an extremely nervous, anti-social, near-shell of a man so mentally and morally corrupted and broken that it's hard to imagine him doing anything else with his life. He waits at his dingy motel for the rare occupant. Surely, he doesn't have much at all to do with most of them. It's the ones who want to talk to him that find trouble, as he's incapable of interacting peacefully.<br/><br/>There is a shame to Norman. He is constantly embarrassed by his own perceived shortcomings, despite being a tall, good-looking man. Given that everyone and their mother has seen and discussed this film, we know the reason for his eternal agony with himself, but just in case someone stumbles upon this and has not seen Psycho or doesn't know the ending, I'll avoid going into it, because I'd hate to be the person who ruins this movie.<br/><br/>I saw this movie first when I was eight years old. It thrilled me, and that is really the only time I've ever been truly and completely detached and sucked into a film's world. I am not saying this is the greatest film of all-time (it would be up there on my personal list, in part because of my attachment to it), but I was born 22 years after this movie was released. A lot changes culturally in 30 years, especially when the start of that was in 1960. Since I was just a kid and movies from 1960 weren't exactly lunch line talk, I didn't know anything at all about Psycho. It just happened to be on TV, and I fell in love with it. It was gripping, I probably had the sense that it was beyond me (or however you'd put that at eight), and Perkins' performance mesmerized me. I'd never seen anything like that. I started watching non-kids movies and TV a lot earlier than a lot of folks did, because supervision of TV was never a big thing for my family. It was just assumed that if I saw a bad guy kill a broad, I would have the common sense instilled in me to not go out and do that myself. But I'd never seen anything like Norman Bates.<br/><br/>And really, I still haven't.<br/><br/>This is a film people will still be watching in another 50 years. The revelations and twists have become less shocking as time has passed, because so many movies have gone down similar roads, but Psycho has its own tone and that performance from Perkins that keeps it elevated among the best."

","By today's standards, the murder scenes are laughable, but I know that back in 1960, this movie was terrifying.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock is definitely a master. The way that he used music and editing made some scenes really frightening to me. I feel like the music was the most effective way that Hitchcock got into my head and stressed me out. Even in some scenes where nothing was happen, that music came on and I was scared. I was grabbing onto my friend and biting my fingers. The night after I watched this, I had to lock my door, check my bathroom for a hidden creep, and think of happy things until I fell asleep. It left a lasting impression on me, definitely. The conclusion is insane! It is a freaky film.<br/><br/>The actors were great, minus the murder scenes. They were calm when they had to be, scared when they had to be, and creepy as hell when they had to be. I will never see the remake of this film, because I really doubt that anybody could ever fulfill these roles better than Perkins and Leigh did.<br/><br/>Hitchcock really knows which angles to use, what editing techniques work, all the things that make this a good movie. The content is scary, the form is excellent. I completely understand why this film is iconic, why it has been brought up so often in society. This is the movie that made motels kind of creepy places, I bet.<br/><br/>I would buy this movie, sure. It's recommended. It's great studying material for a budding filmmaker, so it should be in my collection sometime soon. : )"

","The film Psycho is about a woman named Marion who sneaks away from her old life, after stealing a large sum of money from her employer. On her way to see her fiancé, she finds herself at the desolate Bates Motel, whose owner turns out to be the namesake for the title of the film: a psycho. After obsessing about his dead mother for so long, he psychologically turned into her persona at times. The women Norman Bates kills, were killed when his mother's persona was in charge.<br/><br/>The main characters are Norman Bates, and Marion Crane, portrayed by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, respectively.<br/><br/>The overall theme of this movie seems to deal with the uncertainty of unfamiliar people. When Marion, the main character, happens to meet the socially-awkward Norman Bates, she probably couldn't have imagined getting murdered by him. The message seems to be that you can never really know if the next person you meet is truly crazy.<br/><br/>A movie with a similar theme is Hitchhiker, in which a person driving across the country picks up a hitchhiker, who ultimately does many sadistic things to the driver. In that movie, it was also clear that you just don't know which strangers to trust.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most famous scene in Psycho is the one in which Marion is stabbed to death in the shower, frequently referred to as the ""shower scene"", in pop culture. This scene is shot and pieced together with many short clips, all shot at different angles. The constant views at different angles make the scene more suspenseful and frightening, in my opinion. Although the attacker in the scene remains obscure, it appears to be that of a woman. Ultimately, it is revealed that Norman also dresses as ""Mother"", whenever he thinks he is ""Mother"".<br/><br/>Another scene that best exemplifies how crazy Norman is, is the final scene, in which he's locked up in a prison cell. ""Mother"" is thinking that everyone has it wrong – he wouldn't even hurt a fly! The camera closes in upon him as ""Mother's"" thoughts are narrated. And in the close-up of Norman, an eerie feeling is truly conveyed.<br/><br/>When this film was first released, I think it was a first of its kind in some aspects. I think that never before, a murder had been so graphic in a movie. Although, compared to some modern movies (such as Saw), Psycho would be considered a very mild murder film.<br/><br/>But in any case, I believe the film was cutting-edge for the day, and remains a classic tribute to a man who truly was ""Psycho""."

","I have seen just one other Hitchcock movie before this one, and this review is from the point of view of a relative beginner. Not to Hollywood in general (fortunately!), but to Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck me about this film was how often it has been used as inspiration for the dozen horror-flicks of today. Most of the 21st-century horror flicks concentrate solely on 'scaring' the viewer, and don't give two-hoots about the story (or rather the lack of it), and performances from the so-called 'actors'. The most common sound you will come across in these movies is 'AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!' Whereas in Psycho, every performance is memorable, especially that of Anthony Perkins. Not to forget the cunning Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh.<br/><br/>The second (and probably the most important) thing that struck me was the brilliant camera-work and sound-effects. The ""film"" experience this movie generated (even if you watch it at home on the computer) was something I hadn't experienced in a long time. During the second murder, the immediate change of camera and (EXTREMELY) loud sound, really gave me the shivers! <br/><br/>To conclude, I can safely say this movie will always be on my personal top 3. <br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>P.S: would also like to add, i'd prefer watching psycho for even the 10th time than watch any of the horror movies of today.. in spite of the special effects.. :)"

","Well first of all, I liked to say that the Psycho remake was a lovely piece of garbage and that Alfred Hitchcock's original should have never been touched.<br/><br/>When Alfred Hitchcock made this film just over 30 years ago, it was a huge hit with anyone. Not my most favorite horror film ever though this was a classic masterpiece that should not have been touched afterwards.<br/><br/>The music is greatly chilling, the surroundings that are among us in this film are just sensational and then the ending of seeing Norman Bate's dead mother really left me in suspense. There where no negatives about this film. I'm just giving everyone advice about the remake. Watch it once, and then never ever watch it again because it is full of crap. The remake has no original ideas and it just copies straight out of the Original, though with no suspense.<br/><br/>I think this is a great horror movie and also it's a lovely display and probably Hitchcock's best film made. This film is also a good one to watch over and over again because when Alfred Hitchcock created this film, it started the Slasher Genere off really well. To me the Original Psycho later on created other great slasher flicks like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""Halloween"".<br/><br/>8/10"

","Hitchock was a magnificent film maker but also very clever and Psycho was a very cleverly made film even by Hitch's standards. It starts off as classic Hitchcock with Janet Leigh on the run, with the threat hanging over her: will she get caught? Her boss spots her, the looming policeman, the suspicious car salesman but all this just a sub-plot. The real plot starts when she arrives at the motel. For people who saw this film the first time must have got a real shock to see a star such as Janet Leigh killed off halfway into the film. No wonder Hitch when the film was released for the first time, told people at the end of the film not to reveal the plot. The classic film with twists."

The conversation between him and Janet Leigh is incredibly tense as the dark under currents in Norman's psyche show through. The shower scene is still shocking and Anthony Perkin's reaction when he sees what his ""mother"" has done is great acting. The style of the film is fascinating as well. It has elements of Film Noir but with a 60s art house feel. It was a brave film for Hitchcock to make at that stage in his career and demonstrates what a true master he was of his craft."

","Psycho is known as the world's first slasher film. Psycho is know 50 years old and it is my one of my favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>In this wonderful Hitchcock vehicle, you follow a young woman (played by Janet Leigh) who embezzles $40,000 to give to her boyfriend, who is trying to pay off his father's debt and pay his wife's alimony. During the drive, you are kept in suspense, thinking that she will be caught, due to the fact that she can't hide her emotions.<br/><br/>In this movie, you are looking for a private island, but you find a private trap, set brilliantly by Sir Alfred Hitchcock. This movie is also well known for the shocking shower scene (say that five times fast). Now that everyone knows about that scene, first time watchers will know what happens, they will be expecting it. What first-timers don't know is when.<br/><br/>I personally like the stairs scene. Everyone talks about the shower, almost no one ever talks about the scene where Martin Balsam walks up the stairs of the Bates home. After watching the movie the first time, I was afraid to go up the stairs. That doesn't me that the shower scene didn't affect me. I hate it when people come in the bathroom when I take a shower.<br/><br/>The plot is great. At first, you believe it is about this girl, but really it is about a motel owner who was dominated by his mother his whole life. Then, at the end, our whole view of the plot then twists, which is what makes it my favorite movie. But I can't reveal it. You'll have to watch it for yourself."

","I was fortunate enough to see Psycho for the first time at a late night cinema presentation with an audience full of teens who had heard about the shower scene but had, like me, never seen the film before. And, apart from the notoriety of the shower scene, we didn't know the rest of the story.<br/><br/>There was no internet, no IMDb, it hadn't been on TV yet, and people had been quite good about keeping the main elements of it under wraps.<br/><br/>So we didn't know that we were going to identify with Marion Crane, tempted into committing a robbery, realising the mistake she'd made, having a helpful conversation with the nice young man at the motel she had checked into which led to her resolving to put things right. And then being abruptly, savagely, and shockingly slaughtered. We didn't know we'd identify with her. But Hitchcock did and, while we were sitting in the darkness trying to regain some sort of footing after the emotional carpet had been ripped out from under our feet, Hitchcoock was sitting behind the camera quietly amused at how he had manipulated us.<br/><br/>And then he did it again (without cutting us loose from our emotional moorings, admittedly) - Arbogast's killing, the revelation of the mummy, Norman's appearance in the doorway, and Norman's final look to camera - all shocking, horrifying moments.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterclass in audience manipulation, with nothing to equal it before or since (Jaws came close)."

","Firstly, I have a love/hate relationship with the horror genre. My previous encounters consisted of a few dozen snickers to my viewing partner about how the film was ridiculously unrealistic and could never happen, and that furthermore, it wasn't really scary because I knew what was coming. This leads to my main problem with the genre: I am an expert at discerning the plot climax well before it happens. This is a massive problem, because it takes away the suspense.<br/><br/>Just a heads up, I will not be spoiling anything here, I'll just describe the setting and characters. Nothing story orientated. Anyway, so imagine my surprise when I finally decided to jump into the last of the main four Hitchcock films: Psycho.<br/><br/>The film differentiates itself from Rear Window (1954) in more ways that one. Namely; its been filmed in black & white, the setting is purposely lower class and it focuses even more on the psychological rather than the physical. The villain might not have the razor sharp fingers of Freddy Kruger, or the deep seeded hatred of Jigsaw, but he/she is made infinitely more malevolent through the twists and turns conveyed by the director. What makes this villain so much scarier than all the rest? He or she's an inherently plausible evildoer; one who could be sitting right next to you while you watch the film for all you know. The horror of Hitchcock's masterpiece is that it forces you to question whether this could happen to you.<br/><br/>The filmography might not be as good as Vertigo (1958), but it's certainly up there, and easily the defining work of the genre. It seems somewhat like Sin City in it's technical codes, the director obviously had the capacity to use color, but he chose to use black & white, why is that I wonder? The lack of color (and the associated filmic codes) isn't a drawback, it's done to keep you ignorant of the horrors to come. In many ways 'Psycho' feels like a last tribute to the genre, but in reality it's simply a new beginning, like Clint Eastwood's 1993 epic 'Unforgiven' was for the Western genre.<br/><br/>Hitchcock makes you believe you ARE one of the protagonists. His use of lighting is fantastic: dark scenes preclude a twist, and every time he shows one you tremble in fear, and try to figure out what's going to happen. There's no point. The film is crafted so eloquently that the vast majority of people won't figure it out until well into it, at which point you're not annoyed that you've figured out the main plot element, but rather you become much more involved.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece, and 'Psycho' is one of the few films that'll have you telling yourself that over and over again while you watch it."
"jamesbutterford","10","0","0","31 May 2010"," THE Most Influential Movie of All Time
","I challenge you to think of a more influential movie than Alfred Hitchcock's psycho. Such a movie does not exist.<br/><br/><ul><li>Psycho created its own genre: Sure, there were monster, killer, and ""horror"" movies prior to 1960, but Psycho is the first actually good one. All pre-Psycho films are merely proto-horror movies. People still watch Psycho and, importantly, they still watch it as a horror movie. When people watch Frankenstein or Dracula, they are watching it for A) a laugh, or B) because it's famous. While Dracula and Frankenstein might sell in cheap monster movie box sets, Psycho still sells as a movie on its own, and to a wide and diverse audience that includes kids, adults, cinema lovers, and nacho lovers. No need to mention that every horror movie since Psycho is inspired by Psycho. This brings us to the next point...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Psycho is still a little bit scary: At its release, this movie had people screaming and throwing up. This does not happen anymore, but VERY few movies can legitimately scare people for more than a few years after they're released. I'm not claiming that Psycho is still legitimately scary, but compare it to more recent horror movies such as Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street. Those movies are also no longer scary, and Psycho is in fact (in my opinion) scarier to a modern audience. Thus, it has stood the test of time as well as one could hope.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The music: you all know it, your grandma knows it, and your 4-year old knows it. How many movies have stolen this score almost note for note?</li></ul><br/><br/>One last thing. Critics everywhere regard Psycho as a masterpiece, but often include a little clause about the psychiatrist scene and how it's out of place. I'll admit that when I first watched the movie, I was petrified when the psychiatrist started his speech because I, too, thought that this would be the undoing of a would-be masterpiece. However, my fears were not realized. Every time I've watched the movie since, I actually enjoy this scene and I don't feel the need to justify it by saying, ""Oh, people back then needed this kind of scene to make sense of the movie and it's just dated now."" No, I can 100% truthfully say that I think the scene adds to the movie, and I consider myself brutally honest when it comes to Hitchcock movies, even though I am a fan. I feel that Vertigo, Shadow of a Doubt, and Notorious are all overrated and have problems, but not Psycho."
"alangalpert","10","0","0","27 May 2010"," Iconic film
","""Psycho"" is unquestionably one of the finest films of all time, and probably the greatest thriller (although there are several other contenders, all directed by Hitchcock). The acting is first-rate; the cinematography is superb; and the musical score (by Bernard Herrmann) is iconic. (Incredibly, the score did not receive an Oscar nomination.) Hitchcock has been deservedly praised for his direction, but I feel it is time to give credit where credit is due. I recently read the book on which the movie was based, also titled ""Psycho"". It was written by Robert Bloch in 1959, a year before the movie was made. Except for two scenes that weren't in the book, and a couple of memorable lines (most notably, ""Well, a boy's best friend is his mother""), the movie follows the book so closely that almost all of the credit should go to the author of the book, not the director of the movie. If you have seen and enjoyed the movie, pick up a copy of the book. Only then can you appreciate who the real genius was behind ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>There are quite a few, mostly minor, differences between the book and movie. As I read the book, I wondered why the changes had been made. Here are some examples. In the movie, Ms. Crane's name is Marion; in the book, it is Mary. In the movie, she lives and works in Phoenix, Arizona; in the book, she is from Ft. Worth, Texas. In the movie, Norman Bates is thin and young; in the book, he is fat and middle-aged. In the book, he wears glasses; in the movie, he doesn't. In the movie, there are twelve cabins at the motel; in the book, there are six. I found no fewer than thirty-five differences, but almost none of them made any sense to me."
"ilpohirvonen","10","0","0","19 May 2010"," Mundane Freudian Horror from This World
","At the age of 60, Alfred Hitchcock decided to go wildly radical after his award-winning big productions. His next film, Psycho (1960), was an independent production whose budget was only 800 000 dollars. Through this Hitchcock was able to make a film, entirely in a way he wanted to but also achieve a naturally mundane atmosphere which was still characterized by psychological and film noir-like elements. Psycho is still Hitchcock's most shocking film and the most influential film he ever made. Just like The Beatles, the death of Elvis and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so is Psycho a part of the cultural legacy of the 1960's. It marked a turning point in the history of American cinema and changed its being forever: reality was now approached in a brand new way, through a Hitchcockian prism of fear. <br/><br/>In the central of Psycho there is a run-down motel which has been left to the side of a new highway: a picture of alienation, a system which progresses quickly, neglecting the actual needs of people. The motel is run by an extraordinary man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives alone with his mother. One day Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a woman who has just stolen 40, 000 dollars, arrives to the Bates' Motel. Having disappeared, Marion's boyfriend and sister start to look for her. But Norman isn't too happy about it and tries to avoid their investigation.<br/><br/>Like in many films by Alfred Hitchcock, the opening credits of Psycho are extremely important and fascinating. These opening credits were designed by the storyboard artist and pictorial consultant Saul Bass, who had also designed them for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). The credits, together with the score by Bernard Herrmann, manage to set out the theme and the topic of the film. The credits are often seen to illustrate the decomposition of the human mind but also the change of order and disorder which is common for capitalist urban life. It is an expression of the ""new"" world order.<br/><br/>The graphics designed by Bass don't just reign the opening credits: they're everywhere in the film. In the beginning, we see the horizontal Janet Leigh and her brassiere, and the vertical John Gavin, completely topless. The geometric polarity of horizontal and vertical lines repeats in concrete forms throughout Psycho: for example, the horizontal motel and the vertical Victorian mansion in which Norman's mother lives.<br/><br/>Psycho is mundane, or as Michael Schmidt has said ""Psycho combines wonderfully the everyday and mysterious."" But it really isn't a b-movie. For Hitchcock the horror and excitement just happen to arise from ordinary, mundane things. Once again, the opening scene is a wonderful example of this: just a conventional, simple scene. Back then, the audience was affected by Janet Leigh's breasts and brassiere which were shown for the first time in the history of cinema but, what is more, the scene is so well filmed that the viewer can do nothing but get identified with the characters. Psycho indeed might just be the most polished thriller ever made. It's perfect, no matter how you look at it.<br/><br/>Psycho puts the society to a collision between the shadows of past and presence. It conducted dialog between the old past and trendy presence. In the film, we meet two modern urban clichés: a regular office girl and a lonely youngster who also spends most of his time at his office. There is one intriguing scene which is a wonderful example of this: an unconventional love scene between two loners which, in turn, conducts dialog with the opening scene: now the characters don't talk about money and sex but about loneliness.<br/><br/>The way I see it, if Psycho has got a thesis, it must be that fear is in ourselves. Marion is constantly put in scenes with mirrors: first in the office, then in the motel etc. The most luminous proof of the nature of this thesis is in the scene where Marion's sister (Vera Miles) scares her own reflection on a mirror -- a brilliant shot which soon became a cliché.<br/><br/>In Psycho money isn't really essential. Money is present, all the time, but it doesn't make a difference -- it is insignificant. Hitchcock obviously wanted to show money just as a part of the society. It is a part of the air we breathe, so to speak. However, Psycho does also talk more widely about consumer society. A good example of the consumer culture is the scene where Marion quickly changes her old car to a new one. Even if her motive was to get away from the cops, the scene doesn't just talk about her personal hurry but about the social hurry inside us all. Psycho talks about the American society and about the transition, in the 1950's: how it turned from the conservative to more and more liberal in the 1960's but at the same became more alienated and anguished.<br/><br/>I'm sure I could go on and on about Psycho but, unfortunately, there are limitations. To put it briefly, Psycho is one of the best American films ever made and its aesthetic, cultural and sociological influence is undeniable. Many have spent thousands of words just talking about the architecture of Psycho: how the mansion represents the Freudian psychic apparatus (id, ego and superego) and how much influence Hitchcock took from an American painter Edward Hopper (take a look at The House by the Railroad). Together with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960), Hitchcock's Psycho opened the gates for the graphically clear treatment for violence. However, it is much more of a film about our world than violence. Psycho is all about an example of voyeurism and alienation but, in reality, the criticism hits the whole perverted culture and society. Its mundane, Freudian horror is straight from this world and those who criticize it for being horrible, actually criticize their own existence and twisted world."

I mean, it is good not try see classics with your mind set in stone that it will be one of the best ever, because it is over time that films develop fanbases and classic status, which I am sure this film was not nearly as acclaimed as when it first came out.

The performances from Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh are both fantastic and in their scenes together it is mesmerizing. <br/><br/>A lot of people cannot see this film without knowing about it's infamous scenes, most notably the shower scene. But honestly, I had heard something about a shower scene but when it happened it really shocked me and scared me. The music score is fantastic and probably the best horror score ever composed, and if not certainly in the Top 5.

That is not only great acting, that is good directing as well. The picture and directing were wonderful in so many ways. Each frame in the film was so intense and beautifully lit up. The high-key and low key lighting throughout the whole movie was perfect. Hitchcock knew just how to light up a scene then quickly make it dark and dim for just the right element of three key lighting. He made it look easy. An example is the back lighting he would use whenever the film showed the house normal bates (Anthony Perkins) lived in with his mother. The house looked scary and evil. Hitchcock payed attention to every detail in all of his films. For a film directed in 1960 is still gave me the creeps. Going into this movie i had assumed that it was going to be similar to the movie in 1998, but it was totally different. I loved this one much more."

","Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, hands down. This is probably one of Alfred Hitchcocks more famous and better work in his career. Even though he is an odd person, he has the mind of an odd mysterious suspenseful genius. Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. For too long the famous shower scene with the girl getting murdered is still a favorite scene to remember from people when they talk about Psycho. Also, The Bates Motel is a famous landmark name in the movie. The storyline is well done, the acting is almost to perfection, and the cinematography is acceptable in every way."

","Especially if you are into thrillers. I haven't seen the shot-by-shot remake that came out, 10 years or so ago, but if you watch one Psycho, it should be this one. Actually if you watch more than one Psycho, it would be good if you'd watch the other Psychos (Psycho 2, 3 and so forth). Although they are with Anthony Perkins, I'm pretty sure they are not as good as this one though.<br/><br/>A very eerie performance by Mr. Perkins then, with a very interesting idea (that hopefully comes as a surprise when you watch it, because it would be a shame if someone did spoil you the movie, by telling you what will happen). Quite a few things get done here and other directors have taken those ideas and used them time and again. It's a testament to Hitchcocks genius, how good his movie works and still how much tension is in it, because it hasn't aged a bit.<br/><br/>A great movie, by a great director. I watched it recently at a cinema, but I have to admit, that I missed the small cameo Hitchcock has in his movies. That's saying something about how gripping the movie was for me. And since I hadn't seen it for quite some time, I really discovered quite a few things, by watching it. So even if you have seen it, you can watch it again and again!"

","I really thought this movie was done well. The ending a surprise. Loved it. In the beginning I wasn't sure how this movie was going to be any kind of thriller or horror. I thought in the beginning the lighting was a lot better than in the end. Towards the end everything was so dark.I believe that to go along with the story the lighting fit in perfectly. I also noticed the music in the background they did an amazing job with that it was just in the right places even if there wasn't something bad going to happen you thought there was going to be. I think the plot was great and it kept you guessing. I guess this is why Hitchcock was so famous. Megan"

","I would bet any money anyone would care to mention that no one in the whole history of film viewing was more terrified as I was after watching Psycho. It appeared on BBC1 for the very first time back in 1968 and as I was only 11 years old I started to watch it with my mum despite warnings of the horror it would hold. After about half an hour my mum had to pick my dad up from work, but my gran was in the house in bed so I decided to watch it on my own, big mistake, my mum and dad arrived home shortly after Arbogast copped it on the stairs to find me shaking like a leaf with a poker in my hand. I went to bed after it had finished, never slept, in fact I never slept for weeks, that haunting slow music when Janet Leigh takes the money out of the newspaper in the garage toilet still gives me the creeps, if anyone has ever been more scared by a film then heaven help them."

","My Take: A landmark thriller from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Familiar even to anyone who hasn't seen the film itself, from its famous sequence that has been imitated and parodied several times to its undeniable influence in the horror genre, Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO has since become a part of cinematic history. But with such influence it has made, you'd think the genuine article has lost its touch. That ain't so. Seeing PSYCHO today, the classic still retains its ability to shock on a first time viewing and to give you the creeps even if you've seen it twice or more times.<br/><br/>We all know its influence in the several generations of slasher movies, but what still places PSYCHO is that it's less like the horror films it inspired than another thriller masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock; it's a well-crafted and intelligently written thriller, a quality that has slowly lessened in many of the slashers that have followed. Who could forget Janet Leigh in her performance that would make her famous in horror filmdom (and earn her an Oscar nomination) as the doomed Marion Crane. But any conversation about PSYCHO wouldn't be complete without the mention of Anthony Perkins superb performance as the infamous Norman Bates, a slightly maladjusted owner of the desolate Bates Motel. Perhaps the guys at the Oscar's were simply shocked and shivered by his chilling portrayal to give him the Oscar nomination he most certainly deserved. The supporting performances, especially by Vera Miles, are strong enough to carry the rest of the picture.<br/><br/>Everything seemed to be pitch perfect about PSYCHO: As usual, Bernard Herrmann teams with Hitch and provides a chilling score that will forever etched in our memories. The infamous shower scene, while no longer as shocking, is still one of the most expertly crafted sequence ever made; it's use of montage is still being scrutinized and studied by any film student today. George Milo, Robert Clatworth and Joseph Hurley's art direction is superb, from Norman's office parlor inhabited by stuffed birds to the famous Bates residence (complete with a silhouette of Mother in the window) is legendary and relevant to the many goings-on at the mysterious Bates Motel. The black-and-white photography does more than just make the censor approve the film, it also suites the film's ample atmosphere (blood in B&W is creepier than color). All this and so much more (not to mention the first-ever on-screen flushing of the toilet) make PSYCHO the father (or is that Mother) of them all.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","(Spoilers – in fact, this movie should be watched by all before any reviews read. Experience it first and then learn so much more.) It pained me when I heard that M. Night Shyamalan compared himself to Alfred Hitchcock. Where Shyamalan's movies are simply dreadful, half-assed, slow and contain hilariously bad scripts, Hitchcock remains the master no matter what year you watch his films. 'Psycho' is my all-time favorite Hitchcock film, and one of the best suspenseful movies of all time. It has such depth, both the intriguing (even today) story and characters, never a dull moment was experienced here. And talk about before his time; this movie was ingenuous: The main character is not only enormously flawed (a Hitchcock staple, and one I love so much about his films – see: 'The Birds') but she dies half-way through the feature, leading the way to another, more iconic main character: Norman Bates. I personally wasn't around in 1960, but I'm sure this caused quite a stir with its graphic scenes (by today's standard, this is PG) but I'm glad they didn't just go for the gore. The story, acting, cinematography, and especially the incredible score, were all brilliant. Everything about this movie is excellence, and I am glad that this and that famous shower scene is studied in film classes. This is what movie-making is all about. Marion is attempting to ""escape"" with the man she loves by stealing $40,000 to pay off his debts. Though her ""inner-voice"" gnaws away at her since the theft, just as her conscious gets to her, Bates and his mental illness (shown superbly and believably by Perkins) puts an end to that. Everything works in this masterpiece. In fact, books could be written about all the angles this took, and I'm sure they have been.<br/><br/>Side Note: I live in Phoenix, AZ, and despite it being hot for a good 6-7 months out of the year, it's rarely, make that, I've never experienced a hot day in mid-December like they supposedly said it was in this film. Perhaps they made it in the summer, or they've never visited Phoenix before and assumed it's always hot. That is the only ""flaw"" I detected in this excellent film, and even that's really no big deal."

","The original screening of ""Psycho"" was released at the former (untitled) Westwood theatre at Pico and Westwood Blvd. in Westwood California, (since than that theatre has been replaced by the Westwood Mall.) A selected invitational viewing was privately projected for the guests, cast and crew prior to it's release. As an undisclosed surreptitiously disguised Hitchcock enigma, this version was edited with a subliminal avant-garde inclusion of a craftily illustrated ""Skull and Crossbones symbol"" and spliced into the film after every nine frames of the shower and detective's butchering scenes. Whether or not once the film industry's critics discovered and banned this effect and allowed Hitchcock to continue projecting this version extensively was unknown, but by the time this well-scripted ""Psycho"" was publicly released the fear factor had already been commonly reputed. The silence, suspended action, proceeded by the dramatic music, and the aerial jump cut filming made it a sleepless producing journey of celluloid-fanaticism. <br/><br/>After attending this private screening I was scared out of my innocent mind. A few weeks proceeded and upon it's release to the local theaters, rumor had it that the shrewd Hitchcock created some hanky-panky with this film, so we examined the reel from our local theater's projection room, and discovered the subconscious inclusion of his secret confidential editing. Due to the critical film industry's mere political influence, Hitchcock had to remove this phenomenal strategy. By its reputation alone since ""Nosferatu,"" ""Psycho"" had already stood patented as the most horrifying visual experience ever. ""Psycho"" really didn't need any editing enhancement. Viewing it again recently still sends chills through my skin!<br/><br/>The psychiatrist at the climax of this film played a key role and scene of it's finale who explained the events of the nature of what took place at this spine-tingling escapade.<br/><br/>The geniuses of Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins will not be forgotten...may they Rest In Peace."

","I watched this fairly recently, it stood out to me, for I already appreciated that this is THE HORROR film, the one that comes to mind (shower scene with high pitched music). But for me, what is so marvellous about this film, is that it has not been ruined by adding pointless sex scenes or having countless 'stereotypical blonds' being slaughtered by the thousand, for that is all one will typically see in the slasher movies of the past 20 years. It gave me some relief to see a film that was pure genius in terms of acting, directing (Hitchcock, the best) and how the camera is shot from what was originally seen as and still is seen as rather unusual angles. Instead of the naked blonde teen being killed by the lakeside in the height of summer or in bed with her lover straight into the film, Psycho has some background to it. Lila Crane (Vera Miles)is on the run after stealing a large sum of money, and we see her for the fist 10 or 15 minutes of the film driving anxiously out of the city with the constant fear of being caught or tracked down. She then stops of for a rest at the Bates Motel, and from there the story slowly unfolds at a rate that is not so fast the film just gets far to unreal, but at a rate that allows you to get a good idea of the persona's of the characters, especially Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and it gives you time to wonder, why does him mother sit by the window for such long periods of time without moving an inch? I will leave that for you to find out."

","This film is a classic. Everything about it is great. The acting (especially Anthony Perkins; his performance as Norman Bates was absolutely flawless, but also Janet Leigh), the filming, the directing by the genius Hitchcock, and let us not forget the shocking score(!), by Bernard Hermann. I watched this movie with some friends, and the guy next to me jumped so high during the stairs scene he bumped his head on a shelf! But then again we had the volume too high. But there was no way no know until....RE RE RE RE!, and then it was too late. This movie must be watched from start to finish without interruption. Every single scene is so competently filmed and acted, especially the very last scene with Norman Bates' iconic grin. Do not bother with the remake. Everything you would want out of a classic suspense film is all right here. I saw a few seconds of the remake and that was all it took. It does not even serve as a relic of this timeless original, making the whole remake rather pointless. This precise film-making can just cannot be recreated.

","Psycho combines the intensity of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller with the creepiness of a slasher film. The combination works well to provide a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but which still has the stillness and conventional look of an old movie.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple but provides a frame for an interesting narrative. Hitchcock's excellent photography makes this movie stand out and the casting is spot on with all the characters appearing distinct. I also appreciate that there is not so much over-acting which tends to be the case with many older films and it helps to bring the film a type of soberness but thankfully it doesn't suck the life out of the film like it does with many other films.<br/><br/>The film does have a few weaknesses, I've always had a sense that Norman is not as innocent as he appears and the film goes perhaps into too much detail on how he covers up for the murder. The film could have done with less. Also, the psychiatrist at the end hams up the tone of the film just a tad too much and is one of the few things about the film I've never enjoyed.<br/><br/>However, over-all Psycho lasts the test of time."

","Going into the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece ""Psycho,"" it's best that you know nothing -- in fact Hitchcock wanted it that way -- so this review will be devoid of any synopsis beyond that of the basic plot summaries given on IMDb. But truth is, the plot is only half the film's genius. The rest belongs to the master of murder and suspense.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" thrives on suspense. Without the constant feeling of paranoia from Hitchcock's careful camera movements or from Bernard Herrmann's vigorous string quartet, many parts of the film would feel long. At this point in his career, Hitchcock was so commanding of his craft that he achieves the desired effect from his audience with nearly every shot, whether it's wanting us to focus on particular items or make specific assumptions about the mystery at hand.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most understated element of the film is Joseph Stefano's screenplay. From what I gather about Robert Bloch's novel, Stefano restructured the story to set up a jarring shift in the plot and encase the mystery in an even thicker container for Hitchcock to best utilize his skills. The scripts only major weakness is the scene right after the climax, which is pointless exposition explaining the previous events; something movie watchers don't need today -- though that's arguably because Hitchcock made this movie.<br/><br/>For those that love Hitchcock's style, ""Psycho"" is an instant classic and perhaps no film of his showcases it better. For those unfamiliar with his work, it's not hard to see while watching ""Psycho"" what made his films so memorable. Even those who don't have an eye for good film-making can even appreciate the entertaining suspense and constantly twisting plot of ""Psycho."""

"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","21 May 2009"," The horror and the terror combining on a broad canvas of genre manipulation; psychoanalysis and deconstruction of an archetype in what most say is Hitchcock's best.
","Similarly to a lot of films from decades-past, nothing anybody here, or anywhere else, says about certain films will alter their status as ground breaking, or influential in certain aspects, pieces of cinema. Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is one of those such films, a film that put paid to an entire era and mindset in American cinema; a film that defied grammar and construction and went all out in its deconstruction of both genre and issues of censorship. A film made by a man usually uttered within the same breath as both Kubrick and Welles when it comes to the film-makers that shaped cinema in its first full century as an existing medium. Most will say Psycho is Hitchcock at his best, and you'd be hard pressed to disagree with them.<br/><br/>Essentially, Psycho is a film that covers a fair degree of psychoanalysis going on within a close knit locale. The majority of the film is dominated by a certain Norman Bates (Perkins), a young man whose mother still has a grip on him as he attempts to live whatever pitiful existence he has. Bates will predominantly inhabit one of either two spaces, briefly breaking off to inhabit a rural, swamp locale for the dumping of a car. The predominant two are a cabin, complete with motel rooms and an office as well as his house on the hill which he 'shares' with his mother. Something that Hitchcock does to a very basic level with these seemingly innocent, everyday locations is turn them into spaces of the 'uncanny' variety. That is to say, at a time when Hollywood's studio system permitted definitive genres to be shot on certain sets well suited to the genre film being made, (a mad scientist's laboratory for horror or the inside of a space ship for a sci-fi) Hitchcock manipulates offices and houses and other such 'spaces' and turns them on their heads for what the locations initially demand you produce there.<br/><br/>But the toying with the genre isn't limited to just this. The set up involves a certain Marion Crane (Leigh) and the theft of a large amount of money from her boss. What is set up as a road movie, in which we might assume chase to be the primary narrative drive, turns into something completely different. Initially, the film is driven by a woman. Marion is presented in a less than flattering light, established at the very beginning when it appears she has spent the entirety of her lunch break with another man out of wedlock. Following this is the theft and the complete disregard for authority and her own safety when it transpires she sleeps in her car and very quickly tries to get rid of a police officer when he questions her.<br/><br/>For this passage of film, Psycho relies on its suspense revolving around whether Marion will be caught as would-be lines of dialogue are exchanged within Marion's mind to do with what her peers are debating back at her work. What we assume will be a (routine?) chase film-come-thriller as her boss strives to get his money back will become something else entirely, aptly marked at a certain point in the film in which special attention is given to the removing of the money from the piece. Following this, a new plot drive, indeed protagonist, takes over the reigns of the film and it branches out into a different beast.<br/><br/>I suppose we are meant to consider Psycho a horror piece, despite it starting off as a thriller told from the guilty's perspective as essence of chase looms in the background. Later on, following the famous shower scene, tides will turn and what essentially remains a detective story is told from a killer's perspective. The film places the audience within the world of a murderer and we begin to see that world through the eyes of this character, something that occurs perhaps slightly out of turn when Norman spies on Marion getting undressed in her motel room by the office. It is a signifying of power; a placing the audience into a position of power that they are forced to share with Norman, whom, at the time, probably just comes across as a little eccentric. Later on, however, the audience are completely roped in and must share the stress with Norman. A clever move on Hitchcock's behalf is in the form of private detective Milton Arbogast (Balsam), who badgers poor Norman at the motel reception about recent visitors. Norman squirms and, as an audience, we may have an immediate reaction of not wanting Norman to get caught out. But should we be feeling these emotions given who he is and what he did? <br/><br/>If Psycho achieves anything, it is the manipulation of genre and film language, but it is additionally the breaking down of a character archetype. For the film to spend time with Norman, a seemingly normal human being, as this 'monster' inhabiting a horror film, is extraordinary. There is nothing initially uncanny about Norman and he is a far cry from previous horror genre 'monsters' in the form of anything Universal had to offer at the time. But the film retains a spooky and unnerving atmosphere, punctuated by set pieces involving the aforementioned Arbogast, in a memorable scene on some stairs; but also right towards the end when normal, everyday individuals move in on Bates' house to uncover the truth, in what is a sequence that is still rather frightening. Psycho is somewhat of a towering achievement, and the fact an individual produced this sort of a film yet still managed to cause debate as to whether it's his out-and-out best work, is arguably the most incredible thing about the Psycho."

There have been many changes to the genre over the last couple of decades, perhaps the most significant when the genre went digital with the psychologically frightening Blair Witch Project. But as times grow many horrors are spurned with little effect on the viewers who expect someone hiding with typical music and degrading stereotypes, for example The Hole.<br/><br/>Psycho, released in the early 1960's, may have lost an edge in sharpness with technology inevitability taking control over scares but the shock and drama encoded remain intact and is still a favourite amongst horror fanatics and the shower scene is still debated as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best.<br/><br/>Starting off Psycho sets Janet Leigh and John Gavin debating their future and soon Leigh has money and sets off on her own. This act of selfishness and greed brings viewers right up to scratch as her angelic image is far from her devilish actions and we soon have a thriller on our hands. And soon we also have Anthony Perkins to contend with.<br/><br/>Perkins brings a sharp and twisted shock to the story with a disturbing portrayal of a lonely man wanting company and as we see his stalkerish obsession mixed with his bizarre hobby we dive right into the infamous scene and the shock will surprise and entertain you with a swirling and dramatic depiction of the consequences by Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Again the English director shows a sharp intensity in story telling with fast moving montages and a clever use of bird eye view angles to capture the shocking story in its full intensity.<br/><br/>This horror drama has one of the finest musical scores I personally have ever heard for such a genre. The opening sharp cut title sequences and credits role with a finely established mixture of sophistication and sharpness that generates a feeling of excitement and tension to set you up for the film.<br/><br/>As far as horror films go these days you will see a helpless stereotype waiting for the inevitable to happen.

","1st watched 1/27/2009 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): Scary and strange classic Hitchcock movie provides plenty of reasons to watch and enjoy. Janet Lee plays a woman who decides to steal a large sum of cash and escape with it. The problem is she stops off to stay at the Bates Hotel overnight(which was definitely a mistake) and runs into the Bates family -- or at least it appears this way. Anthony Perkins is excellent as the disturbed son of the messed up family who covers up for his supposed mother's mistakes in the true good son fashion. The mystery behind the movie is determining who did the evils to Janet and others in the Bates Hotel. Hitchcock brilliantly keeps us guessing til the end as well as providing the shocks that we expect from the movie. This is the ultimate weird family scary movie that others have tried to imitate(some well and some badly), but they never match the excellent direction done by the master storyteller. There is the much imitated shower scene, but the overall movie in general is well written and put together and the one scene shouldn't make the entire movie(which it doesn't here).

","This is considered, and rightfully so, the grandfather of all slashers. It IS that. Period. Nothing I say hereafter is designed to lessen that fact.<br/><br/>Psycho is a study of the higher end of the schizophrenic mind, when coupled with some of the more extreme examples of the Oedipus complex. In this example, Norman BECOMES his deceased mother; a mother he killed for bringing confliction and sexual repression into his psyche. Her addition of a new boyfriend into the already sexually muddled situation, added just enough aggression to the mix that it culminated in the murder of both the mother AND the boyfriend, leaving Norman to figure out his own place in the world.<br/><br/>Once Norman decided that his mother was still alive and still instructing him in how to behave in life, dictating his actions, and deciding his fate by committing heinous acts of her own, Norman then adapted himself to fit his mother's teachings and instructions. He thereby molded himself into a serial killer who not only could, but required, the close intimate act of knife work, as that was the only intimacy he was allowed.<br/><br/>And then once he killed, the confliction sets in. Everything is meticulously cleaned up, intimately inventoried, and utterly hidden. The crime scene is lovingly restored to its virginal state, and Normal resumes his otherwise lackluster life.<br/><br/>As a movie, this is a masterpiece no matter what others would say. The pure psychology of the antagonist is case and study for countless students over the nearly fifty years since this hit the big screen. Hitchcock demonstrates a total understanding of the psychopathic mind, and translates that understanding brilliantly to the silver screen.<br/><br/>His choice of Bosco (chocolate syrup) to serve as the blood in the shower scene shows a deeper understanding of the necessary visual dynamics required to propel this into the annals of ""classic,"" regardless of what some naysayers would opine. Psycho IS a classic. It is a classic among Hitchcock's works, among the horror genre, the psychological thriller genre, and among the slasher sub-genre.<br/><br/>No matter how old this is, it still generates a lovely suspense, and stands tall when compared to modern films of the same genre(s).<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great watch, even for a Friday or Saturday night.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","Without a single doubt, Alfred Hitchcock is the greatest director who ever lived. So, obviously, the fans of his always choose what film they think his masterpiece. For me, that film would have to be Psycho. There's just no flaws. The score by Bernard Hermann is magnificently ominous and eerie. The cinematography is beautifully photographed in black & white. The story is original (it was in 1960). The script is well-written with crisp dialogue and real people with real emotions. And the acting is superb from Janet Leigh's screaming in the shower to Anthony Perkins' jittery stuttering when he's talking to Detective Arbogast. The best scene in the film is when the psychiatrist is explaining what events had just taken place to Vera Miles & John Gavin. Psycho is the #1 movie ever made!"

","I sat to watch this movie with a lot of expectation, since it is ranked among the top 20 of all time and was directed by Hitchcock. Usually I enjoy both the dialogs and visuals from a Hitchcock movie but in this the only dialog I remember was during the start'He was flirting with you, he must have noticed the ring on my hand'. On the visual side however the noticeable, innovation (must have been at that time) was the height at which the house (of the Norman) was located, it must have been the camera angle too, that every time you look at it, it gives you a spooky feeling, so just the angle did it! The concept of the movie however is the thing that has taken it to the top of the list (I guess), which has been used in several movies by now but must have been a novelty at that time. The lead actor's performance is the best in the movie, even though in the starting one might think that it can't be him, it must be the lady herself or her lover but this guy gets into the frame perfectly and unfolds himself with each dialog. On the whole a good movie but Rear window still remains my favorite Hitchcock movie."

","If buffs of ambitious movies search timeless horrors, they usually encounter PSYCHO by Alfred Hitchcock, the movie that, in a way, has become a sort of cult movie watched all over again in various places on earth. Yet, such movies usually lead us to a dilemma of high expectations and the subjective reactions after first viewing.<br/><br/>When I decided to see PSYCHO for the first time, I was surprised with one feature that from the very beginning and throughout the whole movie caught my attention: intellectual authenticity. That concerns all aspects from performances to soundtrack and script. Since PSYCHO by master director Alfred Hitchcock was released almost 50 years ago and has already ""experienced"" the test of time, we could well expect this movie to occur dated due to its black and white nature and allegedly old fashioned acting. However, what appears to all viewers is just the opposite. The movie still impresses as a clever story, still shocks as a horror, still stuns with its cinematography and soundtrack as a work of art.<br/><br/>Who can possibly ignore the flawless thrill in various moments of the film that remain in memory for long, moments of stunning cinematography, marvelous lighting that make black and white more attractive than lots of top visual effects? Except for the famous shower-murder scene that combines gore with sexuality and thrill with empathy, there are really breathtaking moments that lead the viewer to the extent of ""orgasmic"" trance of mind. Consider for instance, Marion (Janet Leigh) driving a car and her thoughts of various sorts. Another moment worth attention is Marion - Norman conversation...someone would perhaps ask ""what's brilliant about it?"" Everything! It is simply the moment of mental power that I have hardly found elsewhere, you, as if (of course illusively) get into the mind and perception of this man, into his peculiar hobby, into his very island of ""divided"" self. The shot of Norman's house with cloudy sky in the background makes an enormous effect. And here, it's a must to mention the marvelous scene of Lilah (Vera Miles), Marion's sister approaching the house... How wonderfully filmed, what a soundtrack, what a power of illusion and bliss of thrill! Nowadays, one can only imagine how innovative and convincing the film must have been in 1960...<br/><br/>The performances in the film are sublime. I find all of the acting remarkable but if I were to choose the three most memorable ones, I'd say: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles/Janet Leigh and Martin Balsam. I know that this choice may seem inaccurate to some readers but that is my personal opinion. Perkins gives a masterwork of performance embodying a character of true psychological contradictions that we find later, as we get to know him better. Naturally, psychology is hidden, innate and far from being discovered as easily as looks. Perkins had a very difficult task in this film, some of the hardest ones ever, but he crafted it perfectly, including his final scene... Perhaps you wonder why I have combined Vera Miles and Janet Leigh together but it was done deliberately. The two portray sisters and occur to me as true sisters of the same authentic depiction of fear, of curiosity, of sexual appeal. There could not be a better choice for these roles than the two. Finally, Martin Balsam as private detective Arbogast is brilliant focusing on strong personality ready to cope with suspicion and terror. His scene with Norman is unforgettable with this truly accurate wordiness of investigation.<br/><br/>But I feel that the gist of why PSYCHO was such a blockbuster and has been popular for all these years is neither its artistic side including performances, cinematography, soundtrack, nor even the direction. Its key of success lies in the fact that it is a horror of a psyche set partly within the psyche. It is not a series of shocking scenes with monsters, ghosts or imaginary creatures but the film rooted in the very riddle of human mind, distorted as it may seem yet pretty universal. The scenes we get near the end of the film, perhaps seem hardly real as if not of this world but after longer inspection, it appears they all make a perfect sense. Therefore, the reason for its authenticity is foremost the movie's psychological aspect memorably presented. Strange numbers add to the mystery of all and the atmosphere works for the rest.<br/><br/>All in all, PSYCHO is an unforgettable film, a pearl in the genre and a true model for many modern thrillers that turn either to kitsch or to cheap entertainment. Hitchcock's film is an example of how cinema can entertain, shock, provoke and also educate a bit. If you're looking for your island of escape from decadent and meaningless effects in modern horrors, go to something original and see PSYCHO, a superior thriller of mind."
"Ibuk","10","0","0","8 November 2008"," The one that started it all
","When released in 1960 Psycho's impact on the horror genre was so great that 48 years later filmmakers still seem to be influenced. Psycho inspired movies like Halloween,Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street,Child'd play and many more. When I watched it for the first time a couple of months I was worried that I wouldn't appreciate it seeing as the twist is widely known. Despite knowing the twist it was still shocking and I throughly enjoyed it. The scene in which they find out the truth about Norman Bates mother still disturbs me. The star of the movie has to be Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance was outstanding, especially in the scene in which he almost shows his true colours. Psycho is a true gem and in my opinion has made a valuable contribution to the horror genre. Absolutely unmissable."

","In a moment of madness, Marion Crane steals forty thousand dollars from the office she works in and drives to see her lover in the neighbouring state. En route, she stops off at a lonely motel where she meets the curious proprietor, Norman Bates, and decides to try and undo her folly. An altogether different and more grisly fate awaits her however <br/><br/>There are three things about Psycho which I think make it so extraordinarily brilliant. One is Hitchcock's direction, which is faultless; this is one of the few films where I can't think of any way it could be made better. Another is the sheer daring of the movie, both in terms of its subject-matter (an Oedipal, matricidal, necrophiliac, psychotic transvestite as a main protagonist was pretty strong for 1960) and its amazing structure, in which the heroine is murdered after forty-five minutes, something no other film has done (though some are close contenders, e.g. L.A. Confidential). Most of all however, I love the way it redefined my favourite genre of horror films. Prior to Psycho, every horror movie had a physical monster, whether it was Dracula, King Kong, The Fly, whatever. Psycho has a monster - its true face is revealed just after Lila Crane finds Mrs Bates, screams in horror and turns around - and it's a man. The monster isn't some alien creature, it is a person. It is us. A thousand fine movies have then built upon that - Repulsion, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Taxi Driver, Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Silence Of The Lambs - but they were all born out of Psycho. Great directors like Dario Argento and Brian DePalma have essentially spent their careers remaking it (see the latter's Dressed To Kill and Raising Cain particularly). Hitchcock never thought of it as a horror movie, but it is in the truest sense; it's horrifying, the example par excellence of masterful audience manipulation through suspense into a state of delirious anxiety. On paper it is a crime thriller, from an excellent pulp novel by Robert Bloch, and it can be taken that way, but it has so much Gothic spookiness I find it impossible to do so; the nightmarish old Bates house, the grisly fruit cellar, the murky swamp, Norman's eerie stuffed birds in the parlour, the final superimposed subliminal image of Mother's skull on Norman's face. Is his mind simply broken, or is she a vengeful spirit which possesses him ? One of my favourite ideas in the story is how Marion actually gets off the highway when driving through the night. Technically, it's just a device to advance the plot. Logically, she gets lost in the storm. Personally, I think it's some sinister spell that leads her to her doom at the Bates Motel, like a bewitched innocent in a fairy-tale. Both Perkins and Leigh are stunning in this movie; he for his incredible mannerisms and hawkish stare, and she for her stunning intensity and world-weary introspection. Their supper scene together in the back-office is one of my favourite dialogue scenes of all time as these two lost souls briefly connect, baring their souls despite speaking in riddles; ""We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you ?"". The role was something of a curse for Perkins, who never really got to play a mainstream part later, but he created an unforgettable character who is at the very top of cinema's long list of social outcasts. His final scene sitting in the cell is one of the most profound and frightening pieces of acting I have ever had the privilege to watch. Equally stunning is Bernard Herrmann's riotous all-string score, with its famous screeching violins and rhythmic cellos. As with the best movies, the music is really the dramatic anchor of the film, hugely inflating all the suspense and terror - when the famous shower sequence batters us into submission, it is the assault on our ears just as much as our eyes which floors us. For those of you who think the Oscars reward quality film-making, this is a good example of a stunning movie which won no Academy Awards, losing out to such cinematic greats as The Apartment, Butterfield 8 and Sons And Lovers. Arguably the greatest of Hitchcock's masterpieces (though I prefer The Birds) and undoubtedly the most influential; it was followed years later by three direct sequels (the first of which is very good) and a pointless shot-for-shot colour remake. Hitch appears in his standard walk-on as the man in the cowboy hat outside Marion's office."
"stewiefan201","10","0","0","17 October 2008"," A landmark in horror history housing one of the greatest, if not the greatest, movie villain in history,
","Psycho is a landmark in horror movie history. Alfred Hitchcock uniquely directed the first ever slasher movie, and did so with wit, quality, and absolute brilliance. Psycho is the first Alfred Hitchcock movie I've seen, and I am very impressed by it. Now I've seen lots and lots of slasher flicks in my day, but never have I seen one anywhere near the caliber of Psycho.<br/><br/>Psycho is about a young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). While she's at work one day, out of the blue she decides to steal 40,000 dollars in cash from an investor. She goes on the run telling nobody where she is going, and soon becomes paranoid and wary of her surroundings, and also the people around her. On a particularly rainy night, Marion stops at the Bates Motel where she meets the odd owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman invites her to eat dinner with him, and takes a considerable liking to her. At first he seems like a regular nice guy, but it turns out that he does have a dark side after all. Norman's ""mother"" is a very controlling woman, and as it turns out may be a murderer as well. Using Norman to cover up her vicious attacks. Marion goes missing, and tensions and suspense raise to unbearable heights as Marion's sister and boyfriend, and also a private investigator, begin looking for her. Leading them all the way up to none other than the Bates Motel...and Norman ""himself"".<br/><br/>This is the greatest horror movie I've ever seen, and definitely one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The suspense is built up incredibly, and the story's twists and turns are amazing. I could never successfully guess what was going to happen next in this movie. And you can't say that about most slasher movies these days. After watching Psycho I realize how much recent slasher films blatantly rip off Hitchcock's masterpiece. However Psycho will now remain an unmovable cinema classic in my eyes, and those new age ripoffs will not. It amazes me how a film that is nearly 50 years old, and in black and white, can still terrify audiences. It's simply astonishing what Hitchcock created here.<br/><br/>Now I'll get into the film itself. Just about everything is done right in Psycho. The editing is among some of the best I've ever seen. The cinematography really helps a lot of scenes, and only adds to the terror. Take the ""shower scene"" scene for example: It was shot in such a way that you couldn't see any nudity; and I also appreciated how the scene starts up very bright, and as the dark sinister figure moves closer to the curtains, you get that ominous feeling that tells you that something very bad is about to happen. The acting is also very good. Janet Leigh gives a strong performance, and I'm telling you to keep an eye on her facial expressions, because they reveal her character's paranoia and regret. But the real star of the show, the reason the movie is called Psycho, is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins plays one of the best villains of all time, and one of my personal favorites. You don't know what is going on with this guy. At first he seems normal, then he's covering up a murder with a boyish grin on his face, and then you get to his real personality underneath. Perkins plays Norman as a complete mama's boy who stutters under pressure, and on the spot tries to think up ways to cover up his ""mother's"" murders. At first it seems to be an average performance, but then you begin to notice how Perkins makes his character stutter with nervous ticks, and laughing when he makes a joke. It's the tiny details, of which there are quite a few, that make Perkins performance into one of the scariest movie villains in history.<br/><br/>Psycho is an ingenious horror film because it blends natural horror with great acting, surprising twists, red herrings, suspense, and a constant sense that something is very bad is about to happen. Hitchcock has created the best horror I've ever seen. After 50 years it is still suspenseful and terrifying, and that is the mark of a brilliant filmmaker. I can't wait to see more of Hitchcock's movies. Psycho gets a 5 out of 5 from me."

","""We're all caught in our private traps, we scratch and claw at the air, at each other, but for all of it, we never budge an inch"".<br/><br/>Yes, ""Psycho"" is missing the vibrancy of ""North by Northwest"", vividity of ""Vertigo"", ambiguity of ""The Birds"", and claustrophobia of ""Rear Window"", but it is a unique movie in its very own league. With Hitchcock's sharp eye with little details, genius camera angles, and keen sense of generating suspense and tension, ""Psycho"" is multi-layered and richly-textured film, actually this is Master's last great picture.<br/><br/>The film starts out very slowly. During the first hour, Hitchcock focuses on a single specific event and takes the viewer somewhat familiar point mostly seen in classic film noirs: a confused woman, being stuck in an impasse with a lover bogged down in financial woes, steals money off her employer. Things becomes to go awry en route California (where her lover lives), while she encounters some ""MacGuffins"" such as a mysterious patrolman and suspicious used-car salesman, both are the harbingers of incipient tension and terror. Her edgy trip ends in a sleazy motel off the main highway in a rainy night. Hitchcock startles the viewer while central female antagonist dies half-way through the film, and takes us another sinister place where the real secret is revealed. From this point, Anthony Perkins lead the show as twitchy motel keeper with peculiar idiosyncrasies. This is the role of his life, as everybody is waiting horrified whenever this schizoid time bomb will go off.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, Hitchcock imbues the film with a heavy atmosphere of impending doom. Blood-chilling strings of composer Bernard Herrmann adds greatly to the overall moodiness. Today's horror/thrillers depend too much on graphic violence, where blood, gore, decapitations, and dismembered bodies galore. Not overly violent and with almost no blood and gore, the unshakable effectiveness ""Psycho"" mutters up comes from what is implied, but not shown. He always used to make the audience use their imagination. This is the greatness of Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Now for the downside, I found the second half of the film somewhat forced. Private eye Arbogast's insatiable obsession with Norman and his ill mother is totally unconvincing. Lila's (Marion's sister) intuition about something bad had happened in the motel is groundless. Sam and Lila's visit to the motel and their sureness about Marion's stay in room number 1 is totally implausible. Also, the secret of the film is predictable half-way through, as soon as all the pieces are put in proper places. But, neither of these weak points undermine the cleverness and effectiveness of this great piece of cinema. ""Psycho"" is definitely a classic and deserves to be called so."

","After watching the documentary on Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick, I have noticed that their styles and ways of doing things are very different. The one thing I noticed is that when Alfred Hitchcock was with Selznick the stories showed more compassion and had to do a lot more about romance. I saw a preview of Gone with the Wind It was very different then the movie Psycho, the action in Gone with the Wind was very dry and had a since of just being put there the main focus of the story was mostly on love. As for the Hitchcock movie Psycho that I watch completely of, his way showed a different way of looking at styles of camera angles and the story had almost no romance and lots of scary action and suspense. In my mind even though Selznick made one big success it doesn't compare to Hitchcock's powerful way of filming and creating such powerful works of art. In a way I could say that Selznick portrays his ideas as a romantic but in real life does not have any of the qualities, but as for Hitchcock as looking at his movies you see a very excluded man with some problems, but once again a complete opposite. One of my favorite seen in the movie Psycho was the shower seen the other was when the man gets stabbed and ""roll"" down the stairs, very ingenious on Hitchcock's part."

","Hitchcock only suggested that the psychiatrist scene would be a ""hat grabber"" he gave Josef Stefano his blessing to write that scene as he saw fit; if Hitch had really hated that scene it would have been gone. Hitch only overruled Stefano's wish to use a female psychiatrist. (Had psychiatrist scene been cut, Hitch needn't have cut the poignant scene where Lila Crane and Sam Loomis converse at length, sharing that they have both become reconciled to the fact that Marion won't be found alive).
The most implausible thing in Stefano's script is the unhappy relationship between Marion and Sam. We learn that Marion Crane worked in Phoenix Az. for Lowery's realty company for 10 years. So how on earth would she have become romantically involved with a divorced hardware store proprietor, living 550 miles away in California?? Their tryst seems like a very clumsy and implausible plot device to me. 
I may be nit picking to mention this error but it is surprising that Alfred and Alma Hitchcock missed this one, given their meticulous attention to detail. (Remember how upset Hitch got about there being a full moon in the rain-machine shoot outside the Bates Motel? - the plot development didn't really require it to be raining at all.) During the opening pan shot in Phoenix, the caption reads Friday December 11th. Later, in the ""dead of night"" scene Lila Crane tells deputy sheriff Al Chambers that Marion Crane left Phoenix ""a week ago yesterday"". This would make it Saturday December 19th, and thus the scene outside the Fairvale church would have been on Sunday 20th. Yet in the penultimate scene at the District Attorney's office we see a calendar on the wall that shows the Dec 17th (a Thursday)."

It's got everything you could ask for in a movie of its type. ""Psycho"" is extraordinarily scary, especially for an older film. The B & W cinematography is enchanting and very creepy. Hitchcock sure knows how to shoot a movie and surround himself with the right people.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Psycho"" is also amazing. Anthony Perkins is beyond creepy as the multi-dimensional Norman Bates. Janet Leigh portrays the flawed damsel part perfectly, and she brings a great strength to the role.<br/><br/>I won't give the story's plot details so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that it is both incredibly compelling and strangely disturbing. There's a strong psychological aspect that gives the film a whole other dimension. You can watch it for the chills, the thrills, the themes, or all of the above. If you can only see one Hitchcock movie in your lifetime, let this be the one."
"bckesler","10","0","0","10 August 2007"," Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho'
","'Psycho' is Alfred Hitchcock's strangest, most disturbing, and best film he has ever made. The movie starts off in Phoenix, Arizona where lovers Sam Loomis and Marion Crane are sharing a secret, passionate afternoon in a cheap hotel. Marion is worried that their relationship won't work because they live so far apart and have to keep their love a secret. In the next scene, Marion is at work, her boss asks her to deliver 40, 000 dollars into the bank. In desperation, she steals the money and pursues California to find her lover and run away with him with their new fortune. On the way, however, Marion goes through several obstacles. A policemen finds her suspicious, as does a car salesman. Marion is a clumsy thief. Finding it hard to see the road through a rainstorm, Marion pulls off into an old inn, The Bates Motel. There she meets Norman Bates, a flirtatious, sad, likable guy who's aggressive mother worries Marion. Here are two people, Marion and Norman, who are both trapped. However, Marion has a chance to redeem herself, and she hopes Norman does too. The choice to film in black and white was an inspiration. Instead of grossing out the audience, Hitchcock disturbs the audience with violent and tragic scenes. Joseph Stefano hands over a brilliant script, making this story extremely interesting from a source material that was rather quite dull. We never know exactly where the storie's going and the melding powers of Hitchcock and Stefano are to thank. The music by Bernard Hermann is pure genius. From the second the film opens, our attention is on the screen. The score is all strings, and it brings out the beauty of the black and white picture. Janet Leigh gives a terrific performance as Marion Crane, as do Gavin Lee, Martan Balsam and Vera Miles as the supporting characters. But the best performances come from a voice over work by Virginia Gregg as 'Mother' and Anthony Perkins' defining role as Norman Bates, not only the best performance in his career, but the best performance given by any actor ever. He captures all the subtleties and tragic struggle of the character so well, that he is one of the most memorable characters of all time. Psycho has a terrific surprise ending and a everything ties up nicely in a psychiatric scene most critics seem to hate, but I find resonate. The film has two reaccuring themes: Dependence and hatred of our own mothers. And describing a word by using the same word: ""Eating in an office is too officious."" ""You make respectability sound disrespectful."" ""I will not speak of such disgusting things because they disgust me."" All in all, Psycho is a near perfect film, and a film that hopefully will live forever."

","This is probably one of the greatest horror movies of all time. And even when seeing it in 2007 it still holds up. This is best seen with all the lights out and a lot of popcorn. I did not see this the first time on the big screen but at home..I was too young but and it still scared me. If you haven't seen it enjoy it will bring goose bumps all over your body. The film does wonders on letting your mind projected the horror. All future movies on psycho paths were made following the guidelines of this film. The remake was lame.. I recommend this to anyone interested in viewing horror films without the blood and gore that now is shown. Enjoy."

","Some people say that this the best film ever, well I agree this was good and the plot was so good it left me guessing all the way through but probably the only bad thing about it is that its one of those films where you watch it once and thats it because you already know whats going to happen and it kind of spoils the whole film when you watch it again. What really surprised me was that the blood from the notorious 'shower scene' was actually chocolate syrup! For me after 'North By Northwest' this was Hitchcock's best piece of work. Every movie has a bit where it probably would never happen and Psychos is the death where the detective gets stabbed at the top of the stairs and manages to slide all of the way down them again BACKWARDS! But other than that I say well done to the great Alfred Hitchcock"

","This is without a doubt the best film i've ever seen, it never fails to scare me and it has the best and most chilling plot ever. Hitchcock's finest hour, not only his best film, but the best film ever made! it has some of the most classic scenes that has have been imitated but never mastered, the shower scene everybody knows, even if you haven't seen the movie, the absolutely terrifying final scenes in the fruit cellar is perfect horror. Anthony Perkins is so brilliant in the role that you will never be rid of the image of the character that is Norman bates, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and John Gavin are also brilliant and create a tense atmosphere that really chills you. 100% movie making."
"possumopossum","9","0","0","15 May 2007"," Two Psychos in This Movie?
","Yes, we all know that Norman Bates was a psycho, but I tend to think that Marian was, too, to a lesser degree. It seemed that from the beginning of the movie until she was murdered, she was becoming more unhinged. She seemed paranoid throughout all her scenes, always looking over her shoulder, always nervous. Of course, she had reason to be, but something about these scenarios she played in her head while she was driving to Fairvale seemed unreal. Also, that cop that followed her to California was very unnerving. I sometimes wonder if that was real or a dream, or is Hitch leaving us to decide for ourselves if it is or not. Again, this scene seemed surreal. (That cop looked freaky. Like a commandant of a Nazi concentration camp or something.) Wasn't that Robert Stack who played the gentleman who sold her the car? It sure looked and sounded like him.<br/><br/>This is another case of a beautifully crafted story. The way they played up the Norman/mother thing was just pure gold, what can I say? In 1960, this was probably pretty risqué, the opening scene showing Marion in a bra and a night slip in a cheap motel. Also, as I recall wasn't it kind of uncommon to show toilets in a bathroom in the movies? I know the codes were pretty strict back then. And the murder scene. Stephen King mentioned in his book DANSE MACABRE that you never actually see the knife striking Marion. You know what? He's right. I've seen this film dozens of times since I read that book and you don't see the knife actually striking her. Your imagination shows you that. But that movie has a helluva kicker at the end. I'm sure there are still one or two people out there who haven't seen it, so I won't spoil it for them. This is the only Hitchcock movie I have, and it's a doozy. A really great film from a legendary story teller. 9 out of 10."

","The Plot = In the hopes of living happily ever after with her boyfriend (Gavin) whose getting divorced from his ex wife and still paying her keep, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals 40 grand from her place of work and leaves town and ends up at the creepy ""Bates Motel"" where she meets the shy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and well lets just say everything goes wrong for her after that.<br/><br/>Well what can I say about Psycho that hasn't been said a thousand times before, well nothing only that I agree with all the hype and excellent reviews that I've read and has definitely stood the test of time through the years.<br/><br/>In my opinion Psycho is definitely the one that ranks the top of the genre list, and if it wasn't for ""Psycho"" we've probably wouldn't have had all the great slasher flicks through the years such as the successful ""Friday The 13th series"", Halloween series, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Black Christmas. All of which pays dues to this masterpiece, I mean if Psycho weren't made we may wouldn't have had all them slasher movies. I mean Psycho in my opinion inspired all these movies in some way but directer Brian De Palma is the one who uses Psycho/Hitchcock idea for many of his movies.<br/><br/>Shot in black and white which does put some small minded people off and in my opinion it shouldn't, I think it wouldn't have had the same creepy atmoshere if it was shot in colour just look at the terrible remake which came out in 1998, but the less said about that the better i'd say. Brilliantly written and structured screenplay wouldn't have been half as effective with the proper casting, but Psycho definitely delivered in that department with performances from Janet Leigh who plays the unlucky Marion Crane who gives an vulnerable and sympathetic performance that had me siding with her despite her dishonest actions, Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates) was mesmerising in his touching, unsettling, insecure and layered role which nobody else in this world would ever compare to, I'd say he gives an Oscar worthy performance. Vera Miles (Lila Crane) Marion's sister gives a good performance as does Arbogast the unlucky private detective played by Martin Balsam gave an interesting performance. John Gavin (Sam Loomis) was OK, underplayed but didn't really do much.<br/><br/>All in all Every element came together here to make this a visually arresting picture, directer Alfred Hitchcock was truly one of the greatest of all time and was definitely spot on with Psycho which is definitely his finest film ever."
"nostairwaydenied","10","0","0","5 May 2007"," Hitch is God of Film
","Hitchcock is one fine storyteller.<br/><br/>The narrative style is told through the music for the most horrific scenes shown. One other particular scene in which Marion is driving on the freeway toward her boyfriend. The thoughts in her head are coming from first person POV. The majority of the story is told through an overall audience narrative. What we see is what happening. But that isn't always true. There were moments where the story was depicted through the core characters personality. It focuses mainly upon Norman's personality. We really feel what he is going through towards the end and we sympathize slightly as mother takes over his persona. Norman is the central character. His interaction with Marion drives his mother to take over his actions. His mother was a pivoting person in his life. He feels as if his mother won't let him live so his dominate personality takes over permanently at the end. The way everything ties in when it starts with going down a different road, literally. Marion faces choices in the beginning. Weighing of the good with the bad emphases each of her decisions. She has the choice to do the right thing, but she takes a risk and is cramped up into a corner. As soon as she decides to change her mind, she is stopped. Director Alfred Hitchcock shows us that things aren't what they seem just because you think you're doing the right thing for yourself. No matter how much you cover up the evidence, you will be caught and sentenced. The deaths are filmed just a painting come to life. When Detective Arboghast gets killed, he falls backward and we are propelled with him as he tumbles to the floor receiving repetitive stabbings from Norman as mother. Just because you know what is right from wrong, doesn't mean that somehow you'll be pardoned. In Arboghast's position, he read more into the problem and ultimately, that was what killed him. He knew too much and would have told Sam and Lila had he the chance if he wasn't stabbed.<br/><br/>The POV in the film changes dramatically after Marion was stabbed. It was Norman's business from than on. The film drives us to believe the story is going to be about Marion when in fact, she was the trigger that set off Norman to be the main setting. But as Hitchcock shows us, Norman is an innocent in all of this. He was held captive by mother. She began dominating his actions more and more as the story progress. Another scene in which Hitchcock plays with POV was the scene where Norman was sitting in the station and asked for a blanket. A truly disturbing part of the scene in where he changed POV was when Norman's mother was complaining and blaming Norman for everything that happened to her. The final lines summed up the reasons why mother was so clever to get away with the things she got away with. ""They'll see and they'll say, 'Why, she wouldn't even hurt a fly!'"" It's a definitive film that means so many things but the main idea was that Hitchcock wanted to understand the main focus of the synopsis. Don't trust just anyone on the run. Truly the greatest terror film ever made!"

","Arguably the most famous horror movie in the history of cinema, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho still stands up well today, despite the numerous parodies of the movie, most notably the shower scene.<br/><br/>Though I was unfortunate enough to stumble upon the ending, where one discovers the identity of the killer- Norman Bates donned in women's clothing, Psycho was still very likable.<br/><br/>The film's greatest strength for me, was Norman Bates- one of the greatest villains in movie history. Unlike countless horror movies, the villain of Psycho isn't one-dimensional and though a villain he many be, one grows to sympathize with him, and almost like him. A unfortunate childhood and misguided personality, just barely described toward the end, is where the real suspense kicks in. Finishing with a dark glare from Bates, the viewer is left feeling confused and terrified for even after the killer is revealed, why he really murdered who he murdered is left merely half explained.<br/><br/>The viewer can grapple for answers all they like, but it is unlikely that they find the true answers to all the questions that float around in their head after the screen has faded to black, which gives Psycho an ingredient that places it above the likes of Halloween, Friday the 13th or even The Shining and is enough proof that Alfred Hitchcock will always be THE master of suspense."

Going off on her own, some bad weather forces her to stop at the Bates hotel, which should be an uneventful night before getting back on track. However there is nothing uneventful about what she's going to go through...<br/><br/>Yes, this film is over 40 years old. Yes, this film does look dated in a few small areas. However despite all this Psycho was still, to me frightening. I first watched it on TV and thought it a well done thriller. Having watched it in movies class again, I couldn't believe how much the film had scared me. The now infamous shower scene(infamous to the point it's not even a spoiler), although looking a little dated, frightened me. A lot of it had to do with the music. The music and clever camera angles make this very effective, especially the music. Despite all the sppofs where you hear the music, this is the only time the music proves effective. Also acting ranging from competent to, in Perkins case great, helps the film along as well.<br/><br/>In today's age where exploitation films have gone from an underground genre to commercial and mainstream, films like Psycho will always produce more fear then all the Saw and Hostel films put together.<br/><br/>8/10"

","A brilliant example of a classic Hitchcock technique that has been matched by none is his ability to draw the audience's attention to a very specific item in the film, only to have that item end up completely irrelevant in the end. Marion stealing the $40,000 seems crucial to where the film is going when it happens, and when you realize that it holds no real relevance to the plot, it intensifies the classic and surprising ending. Hitchcock has a way of leading the watcher one way and immediately taking a sharp turn in another direction - a true testament to why he is one of the greatest filmmakers in history."

","Psycho starts as a common ""black"" movie with our heroine Marion (Janet Leigh)stealing us$ 40.000 from his boss for sentimental reasons. Her run ends up at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman (Anthony Perkins) and his sick mother. All of a sudden she is smashed to death in the famous shower scene, no more than 40 minutes after that start. Then we realize we have entered in a completely different kind of movie: a sordid Thriller with a surprising ""finale"" much like a horror film. Hitchcock carries the picture perfectly and it makes complete sense at the end. Back in 1960 double personality movies where not common and many appeared after Psycho (Dressed to Kill, as the outstanding example),but none could get even close to the original. Interest is kept all along and the music score is perfect too. As for the cast, it could not be better. Leigh proved for the first time she could really act and did well after Psycho. Vera Miles also grew as an actress after Psycho, and John Gavin was correct (unusual in him). John McIntyre and Martin Balsam make great supporting. As for Perkins there can be no doubt this was his best performance ever; in fact, you could say the film ruined his carrier because whenever you saw him after Psycho you could not help see Norman Bates. But on the other side, the role put him forever in films history. Saying that Psycho is Hitchcok's best picture shows clearly the huge size of this movie coming from a guy that made such classics as Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, North by Northwest and many others. Without a ""shadow of a doubt"" Psycho is the best thriller ever made!"

","I was just flipping channels tonight and this was on. Even though I have seen it before, I just could not move on and became totally caught up in it. That was the genius of Hitchcock. The way the shots were framed, the way the story was laid out, the way the actors moved and talked-- it all works as an organic whole.<br/><br/>We have a lot more knowledge of psychology today, or at least we think we do, but the shrink's little wrap-up talk at the end is still fascinating. One thing that probably is dated is the sinister/crazy look on the face of Norman Bates at the end. It works for the spooky effect and sends a chill up your spine, but real-life killers probably never show such ""mad"" expressions. Then again, the way Norman Bates is portrayed at the beginning is realistic, in that most people who meet mad killers so not detect anything unusual about them.<br/><br/>John Gavin, who later abandoned acting and became US ambassador to Mexico, was the one stiff and unconvincing actor in this film. At his senate hearing, as I recall, he told the panel, ""I am not an actor and I have several films I can show you to prove it!""<br/><br/>There were several great shots in this film beyond the famous shower scene that usually gets all the attention. The scariest single moment was the killing on the stairs. Then there is the swinging light and the skeletal face of the ""mother."" (Spoiler for anyone who just emerged from a cave and has never seen this film).<br/><br/>Hollywood, of course, made a remake some years ago, but this is the film to see."

","Was what Hitchcock did best, and he reached his apex here in 'Psycho'. I suppose one can put the blame on Hitch for the seemingly-relentless cycle of slasher flicks that are churned out today, for 'Psycho' started the rot. Yet what terrific 'rot' this granddaddy of the horror genre is.<br/><br/>So much has already been said about 'Psycho' that adding a comment seems unnecessary, but I'll try and give a brief summary of my feelings towards this film: Hitchcock created one of his most fascinating characters (and one of cinema's absolute finest) in Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins gives a performance that is nothing short of brilliant as the conflicted protagonist, evoking both sympathy for his loneliness and disgust for his actions. Hitchcock manipulates the audiences feelings towards the villain, as he did memorably in the earlier 'Notorious' and 'Shadow Of A Doubt'. Perkins would never break free of this role for the rest of his life, and his Norman is truly haunting. His chilling final scene (his face) will blow you away.<br/><br/>Our supporting cast give varied performances. Miles is excellent as usual in her role as Lila Crane; her and Perkins carry the acting honours away. Both John Gavin and Janet Leigh are reasonably good (Leigh handles the notorious 'shower scene' very well), but noticeably weaker in support (particularly Gavin- he just isn't a leading man).<br/><br/>Hitch shot this in black-and-white for a purpose- the gore of his scenes would not go down well in colour. Also, shooting in black-and-white gives 'Psycho' an even darker, mysterious quality, with Hitchcock's brilliant use of lighting and shadow to create mood and suspense. It has the feel of a low-budget, roadhouse film, and this effect suits it perfectly.<br/><br/>The suspense flows nicely throughout, apart from a rather slow and, at times, frankly irritating, opening sequence. Hitch takes a long time to set this one up, yet once we reach the Bates residence we know that we are in for one hell of a ride- that's when the picture becomes great. The only other significant downer comes near the end where the shocking order of events are explained through some rather (for today) quaint psychobabble. Apparently it was added in to try and explain the horror and motives to terrified audiences in the 60's, yet it comes across as hokey today.<br/><br/>'Psycho' deals with then-shocking elements of theft, necrophilia, incest (you'll look at the term 'Mummy's Boy' on an entirely new level after watching this), adultery and murder. This was shocking on first release and it's content is still powerful today, resonating with a modern audience.<br/><br/>The murders are handled brilliantly- the amazing, classic shower scene that takes everything we have viewed in the first half of the film and distorts it completely. It is brutal, compelling and, accompanied by Bernard Hermann's screeching violin score, quite terrifying. We don't actually see the knife jabbing into Leigh, yet we still see so much. In this, Hitch effectively 'shifted' the role of key protagonist from one character to another.<br/><br/>It's so atmospheric- look at the visual effects used in the Bates Motel, the predatory birds (a recurring Hitchcock motif)that surround Norman as he eats with Marion Crane (another 'bird' from 'Phoenix'). Vera Miles searching Mother's bedroom for clues. The revealing scene with 'Mother' and the swinging light bulb.<br/><br/>To say any more would be to spoil a fascinating cinema experience- just go out and SEE IT.<br/><br/>9/10."

Alfred Hitchcock has brought the book from Robert Bloch to the big screen and turned it into one of the scariest and most suspenseful movies to ever hit the screen since it debuted in 1960 making audiences aware when taking showers. The shower scene is one of cinema's most terrifying and unforgettable moments with incredible tension that makes the viewers feel for the characters, the score by Bernard Herrman is total classic for sure and the movie went on to become an important landmark for the horror/thriller genre for years to come.<br/><br/>It's often imitated and rip-offed a lot of times and paved the way for slasher flicks since then but nothing can ever come this much close to the original masterpiece that started it all!"

","This was the fifth and final film of Alfred Hitchcocks impressive directorial career to earn him an Academy Award nomination for best director. His other nominated films as a director were Rear window, spellbound, Life Boat and Rebecca. He never won the Oscar. This time around he lost out to Billy Wilder for The Apartment. What he accomplished from this innovative low budget film probably should have won him the Oscar. This is a low budget film for Hitchcock that in toady;s dollars would have cost about $5 million to make. The film was adapted from the 1959 lackluster novel by Robert Bloch by screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Cinematographer Jack Russell got an Academy Award nomination for photographing this film but no major film offers because of his work, He had did Orson Welles' Macbethe early in his career and was mostly involved in television and a few B movies before and after Psycho. He does a great job here along with film editor George Tomasini who edited Stalag 17, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Birds and Cape Fear among his many fine films. A memorable music score from Bernard Herrman who did such films as Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Vertigo and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This is the story of a woman who steals $40,000 dollars and has plans to run away with her married lover but sees her plans and the life she lived evaporate so on the run she stops at a rundown motel off the beaten path that sits in the shadow of an old decapitated wooden turn-of-the-century mansion where the motel keeper lives with his aged mother. It's a classic horror setting and filmed in black and white. Janet Leigh in an Academy award nominated performance as Best Supporting Actress is the woman on the run and Anthony Perkins is the motel keeper who has been hounded by his domineering mother all his life and functions in his lonely existence as a motel keeper of a motel that no one stops at anymore. Also among the cast are Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Gavin and John McIntire. This film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction for it's great set. It's a fairly simple story with twists and turns and a little black comedy thrown in. It's a classic and comes across as kind of a bonus prize for followers of Hitchcock like he was saying here's something a little different for you to check out. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10."
"Imaginist","10","0","0","21 January 2006"," Psycho (5/5 stars)
","Synopsis: Every so often a movie will shatter an audience's preconceived notions and expectations; ""Psycho"" is that kind of film. The key to ""Psycho"" is that it came out nearly 50 years ago and while viewing the film one should keep this in mind. Most of the surprises and tricks we take for granted today were at one point something totally new and different. Writers so often steal and copy ideas from others that everything becomes predictable--in fact, that is the major problem with today's horror flick: the viewer knows exactly what is going to happen. However, ""Psycho"" is sort of a first cause, it's a film that stole nothing yet inspired everything. Of course, to watch the ""Psycho"" in this day and age isn't nearly as exciting as it would have been back in 1960. But as I stated, in order to truly appreciate Hitchcock's genius one has to put himself back in a theatre during ""Psycho's"" release.<br/><br/>The film begins with a young woman, Marion Crane (Leigh). She seems like a respectable girl, but she soon falls to temptation and steals forty thousand dollars from her employer. After this she immediately leaves town and heads towards California. Before she reaches her destination she must first take a night's rest at a roadside motel, the Bates Motel, and here begins our descent into the darkness. At the dilapidated motel, Marion meets the owner, Norman Bates (played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins), and they even have a nice dinner together. Hitchcock has set up the perfect thriller; he dupes us into believing this film is now going to somehow center on Marion and Norman, and in a way it does, but not in the way we anticipate. Hitch starts this film as a classic ""cat and mouse"" game: girl steal money, cops try to get money back. But all of our expectations are shattered as Marion is brutally stabbed to death while she is taking a shower in her motel room. We even discover that the perpetrator is Norman's crazy mother.<br/><br/>Marion may be dead, but her crime is well enough alive. A private investigator (Martin Balsam) (hired by Marion's sister and boyfriend)is on her tail, and traces her to the Bates motel. He too meets and untimely death, and once again we are astounded. Hitchcock not only killed his main character, but now he has killed a cop. We are held in complete suspense; we know that Hitch is not afraid to kill anyone, and that means anything can happen. This is the kind of remarkable and groundbreaking stuff I was talking about. No other director before Hitchcock was as brazen as to knock off the female lead (and certainly not while she was naked in the shower). Could you imagine seeing this for the first time?<br/><br/>Soon enough Marion's sister (Vera Miles) and boyfriend (John Gavin) decide to go find her themselves. They want to convince Marion to turn herself in so she may receive a lesser penalty for her crime. Right before the private investigator was murdered by Momma Bates, he told them that he had traced Marion to the Bates Motel, and thus the two of them head off to the hellhole. Shortly after this point the film ends, and what an end it is! Hitchcock has set us up for one of the most suspenseful, disturbing, and surprising conclusions in cinematic history. I can only imagine how incredible this experience would have been back in 1960, but alas, ""Psycho's"" ending is hardly a secret anymore and some of its more shocking moments are not nearly as jaw-dropping in this modern age. However, that doesn't change the fact that ""Psycho"" spawned the modern horror genre and gave us some of Hitchcock's best cinematography.<br/><br/>We have been exposed to almost fifty years of copycats since ""Psycho"" and because of this I think we have forgotten just how amazing the original was. It is like living in Arizona: one sees the sun so often he forgets how glorious it was when he first moved there. So yes, ""Pyscho"" may seem a bit dated, but that isn't the films fault; that is our fault--we have seen to many duplicates. I will also admit that ""Pyscho"" doesn't really have much of a message (well, unless one counts the film's brief mention of how people create ""traps"" for themselves). However, this movie's goal is not to preach, but to scare and surprise, and I believe it succeeds wonderfully in this area (so long as we can imagine ourselves in a 1960's theatre). ""Pyscho"" is not only a part of American culture, but a milestone in American film-making, and probably Hitchcock's greatest achievement. For all these reasons and them some, I give ""Psycho"": 5 out of 5 stars."

","The truth of the matter is, everytime I think about great films, Psycho is the first to enter my mind. Ever since I saw it for the first time in 1989 on television I have not been able to let go. The simplicity of the imagery, and the fine-skilled actors, make it into a masterpiece. Hitchcock went on to make many great movies more, but ""Pscyho"" is the portrayal of a very disturbed man and his mental state is shown simple, matter-of-factly like only Hitch could do it. I´ve seen it 10 times now, and I will continue to, because it´s the best film I have ever seen. And now,if you will excuse me, Mother is kind of hungry....."

","Starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Simon Oakland, and Janet Leigh as Marion. 4/4, My IMDB Rating: 9.0/10. Rated R for Violence and Brief Nudity.<br/><br/>The now familiar plot concerns Norman Bates, a nervous, bird-like motel proprietor who lives under the domineering influence of his aged invalid mother. Norman takes care of Mother and, in return, she protects the disturbingly boyish man from temptation and corruption, particularly in the form of attractive single women who come to stay at the motel. Marion Crane stops at the Bates Motel after impulsively fleeing from her workplace with a large sum of stolen money. She had hoped this cash would allow her married lover, Sam Loomis, to marry her. After chatting with Norman, Marion appears to resolve to return the money. However, someone intervenes, leaving a bloody mess for Norman to clean up. After he's scrubbed down the bathroom, the dutiful son places the corpse in the trunk of Crane's traded car and sinks all the evidence in a nearby swamp. The situation gets tense for Norman when Marion's sister, Lila, Marion's lover, Sam, and private investigator Milton Arbogast arrive to ask some questions.<br/><br/>
This movie is an all-time classic. Horror at it's finest. Mystery also at it's finest. Anthony Perkins was so good that I think that he should have been atleast nominated for an Academy Award. Although I thought that Psycho II was surprisingly good, I felt that Psycho III, IV, and Psycho(1998) were very inferior. Perhaps no other film changed Hollywood's perception of the horror film so drastically as did PSYCHO. Nowadays, when any psychological thriller featuring a loony with a knife is designated ""Hitchcockian"" in some quarters, it's easy to forget just what a dramatic change of pace this was for Hitchcock. A great catch of the day!"

","Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie is only forty-three years old, yet it rings fear into the hearts of millions of people, each scream louder than the next. What movie is this? Why, Psycho, of course.<br/><br/>It begins with a swift opening credit sequence that is low-tech but does the job. Just like the rest of the movie. This, along with other Hitchcock films, is what horror movies are. You don't need excessive blood and gore and amorous teenagers. All you need is a decent story and tension galore.<br/><br/>Actually, this landmark films is pretty much thrill-free for the first half. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary. She is asked to take $40,000 to the bank, but instead she runs away with it, without telling anybody. She then decides to check into the Bates Motel and chats a bit with loner owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She then takes a shower.<br/><br/>Everybody knows the plot, everyone knows the shower scene. What most people also know is how great this film is. It's finely crafted with superior music and terrific acting all around, with some symbolism all around. First, the music.<br/><br/>Bernard Herrmann, who produced the score for most of Hitch's other movies, did a top-notch job here, also. His strings orchestra really brought out the noir-ish mood. Even when Marion is just driving, you still feel tense because of his A+ score. The superimposed voice-overs that weren't very frequent were also quite good; it seemed like you couldn't tell whether Marion was thinking that or not. Hitchcock is a great directory; his camera shots and precise timing are superb. Most horror filmmakers try to carbon copy his style, but never succeed, because they don't have any of his wit and superiority. This is a fine craftsman at work.<br/><br/>Perkins is eerily great. He manages to be vague and yet vulnerable. He's being overpowered by his overbearing mother who lives in the house behind the motel. He seems like he could be a nice guyuntil he snaps. Leigh is also great, along with Vera Miles (Marion's sister Lila), John Gavin (Marion's boyfriend Sam), and Martin Balsam (P.I. Arborgast).<br/><br/>I don't understand why Psycho was remade thirty eight years after it came out. Nobody needed to see it in color, with new actors, and the same scene-by-scene! It probably would have been a lot better if Gus Van Sant (who directed the new one) did a `reimagining', like Tim Burton and Planet of the Apes. Sure, William H. Macy is in the new one, but I've seen some of it and it's just horrible.<br/><br/>Reading up online, I see some symbolism throughout the movie. Norman's obsession with birds (his middle name is Francis in the movie) means he wants to fly away from his mother. Something that I always love in movie is when they put `hints' of the movie in. For example, in the office where Marion works, there are two pictures: one of where she will be pulled over by a cop and one of a swamp that comes into play later. That type of stuff I always find fascinating.<br/><br/>Look for Hitchcock's cameo (like he always has) as a man in a cowboy hat around four minutes into the movie, outside of Marion's office.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R for two scenes of violence."

","I hate to jump on the band wagon, but this film is one of the best horror's of all time.  Tomes and tomes have been written on this film, so I hope what I have to say is relevant.<br/><br/>You know the story; bomb shell, Janet Leigh, steals $40,000 no more than ten minutes after a steamy love scene and heads to Fairvale and to her boyfriend and what she believes will be happiness ever after.  Enter Bates Motel and the boyish Norman who is a charming yet pathetic soul, dominated by his powerful mother.  After Janet decides that stealing the money is wrong and makes a decision to return it, she hops into a sin-cleansing shower and suddenly gets stabbed a hundred times by a knife that never even touches her body.  We're forced to transfer our feelings to Norman who has to protect mother, even though she has committed a great crime, no harm must come to her, and we start rooting for him.  Senile old mother picked the wrong girl to kill off, not only did she provide the world of horror with the endlessly plagiarised shower scene, she also caused people to come to the motel where her trail ends (remember, she stole 40 grand).<br/><br/>**SPOILER** We have no reason to believe that it isn't Mother doing the killing, the mother scenes are so well designed that we don't have a reason to believe that Norman actually killed her ten years ago and became her murderous alter-ego, dressing up in her clothes and killing pretty women in the shower.<br/><br/>The source novel for the film was written by Robert Bloch which in turn was based on the case of Ed Gein, who made headlines in the '50's when he confessed to robbing graves, having sex with corpses, dressing up in human skins and doing generally unusual things, he too, had a mother fixation. The Bernard Hermann score is a brilliant tension mounter and is used in all the right places to leave the audience gasping.  A truly memorable film."

","Having grown-up in the late 70's and early 80's watching such ""scary movies"" as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Holloween"" and of course ""Friday the 13th"", I thought I knew what scary was, that is until I saw Psycho.<br/><br/>Psycho was the only movie that truly scared me, because something like that could really happen.  :::::Spoiler coming:::::<br/><br/>Let's face it Norman Bates was Ted Bundy, the Hillside Strangler and the Son of Sam all wrapped up in a neat little albeit warped package!  He was a serial killer before there was such a thing in mainstream media...I even wonder if there was such a term as ""serial killer"" when the movie was filmed, (if anyone knows please let me know).<br/><br/>A young woman stops at a roadside motel to spend the night, she meets an unassuming shy and attractive young man.  She checks into her room and she takes her last shower. But the question is who kills her, is it Norman or his mother? Regardless of who it is, the point is that what happen isn't as far farfetched as hockey mask wearing madman or a halloween mask wearing escapee from a mental hospital, stalking his sister, Norman is really the boogie man.  He is what goes bump in the night, he is the stranger that your mother told you not to get into his car! However unlike Bundy and the others, you actually find yourself feeling sorry for Norman Bates, he he truly tortured and definetely psychotic, but you really want to know why he is in such a state, what drove him to madness and then ultimately murder.<br/><br/>Psycho was a rude awakening for movie audiences in the 60's, it was a lost of innocence.  How appropriate that a movie that started off the 60's was a preview of things to come...the murders of Martin, Bobby, John, Malcom and Medger.  The Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and race riots in Los Angeles and Detroit. I may be over-simplifying things but if you step back and take a look I may not be too far off."

","A near perfect film that few today can see in its intended state, ie not knowing anything about it! Hitch masterfully lulls is into thinking the film will be about a girl who takes off with a load of money - yet that has no relevance to the film in the slightest (other than to scare the hell out of you when she dies). I actually watched this film not knowing that Norman Bates was his mother and ultimately gained more from the film than a lot of people that I know have watched it.  Perfect score to the film by Bernard Herrmann which adds to the tension - see especially the music as marion is driving in the rain, and note how the windscreen wipers are a metaphor for the knife the rain is also used like the water from the shower (almost hinting at what will follow) Superb film from the master of suspense! 10/10"

","Nobody was ever as good as Hitchcock. Nobody. And Hitch gets to show off the full scope of his directing talents with Psycho, his 1960 masterpiece of terror, suspense, drama and mystery. Drawing the audience in from the first scene, seriously screwing with their minds, then throwing them back out again, the Master of Suspense more than lives up to his prestigious title.<br/><br/>In a classic bit of directorial finesse, Hitchcock throws the audience for one of the biggest loops in movie history 50 minutes into the movie. Until then, the film has focused on Janet Leigh's character and the money-stealing plot. Who knew she would die so suddenly? From there the movie goes on to focus on the likable yet obviously troubled Norman Bates and his somewhat suspicious relationship with his mysterious mother.<br/><br/>Toying with our emotions like no one else could, Hitch forces us to root for Norman through the rest of the movie, even to a subconcious degree. We know that Norman is covering up a murder, but, admit it, when that car was sinking in the swamp and it stopped, you wanted it to go all the way down just as much as Norman, didn't you? Taken on an intellectual standpoint, this movie can make you question your morals, beliefs, and ethics. Or you can just relax and let it scare the hell out of you. Both ways are equally effective.<br/><br/>Words like ""thrilling,"" and ""disturbing"" are thrown around a lot these days. However, this movie inarguably sets the standard by which ""thrilling"" and ""disturbing"" movies will forever be measured. It's a classic of filmmaking, and you cannot rightfully call yourself a movie buff until you have seen it. Be forewarned though - it may make you swear off showers for a lifetime.<br/><br/>(****/****)"

Even after my 100th time seeing it, i still find it just as suspenseful and intense.(Although my dad gave away the ending, and i will NOT do that here). The reason i love this movie so much is because the characters are believable. Anthony Perkins perfectly portrayed Norman Bates, and I really think that was the best performance by an actor in any movie I've seen! I think Anthony Perkins playing Norman was a mixed blessing because he was just SO GOOD in that movie, but he didn't really get offered to do anymore movies after Psycho,(which i thought was stupid because he was a brilliant actor). You actually find yourself sympathizing with Norman, which you really don't do with movies of its kind. Janet Leigh was great as Marion Crane, as well. Another thing: ALFRED HITCHCOCK. He is by far the greatest director of all time. All of his films were brilliant, and you always found yourself on the edge of your seat during the major climactic scenes. It's a shame he's dead now, because we really need more directors like Hitchcock, who can come up with such brilliant films as Psycho."

","I've seen ""Psycho"" about 10 times in the past, but I just recently watched it again for the first time in about two years.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the film was even better than I'd remembered.  It may be my favorite film from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>
Given the fact that horror films have become increasingly macabre and disturbing over the years, ""Psycho"" does seem to have lost much of it's ability to frighten the viewer.  Just imagine how this movie must have effected audiences in 1960.  They'd never seen anything remotely close to this.  I wish I could have been there.<br/><br/>Sadly, I'm a member of the younger generation, who has had the plot twists and famous moments spoiled for me.  I can't appreciate the shower scene as much as most people because I probably saw dozens of rip-offs and spoofs of it before seeing the real thing.  I was immune to being truly shocked by ""Psycho"", but it's an amazing experience, nonetheless.<br/><br/>Besides Hitchcock's ingenious direction, the key reason for the film's greatness is Anthony Perkins.  He totally masters the psychotic Norman Bates with understated nervousness and desperation.  Bates is the true main character of the film, and we can identify with him more than we can with any of the other characters.<br/><br/>I don't find ""Psycho"" to be terrifying; it's more thrilling and fun than scary.  There are a few ominous moments to be found, though.  My favorite is the final scene, with Bates in the asylum.  It is genuinely uncomfortable to look at as the camera slowly zooms in closer to Bates' facial expressions, leaving the viewer in a state of claustrophobia.  His final grin at the camera is truly spine tingling and unforgettable.  It's one of the many images in ""Psycho"" that is imbedded in my mind.<br/><br/>There is only one set of scenes in the movie which I find to be a bit tedious, and that would be Norman's clean-up of the bathroom.  Not that it isn't necessary, it just seems as if we see him doing more cleaning than we really need to.  But this is a small fault in a nearly perfect film, which is as exciting and mesmerizing as it ever was.  In other words, ""Psycho"" hasn't aged a day."

","Just saw Psycho for the first time and I thought it was an excellent horror film.  Now those of you who haven't seen the original don't be confused or misled by the word ""horror.""  Most people today when they hear the word horror think of the likes of Jason or Freddy or Dracula hacking and biting people to a bloody pulp and leaving us with a very gross looking corpse on the the screen and a sick twisting feeling in our stomachs.  Horror, according to the dictionary, means a state of suspense or tension; unfortunately, today one can't call a movie a horror film without gore. When people today for the first time see Psycho think that this movie isn't scary enough or gory enough to be considered horror.   I must admit that I was at first trapped into that state of mind, but then I soon realized that Psycho is not a horror in the sense of gore or fright factor, but a horror in the sense that you are on the edge of your seat wanting to know what is going to happen and when it does happen you are shocked and sometimes disturbed by what has just occurred.<br/><br/>What adds to the mystery, suspense, and yes horror to it all is the fact that you don't know how the movie is going to end; unfortunately, I found out what the ending was going to be before seeing the movie.  So I beg you all, don't tell others who haven't seen this film what the ending is going to be, because that is where I was the most scared in the entire movie. Just imagine what it would have been like if I, or anyone else, didn't know what the ending was.<br/><br/>We miss you Alfred."

From the beginning you know that Marion is (for 1960) a rather unscrupulous woman, but you like her. Albeit a poor decision-maker, she's strong and courageous.  You follow her along through her folly, wondering, `Will she get away with it?' Will she come to her senses?' And when she finally does with the help of poor, lovable, goofy Norman, the whole thing takes a twist that you could never have seen coming from a movie made back then. The cinematography is excellence, I have yet to see it's like again. The remake made a great attempt but it just didn't feel the same. The performances are as pure as Ivory soap.  This is the one movie that I can sit through time and again and it only makes me love it more. The man was a genius and obviously at the top of his craft here. That's my take. What's yours?"

","I was not even a gleam in my father's eye when this movie was made, and yet this movie is as scary now as I'm sure it was then.  ""Scary"" movies these days generally do not scare me at all.  Alfred Hitchcock's movies have always had an uncanny ability to scare the wits out of me.  Particular Vertigo and this movie.  The Birds was scary also, but not as disturbing as these.  Now, about this review.  I had never seen this before and on a boring Saturday evening I decided to go buy this dvd from the local store. So, I got it and watched it that night.  I watched it with the lights out, my surround system cranked, and on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I cannot tell you how many times my heart skipped a beat in this movie.  The music, the photography, the lighting, everything combined to make this a movie that I will not forget.  The music in the shower scene that is repeated at the very end (screeching violins) is forever engrained in my memory.  I tried watching this movie again by myself today and I cannot do it.  That is how scary it is.  Anthony Perkins is amazing.  Everyone in the cast is amazing, but his is the performance that you will remember from this movie.<br/><br/>Now, about the dvd.  This dvd is incredible.  A 90-minute making of Psycho is incredible.  There is also a trailer, another documentary, and tons of other good stuff.  They really crammed a lot onto this dvd to make it worth your money.  The video quality is crystal clear.  The audio quality is stupendous.  It is only Dolby Digital stereo though.  Just be sure to crank this one to let Bernard Herrmanns score scare you out of your mind.  To sum it up, do not rent this dvd, this dvd belongs in your collection so do yourself a favor and go rent it.  But do not watch it by yourself unless you are brave."

","The story of the motel owner with a split personality is part of our American culture.  Everyone is familiar with the famous shower scene. Bernard Herrmann's score evokes memories and moods instantly.  Psycho is a film masterpiece.  It is a wonderfully chilly tale of sexual repression, of madness, of the effects that living alone can have on an individual, and finally on the rural aspects of horror in the life of rural America.  It is a cheaply made film, but accomplishes so much with so little.  The credit goes to a handful of people.  First and foremost in this group stands the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.  It is Hitchcock's best film in terms of utilizing the minimal for the most shocking scenes ever filmed. His shower scene is forever etched into the mindset of people all over the world.  When the film came out, people were afraid to take showers afterward for quite awhile.  The camera lens sets the pace for the film, and my favourite scene is Janet Leigh driving in the car.  Extremely well-shot scenes with a steady current of tension.  Hitchcock was ably assisted by all concerned.  Herrmann's score is awesome.  Joseph Stefano did a wonderful job adapting the wonderful novel by horror legend Robert Bloch.  The acting is first-rate.  Anthony Perkins did such a good job that he never could escape the role of Norman Bates.  Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, even John Gavin do credible jobs.  Janet Leigh is very good, and looks quite fetching and provocative in a black brassiere.  Watch for cameos by Simon Oakland(from The Night Stalker fame) and Ted Knight as a guard.  An incredible film in many ways - not least of which is the incredible legacy the film has acheived in our cultural panorama."

"skiop","3","10","39","16 January 2010"," A flawed classic
","1960 was in a way the beginning of modern horror. Before that, horror movies featured monsters and mythical creatures, and monster movie was synonymous with horror movie. This all changed in 1960 with the release of this movie and the inferior, controversial, career-destroying Peeping Tom. These movies showed the worst kind of monster: a human being.<br/><br/>The plot follows that Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles money for herself and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). She stays overnight at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). It's not a surprise to anyone that Norman Bates is the villain of the movie. That is one of the primary problems with this movie: Norman is the only likable character in the entire movie. He's handsome, but shy and misunderstood, so he can't have a relationship outside of his voyeuristic fantasy life. This is a grave contrast to Marion Crane, a sleazy, immoral character.<br/><br/>All is going well to this point; it looks like it might get interesting, but starting with Marion's murder, it takes a 180. Her murder is one of the worst (not most brutal) I've ever seen. While the killer is supposed to be stabbing her to death, the camera jerks all over the place. Epileptics should definitely skip this part. John Carpenter did a far better, less obvious obscuring of graphic murders 18 years later in his Halloween.<br/><br/>The movie then goes from bad to worse, as we observe some of the going ons in a small town, with Sam and Marion's sister, Lila (Vera Miles). Here is where it gets really boring, showing us inconsequential pieces of small-town life. Unlike Halloween, which was based on the introduction of a madman into the everyday life of babysitters, Psycho's second half is little more than filler. There is essentially no connection between the first half and the second or between the second half and the first. It just meanders for a half hour or so.<br/><br/>The climax really comes out of nowhere. The special effects aren't that good (in fact, they're awful), but it is the best part of the movie: Sam tackling knife-wielding, cross-dressed Norman and the following scene providing a glimpse into Norman's mind, something that nothing before that had done."

Had it not been hyped as the scariest film ever made, than it would have gone over better. But as it stands, Psycho DOESN'T stand. Back in 1960, movie-going Americans were not at all expecting this, had never seen anything like this, and were probably very shocked when they did. This movie started the endless number of slasher-type films we know today, such as ""Halloween"", and the Jason series. Of them, I can't say Psycho is any better. Hitchcock does well with the cinematography, but falls short in the suspense area. His predecessors, such as Ridley Scott (Alien), Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath), and many others succeeded where he failed. The acting in Psycho is pretty good, though sometimes mechanical. Bottom-line: If you have NEVER seen a horror film, particularly of the slasher type, than you will find this a chilling film.

","I agree with the fact that it has been of (most) importance for the movie industry because of some new elements it introduced. But besides that and the good directing, it totally lacks of brilliance. The actors were OK, but not worthy of all the praise they were given for it... Just take a look at what they have achieved in life: Anthony Perkins: 1 Oscar nomination (for supporting role), Janet Leigh: 1 Oscar nomination (for Psycho, which tells us a lot), and I won't even mention Vera Miles simply because there is nothing to mention. These are no great actors, not in any other movies, and neither in Psycho. Then we come to the story, the part of the film I really did not like. There's simply nothing brilliant about it, it's merely a plain story. Also, it was a little too obvious, referring to the fact that Norman's mother was already dead. This should have been worked out better, just like the shower scene. OK, the idea was brilliant, but I just can't believe, even back in 1960, that people find this shocking. It was such a let-down, I had expected so much more of this scene... It really looked like a big comedy. I know that many of the Psycho fans will disagree with my opinion, but let me just quote Hitchcock to add force to my opinion: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy. Had to be."" Then I wondered, how come it still has become a classic? Well, allow me to again quote Hitchcock: ""Even my failures make money and become classics a year after I make them."""

Anthony Perkins delivers the performance of a lifetime as Norman Bates, the poor pawn of his 'mother'. The film, brilliantly shot in B&W, has become a staple in any movie lover's eye. The entire story revolves around the theft of 400,000 by one Marion Crane(Janet Leigh). This theft entangles her sister(Vera Miles), her lover(John Gavin), a private eye(Martin Balsam), a sheriff(John McIntire), and a lonely hotel manager(Perkins). ""Psycho"" is capable of being rewatched over and over again with little secrets hidden through out. Each character holds some secret: Marion stole some money, Gavin is seeing her on the side, Marion's coworker took tranquilers on her wedding night, her boss has alcohol in the office, client holds undeclared money from the IRS, and Norman has the biggest sequel of all. ""Psycho"" also contains the greatest score of all time which contains only strings which was wonderfully composed by the late Bernard Hermann as well as the best directed scene of all time, the infamous shower scene.

I'm not a giant fan of Alfred Hitchcock but I do find that he deserves his title ""master of suspense"". If it were only for this movie alone. Psycho is the most important modern horror movie since it gave a whole new image to the character of the ""serial killer"". Norman Bates is frightening but there's always sympathy for him. He's the most influential horror icon without a doubt. I doubt that there're many people who don't now about the terrific climax by now. I've heard spoilers about this movie before I knew it even existed...But still, there are always surprises to discover and no matter how many times you see it you'll always be impressed. <br/><br/>Other than that, there isn't much to say about this milestone in cinema. Watch this movie if you haven't yet and don't go on calling yourself a cinema fan before you see it !! But, avoid the 1998 remake at all costs! Although there are a few decent actors in that ( William H.Macy, Julliane Moore and Viggo Mortensen ) it's a disgrace to Alfred Hitchcock and to everyone else who was involved with the original version"

","Compared to many of Hitchcock's other works, this movie is a bust. Although it may have been extremely scary at the time, today it is laughably bad. The story sucks and the acting isn't great.  The one thing I do give Hitchcock credit for doing well is the famous shower scene. Without it the movie would have never even been heard of."
"mokono","6","3","10","9 June 2008"," Generation gap?
","Let's start at the end: it's fun to watch. However, it's definitely not a scary movie.. I mean, ""haunted-house"" dramatic effects, as some people call it, are just plain ridiculous. I know for sure that a lot of people in my generation would have the same reaction I did when I saw the first murder: burst out laughing. But reading some of the comments here, it seems to have scared people in the movie theaters and some users claim to still be scared about it. Well, I really feel like asking, is it all a generation gap thing? Can't be, after all, there are way scarier things around now, in all types of scares, especially visually (heh, the skeleton..).<br/><br/>I have to say, though, it's well done and well played, feels good to watch. The only problem here is looking and sounding silly on the climaxes.<br/><br/>That, and that the content is.. well, not that complex. I mean, we've all seen a load of stories about multiple personalities by now.. and this one isn't specially interesting. Again, too much emphasis on this. Also, the characters in general are just slightly above general. We see a little too many ""hollywood""esque and shallow personalities. Sometimes, the dialogue flows in mysterious ways (sheriff scene).. showing us that it wasn't very well translated from the script writer's mind.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's worth seeing for the laughs and for being a landmark for the genre. But that's it."
"murrayian","6","3","10","16 December 2006"," disappointed at the end
","I recently purchased the Collector's Edition of this movie, mainly because of all the accolades and hype from other viewers. I can't remember if I ever saw the movie in its entirety before, but if I had, I had forgotten most of it. I have just finished watching the movie tonight, and while there certainly were a lot of good moments in the film, I was left feeling a little disappointed at the end. When the psychiatrist is discussing Norman's mental state(s), after he has confirmed that Norman killed Marion, Lila, her sister, just sits there listening, with no reaction, as if attending a lecture. This seemed so unreal, given her frantic hunt for her sister throughout the movie. Surely we would have expected some kind of reaction on learning her sister was, in fact, dead. Just my impressions."
"valadas","6","3","10","3 August 2006"," Too unconvincing to be true
","I never was a great Hitchcock fan and this movie did nothing to change my mind. It's indisputable that he makes very good movies from the formal-technical point of view and that he knows how to create a suspense and (or) horror atmosphere with great mastery and skillfulness but the stories he tells us are too fanciful to be real (despite the fact that they are presented as real)and when he dives into the psychological pathology of his characters he becomes much unconvincing. For instance in this movie the psychiatrist's explanation which takes place in the final scene doesn't seem to me to have great scientific rigor, looking more like pure fantasy. Nevertheless it's true indeed that this movie (like others he has made) keeps us stuck to our seats and wrapped up in the story unfolding from the first to the last scene. Only later and after the movie ends do we emerge from that spell to realize that all that has very little juice in terms of psychological reality. This movie has however also a remarkable feature in the performance of the great actor who is Anthony Perkins who makes and excellent character very well adapted to the role that the movie's director gave him and with great and talented sobriety."

","This is a well directed and extremely well-scored movie. Unfortunately, while the movie is interesting for its place in cinematic history, (just look at the accelerated editing in the shower scene) it really isn't at all scary, or even all that interesting today. The production values for the movie are amazingly low, and it often shows (it was filmed on the cheap on a hitchcock presents TV lot). The script is weak and reeks of an exploitation film. The acting is good, though not great. Bad material handled by a great director that's worth watching if youre interested in cinema or too old to enjoy a gory, though better film.

"Movieman-133","1","25","173","16 July 1999"," Psycho, The most overrated horror.. NO suspense movie of all time.
","Well,   what can I say about this film.   It's merely okay and the black and white makes the film seem completely dull and frankly quite boring.  I don't understand what all this talk about the color being artistic but I found it repulsive.   The acting in the movie was very mediocre, especially from the stiff John Gavin,   the ever so proper Vera Miles,  and the so serious Martin Balsam.   Try watching the new Psycho and you'll find that these characters can actually have personalities. As for Janet Leigh, well she was good,   but Anne Heche seemed more innocent,  more human,  and more sympathetic.   As for Anthony Perkins,    he's also so monotone, barely ANY emotion,   and I struggle to understand why people rave over his dry performance.  As for the ""mother twist"",  well that was good but there are twists in about every horror film now a days and they are usually more entertaining than this joke. And then there is the shower scene which everyone says is so scary?  Where have they been ,  I could pick out a dream sequence from any A Nightmare on Elm Street sequel that was done more creatively and powerfully.  It was a simple knifing in the shower for god's sake,   isn't watching the opening of Drew Barrymore in Scream ten times more chilling and exciting? Give me a break,  when I went to Universal Studious they said the shower sequence was one of the most famous scenes of all time.  Well,  give an audience an opportunity to watch either that or the astonishing death of Piper Laurie in Depalma's Carrie,  or the thrill of the finale chase in Halloween,  and well see what brings more reactionary emotion of the audience.  Well,  what can I say about a movie that I will never understand?  When people made the new Psycho some thought it was stupid because of the story--and so I know I'm not alone.   It's just that these old foggies are so hung up on old movies that they are blind to see that modern movies provide for much more entertainment.    Some old horror films like Rosemary's Baby are excellent,  but this is not.  As for Bernard Herrmann score,   it's overplayed,   can't he think of anything new to compose? Compare Pino Donnagio' lush score from Carrie opposed to this and see what's more creative and effective.  What can I say besides people, this movie is simply average and that it might of have been good back then, but it's simply OK now.  Do we still rave about the type writer just because it was original back then?  I have spoken and I guess that Blockbuster Video agrees with me that the movie is too much of a joke to be placed in the horror section.  It's in the Drama suspense category,  and certainly a thrilless and dated film to belong anywhere else.  Psycho remains as the most overrated film of all time and the new Psycho is a much better improvement."

Okay, sure this movie is a huge critical and box-office success. Sure, it's compared to every single other movie in the slasher genre. Sure, it's even responsible for creating the sub-genre as a whole. But, in my opinion, this movie is too long and actually boring as it slowly draws toward it's conclusion.

"aristotle61","9","1","2","26 April 2019"," Great Movie But..................
","I'm not going to bother telling you what's great about this movie. You can look at the gazillion reviews here for that. Overall I would give the movie and 8.5 to 9.0.<br/><br/>I'm going to use this review to make a few criticisms because no one seems to talk about that in their reviews. One of the recent reviewers had an interesting perspective. They thought that the movie dragged in the middle. I didn't see it that way. I thought the beginning was very weak. I didn't like it at all. The whole scene in the hotel room at the start was not entertaining in any way for me.<br/><br/>There were a lot of little things in the movie that seemed silly to me.<br/><br/>One of those was when Norman was clearing out the hotel room after the murder. The last thing he removed from the room was the newspaper that had almost $40,000 dollars in it. There is absolutely no way that someone could pick up a newspaper with all that money in it and not realize there was something in it. He would have needed to hold it together too in order to stop the money from falling out.<br/><br/>Another was the camera work for the killing of the detective. I know Hitchcock is much admired for his camera work but the close up of Martin Balsam struggling to not fall backwards down the stairs looked ludicrous. In fact it looked very similar to a scene in another Hitchcock movie, Vertigo, except the scene in Vertigo wasn't this ridiculous. It took as much time for Balsam to fall down the stairs in this movie as it did for someone to fall from a tall building in Vertigo.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie by far was finding out that the mother had been dead for ten years and that Norman was himself and also acting as his mother because he had a split personality. One hour, ten minutes, and 27 seconds into the movie, bother Norman and his mother appear in the same scene. I never see where anyone ever mentions this. This is clearly an attempt to make you think that Norman isn't crazy and is not dressing up and acting as his own mother, but how do you justify this? Anyway, I would be interested in what anyone else has to say about this."

","This movie is great to watch with friends and family. One of the thing that I really liked about the movie was that it was shoot in black and white. Another thing that stude out was that the music was changing the mood of the characters. Almost every time the people don't notice the way a character changes how they walk,talk or even act because the director wants that to happen. I'll tell you why he need our attention some where else instead of the main point. That's what Alfred Hitshcok did with this movie. That's why this is a master pice that will go on to generations. Honestly the movie will be way better if they didn't show the person who was crazy. That would of being a good turning point where the director could of had the option of continuing the movie or let the people with the urge of watching another part of the story. But I truly recommended to the people who like the old classic movies."

The story is pretty linear and follows the grim events that take place at bates motel, it's hard to say much without spoiling the plot but if you're a fan of psychological horror I'm sure you'd enjoy it. The film is also filled with all sorts of neat motifs and symbolism that are fun to discover within the first or second viewing. This film will surely linger in your brain long after watching it.

","How do you write about, let alone review something that's been picked apart and assembled again, stretched into 24 hour performances by lesser artists, copied, imitated, quoted, spoofed, franchised, and even remade shot for shot? About something that has been appreciated, raved about and even worshipped for nearly 60 long years by audiences, devotees and eventually even critics?<br/><br/>There are reasons for all that. John Gavin may have been wooden but Vera Miles was good enough, Janet Leigh and Robert Balsam were exceptionally good and Perkins was sensational. It was Robert Bloch's best achievement in lurid pulp, Stefano's best screenwriting moment and Hitch was quite literally at the height of his powers. So were his wife Alma and assistant Peggy, who also sensed how times were changing and how the audiences were ready for something never before attempted or seen - a film with moments so pounding and visceral that it would end up changing the entire ballgame.<br/><br/>And then there's the score, equally deeply ingrained on our culture. ""Hitchcock does about two thirds of his films - I finish them for him"" - Herrmann would say, and it's been true from Harry through to Marnie. This one contains the most famous musical cue of all times and a neurotic, hurtling main title to boot, but it is the slow bits, during which Hitch handles the passage of time, trouble, unease, mystery, suspense and degradation that are just superb, allowing for some of the most exciting moments ever commited to film. Elegant and decidedly modern, all the more lethal for its reduction to a chamber string orchestra, the score is well produced too; loads of sticky reverb and compression were slapped on those ferocious shrieks, making them always sound a bit limp on later recordings - and certainly lacking that thoroughly ripping effect. Luckily, Hitch gave in and went along with his composer.<br/><br/>To wrap it up - the less said about Psycho, the better - and it is best enjoyed in silence and darkness. It has a flaw or two but its unique, darkly unsettling magic speaks for itself even today and it still feels like an exceptionally modern, cool, groundbreaking film. Whatever Walt Disney may have thought of it."

","Psycho is a journey of a film, flawed but remarkable the same.<br/><br/>Going into the film, my only notion of what might transpire is the stabbing in the shower scene. That happens to be one the weakest parts though. The strength of the film is taking on many different forms and doing them well. A seemingly good woman stealing forty thousand dollars and on the run, to an off the beaten track motel and a murder, to a private investigator unsettling the killer, to a sister and boyfriend doing whatever it takes. Janet Leigh's excellent as the lead, though odd for her to die mid film. I wasn't surprised by the corpse, because they never showed the mother or the killer's face and it's a figure at the window mentioned more than once. Then for the sheriff to say she was dead, set that in stone. I had figured it was a voice recording talking to him. Lila had the option to go out the front door and chose the cellar when Bates went upstairs, just survive first and then come back jeez. The ending's in poor taste, as the loved ones don't want to hear why he's a freak and I didn't feel it necessary either.<br/><br/>The highlights are the cop talking to Marion and then following her and Arbogast questioning Bates."

","Sorry for the title of the review for possibly tacky, but that's what my experience with the movie says.
I felt like a real crime scene, we have everything in it, a murderer, the victim, the detective, the relatives of the victim, and the cops.
The whole movie is so well built, since nothing is by chance or has any excuse for the events, from the cause of the trauma and second personality of Norman Bates to Marion's reasons for stopping at the Bates Motel.
Speaking more about ""Quest"" Marion Crane, she's so tense from the moment her boss notices her in the car, right down to the incredible classic murder scene in the bathroom. (It may seem a little obvious that she died in this scene, but I never had taken her spoiler, so for me it was an incredible suspense and tension experience).
Lastly, we have the background of Norman Bates, who I do not know about the others, but I tried a lot to be a detective during the whole movie, so that sheriff scene was spectacular, the plot twist was one of the best I saw.

","There is no debating that ""Psycho"" is one of the classic psychological thriller movies of all-time. Heck, some might say that it even invented the genre! What is perhaps even more interesting, however, is how different this film is from the rest of the Alfred Hitchcock collection of motion pictures.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Psycho"" sees young secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steal a large sum of money from her employer in order to have an affair. While escaping the city in the dead of night, Crane pulls into the Bates Motel, owned and run by one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), when the weather takes a turn for the worse. What Marion, as well as a private investigator (Martin Balsam) and Lila Crane (Vera Miles) later one, discovers is that Norman is hiding a deep and terrible secret revolving around his beloved ""mother"".<br/><br/>In most other Hitchcock movies, the plots are more generic and the picture full of color. In short, they are lighter experiences that as much showcase the stars and styles of the time as they do cultivate rich plots and intriguing characters. With ""Psycho"", however, the entire experience is gritty and filled with some of the most interesting characters (in particular Perkins' Bates) ever to grace the big screen. The movie was even purposely filmed in black and white to give it that extra ""edge"".<br/><br/>When a film like ""Psycho"" achieves such a high degree of popularity, it sometimes loses a bit of its edge due to the fact that ever scene, character, and line has been dissected a thousand times over. In this case, though, ""Psycho"" can be watched at fairly regular intervals without getting too stale. Even if you know what is coming (and most people by now do), it is still creepy.<br/><br/>In short, ""Psycho"" is a seminal film of American cinema for its character studies and raw thematic material (when its contemporaries, generally speaking, were much lighter and sometimes little more than vehicles for their stars). Whether the first time or the twenty-first time watching this gem, you will pick out ""just one more thing"" that amazes you, as well as experience that ""creepy-crawly"" feeling regarding Mr. Norman Bates."

The shower scene was also great, very well organized, the shoots were amazing, with all the close ups and all. The acting was fantastic, Norman's character was very on point. Hitchcock did a really good job directing this movie. This was actually the first Hitchcok movie I've ever seen, and it definitely left me craving for more. <br/><br/>Anyway, it may not look like a really good movie at first sight, but it is.

"oOoBarracuda","9","1","2","7 November 2016"," Psycho
","Alfred Hitchcock directed probably his best-known work in 1960 with his feature based on the book of the same name by Robert Bloch. Starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and Hitchcock's abandoned would-be star Vera Miles; Psycho explores a desperate woman's attempt to forge a life with her boyfriend, and a man driven by his relationship to his mother. Psycho is a wonderful case study into the psyche of human beings with vastly different outlooks and intentions for their lives. Hitchcock delved into the psychology of humanity in a way to make audiences pay attention all the while creating a complete masterpiece and the film most closely associated with the famed suspense director.<br/><br/>On a December day in Arizona, the audience meets Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who has just spent an extended lunch hour with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is divorced and lives far from Marion so the only time they have together is stolen lunch hours and hotel rooms. Sam is reluctant to further his relationship with Marion, despite the intense love shared between the two, because he pays a monthly alimony to his divorcÃ©e wife. Marion has a deep conversation with Sam in regards to the future of their relationship, as she wishes to become a married woman and create a home for Sam. Leaving the hotel room feeling helpless, a little desperate, and enslaved by her love of Sam so much so that she knows herself to be unable to leave him. Upon returning to her office, Marion's boss brings in a client flashing around $40,000 in cash for a transaction. Marion, being the one trusted to take the large sum of cash to the bank, instantly devises a plot in which she and Sam can enjoy a life together, married, together, and happy, if she can get away with the $40,000. Instead of going to the bank, Marion scurries home to pack a bag and embark on a new life. After speeding away on her new mission, Marion's boss passes her on the street initiating a guilt trip that Marion can't escape. After taking a nap on the side of the road, Marion has an interaction with a police officer which puts her even more on edge. Marion, convinced she must trade in her car for a new one after seeing her boss on the street, hastily makes a deal with the dealership o\owner and speeds away hoping to avoid suspicion. After an especially rainy night, Marion has become unsure of her location and pulls into a secluded motel. Emerging from her car for shelter for the night, Marion meets motel owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly nice young man who helps Marion inside with her bags and offers to make her dinner so she doesn't have to go back out into the rain. After hearing a heated exchange between Norman and his mother, Marion offers advice and consolation for Norman, believing his mother to be an overbearing negative presence on his life. Norman is clearly taken aback by what he perceives to be an attack against his mother, Marion is taken aback by his strong reaction and seeks refuge to her room as she has already begun questioning her plan and seems to have decided to go back to Tuscon, return the money, and make amends with her boss. Little does Marion know, Norman and his relationship to his mother would interfere with her plans.<br/><br/>Psycho has reached the point that there is little left to say about this film. It's a near perfect entry on Hitchcock's filmography. Psycho is so closely associated with the famed director that it has been endlessly analyzed and heralded for the masterwork that it is. The standout from the film, other than the brilliant direction of a largely dialogue-driven plot, is the fantastic score. Bernard Herrmann, a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, crafts a perfect horror/suspense score that is as iconically connected to the film as the John Williams score is to Jaws. Granted, I haven't seen much of Anthony Perkins' work, but he was perfectly cast in the role of Norman Bates. Norman had to embody a psychotic crazed maniac inside a quiet, unassuming petulant child all at once, and Perkins was perfect for the extreme marriage of characterization. Martin Balsam is a brilliant character actor and it's always fun to see him pop up in a film. As earlier stated, Psycho is a surprisingly dialogue- driven film, with only a few shots of action sparsed throughout the film. The pivotal scene in which Marion and Norman share dinner together, bringing Marion back to her good- natured self, was filmed in such a perfect way highlighting the taxidermied shells on the wall exposing the possibility that Norman could be a much more sinister character than he initially appears. Hitchcock proves his strength as a suspense director with his seminal classic, Psycho. Near-perfect direction, incredible casting, and a brilliant score, it is clear to see why Psycho has stood the test of time, and remains a favorite and yearly Halloween viewing tradition, for myself anyway."

","Alfred Hitchcock has referred to this as a comedy. People seeing it for the first time may raise a quizzical eyebrow. If you have seen it before, then some of the dialogue such as ""Mother, uh, what is the phrase? She isn't quite herself today."" does have a morguish humour about it.But it is definitely not a film at which you will do much laughing, if any. Here is a near perfect example of the cinema of terror. it starts off a gripping suspenser about a young woman on the run with some money she has stolen. But then the totally unexpected happens, and we are plunged into a world of nightmare. on the technical side, direction, photography, and music are superb. in the acting side, the performances are varied. But Anthony Perkins is excellent. How he failed to be even nominated for his performance is a total mystery. The same goes for Bernard Hermann's chilling score. Now for the bad news. What stops the film from being perfect is a rather lengthy explanation of the reasons behind what happened, as told by a psychiatrist, played none too convincingly by Simon Oakland. There is also the revelation scene, which if i recall correctly looks to be as if Perkins is giving a helping hand there. But ignore those small gripes, and prepare to be held on edge of your seat by one of the best chillers ever made."

","The most original and influential moment in the film is the ""shower scene"", which became iconic in pop culture because it is often regarded as one of the most terrifying scenes ever filmed. Part of its effectiveness was due to the use of startling editing techniques borrowed from the Soviet montage filmmakers, and to the iconic screeching violins in Bernard Herrmann's musical score. The iconic shower scene is frequently spoofed, given homage to and referenced in popular culture, complete with the violin screeching sound effects (see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, among many others).<br/><br/>Psycho is a 1960 American psychological horror thriller directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, and written by Joseph Stefano, starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, John Gavin, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam, and was based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The film centers on the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane (Leigh), who ends up at a secluded motel after stealing money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner-manager, Norman Bates (Perkins), and its aftermath."

","I was entirely impressed by this movie, since the beginning you feel something bad is gonna happen because of the music and the dialogues, but you won't understand until the end what is all about. You think the story goes on one direction but then you realized you were wrong talking about the characters and their motivations. You really feel you're watching a thriller, you feel as nervous as Marion all the time. The music was amazing, the scenes and the script. I would say it's a perfect movie. I wanna keep the story like that and won't watch the other Psycho movies. It is also interesting to know all what the movie involved during the production and after. For example the shower scene is one of the most memorable in horror films, the relationship between Norman and his mother is 'represented' in the Simpsons by Director Skyner and his mother, and, Antony Perkins couldn't get more success after his performance and he died in 1992, he got VIH."

","This movie has it all. The camera movement, lighting and general feel all contribute to making this movie rightfully perfect. Then you add on an amazing soundtrack that just adds so much to the suspense. The soundtrack may be responsible for most of the feeling of fright or horror. The best part though is the story. I was fortunate to have avoided the ending of this film before seeing it and I can't be happier that I did. I enjoyed that twist and shock ending, it made perfect sense throughout the story and made the entire story so much creepier and unsettling. I will take a creepy and unsettling story that borders on disturbing over a modern horror with cheap thrills any day."

","Alfred Hitchcock was the master of making films full of suspense and horror. Hitchcock is able to get into the mind of his viewers and leave them shocked and horrified that anyone could do what Norman Bates did. The title describes exactly what Norman Bates is. A psycho. Even though this movie is old school and filming has changed and improved a lot since this movie came out, I still believe today's generation can still sit and enjoy this movie. In this psychological thriller, viewers are left screaming at their T.V. screen trying to tell the characters to get out while they can. This popular 1960 horror film was so successful, there was a current television series created that is just as successful as the movie."

For a movie of the 1960's it holds its own when compared to mystery movies of today. I think Anthony Perkin's performance was the highlight of a movie full of highlights. It's a movie that has a simple story but adds complexity through the technical knowledge of Alfred Hitchcock.

","I'm not a fan of horror movies. In fact I hadn't watched any horror movie before watching Psycho. I like thrillers though and I've seen many movies with psychopath serial killers (se7en, the silence of the lambs, identity, zodiac, criminal minds...). So I thought, it's a serial killer black and white movie from 1960, how scary can it be? I've never been so wrong. I was familiar with the split personality thing from other movies and so I guessed that Norman and his mother were one person very early. And in the scene in the basement I was almost sure that we would see a skeleton sitting in that chair. The movie wasn't shocking or twisting at all for me. AND YET IT SCARED THE S*** OUT OF ME! It's been three days now and I still have trouble sleeping. I'm not sure why, I mean I've seen much more troubled psychopaths and watched much more brutal murders and wasn't scared a bit. Alfred Hitchcock is definitely a genius. Music is excellent and it seems that it plays a big role in scaring the viewer. Right now, I feel like I don't want to watch a horror movie again. But I'm sure I will never be able to forget Psycho."

","I understand that this is a horror movie, but this is a mystery film of a murder. The director know that we will get scared or petrified in the shower scene. Marion is a office worker who stole money, which is another mystery besides the murder done by Norman. I understand that this have a lot of spoilers and I know all of them. I find this less violent and more sexual base on the content shown in the film. Even worst, this is 1960 and it looks quite wrong to me. This film might be quite horrible and even scary for young children, so parents should watch out before watching this film in the first place due to violence and sexual content, mostly the sexual content. I understand why this film received mixed reviews at first, because of its acting and controversies, but overall, this film is good due to the suspense."

Alfred Hitchcock is described to be one of the great American film directors, and you can see why after watching this film.

The acting of Bates was successful, because I never suspected him. I just thought he was an odd ball. And the shower scene, were he stabs the girl a hundred bazillion times is totally overdone and . . . and just perfect. Hitchcock wants us to know it's a movie, don't take it too seriously.

The strange camera angles give a sense of foreboding. The performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is what ties this film together. Bates' strange naivety yet obsessive personality is shown through his facial expressions alone. The way the tone of his voice changes when sensitive topics come up has a subtle brilliance. The film does have a few immersion breaking moments. The long overly long fall down the stairs, meant to increase suspense, instead reminds the viewer they are in fact just watching a movie.

"ashleywiscomb","9","1","2","4 December 2015"," Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock is a must see
","Being often nicknamed, ""The Master of Suspense"", Alfred Hitchcock certainly does not disappoint in his black and white film, Psycho (1960), with his certain use of psychological examination of his characters that will have you intrigued from the very beginning of his film. Psycho is a classic horror film that challenges the genre for a contemporary audience, a rush of chaotic fear and madness as suspenseful as you would have predicted from the movie that started the slasher genre itself. <br/><br/>Despite a slower pace and dated special effects, it's a well crafted if unconventional horror film. Along with it's creativity, it has a more engaging plot filled with more visual disturbing than almost any other film in the horror genre.<br/><br/>Hitchcock does this by building a connection to his audience to the characters. By getting into the main character, Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind at an early start of the film, has you not only engaged but intensively worried already of what will happen to her. Being a secretary in Phoenix, Marion's conscience drives her insane when she decides to steal 40,000 dollars from a client in order to run away with her love, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With an eerie feel, you are sucked into the movie trying to figure out how and why things are happening to her. The buildup adds to the intensity of the unknown of who is the killer and why their motives are the way that they are.<br/><br/>As Marion Crane tries to run farther away from her problems, not only has she found herself in a huge rainstorm but also exhausted from the endless thoughts of her conscience mind. Having to pull over she is luckily able to find the flickering lights of the Bates Motel to stay the night. There she meets the polite, man of few words, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman welcomes Marion to her stay by casual talk over sandwiches and milk. Norman then explains his interest in taxidermy and his unique relationship with his mother. Hitchcock sets the scene of this encounter by his ability of using foreshadowing with little details of Norman's parlor where the scene takes place. It is there where we find out more about his overbearing, domineering mother. Throughout the entire film, viewers have a sense of suspense always being displayed whether it is through the mysterious music, the director's use of certain angles, or even just the unknown of what we as the audience understand. Hitchcock finds a way of having you always questioning and in a way, overwhelmed with emotions while watching his films. Viewers that are from my generation could say that to be even considered a ""horror"" film or even a ""thriller"" there must be a certain amount of violence or gore to reach this criteria.<br/><br/>However, in 1960, horrified viewers saw Psycho as such a thrilling film and to be surprisingly not explicitly violent which our generation today would be uncommonly found in the latest horror, thriller films. Hitchcock doesn't use the violent gestures to make his film what it is. It is about the psychological intellect that he so deliberately has the audience feel. It is about the buildup and the mysterious overall mood of his masterpiece that has you leaving wanting more.<br/><br/>If the definition of a good thriller to you is gore and violence, Psycho wouldn't necessarily be the movie for you. Not meaning to say that there isn't a scene or two that will take you by surprise, but there is so much more than the gruesome feel to this movie. It is Hitchcock's way of giving his audience enough suspense, curiosity, and most of all, that thrilling feel that makes the must see Psycho what it is, a worldwide phenomenon."

","Alfred Hitchcock has done it again. Psycho has set the bar for horror films and its still a great film to watch in this day and age. The ways Hitchcock uses the different camera angles to build suspense is incredible. The way director Hitchcock uses sound to unleash a chilling sense of fear to the audience is magnificent. Psycho is a must watch if your interested in watching a suspenseful horror film. Vera Miles as Lila Crane does a great job in this film and her character is outstanding. The ability to create suspense and thrill is an art and Alfred Hitchcock does just that and more. I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a classic horror film."

","First of all I was disappointed to see the movie in B&W. But, after watching the movie I can clearly understand why Hitchcock had chosen B&W over colour. If you are also thinking like me, don't care about the colour just watch this.If you don't, you are just giving up on the ""mother"" of all modern horror movies. No movie lover will take a risk of not watching Psycho. The cinema begins normally, in Phoenix, Arizona. The lead actress was a worker in a real-estate service corporation. She stole $40,000, which she had to put in bank and decides to leave the city. When she was driving, there must be scenes at her office and home to be shown. All we expect was to see those but not the face of the actress, but Hitchcock made a remarkable history to just show what is really needed. This makes you realize the mastery of Hitchcock. A psychological thriller which people didn't see till 1960, remains unaltered in its image.This connects to our minds directly. Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), the owner of Bates Motel and a Momma's boy looks like a friendly person. His action really brought the movie to life. An great movie which makes us predict what happens next, but deceives us every time in a HONEST way. Coming to the part which contributed majorly to the movie's success, MUSIC. Bernard Herrmann's score is quintessential. The music he gave makes the movie appealing at the most famous scene ""Shower Scene"". The most frightening scene is the out-of-nowhere murder of the Private Investigator. The music helped a lot here too. By continuously shocking the audience, Hitchcock took the movie in his direction, righteously. At the end, the audience will be shocked again and this is most horrifying too."

"tjgoalie13","9","1","2","1 October 2015"," A Terrifying Horror Film, and A Compositional Masterpiece
","Psycho is a classic horror film, directed by ""The Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock. Chosen to be shot in black-and-white rather than color, the tone is often terrifying, and the acting is chilling as well. The film is loaded with symbolism, and terrific composition that is just subtle enough to not give away the plot, but tells an educated audience member everything they need to know from a single frame.<br/><br/>Psycho benefits from masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, who embodies what is considered perfect mise en scene, by making almost every object in frame important in some way. The composition of the film is extremely dense, whether it be symbolic, or narratively relevant, almost every frame is crucial for the film. A great example of this is the parlor scene, in which we see Norman Bates invite Marion into his parlor. One could argue the plot of the rest of the film is told through symbolism, and composition. In the scene the composition very heavily foreshadows the coming events of the film, as we see predatory birds and predatory sexualized paintings in the parlor, concurrent with Norman. As the audience sees a large Owl, in attacking position, on eye level with Norman, the meaning is clear. This composition is consistently used throughout the scene. Another example is Marion is usually in camera with ravens, very clearly foreshadowing her fate. It's this dense and brilliant composition that makes Psycho a great example of Alfred Hitchcock's genius. Another thing that is evident throughout the film is Hitchcock's style, whether it be his obsession with birds, his love of particular shots, or his undeniable voyeuristic use of the camera. Composition is the director's most direct route into the mind of the audience, if one knows what to look for they can learn about a director from his composition. What we see is Hitchcock likes shots that feel as if the audience is looking at the characters through something, whether it be a windshield, window, or hole in the wall. Using these shots Hitchcock almost makes the camera feel like another person viewing the film. It's the use of voyeuristic shots, and the attempt to make the camera feel like another character that subtly brings the audience to Norman Bate's level, at one point we even see shots from his perspective. I suspect this was done to muddle the message of who is right, and who is wrong, because the audience is both off put with the creepiness of Norman, but is also lead to be sympathetic. In essence Hitchcock makes a movie where we see no truly good characters, but no truly bad characters either. In the end Hitchcock created a masterful horror film that could still stand as one of the best all time. The black-and-white color, dense composition, and uneasy score make Psycho all the more terrifying. All-the-while setting the standard for how filmmakers would develop characters for years to come."

But I watched it again bearing in my mind how it was in the sixties. And you got to admit that for that time this thriller was really top notch. Even though I knew the whole storyline this time, and so the surprises are not working like they should be, it stills stays an enjoyable movie to watch.

"Maladjusted_1","10","1","2","4 August 2015"," One of the most thrilling titles ever made.
","I suppose it's quite peculiar that I only saw 'Psycho' after seeing around a dozen other Hitchcock titles, given that it's his best- known film. As I pressed 'play', I made the mistake of assuming that it'd just be a seminal slasher film, lacking the complexity of other Hitchcock titles such as 'Rebecca' and 'Vertigo'. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. The score was perfect, and I'm not just talking about the piercing shrieks of the legendary shower scene. It remains amongst the most iconic in cinema, and is just as foreboding as John Williams' score for 'Jaws'. Another winning feature of Hitchcock's horror is the excellent acting. I hadn't heard much about Anthony Perkins prior to watching 'Psycho', and so I was sceptical as to how he could portray a villain as iconic as Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader. His acting talents shine from the first scene in which he appears, though, and Perkins delivers a truly outstanding performance as the crazed motel manager, Norman Bates. The performances of Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and the other actors in 'Psycho' are just as good as Perkins'. <br/><br/>The twists and plot developments delivered in the film are similarly brilliant. After the shower scene, I wasn't sure that the film could surprise me or really offer me much, but I was – once again – surprised. The level of danger perceived in 'Psycho' is much greater than that in many other Hitchcock titles, and I never thought that a 55-year-old film could grip me like this did. The brilliant director's other titles were certainly thrilling, but the threats facing actors such as James Stewart, Joan Fontaine and Tippi Hedren seemed either relatively minor ('Rear Window'; 'Rebecca'), more intriguing than dangerous ('Vertigo'; 'Suspicion'), or even comical ('The Birds'). 'Psycho' could not be dismissed in this manner, and I found the plight of Vera Miles and Janet Leigh just as intense as Jodie Foster's in 'The Silence of the Lambs', if not more so. At points, Alfred Hitchcock's iconic horror was creepier than 'Rosemary's Baby' and more shocking than 'The Exorcist', and the director accomplishes this without delving into the supernatural or paranormal. I'd go so far as to say that this title is one of the greatest films ever produced, and it certainly ranks as my favourite Hitchcock title at the moment. Upon watching 'Psycho', you'll realise how even acclaimed thrillers such as 'Se7en' and 'Misery' pale into passivity."

The music that is played during the shower scene is one of the most recognizable and compelling pieces ever written.

She is afraid of being found out, but so is Bates, so they do actually have something in common. They are both putting on a show for the other, pretending to have nothing to hide. Antiheroine and villain, conversing over sandwiches, sitting under watchful eyes of taxidermied animals. We don't see them in the same frame either which makes them both seem even more distant, detached. <br/><br/>Another favourite scene is Bates' thin frame standing at the edge of the lake, silently contemplating Arborgast's death, as his car slowly sinks into the muddy Waters.

Janet Leigh, a popular name back in the day and Jamie Lee Curtis's mother, has enough screen time for her character to be better appreciated and Anthony Perkins's portrayal of Norman Bates is both amiable and creepy.

","Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known film invented modern suspense the moment it opened in the cinema. As a child I recognized the iconic imagery and score years before I ever had the chance to watch the movie in its entirety. From the blend of music and cinematography, to its groundbreaking use of ""less-is-more"" violence, ""Psycho"" undoubtedly proves that what we see is far less important that we we DO NOT see. This film married Freud and Freddy, and redefined the horror genre as it is. It explores the often-complex relationship between mother and son, the dangers of cloistered sexuality, hidden desires, unexplored urges, dealing with death, loneliness, perversion, greed, lust, and the law."

The film is filled with so many twists and turns from beginning to end that kept me on my toes, although I already knew of most of them already because I'm clearly the only person who hadn't seen the film. I loved the plot of the movie and how the viewer starts off thinking about the girl and the stolen money, when in fact it isn't about that at all. I also believe that this film is one of the best examples of Hitchcock's mastery of suspense. There are so many scenes that are filmed in such a way that really amps up the viewer's anxiety and I'm not just talking about the shower or stair scene. I think the scene that really showed this was towards the beginning of the film when the cop pulled up behind the woman. I loved how they filmed this scene because they filmed the cop from the point of view of the driver side mirror, which kind of made you anxious because it made you feel like you were being pulled over. I could say so much more about the greatness of this classic, but I'm going to stop before I repeat everything else that has ever been said about this movie."

","Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing thriller movie. Hitchcock kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. This movie is flawless and the cinematography is perfect. Using the shadows and covering up the killer in the shower scene was perfect. It couldn't get any better. The shower scene is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in any movie. The camera zooms in as she showering to the shadowy figure in the background. Then he opens the curtain and the score music comes on which was perfect and fit so well. While he is stabbing her his whole figure is still hidden and you can't see his face. Then he leaves the bathroom as she's dying and the camera is just focused on her hand as she is slowly dying. It was perfect and just gave me that weird feeling. I loved it. That scene describes a horror movie perfectly. The acting job too during that scene was great. She made it look so realistic and it was spectacular."

","I remember when I first saw this the ending really got me by surprise. Now, looking back on it, I notice the smaller details Hitchcock put into this film. I, specifically, liked the comparison between the color of Janet Leigh's character's underwear. Int the beginning of the movie, her underwear was black. After she decided to give back the money h had stolen, her underwear is white to symbolize her repenting her crimes. Overall the movie is very good. My favorite part of the whole movie is Anthony Perkins' acting. It's excellently creepy which s good to set up an overall feel for the infamous Bates Motel. Another very good part is the movie's twist ending. One could argue that it's the predecessor for all future plot twists."

","I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock. Every movie that I've seen by him has been excellent. This one, however, is my favorite. Psycho is brilliant. Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was fantastic. Hitchcock builds the tension and constantly keeps you on your toes. His use of camera angles is superb. This, all while keeping the movie moving along at a brisk pace. At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down. It's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impactful. I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else. I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing write till the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen. You're engrossed by these characters and the plot that you don't want to miss a second."

","One of my all time favorites, Hitchcock never fails me. This film is dazzling and suspenseful, brutal and beautiful.<br/><br/>This film starts off with out lead women, haunted by guilt when she decides to steal thousands of dollars from her job and decides to leave town. Fate catches up to her at the bates motel where she is murdered. After the death of the main character so early on in the film, her boyfriend and sister come looking for her, hoping to solve the mystery of her disappearance. By doing so, we are brought into the mind of a psychopath.<br/><br/>This film, like Hitchcock's other films ,are extremely suspenseful and fun. The cinematography in combination with its editing is lighting is sublime. all of these things support the movie strongly but would be nothing without the soundtrack. The music is what really puts this film over the edge with its dramatic build and loud interruptions. A true classic."

","Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is an excellent film. I would consider it scary even compared to today's horror films. The keeps you thinking and has an awesome plot twist at the end that leaves you in awe at how well the script was written. Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh both played outstanding roles. The score and cinematography are both excellent. Hitchcock used some interesting shots such as the close up of the man falling down the stairs. Psycho is also known for its famous shower murder scene in the beginning that included the famous shrieking sound effect of horror films. Overall I give Psycho an 8/10 for its plot as well as its incredible acting."
"MC_Barton","9","1","2","30 March 2015"," ""A boy's best friend is his mother""
","""Psycho"" is a masterpiece in all sense of the meaning. It has the two aspects that makes for a riveting adventure into an alternate reality of horror, both aesthetic and apparent qualities. Horror movies are a major component of societal culture and are often executed with the objective of just frightening the viewer with predictable methods such as jump scares or disgusting content. However, once in a while, comes along a psychological horror film that is able to rattle the sense of being and challenge the moral compass of an individual, and ""Psycho"" is one of those films. Needless to say the real fear elicited from the film is that fact that a monster resides in such a normal, compassionate, and kind Norman Bates. Hiding his true intentions, he turns into one of the most provocative killers ever portrayed in any movie and has become a cultural icon. The shower scene in particular needs mentioning, the killing out of context doesn't really have an impact, but taking into account that the protagonist has just been killed about halfway through the movie gives a sense of vulnerability and is truly a shock that is worth noting. If you haven't seen this film, watch it."

","Psycho... What can I say of the greatest thriller ever made? Only repeating what others before me have said time and time again. This is absolutely brilliant no other movie can depict such horror and schizophrenic thriller that could not possibly be remade successfully as the genius Mr Alfred Hitchcock could.<br/><br/>Horror today is all over the place with poor production, poor storytelling, poor filmmaking and everything else that is wrong with them. What they don't understand is that the best horror movies need the process that Psycho takes, not just gore and bloodshed but story, emotion and Psycho is how it is done right. <br/><br/>The perfect character development, perfect pace, excellent characters and casting and the most shady villain of all cinema history. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it. Watch it. Anyone that wants to study film needs to watch this and learn what true horror is and if only producers would look at this and make horror today like it was in the old days because it truly is horror and thriller at its best.<br/><br/>Grade: A+ Comment: Horror made right."
"ekheart","10","1","2","1 March 2015"," What a Film
","What can really be said about a classic like 'Psycho' without being entirely obvious? This amazing film remains beautifully subtle, and creepily haunting. From the set design, to the perfectly executed shower scene, to the final interrogation scene that really proves it is the average, 'normal' ones to look out for, this film is perfection. (And the 'Bates Motel' series it inspired is not too shabby, either.) Was the actor who played Norman Bates ever able to find another role after this film? I know as a director, myself, I would never be able to get past such a creepy character. And Janet Leigh? Also a brilliant actor choice. All in all, this is a brilliant film made by an insanely talented, but deeply troubled man. Regardless, though, thanks, Hitch."

","We have heard a lot about this movie. A lot of side stories and a lot of prequel made as of 2015. Nothing can match the original movie and that's why its a classic. An amazing watch and I have learned a lot in dissecting this in Film school.A psycho thriller by the amazing director known as Mr. Hitchcock. Four award winning nominations including best direction. I always admire Hitchcock with the way he storyboards all of his movies and this is one great example of such. I always look up to him whenever I try and get my film together. Cinematic and one of the best films of all time. If you haven't seen this movie then you are missing out. Make sure that you put it on your movie cue."

","Easily one of my all time favorite movies. Hitchcook never disappoints and Psycho is no exception. The story is very simple and straight forward with a great twist at the end that catches audience members by surprise ( although I wasn't so easily fooled. Hitchcook using several foreshadowing techniques and focused shots to push the audience towards a conclusion. His shots, while often simple, are very effective; for example the low lighting and the back-lit people allows the audience to see the outline of the killer but no specific details beyond that. The shower seen was especially brilliant with a wide variety of rapid shots and insinuated actions. Overall the film is amazingly made and a stepping stone for all psycho thrillers to come."
"theblackscythe","10","1","2","1 October 2014"," Rightfully considered one of the all time horror masterpieces.
","(Halloween Horror Reviews #1)<br/><br/>To Begin my rush of October horror reviews, I will now cover one of the most iconic and acclaimed horror films ever. Alfred Hitchcock's often imitated, but never matched, Psycho.<br/><br/>To start, the film has possibly one of the tightest screenplays ever written. Innumerable twists, plays on the audiences expectations and elegant little subversions upon itself make the plot come alive and dazzle like a firecracker. I mean it when I say that 54 years after its release the rest of the genre is still trying to catch-up Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch's masterpiece of a screenplay. However, the way Hitchcock delivers this script is also incredible. Small visual hints and tricks make the film a joy to re-watch. For example, we see a woman in white underwear, later in the film she wears black underwear to show that she has committed an impure act. Such tiny details, but the impact is massive on the whole.<br/><br/>Next the acting. Anthony Perkins delivers one of the most effective 'creepy' performances of all time. Like the screenplay it too has not been matched in 54 years and remains the yardstick for all psychopathic portrayals in film. Aside from Perkins however, the rest of the cast give strong performances, particularly Janet Leigh in the 'starring' role. <br/><br/>The set design is legendary. Such mundane and simple locations are brought to life by the films exquisite lighting and use of shadows. The house in the background to the main set looms like a falcon, and casts a shadow over all the preceding events. You feel like someone is watching you at all times, and are constantly on edge. Such simple images as a stuffed bird, or a tall staircase are used so effectively here. This film remains an icon on minimalist set design, and how to creep your audience out with the simplest of imagery. <br/><br/>Overall I cannot praise this film enough. One of the most iconic and brilliant films, from one of the most iconic and brilliant directors of all time. <br/><br/>Happy Halloween."
"donniecs97","8","1","2","26 September 2014"," One of if not the best horror movies
","This is hands down Hitchcock's best film. If only they made movies like this nowadays. The acting is suburb especially for the era the film was made and of course the directing is brilliant. Anthony Perkins does an amazing job as Norman Bates and really made a lasting performance. You really feel he has an unhealthy relationship with his dead mother and you you may be thrown of by the fact he committed the murders, after a while you think ""I knew it"". He is like that weird kid at school who you know is going to snap. In my opinion, he made the movie. Of course he didn't do it alone he had Very Mills, Janet Leigh, and many more supporting actors/actresses. This movie really keeps you hooked until the incredible ending and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. This is one of those movies that scares you without using cheap jump scares or tons of gore. One of the major factors contributing to the scare level is the soundtrack. I'm sure most people know the music played over the infamous shower scene, but people overlook the eerie music played throughout the film. I really suggest any horror fan...any movie fan to check this masterpiece from the master of the macabre."

","I had even heard the famous music in Psycho before I watch this film. There are many preparations in it. First of all, Norman talks with Marion. There is a stuffing of a raven at his back. The stuffing is a hint in Psycho. Norman has double characters- Norman and His mother. His mother is violent and loves Norman, her son. She tries to prevent to take Norman by women. The stuffing represents her. It likes a mask. Second, A toilet and an overflow of a bath expresses something. It is death and despair because it is pitch-dark within overflows. I pick up two hints. Final, I remember the mummy of Norman's mother. I like this movie."

","I am not one that is into most slasher type of films but the ""Psycho"" film series has a very good interesting story and main character (Norman) from the first film to the very last movie. I love these movies.<br/><br/>Psycho is most definitely a horror classic - I doubt most people would argue with that. It is a must see for those that love horror but have yet to view the film.<br/><br/>Psycho is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen in my life and I am not just talking about the infamous shower scene. The entire movie had an air of mystery and thrilling suspense from start to finish which added more to the horror, more than the shower scene.<br/><br/>Even if you never knew that Norman was a ""Psycho"" killer the character would still seem bizarre. Norman seems normal when you first meet him on film, yet the more he speaks the more he seems strange, just weird when he talks - that alone is enough to scare the pants off of you! Then you factor in the fact he is in fact ""Psycho"" on top of it the movie becomes one of the all time scariest films ever! No, Norman is not normal.<br/><br/>10/10"
"RossRivero99","10","1","2","1 July 2014"," The Very Best movie of 1960
","Perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's most acclaimed film Psycho is a film that should have won best picture, and best director instead of Billy Wilder winning both awards for his film that came out in that same year The Apartment. The movie tells the story of two of the most important characters in the film which begins with Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) a woman who stole $ 40,000 in cash to go see her boyfriend Sam (played by John Gavin) then after running into the police she goes to a car shop to borrow a car then on a rainy night goes to the Bates motel where she meets a man named Norman Bates (played by Anthony Perkins)who seems nice but really is a troubled psychotic maniac. Who then dresses up in his mother's clothes and ends up killing Marion in the most famous scene in the movie ""The Shower Scene"". Then a private investigator (played by Martin Balsam) and her sister (played by Vera Miles) search for her. When I was watching this film last night for the very first time I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen because of how scary and well done the film was. The performances were top notch from Leigh, Gavin, Perkins, Miles, Balsam, and especially John McIntire as the sheriff."
"Chris042711","10","1","2","9 May 2014"," Stands the test of time
","I feel that this movie is a classic that all people should watch, especially those who like scary movies. Psycho was released in 1960 and is often the most remembered film from that era. The film uses a great use of lighting by combining low key with high key lighting styles. Low key lighting in the film was used to show eerie settings and to emphasize they mystery of what is really going on their and in the house which is located directly behind the motel which a good portion of the film takes place in.<br/><br/>In the film Marion is a respectable lady who is in a relationship that is strained by financial burdens. When a high rolling customer comes into her work looking to buy a house in cash. She is entrusted with the cash and told to put in in the bank immediately. She doesn't do this though. Instead she takes the money and goes on the run. Unfortunately for her she runs into Norman Bate's who runs the bates motel. She takes a room and appeases Norman by having dinner with him. As they are talking she offends Norman when talking about his controlling mother. So Norma does the normal thing anyone else would do and kills her in the shower while dressed up as his mother. This scene is now one of the most know pictures in Hollywood now. After he kills her a private detective comes who is tracking down Marion. he asks to many questions for Normans liking so naturally Norman also kills him too. Norman is later caught thanks to Marion's lover and sister investigating the house behind the hotel when they find the decomposing body of Normans mom. It turns out that normal went crazy and took on and acted as his mother ad Norma but in the end committed to the role of his mom and psychologically in his head became his mother. This is who the name of the movie is Psycho because he was in fact a Psychotic lunatic."
"connorsalisbury18","9","1","2","6 May 2014"," Culturally Significant and Excellent.
","The film Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is teeming with character and an interesting plot line. The film is culturally significant as it portrayed a villain that was not one dimensional but rather detailed. The ending scene where Norman Bates, while dressed up as his mother stabs Marion is iconic. This scene along with the classic music and sound that went along with it is unforgettable. The concept of Psycho has even been re imagined as a television series, since it remains so popular even today. The movie had great acting, and Norman Bates character made the film. He was eccentric and crazy, talking to his dead mother, and even 'becoming' her at times. The setting was ominous and creepy. There was this empty motel with this looming mansion above it on a hill. It emanated spookiness, and added to the mise-en-scene of the film. The movie gave a great feeling of intrusion, and the lack of privacy which made the movie scary and unsettling. Overall the film was an excellent piece of psychological horror that still resonates with fans today."

","Having just finished the first season of Bates Motel on Netflix, I was very excited to watch Psycho, to see what the show was based off of. And I have to say, it did not disappoint. The film is full of plot twists, with an ending that one does not expect. It is also filled with many Hitchcock like shots, being very dramatic and suspenseful. The score of the film adds to the over all horror and suspense feel that the audience gets while watching, and helps make the film the masterpiece that it is. Psycho has definitely been a reference for many horror films to follow, and will continue to do so. It is truly a masterpiece, and I would recommend it to anyone."

"jacobclark512","10","1","2","4 March 2014"," The Perfect Horror Film
","Psycho is a ""less is more"" type of film. The minimal budget allotted to Hitchcock made him simpler and more restrained in his film-making. This allowed the story and acting to shine through instead of the big names and huge flair of earlier films like North by Northwest. Janet Leigh is stunning as Marion Crane and ensures that we remember what little screen time she has. The rest of the supporting cast is memorable to a point and adds emotional depth to the story; however, it is Anthony Perkins who steals the show. His performance as Norman Bates is one of the most stunning performances of all time. Perkins also hides the film's twist well throughout the entire movie, adding to Psycho's suspense. The score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and adds incredibly to the suspense, especially during the infamous shower scene. That single scene is perhaps the defining scene of Hitchcock's career. It not only serves as the single catalyst for the plot, it also shows the attention to detail he gave to his movies. Psycho is the best horror film ever made for its reliability on every other factor besides gore to create suspense. It revolutionized the genre, along with Hitchcock's career, to be more focused on substance rather than style."

","To me Psycho is the best movie from the master of thrill and suspense Alfred Hitchcock. It has everything that makes a thriller perfect, the start is a bit different from the plot but that is what making psycho even more beautiful, the tension in Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind weather to steal and run away or remain loyal, the free way scene with cop following her and then her entry to the BATES Motel, the main concern of the movie, Everything is shot to perfection. The music never gets better, it sounds to be created specially to scare you. Norman Bates has a very special characteristic in his character and no one could have played him better but Anthony Perkins. Hang on guys, because no one is going to relieve himself of the great tension from start lasting through the entire movie up till the final frame. Anthony Perkins is the reason why you are never gonna feel out of the movie for even a second, and you never forget him even after watching this flick. It's not an ordinary horror film because everything makes sense, a mother's love is eternal.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock has proved himself to be the cinematic icon, He manages to catch you through his characters in every film he has made, While this one being the best of all."
"rsabnis1","9","1","2","18 February 2014"," Thrilling & Riveting; Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho creates an impact greater than most of his epic noirs.
","The way films shot in black-and-white portrays itself to the audience and materialize into something more than just a critical acclaimed film is surely alluring to experience. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho might not be my first movie I watched from the 60's era but it's definitely the one creating a greater impact than the other. The movie has pure visceral feel and induces a thrill so powerful that you might find yourself quite intrigued by it. <br/><br/>Psycho opens up with a scene with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) in a rented room of cheap hotel in Pheonix. Their apparent actions and conversations give vivid impression that both are currently having an intense love affair and want to get married soon but are unable to do so since they can't afford the expenses involved. Marion is working in an estate agent's office and meets with a client who gives her 40,000 dollars to buy a house for his daughter.<br/><br/>A desperate Marion steals 40,000 dollars from the client and flees from the town. Marion, on the run takes refuge in a motel called as Bates Motel, whose business appeared to be in total shambles. Even being strongly confronted by his dominant mother, the owner of the motel Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) warmly welcomes Marion with warm dinner and cosy room to spend the night in. Things turned horribly ugly when Marion gets murdered in the room of the motel by an unknown entity as she gets stabbed multiple times. The unknown entity in the movie will somewhat be perceived by the audience as 'Psycho' and the overall objective of cold-blooded murder however remains a mystery. <br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, Psycho is a mystery thriller with the suspense not being kept on hold for long and becomes quite flagrant. Alfred Hitchcock has made an audacious effort to make such a thriller in which the title of being the 'protagonist' vacillates from one person to another quite impressively. You may not be sure who the lead character actually is but you are pretty sure that the film is not a bizarre scramble of sheer ambiguity. A cinephile's experience will spring to life if he doesn't have the prescience of the suspense before. The film is capricious but still thrilling and fantastically riveting. <br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is worth the encomium and claps. <br/><br/>9 on 10 stars"

Not that it isn't great, maybe I'm one of those 1 out of 100 people not to be fazed by this film. As the title of the film suggest, I anticipated the twist and it the part which is supposed to 'blow your mind' was way too predictable for me. But top notch direction again.

"akash_sebastian","8","1","2","16 July 2013"," Best Psychological Thriller from the Master of Suspense! Pathbreaking for its Time...
","With an age of 60 years, and a book containing such violence and sexuality, when Hitchcock tried to make 'Psycho' in 1959, the people, the industry and the critics didn't expect anything to come out of it. Who could have guessed it would become one of his best and most ambitious works.<br/><br/>Personally, it's my favourite Hitchcock movie; it's a powerful and complex psychological thriller. The movie was path-breaking in so many ways, and completely transformed the thriller and mystery genres. Its foray into psychoanalysis, the killing of the leading lady halfway through the film, the voyeuristic camera angles/glimpses into the lives of the characters, and the sexuality on film; all these completely changed the face of cinema. And not to forget John L. Russell's cinematography and Bernard Herrmann's legendary background score which give the movie its tone and impact.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh is mesmerizing in her short, but brilliant, portrayal of Marion Crane. Anthony Perkins gives a heartwarming and powerful performance as the innkeeper Norman Bates.<br/><br/>How can I finish my review without mentioning the famous Shower sequence? Legend has it that the scene was filmed over 7 days, and features 77 different camera angles. The nudity and violence are merely suggested, and not actually shown, and there lies the actual beauty of the scene. And the shots shown are through the views of the killer and the victim, and not that of a third person. Other than this scene, there are many other memorable and brilliantly directed scenes in the movie, including the climatic twist and the exceptional ending. There are many such details which add to the magnificence of the film.<br/><br/>The movie still remains as one of the best suspense thrillers of all time. Hitchcock truly was... the Master of Suspense!"
"cleary-joshua","10","1","2","11 July 2013"," One of Hitchcock's very best works, and among Herrmann's finest scores
","Despite being shot in 1960, when colour technology had taken over and was thriving, Alfred Hitchcock decided to shoot his masterpiece ""Psycho"" in black and white, in order to keep his budget down. However the black and white adds so much more suspense and mystery to the film, which keeps throwing curveballs at the audience. It tells the story of Marion Crane (at the start anyway), a woman who decides one day to run away with Having done this, she becomes instantly paranoid, convinced that a policeman is following her. While driving off in the rain, she gets panicked, and checks in at a strange motel called ""Bates Motel"", inhabited only by a young looking Norman Bates and his mysteriously unseen mother.<br/><br/>I don't really want to say more about the plot than that, since it's a film that constantly surprises with its plot. Sure, 90% of people know about the famous ""shower scene"" which is still very scary to this day, but what comes after it was very unexpected for me. I had no idea at the 60 minute mark where the film was going to go. Anthony Perkins' performance as the calm looking but psychopathically twisted Norman Bates is a fine one, and there is a lot of depth and evil concealed behind his eyes for most of the film. From the first moment we see him, you are certain he's a killer, he's just got an evil look to him.<br/><br/>The set design and cinematography are both fantastic, and the Bates house is particularly creepy standing atop the hill. The opening shot of the cityscape is also great, with the camera gliding over into the hotel room. What really makes this movie so incredible to me is the soundtrack. Bernard Herrmann here provides one of his very best movie scores, with so much menacing, anger and suspense in every cue. The violence of the ""Prelude"" music sets the audience up instantly for a thriller, and even though the first 25 minutes are fairly tame, the music keeps returning to remind you that something is coming. Also, the fact that he writes only 4 proper cues which he reuses throughout the whole first 50 minutes is incredible, because they don't seem monotonous, and have a new side to them each time.<br/><br/>In short, because I really don't want to give much away, this is an absolute masterpiece, one of Hitchcock's very best works. It's got violence, suspense, drama and thrills, and somehow a lot of depth along with that."
"TheMulderFox","9","1","2","6 July 2013"," A Masterstroke - Psycho is simply brilliant
","What can I say about Hitchcock that hasn't already been said so many times before? The man was an absolute genius and I adore his work. And just to get it all out of the way I love Psycho, just in case that wasn't already clear.<br/><br/>In the late '50's and early '60's there was a flurry of low budget, mostly B&W horror/thriller/suspense movies made. Think the work of Wiliam Castle(The Tingler, House on Haunted Hill, Macabre)as an example. These proved mostly very popular with audiences, and it was this trend that sparked Hitchcock to try his hand at the same formula. The result was Psycho.(as a side note William Castle in turn made ""Strait-Jacket"" as a direct response to Psycho) The true strength of Psycho, for me, lies not in the Famous Shower scene or the brief outbursts of violence(few as they are) heightened by Bernard Herrmann's now signature score. The true strength of this film lies in the casting of Antony Perkins and Janet Leigh. They portray their respective characters perfectly. Watching the subtle nuances in their performances, the minor changes in expression, the inflections and tone of voice is just fascinating. There simply is no Norman Bates without Anthony Perkins.<br/><br/>Even to the very last scene Psycho keeps you enthralled where the big pay-off of the story is not stereotypically the apprehension of a maniac(or psychopath if you will)or the solving of a crime with the comforting knowledge that all is well again. Instead it comes with the realisation of just how far down the rabbit hole you've truly gone, and that ""Norman Bates"" can be anyone or anywhere. Be it the unassuming shy owner of a roadside motel or even your neighbour.<br/><br/>Psycho is simply a must see picture."

","Major Spoilers Below....<br/><br/>""We all go a little mad sometimes."" Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a suspense, thriller film that is still effective today. I have not seen a lot of Hitchcock's films and the ones I have seen are the most known; Vertigo, Rear Window, North By Northwest and now Psycho. This film has become such an icon in horror and thriller films that it becomes so hard for a person in my generation to come in this film fresh and be ignorant. This film is very effective as the story requires the audience to not have an idea of what is coming next.<br/><br/>As I said before, I came into this knowing all the iconic scenes but luckily I did not know about the main twist at the end of the film. This film was based on a novel by Robert Bloch but developed to the screen by Joseph Stefano. I have not watched any other works by Joseph Stefano and I have not read Bloch's novel but yet due to popular culture the film kind of takes the fun out of watching this film. Though stripped off of it's suspense at times but the film's story story was still entertaining due to its characters. I admire the fact that the film decides to take an unexpected turn and switch the focus on Norman Bates rather than Marion Crane. I find Norman an interesting figure and is something of a mystery. I do tend to give a more positive rating to films that dives into human psychology, which is the reason I liked films like Identity. Lila Crane is a great substitute of a strong female character and doesn't sacrifice the presence of women, something that is lacking in this film in my opinion. The film overall is great and the character Norman Bates is something that have influenced future films.<br/><br/>Alfred HItchcock has been labelled as the master of suspense. Though I haven't seen all of his films but I felt Psycho is one of the films that solidified his reputation. To me, this film ties up there with Hitchcock's other film Vertigo. The film still does feel like a product of its time and may feel a little date in its effects, like when a certain someone falls down the stairs, but I watched this with that mindset and not allowing its dated flaws to ruin my judgement of the film. Psycho is still something that should be watched by the current generation and, mystery and suspense fans.<br/><br/>John L. Russell is the film's cinematographer and in this film he ensures that everything does, every angle and every camera movement, supports in creating tension and suspense. The camera, a lot of the time, follows the characters ensuring that our focus stays on them. Shadows are important in shaping the tone and supports the characters' personalities and intentions. Some of these scenes are so iconic in its cinematography that it has attributed to the film's influence. Hitchcock may have decided to have this film in black and white because it is much cheaper to photograph it that way but I think this style is also something that he desired to avoid that feeling of a set.<br/><br/>Bernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who have worked on the most acclaimed films; Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver and North By Northwest but I think this is his most iconic as it has been used and talked about by either critics or the general public. The film's tense moments are accompanied by harsh strings that shocks you as it screeches. Without Herrmann's score then the film would not give that same effect as it would with it.<br/><br/>The most crucial actor that must be chosen perfectly is the role of Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has embodied the role of this damaged man so convincingly that it is horrifying to even think it. Janet Leigh was terrific, her acting did not outshine anyone but certain moments in the film like the suspicious police officer, shows more to her than a pretty face. Martin Balsam as the private detective was one of the most enjoyable ones in this film. I did not expect much from him because the last film I have seen him in is Breakfast at Tiffany's and he did not really do much there.<br/><br/>Solid cast, beautiful black and white cinematography, legendary score, and great direction has earned this film a classic status and will remain that way until the end of cinema. I adore the psychological aspect of this film and the choice of black and white photography. This film has shaped modern thrillers and will continue to do so."

","I remember the first time watching this film (as I write this I am listening to Bernard Herrmanns wonderful score for the film), best Saturday night movie ever! Lights all turned off to add to the suspense. Its one of those films you can only really see once, but I have watched it more than 10 times! I think that the music for this film is amazing, from the opening credits to the infamous ""Shower Scene"". Obviously I would say it was Hitchcock's best (as a lot of people would agree) and the casting choice is brilliant, unlike the 1998 'disasterpiece' with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates(seriously?!). Anthony Perkins has got to be one of the greatest movie villains ever! I cannot recommend this film enough! It is just a masterpiece of cinema and every single person on this planet should see it!<br/><br/>P.S. Make sure it is the 1960 version you watch and NOT the 1998 remake!"

","It definitely wouldn't fit under the musical or romantic category in my opinion with the blood and violence. It starts off with the switched angles, showing the woman looking at notebook, to woman's face to just the notebook, to just her face again, it is keeping the movie from appearing boring.The angle of the shower, not just the woman in the shower, but the actual shower. It shows the woman getting in feet first, showing the floor of the bathroom and then it shows the side and front view of the water spurting out of the shower head. it is keeping our eyes interested in what will happen next. The low key lighting is very intense at times, it creates this eerie feeling. For example the black outline of the killer and the eerie haunted house, the back lit lighting behind the black makes it more eerie and scary."

","Classics are often underwhelming, because they are often described as the pinnacle of filmaking, whereas in truth, films get better and better.<br/><br/>The presentation is the most obvious- black and white cannot compare with color (but works in this case!). Ranking movies is a bit like ranking ""which firearm is the best?"", because while there may be classics, the newer ones have the benefit of the knowledge of the older ones! Movies look at the old ideas and improve upon them. People might not agree with this, but I think it is nostalgia that is ruining their perception.<br/><br/>THAT said, this movie is actually quite thrilling. I enjoy watching classic movies for the insight in how filmmaking has improved as an art, but usually have low expectations because we all have been spoiled.<br/><br/>Everybody probably knows the plot by now, but if you don't, it's worth a watch.

"max-swindlehurst","10","1","2","17 May 2012"," By far the greatest horror/suspense film of all time.
","Psycho is by far the greatest horror film of all time, and one of the earliest made horror films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect especially the famous 'shower scene'.<br/><br/>Visually, Hitchcock subtly represents these theories through symbolism, lighting, shapes (that reflect the characters personality) and dialogue. The most interesting and important concept that ties in with almost every other aspect of the movie are the constant metaphors that represent the psychodynamic theory of the psyche; the id - impulsive, the ego - creates realistic ways to satisfy the id's demands and the superego which is the moral compass that regulates the other two. Throughout the superego is represented in a number of ways; the policeman, the stuffed birds and Marion (just before her murder). And Norman of course represents the ego and id; although his conflict is brought to the surface through schizophrenic means. This concept that I have tried my best to explain barely scratches the surface of what is a movie jam packed with interesting analogies and metaphors. But all this complexity resonates from the focal exploration of the human mind and makes the audience question their own ethics.<br/><br/>There is no sloppiness in this movie in terms of a visual and aural experience, as Hitchcock's objective of 'messing' with the audience requires and almost flawless film viewing experience; an that this is."
"Toronto85","10","1","2","12 April 2011"," Psycho
","Psycho is probably my all time favourite horror film next to Halloween (1978) and the original Night of the Living Dead. What this movie managed to do at that time in the 60's was remarkable. There had never been anything like this made up to that point. It's the start of a great sub genre known as the ""slasher film"". The story is of a troubled man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and a woman on the run named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Marion leads an unfulfilled life and one day decides to embezzle $40,000 from her employer. While on the run, she stops off at the infamous Bates Motel to think things over and get some rest. While taking a shower, an unseen assailant who resembles a large woman attacks her with a knife, killing her. We soon are led to believe it's Norman's mother who committed the crime. It's then we see Norman cover it up for her. Many people question the whereabouts of Marion over the next few days including her boyfriend and sister. They, with the help of a private investigator, discover she was at the Bates Motel. But when entering the house up on the hill behind the motel, the discovery they make is much more chilling then could ever be imagined.<br/><br/>Psycho is an all time classic by suspense and psychological icon Alfred Hitchcock. This was definitely his best work. The Birds was also excellent as was Rear Window, but this will always be his best known piece - and for good reason. The performances by Perkins and Leigh in particular was very understated and very well done. Watching it the first time, you really are drawn into the story and the mystery of the crimes taking place. Of course, after a few viewings you know the plot and the killer's identity. This is one of those horror movies that never gets old to me and never feels boring. Each time I watch it, I pick up something new. I liked Janet Leigh's character and her struggle with the embezzlement scheme. She knows what she did was wrong and contemplates taking the money back numerous times. It gives her that human quality and makes viewers feel bad for her in the end.<br/><br/>The musical score is legendary as well, even if you've never seen Psycho, you know that sharp grating music that goes along with each suspenseful moment. Psycho is a classic horror film, but not just horror. Even the people who hate horror should see this at least once for it's brilliance.<br/><br/>10/10"
"srryimnotcreative","10","1","2","2 April 2011"," One of the best most scary movies ever...
","This movie is truly scary in a way modern horror movies aren't. There is almost no blood and absolutely no gore in it which modern horror movies are full of. The scary parts of the film is you can never see any gore so its all up to your imagination. And the acting is the best i've ever seen Anthony Perkins plays Norman bates so well i truly believed he was psycho and Janet Leigh even though she wasn't their the entire movie while she was their she owned the screen.

"Steffi_P","9","1","2","27 December 2010"," ""Our private traps""
","The horror genre has often thrived on tales of the unknown, the inexplicable and the supernatural, and this can be very effective in its own way. However there has long been another tradition of scaring people with more worldly horrors, with the genuinely unnerving touch of wholly possible events, familiar settings and the thought that this could happen to you too. And who else would be behind one of the most seminal and iconic entries in this subgenre but Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock, the director who specialised in bringing real-world terrors home to his audience.<br/><br/>Perhaps the main secret to Psycho's success is the unusual structuring of its screenplay. The adaptation by Joseph Stefano contains more or less all the actual events of the original Robert Bloch novel, except that the emphasis has changed. The novel was told largely from Norman Bates's perspective, with Marion Crane turning up on his doorstep a few chapters in. However the adaptation brings us in to the story with Marion, telling the first half of the narrative through her eyes. This not only provides one of the biggest red herrings in the history of the thriller, it is a really effective way of keying us into the story on the level of an ordinary ""everywoman"", albeit one who has stolen a large sum of money, but even this the script goes to lengths to rationalise, embroiling us in her growing paranoia.<br/><br/>But the screenplay would be worth little if it wasn't for the fact Hitchcock knows exactly how to present this material. He uses a lot of long takes in the scenes with Janet Leigh, using his roving camera to keep us with her, or at least with her thoughts, as for example when the camera pans down to the pile of money on the bed then over to the suitcase. Such manoeuvres can be very gimmicky and intrusive, so a director can only really get away with them if the picture is otherwise utterly compelling, which of course Psycho is. Hitch contrasts the long takes with a choppy editing pattern when Anthony Perkins is around, as suited to the awkward oddity of his presence. One of the director's finest constructions is the scene where Leigh and Perkins talk together in the parlour, surrounded by all those stuffed birds, a rather long scene, heavy on dialogue, and thus one that could easily become boring. However Hitch creates several modulations in tone simply by varying his angle. For example, when Bates is angered by Marion's suggestion that his mother be put someplace, Perkins is shown in profile, with that predatory owl prominent at the top of the screen, while the contrasting shots of Leigh become close-ups, looking vulnerable with her back to the wall.<br/><br/>And one of the biggest keys to the realism (and therefore the ability to disturb) of Psycho is the quality of the acting performances. Janet Leigh plays a very credible game of trying to balance outward calmness and inner turmoil, which is really crucial to make the picture work. If the average audience member is to empathise with her character, we have to believe that she is not some hardened criminal, and that she is racked with guilt and fear of getting caught. Martin Balsam is great too as the easygoing private investigator, making his character likable by the naturalism of his performance. Finest of all however is of course Anthony Perkins, the genius of whose performance is the simplicity and fragility with which he plays Norman Bates, and that edge of menace he suddenly brings out of nowhere. His turn here is ideally suited to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense, as it treads that line of allowing the audience to be taken in by one red herring, but is also believable in retrospect once the truth is finally revealed.<br/><br/>I'll finish with a quick word on the musical score for Psycho. While Bernard Hermann's ""stabbing strings"" have been cited and praised as much as virtually every other aspect of the picture, I'm also struck by the similarity between the main theme (the sharp, tense piece that plays over the opening credits and several other scenes) and the penultimate movement of the Russian composer Modeste Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. This latter piece refers to a macabre Slavic folk tale about a witch who kidnaps and murders children. Whether or not the link is deliberate, both pieces of music strike the same tone to suit their grisly and terrifying subject matter."
"blanbrn","10","1","2","19 December 2010"," Hitch's best. One of the best and most memorable suspense thrillers in film history. Well liked for the famous shower scene.
","""Psycho"" is without a doubt a classic film a suspense thriller that ranks well in memory it impacted cinema and pop culture it's a film that ranks as iconic history. When I first saw it I was even afraid to take showers as a kid! As the famous shower scene impacted me that much, and many people even had a phobia of staying in a motel after seeing this film classic. Later thru the years after countless viewings I adjusted and saw every moment of the film as pleasure as after I learned how the shower scene was shot I learned to appreciate cinema history and the techniques of how the shower scene was shot with superior montage editing.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock the master of thriller suspense had it all in ""Psycho"" the many themes present are lust, sex, embezzlement, greed, secrets, taxidermy, voyeurism, and a split personality which caused someone to cross dress as their dead mother! Aside from that the shower shower scene is memorable one of the most famous in film history and combined with the performances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, ""Psycho"" is a memorable classic that a viewer can't get enough of.<br/><br/>Set in Arizona it begins with Marion Crane(played so beautiful and very elegantly sexy by Janet Leigh a 60's screen siren. Plus it was a real treat to see Janet undress and sport that sexy black bra!)a woman who as a lonely secretary only has a hobby of being a sexy and elegant seducer of her boyfriend a man who's divorced. And Marion wants escape so one Friday afternoon after returning from lunch break when she receives a payment for her boss from a rich oil business man an ideal is sprung to mind. Marion will leave town only the money is not put in the bank it will take a journey ride with Marion to California. Interesting and very watchful along the way is the scenes of the deep voiced policeman who follows Marion a little distance, as I think Hitchcock used these scenes to show a viewer that Ms. Crane felt guilt about her exit.<br/><br/>Only one rainy evening in California she drives upon the lonely Bates motel and this place feels different as it's clearly not what it seems. Attending is Norman Bates(wonderfully done and over the top by Anthony Perkins) who's a strange guy a shut in who tends to his old sick mother(supposedly)and Norman has a hobby of collecting dead birds! As he talks and checks Ms. Crane in Norman seems normal, yet he's anything but. Then shocking is when Marion gets settled in she tries to unwind and chill with a hot shower, only this is one shower that will spray out a sliced up death as it will become a blood bath! As Marion will clearly have her secrets washed away in blood.<br/><br/>Many don't know the shower scene was shot from seventy different camera positions. As the montage editing is fantastic as the way the shots were linked together showing a certain form of art. This was adapted from the Soviet Union from the classic director Eisenstein as the clashing of images is graphic as it matches the film's shower scene so well. As each clashing scene the knife is shown going back and fourth from Leigh's body the images clash with blood showing the graphic side of life as this film has a bloody form of art. And most telling and chilling is the final shot when Janet falls as the blood drips down the tub drain showing her dead the drain symbolizes her life has indeed went down the drain! Really this is one scene I can go on and on about as if you know and study film their is always something you can find that the shower scene symbolizes and links to life and a graphic form of death. The scene was just so brilliant.<br/><br/>So did Norman do it or was it mad mother who knows as Hitchcock tries to keep it a little suspenseful. Only you the viewer know the real shock poor Norman is a dressed up guy having a thing for women's wardrobe! Overall great suspense thriller classic from Alfred it proves we all have the right to go a little mad. It proves that you can't run from and hide your secrets. And when you arrive in a strange place you never know what to expect, as hidden secrets are present and they might just be stranger than yours just even mad and crazy! ""Psycho"" is one of the best films ever made."

","I shall never look at motels the same way. They are disturbing. Actually I've always thought they were disturbing. Hitchkock probably always did too. This movie delivers tension like no other. The famous shower scene gets me every time I choose to watch the film(Psycho). When ya first saw you didn't see it coming. But then when you saw it again, you anticipate in dread. So it's got REPLAY VALUE. Excellent photograpy and camera work. The house on the hill sure is spooky. And the ending scared the crap out of me when I was little. I still does. It's such a disturbing looking skeleton. It looks like an ape for crying out loud! Gee whiz. It sure is a great flick. Hitchkock foreva. Rest in peace my dog."

","Yes, everything you've heard is true. The score is a part of pop culture. The conflict is well known. But nothing shocks like the seeing it for yourself. Psycho is the one of best horror film ever made, and I usually hate this movies. The story is incredible and so is everything else. The shower scene was so important because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a naked chick getting stabbed in a shower was something that nobody had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing people having sex and getting hatched to death is nothing uncommon. The soundtrack is so important in this film. Sound is such an important element in movies. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween."
"RickBrands","7","1","2","27 November 2010"," Visually impressive, but doesn't hold up.
","While I know I'll anger a lot of thriller fans, here's my two cents: this is one of the least enjoyable Hitchcock classics. To clarify: if you compare Psycho to North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train, Vertigo or Rebecca, I can't see how any self-proclaimed film fan wouldn't conclude that it falls considerably short. Even other Hitch classics I don't particularly love or hate (such as The Birds, Rear Window or Marnie) trigger a wider emotional response than the pretty simplistic shock effects which are all Psycho has to offer. Of course there's some great cinematography, but it isn't backed by any involving factors other than sheer horror, or the kind of hammy pseudo-psychology Hitchcock already tried his hand on in Spellbound.<br/><br/>My reasonably kind rating of seven out of ten is mostly motivated by its historical importance - even if you take into account that Peeping Tom, which I think is a far superior film with a similar theme, relentlessly flopped earlier in the same year - as it opened the mainstream public's eyes regarding the horror/thriller genre. But if you've seen Psycho once (which, in fact, any film fanatic should), to me there's no real reason to watch it again."
"Atreyu_II","7","1","2","13 August 2010"," Intriguing
","'Psycho' is nowadays highly praised as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films but back when it first came out it got mixed reviews. I'm not that familiar with the cinema of The Master of Suspense, though.<br/><br/>In 1960 colored films were already quite common (even Hitchcock's own films) but 'Psycho' was filmed in black and white. One can only wonder why, but I don't care about that. I'm not saying this just because I consider black and white a form of art but also because 'Psycho' is the kind of film that works better in black and white. It probably would be bad if it was in colors. The same way I wouldn't want black and white films such as 'The Window' (by Ted Tetzlaff) in colors, among others. <br/><br/>'Psycho', while I don't see it as the masterpiece many made it seem to be, is an okay movie. The old-fashioned feeling it gives is nice: the opening scene showing a lovely panorama of Phoenix, Arizona (where it takes place); the huge American cars of that time; the fact that it is in black and white; etc.<br/><br/>The famous shower scene doesn't look minimally realistic. I'm not gonna spoil my reasons, but it's so phony that it's obvious how it was made. Nevertheless, I think it is well made (if that makes sense) and it certainly is effective when it comes to quickness, although not really scary... well, at least not for our standards. But it must have been so surprising in 1960. For me, the part when the same assassin kills detective Arbogast is scarier, as that scene is so sudden and when you less expect... not to mention that it is very quick!<br/><br/>The violin sound makes a great piece of music and works well for the suspense of this film, which has many well made scenes of solid suspense. Scenes which give the feeling that you don't know what's gonna happen, but give the idea that something bad might happen. That's the case, for example, of a sequence when Marion is driving her car on a dark rainy night and the wipers of her car barely clean any rain. We barely see anything, just like her.<br/><br/>This is a movie that, watching for a 1st time, it's almost impossible to guess that Norman's ""mother"" is actually Norman himself disguised and imitating her. But it's easy to suspect that he's not the innocent guy he seems to be at first, as he smiles of satisfaction when he sinks Marion's car on a swamp (with her body in the car's trunk).<br/><br/>Although interesting, it's a weird movie. I hear that weird movies was one of Hitchcock's specialties. Janet Leigh does a fine job as Marion Crane. Other actors do well either. Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack is fantastic.<br/><br/>The final shot, which shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, could have been longer. It's far too quick and ends too sudden. Practically the moment they show it the movie suddenly ends."
"lewiskendell","9","1","2","10 April 2010"," A classic in every sense of the word.
","It's hard to imagine a black and white movie from 1960 with no cursing, no blatant violence, and very little action, being epic, but Psycho definitely deserves that description. <br/><br/>Even with a basic prior knowledge of what was going to happen, I was still completely enthralled by the whole thing. It takes several different turns in tone and content throughout, but it's all consistently well done. There are very few better examples of the words thriller and mystery than this one. I used to absolutely hate older movies, but Psycho is proof that all the things that I love about movies now, were alive and well many years ago. I was absolutely startled and freaked put a few times during the film, and that's one of the finest compliments that I can give."

","Woah! ""Psycho"" is truly amazing! Everything you have heard about this undeniable classic is true (well only if you have heard very good things, that is). The script is amazing. The acting is flawless. ""Psycho"" truly delivers in every sense of the word. The sound in this movie is spot on, adding to the visual experience (when Balsam is attacked, for instance).<br/><br/>Hitchcock's directing is so skillfully done that ""Psycho"" is definitely his masterpiece. Janet Leigh screaming while being attacked in the shower is a scene that defines a whole genre, and it's Hitchcock's work that has made that scene, and the whole movie, simply timeless.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" is particularly good (and troubling to audiences) because it steps back from the fantastic beasts who stalk towns. Instead of vampires and werewolves, ""Psycho"" has a much more realistic (and thus haunting) beast: one of us. Instead of gore, there is suspense. Instead of lengthy action scenes, there is more character development. In addition to this, the movie is perfectly cast. Anthony Bates plays Norman Bates. His subtle and creepy demeanor is unsettling.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" is truly a great psychological thriller that is a classic for a reason. Do not hesitate; go watch this movie right now."
"tsheridan94","7","1","2","8 February 2010"," The movie that redefined a genre
","Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was the movie that revolutionized horror forever. This is a must-see for anyone who calls themselves a connoisseur of horror. And while not the scariest film ever, or even in the top tier, it still provides a marvelous psychological aspect, and some genuinely terrifying moments. <br/><br/>Psycho also has one of the most famous horror sequences, and even movie scenes in general. Is there anyone who hasn't heard of the shower scene? This scene is famous for a reason. The eclectic shots, switching so frequently that it almost looks like still frames create an atmosphere of realism. This seems like a newscast, a real event. And that's what is so scary about this movie. It seems completely real, as if these events could happen. Hitchcock caters to the imagination, his brand of fear rooted in emotion, not visuals.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's classic black and white tale of passion and horror was revolutionary for the time, and consequently has spawned a slew of imitators. None of these emit the intensity so easily shown in Hitchcock's Psycho. There has even been a remake, a travesty to the original. In the spirit of honor, the 1998 film with Vince Vaughn should change it's name so it won't be associated with this 1960 gem.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was, and actually still is, a force to be reckoned with in this league. He is a force of nature. New horror movies come and go, and, aside from a very select few, are forgotten in a matter of months. Hitchcock as shown his staying power in the dog eat dog world of horror by creating not one, or two, but countless classics. The greatest of these, though, was unquestionably his little came changer called Psycho."

","Right off the bat the viewer is immediately mesmerized and engulfed in the film as it begins with classic, intense Hitchcock music which I really loved. Psycho has great camera-work, fitting music and perfect sound. I specifically like the car scene in the beginning when the camera seemed to be fixed on the hood of the car it just looked awesome. The music always fits the scenes throughout the film however, my favorite was probably the shower scene. There were pretty good effects in the movie as well like the rain scenes for example. I thought Janet Leigh was amazing; everything from her body gestures (for example the movement of her hands when she was originally driving and being followed by a car showing her nervousness) and just her overall sense of panic (when she's at the car dealership and is being watched by the cop). I really enjoyed the sound as well, especially in Marion's car ride after she changes cars and you can hear the voices of people the cop is questioning, etc. The film is incredibly suspenseful especially in the car ride when it starts to rain and she can't see anymore; you're on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen. The shower scene is an absolute classic. It's so real yet at the same time so fake, you never even see her getting stabbed and the lack of blood was a little unrealistic. I felt like the only other two scenes that lacked some realism was the staircase scene, and the fact that there was conveniently a swamp right across the motel for Norman to dispose of cars and bodies. The lighting in the film was also really good with a balance of light and dark scenes. Overall, the movie is pretty good and it has its twists and is a little creepy and scary at times. However, in the end, I honestly don't feel like this movie deserves #22 on the top 250. I think The Shining, even though it was 20 years later, tops this movie in the ""horror scale"" but that's just me. Regardless, this is definitely a classic and a great movie."
"Ashes_fayded","10","1","2","27 March 2008"," Technique
","The whole movie, in my opinion, was very well thought out. Alfred H. began the uses of bringing the viewer into the show, rather than having them just view it. The scene in the movie where Norman Bates (playing his mother) begins to stab the woman in the shower is most interesting to me. Not because of the great sound effects but the set up itself. When Norman begins to stab the woman, notice how he holds the knife, notice how he stabs downward. It is statistically known that when men stab with a knife they hold it in such a way where they stab upward. Women on the other hand stab downward. I like to think that Hitchcock was genius enough and thorough enough to add this technique into the movie. Norman was dressed as his mother, therefore, was in complete character to stab like a woman."

","I had always avoided watching Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho due to its age and how our media has ridiculed its famous shower scene for the past forty years. I just thought I would not be able to take it seriously. However, as I was watching it, I was fully immersed in its world and I couldn't look away. <br/><br/>Many criticise it for its somewhat slow pace, I supposed that's to be expected from my generation, who are used to watching quickly paced Michael Bay trash. But I didn't find this film to be terrifying like many believe it is, though I suppose that's because I don't carry that nostalgia of having grown up with this film and also because when it was first released, it was the first if it's kind. ""Slasher"" films had scarcely been done in 1960, but now there are at least two released each week. <br/><br/>The lighting in Psycho is terrific; it really made me uneasy in the scenes in which Norman Bates was talking to Marion Crane because the lighting is so atmospherically creepy, especially in relations to the shadows the stuffed birds emitted. Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job at building suspense as well. I was on the edge of my seat up until the shower scene, it felt like the climax, halfway through the film, and things sort of trailed afterwards I find. Anthony Perkin's acting abilities really impressed me, how he could easily switch between his multiple personas all the while still showing us that there is a crazy man behind all his facial expressions of friendliness was fantastic. <br/><br/>The score was extremely well written and the composer really connected the visuals to the music in a way that made the viewer uneasy. However, the actual killings weren't well executed in my humble opinion, they felt more unintentionally comedic than frightening, and I'm sure it wasn't Hitchcock's intention for viewers to feel this way. But back in 1960, I'm sure audiences were scared out of their minds, but by today's standards, explicit gore is more common and the killings in Psycho felt a bit weak. <br/><br/>It was an excellent film nevertheless 9/10"

","When this was shown on UK TV as a classic for the first time in the mid '70's I considered myself a horror film fan and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Since then of course the Hollywood horror film has ""progressed"" to the stage where only perversion and gore are considered fit entertainment meaning most people today would sadly now probably equate Psycho to their ideas of Mickey Mouse. However it remains to me the best of its kind, and as violent and sleazy as I'd want anything to get. Will tomorrow's film buffs think the Saw movies of today laughably non-violent too?<br/><br/>Woman steals money from employer and scrams but unfortunately runs into homicidal maniac who polishes her off as she's getting second thoughts  about coming clean! Leigh's shower scene is justly famous – I guess Hitch the voyeur would have been tickled by the microscopic attention it still gets. There was even a stultifying gigantic slow motion frame by frame movie exhibition in London in 2006 by some idle Arthead extending the 40 seconds into 6 or 7 hours. Really worthwhile to have a stab at! When I was a kid Arbogast getting it at the top of the stairs startled me the most, although if you see it again you wonder how he could defy gravity while dying. That moment with Perkins biting his fingernails as the car stops sinking into the mud! It has a fantastic plot (in the best sense), with Hitch pulling out all of the cinematic stops he could think of, that keeps you hooked to the pervy climax and thoughtful ending. As with a few other films, such as Once Upon A Time In America, the music score is integral and vital as Hitch recognised – without Herrmann's zigzag music you might as well have been watching a (better) Corman.<br/><br/>If something is labelled ""classic"" it doesn't have to be good or feelgood as well, but Psycho certainly was the first two."

","""Psycho"" is undoubtedly among the tensest films ever created, if not the tensest. The film's story first introduces Marion Crane, but eventually leads to the Bates Motel, which acts as a vortex that sucks a host of characters in.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins gives an unforgettable nuanced performance as Norman Bates, and develops the character expertly with stutters and expressions as well as dialogue. Janet Leigh is equal to giving a critical performance as the anxious Marion Crane, who carries the first part of the film. The performances of Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and the supporting cast are also solid.<br/><br/>Other than some brief pauses, this film consistently has heart-throbbing tension. Bernard Herrmann's famous score is an important contributing factor in the near constant tension. However, importantly this film also has an underlying mystery which ensures that the film is fascinating as well as tense."

","Hitchcock's greatest film, an adroit blend of grizzly horror, crazy pop psychology and clipped social satire, is about a girl called Marion Crane, (Janet Leigh in a career-defining performance), who takes the money (her employers) and runs all the way to the Bates motel where ... well, if you haven't seen it and really don't know the plot, I won't spoil it for you, suffice to say at which point it becomes a movie about a boy called Norman, (Anthony Perkins in one of the greatest pieces of screen acting ever; like Anthony Quinn's Zorba, Perkins was doomed to play Norman for ever more).<br/><br/>Dismissed by serious critics at the time, (for it's violence, for it's cheap, tawdry milieu - talk about pulp fiction - and for what they saw as Hitchcock's degeneration into what now would be dubbed the slasher movie genre), it is now widely regarded as a masterpiece, a brilliant fusion of technique and content, drawing us first into Marion's world, then dismissing her as fatuously as Antonioni did with his heroine in ""L'Avventura"", before creating in Norman one of the most multi-layered characters in all cinema and finally 'explaining' the whole plot in a totally audacious coda. Even without the shock element the film repays repeated viewings and was needlessly remade by Gus Van Sant, virtually frame by frame and in colour, and which should be avoided at all costs."

","Quite simply the best film of all time. Tony Perkins gives one of the best performances from a male actor on screen. Sensational story, superbly directed by Hitchcock and excellent performances from all actors especially Janet Leigh. An amazing film for 1960, the story is the best horror of all time, the lonely hotel, the eerie house and the quiet mysterious deranged proprietor make the atmosphere sensational. Would have been very enjoyable to have seen this movie when it was first released as the story was unknown and to have the beautiful main character (Janet Leigh) killed so early and in the most vicious way in the shower was such an unexpected and shocking turn! The scene is one of the most famous in movie history but was not done by Tony as he was very squeamish and shy around woman! What began as a young woman running away with some money to better her and her boyfriends future turns into the murdering, deranged world of Norman Bates. You never know that Norman is the killer until the end, nor do you know he is mentally ill, but of course you always have this feeling! The film especially for its time is just so different, so wonderfully done and the story is made from amazing imagination. The film is much better than the book as the character in the book is not similar to Tony Perkins Norman. This was Perkins role of a life time and he does it amazingly, he was born to play this part and will always be here with us as Norman as the film will always be in the memory as it is the best film ever made.It has also influenced every horror movie since and continues to be influential to this day. RIP Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh and thanks for the movies,the performances and the entertainments you gave us."
"BonsterT","10","1","2","10 April 2006"," Psycho, horror movies, and metaphors in psycho
","Pitch perfect. Every single frame of this film was shot by a genius, and a Genius Hitchcock was. psycho still remains as one of the greatest horror movies of all times. Is it more then just a ""Hooror Movie."" I mean this term has been used very commonly but has been perspective very falsely. When people hear the word ""Horror Movie"" they think of butcher knifes into teenage beauties and screaming but no real meaning. In my opinion this is not true. Throughout history, horror movies have had many metaphoric and subtle yet deep meanings. Even the goriest as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is not just a movie about a guy in a mask chopping up teenagers. <br/><br/>Now, about Psycho, this movie is very interesting. Starting with a plot about a young woman, Marion, who steals forty thousand dollars (More like 400 thousand now according to inflation) to have enough money with Sam, her lover, and live with him. When she gets passed the salesman and policeman she creates other people's conversation in her head as she heads off in the Bates Motel.<br/><br/>As the viewer is interested in Marions life a brand new character is introduced, Norman Bates. If you notice Norman is very persistent that she calls him Norman instead of Mr. Bates. Twice he corrects her. This, i feel, is him trying to separate from his mother. He feels so controlled by his mother he doesn't want to be Mr. Bates, which contains his mother's last name in it, he wants to be Norman, himself. Now, as they talk about being stuck in a trap, both of the characters have been trapped into a situation. Norman with his mother, Marion with her money. <br/><br/>Both characters have many similarities, split personalities, etc. And I think that is the main reason Norman felt such an attraction to her. Not because of her beauty and charm, but him and her connection. As she leaves he looks through a hole to watch her dress. (Notice what painting he removes from the wall, one depicting a rape) Here he watches her, like one of his stuffed birds, while she undress. <br/><br/>I notice both their names have a lot to do with their reasoning in the plot. Norman ""Bates"" as he is awaiting to be caught, and Marion ""Crane"" a bird she is to catch Norman. <br/><br/>Anyways, now Marion gets nude and takes a shower. Earlier she suggested returning the money so now the audience is nice and happy. As she is taking a shower, we notice a slight blur in the background. This blur turns into a maniac silhouette mother stabbing the young and innocent nude, blonde bombshell with her 12 inch long butcher knife. <br/><br/>What makes the shower scene so intense is not the loud, intense music but the shots, from down watching the knife coming at you, to the mouth of Marion screaming in terror while a the violin is screeching.<br/><br/>I have a lot to say, theme-wise about this film but then this will be too long, if you want to know give me a private message and I will send you all my reasoning for many lines."
"kkipple","9","1","2","5 April 2006"," High suspense!
","I am 23 years old and have just gotten around to watching ""Pyscho"" for the first time tonight. Gave me the chills. Very few movies are able to do that, so this is high praise indeed. All the praise you've heard about this film is true. The acting (especially by Perkins) is excellent, the score unsettling, and the cinematography brilliant.<br/><br/>The story begins with two lovers in Phoenix sharing a quick romp during Marion's (played by Janet Leigh) lunch break. She returns to her job and is given $40,000 to deposit at the bank. She takes the money and returns to her home, then decides to flee Phoenix and run away with her boyfriend. She drives most of the night, and, tired, pulls in to the Bates motel for the night....<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, what follows is one of the best murder-thrillers I've had the pleasure to watch. Everything about this movie is handled well, and Perkins knocks it out of the park playing the friendly, stuttering, and finally chilling Norman Bates. I can only imagine how shocking this movie was when it was released in 1960 -- many of these themes had yet to be explored in cinema, and if the infamous bathroom scene is still a bit unsettling to modern viewers, it must have been truly terrifying at the time.<br/><br/>This film is Hitchcock at his finest.

"bbhlthph","9","1","2","28 March 2006"," What made Hitchcock Unique?
","I do not know which film has attracted the greatest number of IMDb user comments or ratings, but the database for Psycho currently includes a total of 511 comments, and there are 64,372 users who have rated this film at an average of 8.6 - giving it the #23 spot in the all time top 250 films. Hitchcock's Psycho was released in 1960, before most of today's cinema patrons were born, and today it is not often seen either in the few remaining repertory cinemas or even on TV movie channels. Younger viewers will never be able to experience the shock that this film created when first released. Seeing it on a home DVD can give no hint of its original impact in the theatre. In principle one might expect that by now this film would be nothing more than a fading memory for most of today's movie goers, but instead new comments on it are being submitted to IMDb on an ongoing basis and major film reviewers also continue to discuss it in numerous other publications. Such facts probably tell us all that we need to know about Psycho; but, even if they do not, there can be very little left to say to add to the 511 comments already published by IMDb.<br/><br/>Although I originally had no intention of adding any comments, I have gradually become forced to change my mind by the flood of copies, near copies and look alike films that attempt in one way or another to trade on the reputation of Hitchcock's masterpiece. We have an almost shot for shot remake with the same title (1998), as well as Psycho II (1983), Psycho III 1986, Psycho IV (1990), and American Psycho (2000). In total IMDb now lists 97 films with Psycho in their title and many of these clearly hope to exploit the reputation of this 1960 film in one way or another. There are others which also exploit it, sometimes even more blatantly, without trading on its actual title; even though they may be released with titles such as The Psychopath or Psychotic. It is difficult to comment meaningfully on most of these films before my comments on Hitchcock's original are on record, so here goes: Firstly I must take issue with those who imply that Hitchcock was the originator of horror films per se, or even that he was the first director who understood how to use a movie camera to create horror, suspense and tension. If you really believe this, go back and carefully look again at the early masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) in which the use of many techniques later so effectively exploited by Hitchcock can be found. Although Hitchcock actually directed one film in 1914, long before Dr Caligari was released, only part of this survives; and even his greatest fans would find it difficult to claim him precedence in the exploitation of these techniques. Hitchcock success was due to his mastery of cinematographic imagery combined with a very adept hand in using whatever technological or artistic developments were available to the maximum advantage. Most of his early work was carried out in the period when colour stock was not readily available or was very expensive and potentially unreliable. Until his reputation as a director was firmly established, Hitchcock was not free to make his films in colour and most of his early ones were shot in monochrome. But before he created Psycho he had filmed a long string of successes, in full colour, starting I believe with the period drama Under Capricorn in 1949. He had also experimented with one important film released in 3D format (Dial M for murder), and his choice of monochrome for Psycho was clearly made because he believed that it would be artistically more effective made in this way. This judgement was so accurate that even today when every movie goer has some familiarity with the story, it is almost universally agreed the visual impact from watching Psycho is far greater than that from a whole library of more recently made horror films.<br/><br/>Psycho did not however become the classic it is simply because it is a very effective horror film. The horrors of World War II and the fears associated with the development of the atomic bomb provided more than enough material to occupy most movie makers during the period immediately before 1960, but these horrors remained remote from everyday life in normal North American communities. Hitchcocks genius probably lay primarily in recognising this, and becoming the first major filmmaker to exploit the horrors that result when individuals with normally insipid personalities undergo some experience or trauma that leads them to behave in ways which those who know them can neither understand or comprehend. To see a Hitchcock film generally involves not viewing in a detached way what might happen in some remote and hazardous locale far away from home, but watching with mounting horror what might easily occur in ones own home community in the not too distant future. There are more and more directors who try to make horror films today, but unfortunately very few of them even understand this is why Hitchcock's films remain so much superior to their own.<br/><br/>Hitchcock has frequently met well justified criticism for unduly cavalier treatment of the novels that he filmed - he regarded a novel as no more than a framework on which to hang an often very different story created in a different medium, and for this reason his films often irritated readers of well loved books such as Buchan's ""The ThirtyNine Steps"". Although this may also apply to Psycho, we should consider how many readers today would be familiar with the works of Robert Bloch if his novel had not been filmed by Hitchcock?"

","What can I say? What can anyone say? Psycho is the greatest horror/suspense film classic of all time. Mr. Hitchcock, the master of suspense, gave 1960 audiences, a film they would never forget. And the film started an industry of slasher films. I don't even know if the master knew the impact it would have in film history.<br/><br/>Most of you reading this have seen the film, know the plot, and the surprise ending. So I won't bore you all with going over all of it. What I want to do is go over some of my personal feelings about the film, and my reaction when I first saw it on video, in the 80's. I was only a teen, but enjoyed classic movies. Especially this one.<br/><br/>WARNING AGAIN-SPOILERS, for anyone out there that have not been lucky enough to see this masterpiece.<br/><br/>The shower scene. I remember seeing the figure beyond the curtain, slowly move in. I put myself in the mind frame of a 1960 audience. When that shower curtain was pulled aside, and the figure appeared, along with the screeching music, I was terrified, but could not take my eyes of the screen. How brilliant was Hitchcock? To have his leading lady, star of the film, stabbed to death in the first 40 minutes of the movie. This left us, not knowing what to expect next. Anything could happen now. And a piece of info I learned on the shower scene. With all the brilliant editing, it had always been said, that the knife NEVER touched Marion's flesh. As I studied the scene in slow motion and frame by frame viewing, I found something. There's a shot of the knife going into the stomach of Marion. As I went frame by frame, I found, not only does the knife touch her stomach, but the tip of the knife penetrates the flesh. You can only see this if you have a VCR or DVD player, that can go frame by frame. Try it sometime.<br/><br/>Arbogast- The murder of investigator, Arbogast, almost gave me a heart attack. I thought he'd creep into the house, maybe get some answers from Mrs. Bates, etc. But I guess I need not say what happens when he reaches the top of the stairs. My dad told me how he saw Psycho in the theater, when he was a teen in 1960. He said the Arbogast murder made him jump out of his seat, with his heart racing for the next five minutes. He says it was the biggest scare of any movie he's ever seen. I agree.<br/><br/>Lila and Norman- This time I thought I had it figured out. Lila would get to Mrs. Bates, and get some answers. Wrong. When Lila goes down to the fruit celler, and finds the dead Mrs. Bates, chills ran through me. But then when Norman appears, dressed as his mother, with the insane look in his eyes, I got more chills than the flu. It finally sunk in. It all came together. That's what makes the film even more frightening to watch now. To know what went on in that old house, overlooking the motel. The madness, the horror, the evil. That's what went on in that house, years before Marion Crane stopped for the night. Pure madness. Pure evil. Pure insanity.<br/><br/>Well, that's about it on my comments. The film is the greatest horror/suspense classic ever made. If you haven't seen it for a while, set aside a night, and watch it again. You'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>V.M.<br/><br/>""We all go a little mad, sometimes."" <br/><br/><ul><li>Norman Bates</li></ul>"
"Acapulqueno","10","1","2","2 August 2005"," Disorienting in 1960
","Too many reviewers, I think, overlook one of Hitchcock's most effective and disorienting touches. When this film was released in 1960, Janet Leigh was a major star and John Gavin was an important leading man. Those of us who saw it then watched those stars, Leigh and Gavin, plotting a robbery. They seemed to be getting away with it when, with absolutely no warning, the top-billed star gets killed.<br/><br/>With the star missing, and the robbery apparently forgotten, the audience was left in the very upsetting position of having no idea as to the possible direction of the story or the identity of the star. In those days Anthony Perkins was little more than a minor juvenile who was listed in a supporting role. Now anybody who sees the movie, even before the first showing, knows that Perkins is the star, and that original disorientation cannot be recreated."

The movie is a masterpiece, no doubt about that, but calling it horror isn't exactly right anymore. Sure, in the sixties, this must have caused a lot of nightmares, but we are used to a lot more nowadays. Still, that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth watching anymore. It certainly is, I would even say more: this should be seen by everybody who is at least a little bit interested in movies...<br/><br/>Marion Crane, working in a real estate office, hasn't had too much luck in life so far. She only sees her fiancé Sam during her lunch breaks and they can't get married because they don't have enough money. Sam is divorced and still has to pay off his ex-wife's alimony. She feels like she is stuck in a situation she can't get out of, but then she gets a golden opportunity. When Mr. Cassidy, a rich oil tycoon, comes to the office to give $40,000 in cash to buy a house for his daughter's wedding present, Marion is trusted by her boss to bring the money to the bank. But instead of bringing it to the bank, she takes the money to start a new life. She packs up and heads for Fairvale to see Sam, but when the night falls, she ends up at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates. Norman is a nice young man, but he seems to be obsessed with his mother. After lunch, Marion returns to her room where she will take a shower, the last thing that she will do in her life...<br/><br/>As I said before, if you think this will be a horror movie like you are used to see, than you'll be disappointed. But if you are looking for a very mysterious and suspenseful movie, which will not let you go until the credits are shown, than this is the best you can get. It's not for nothing that they call Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense. Many have tried to copy his work in more recent times, but not one of them has been able to make a movie as good as he did. The script for this movie is absolutely brilliant and the plot twist is timed perfectly. But ""Psycho"" is not only a masterpiece thanks to the story. The acting and the camera-work are at least as memorable. While all actors did a very fine job, it is Anthony Perkins who was the most perfect one of them all. Somehow he doesn't give the impression of playing his role, it's like the actor and the character have become one in this movie. Believe me, that's something you will not find very often. The same for the camera-work. Hitchcock understands the art (and you can take that word quite literally) of not showing everything and still making you understand what exactly is going on. There is only one other director who I know off that was also able to say so much with so little and who knew so well how to work with close-ups and that's Sergio Leone (Not that I'm comparing both men with each other, because the movies that they made couldn't be compared either, but in my opinion these are the two best directors ever).<br/><br/>I really could go on for hours about this movie, but I believe that it is impossible to completely describe what this movie does to you. I'm convinced that this is a classic that should be seen by everybody. And for such a classic there is only one appropriate rating and that is 10/10. Nothing more, nothing less."

Multiple viewings are absolutely required to grasp the second meanings to all that is uttered: ""We all go a little mad sometimes"" ""A mother is a poor substitute for a lover""<br/><br/>With the acting, these lines make the blood curdle. A few problems with the editing, both otherwise one of the best suspense thrillers of all time. Hitchcock gets all the praise he deserves!"

","Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is the tale of a momma's boy. I guess you could say that Anthony Perkins's chilling portrayal of Norman Bates take the phrase momma's boy to an extreme. Just a boy and his mother living alone. Nothing wrong with that. At least Janet Leigh's character, Marion, doesn't think so. She's stressed, so she steals $40,000 and finds herself at the Bates' Motel where she has a nice dinner with Norman-and goes to take a shower. For it was there, in the shower at the Bates' Motel, that the most horrifying and controversial scene in horror movie history took place. And little did Marion know that that one shower made the movie what it is today."

","This movie can be simply described with one word : brilliant. It really is brilliant. Every element of this film is brilliant. The plot, the characters, the suspense, the atmosphere, and especially - the ending. It's a masterpiece, 'nuff said. 'Psycho' is without a shadow of a doubt the most scary and creepy movie i have ever seen. And it's not because of the gore, blood and guts. No way, you won't find that in this movie. The suspense and the incredible atmosphere is all this movie needs to be scary. Once again Alfred Hitchcock proved that he is indeed a genius. He wanted the movie to mess with your mind, and he succeeded. All i can say is this : people who didn't see this movie, do it ASAP, don't bother watching the re-make, just watch the original 'Psycho', allow it to enter your minds and play with them a little bit. <br/><br/>10/10"

","How can anyone not have an appreciation for this movie. It was this movie and it's director that changed the way modern films are made. This film raised the bar for a horror film, because it hit close to home and seemed not like some faraway fantasy but something real. The characters seemed to mirror real life, and it made you afraid to take a shower, afraid to turn of the light in your bedroom. This movie still inspires fear in this day and age of blood and gore, because it is a psychological horror film that play with the mind and not your digestive system. This movie represents the worst fears of many people, because it is a story that still shocks you even when you've watched it several times."

","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is one of my favorite films of all time and the best horror film I have ever seen.  Hitchcock does a great job of telling a story with a film, not necessarily pointing everything out to viewer, but keeping the viewer on their toes the whole time.  Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is the heroine of the story who steals $40,000 of her boss's money and flees the city.  Twists and turns abound as Marion is followed by a police officer for much of her trip neither her nor us knowing what he knows or why he finds her suspicious.<br/><br/>Eventually Marion meets up with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who runs a run-down hotel much like any you could find along any highway anywhere in the country.  What follows is one of the most famous scenes and events in motion picture history.  If you don't know yet, I won't ruin it for you.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is at his best messing with the audience's heads in this flick, in my opinion right up there with his stellar story in ""North by Northwest."" The film is a great thriller and a great horror film that takes you on a roller coaster throughout all the events that take place. <br/><br/>
Not much can top ""Psycho"" and I'm not sure if there is anything that could be done to improve it.  It is just that good.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","Part of a film's aging process is how it deals with the fact that after 40 years of spin offs and SNL skits, everyone already knows not only how the film ends but the key events as well. ""Casablanca"" is perhaps the greatest example of this. So what happens when a film becomes a modern fable with every scene recognized and many of the twists expected, especially in a film steeped so heavily in suspense?<br/><br/>Hitchcock's suspense is not simply based on the fact that the viewer doesn't know what's going happen, rather he turns those expectations into fears by limiting our scope to that of the camera. We all know THAT the investigator is going to be killed, it's in the trailer, but the exact moment is as much a mystery to us as it is to the victim.<br/><br/>I was intrigued as to how much parts of the film resembled an Attic tragedy since there is some great foreshadowing (Bates's hesitance to show her the bathroom) and characters who bring something to the table, but who are ultimately lacking. Bates's own downfall would need to be explored more deeply (the psychiatrist's speech doesn't cut it) to really merit such a label, which the now infamously terrible remakes attempted to explore.<br/><br/>What I find most fascinating is the shift, it's as if half the film is devoted to the aftermath and is exceeding the suspense structure that Hitchcock had created. It was daring and worked perfectly. It may seem not that the film was based too much on it's ability to frighten, but there are enough Freudian (albeit, relatively transparent) references as well as some clever arrangements of the camera and the props to keep today's sanest at the most, fascinated, and at the least, entertained.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 - An excellent film."
"davidbyrne77","10","1","2","17 June 2004"," The best, bar none
","If you're reading this, chances are you've seen the film - so there is little point describing the plot.  Okay.  Why do I keep revisiting this film, and why do I hold it to such a high regard?  Two words - acting and directing.  If this is the first 'real' horror movie, or the first slasher film, it is the best because it doesn't fall into the traps associated with later (and cheesier) horror films.  For one, all of the characters are 'real' and intelligent.  Sure, Norman Bates is weird, and Marion Crane is scared of him, but she's also sympathetic to his plight.  It isn't like he's waving around butcher knives and she says, ""Hmm, well, I think I'll go take a shower now!""  The conversation in Norman's parlour ends on a pleasant note (after having navigated through some very dark material) and she leaves to go prepare for bed - she couldn't have suspected what was about to happen or the audience would have suspected it too - the killing wouldn't have been a shock at all. Another thing about these 'real' characters.  Arbogast starts out hard-boiled, but his conversatin with Norman in the motel office seems so real to the point where I suspect that the dialogue was ad-libbed.  But of course Hitchcock wouldn't have allowed that.  But the dialogue doesn't sound scripted at all.  It's all in the delivery - very effective, we get to see that Arbogast is very good at his job - not an amateur at all.  When Sam and Lila go to the motel to do their own investigation, there is inspired dialogue that you wouldn't hear in a conventional horror film.  For one thing, when they enter the bathroom, the scene of the earlier carnage, Sam matter-of-factly remarks ""there's no shower curtain"".  It's just a coment, and neither character dwells on this miniscule of details - how could they have guessed that it was used to wrap Marion's body with before she was dumped in her car trunk?  As well, when Sam decides to occupy Norman while Lila searches the house, he says ""If you find anything, anything at all, don't stop to tell me"".  See?  Again, this wouldn't have occurred in a regular movie. The characters are intelligent and think out their actions before they act on them.  And while Lila is put in the position of choosing to either run out the back door of Norman's house or down the flight of stairs and into the basement, she chooses the stairs (famous horror movie mistake) not because she is stupid, but because she is curious and wants nothing else but to find out what happened to her sister. It's one thing to have a main character massacred halfway through the film, but it's a much different movie that show's the intricate clean up of the crime scene - the mopping up of the blood, the wiping of the floor, walls and bathtub, the careful disposal of the body, etc, etc.  While the murder last for less than 30 seconds, the clean up goes on for 10 minutes, and makes the scene far, FAR more disturbing.  Watching dutiful Norman clean up his 'Mother's' mess, looking at the blood on his hands, smiling happily as the car sinks below the surface of his backyard swamp...well, it reaches a level of 'disturbing' that most movies hope to achieve but never reach. And the last line:  ""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly....""  Enough said."
"psionicpoet","Null","1","2","2 June 2004"," A masterwork by the master of suspense
","Oft-cited as one of the top horror movies of all time, along with such fare as ""Jaws"" and ""Alien"", ""Psycho"" is Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known film. Why would this one film, made before the peak of his career, come to be the most famous? It's simple: Hitchcock was at his best when he toyed with audiences' expectations, and ""Psycho"" did that in a big way.<br/><br/>Viewers in the 1960's were not as jaded and suspicious when they waled into theaters as they are today. Now, people try to guess the endings of M. Night Shyamalan movies before the first hour is up, whereas the audiences of Hitchcock's time were more passive. Hitchcock took advantage of this quality by establishing a seemingly unstable character -- the titular psycho -- only to force us later on to question who was really most deserving of that dubious honor.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a struggling office worker, carrying on a relationship with a man she knows can't support her. Faced with these pressures and an opportunity to change them, she steals $40,000 from her workplace and goes on the run. She stops at the Bates Motel, a forgotten little establishment strapped for visitors ever since the highway was diverted elsewhere. The caretaker there is Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a charming young man who exudes an aura of strange intensity. It is there at the motel that the fate of Marion and her stolen money will be decided, by forces outside her control. The nature of those forces is not truly revealed until the last minutes of the film, in what was an truly outrageous ending for a movie of the 60's.<br/><br/>The performances of the main characters are very good, with special attention being paid to Anthony Perkins. Perkins never got another major role after his turn as the conflicted Norman Bates; his stellar performance in ""Psycho"" cementing him in audience's minds as a certain kind of character actor. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane acts just as you would expect a desperate and paranoid criminal on the run to. The supporting cast is capable, with the exception of Marion's love interest, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). He comes off as the typical, brutish boyfriend type, a one-note character with little to do other than exist in various stages of outrage.<br/><br/>The camerawork in ""Psycho"" is exceptional, especially considering the tools available to Hitchcock at the time. The long zoom in to the room where Sam and Marion are meeting is phenomenal for a 60's movie, as is the way Hitchcock stages the infamous ""shower scene"" that so scared the public. As in the aforementioned classic horror movies, Hitchcock deftly hides his ""monster"", his ""psycho"", allowing us only brief glimpses at it to let the tension and suspense to build. Perhaps the ultimate failing of ""Psycho"" is in its lasts minutes, when the unmasking of the true ""psycho"" leaves audiences over-saturated with information when they had so long been left in the dark. There is such a thing as ""too much information"", and the end of ""Psycho"" suffers for it.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" is and will continue to be remembered as the seminal Hitchcockian film, whether it is his best or not (I, for one, find ""Rear Window"" to be a better film). With the way Hitchcock played the movie-going audience of his time, it is little wonder why this is. As long as people crave an intelligent, suspenseful horror movie as a respite from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""-style gorefests, ""Psycho"" can be assured of its firm place in the cinematic cosmos."
"ygar72","Null","1","2","30 May 2004"," True Movie Making Mastery
","Perhaps the scariest movie ever made, Psycho proves that talented writing, editing and directing is the key to great movies. Alfred Hitchcock shows that gore and gratuitous sex are not needed to scare, excite and arouse viewers. Much like a beautiful woman who knows how to dress, it's what you don't see that attracts all the wonder. I guarantee Psycho will scare the heck out of anyone who watches it. They to remember is that you have to be the detective here. You have to figure out what exactly is going on inside the Bates Motel. Don't worry, the answers will come. In the meantime, your mind will be kept free of irrelevant (and untalented) scenes of blood, guts and lust so that you can figure it out."

"tombeaman","10","1","2","5 March 2004"," Considered Great Cinema for a Reason
","$40,000 and poverty.  Honesty and lies.  Infidelity, trust, and honor. Light and Darkness.  Black and white.  Life and death.  Freedom and traps. Sanity and psychosis.  Male and female.    Alfred Hitchcock studies each of these in Psycho.  In fact, it is the study of these dichotomies, these human conditions that make this thriller timeless and allow it to be considered a true classic.<br/><br/>Each of us has human fallibilities.  It is the struggle between the perfectibility of man and the imperfection of the human condition that creates the traps that Norman Bates speaks of.  In the foretelling rendezvous in the office parlor, Marion and Norman focus on the human condition and how we each weave our own tangled webs.  In this scene, Hitchcock clearly shows the fragile female, using sinister lighting and superior camera angles to make her appear vulnerable and susceptible. Hitchcock pits her against the male on the prowl who is conflicted with his own demons and trapped, seemingly, by a traveler's hotel that gets no travelers.  Marion is uncomfortable, alone, and on the run straight into a trap of her own making; Norman is uncomfortable, alone, and trapped on what may as well be a dead-end road.  Norman is more than a hotelier; he is clearly the nervous suitor, fetching homemade sandwiches to feed the lovely visitor.  Marion is registered under a false name, believing that the police will catch her at any moment.  If only she were so lucky.<br/><br/>When Norman reveals his sexual interest by peering through the hole in the wall, losing yet another struggle to be good, Marion is exposed at a time when each of us would be vulnerable: as we disrobe in an unknown environment, to prepare to rest from a long day.  As the characters lose the struggles that they are fighting, Hitchcock reveals more about ourselves than he does about Norman.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's sense of pace throughout the movie, starting slowly and building to a climax, with various false summits along the way, are combined with the musical score to keep the audience attentive.  We find ourselves rooting for the adulterous embezzler, even after her fall from grace, partly because of her decision to extricate herself from her trap while there was still time. Our desire to find out who done it, even after Marion is no longer a part of the story, is a credit to the skillful manipulation of the audience, and of the realization that any of us could find ourselves in a similar predicament, and we would want justice to be served.  <br/><br/>Thus Hitchcock is not just spilling blood to scare audiences, but to get us to appreciate our own contradictions and our freedom to choose which road we will travel, which trap we will set."

","Psycho is my all time favorite of Hitchcock, although I have to admit that I still haven't yet seen all his silent films. Hitchcock had just finished his television series and obviously had learned something new about BW film making. (And this from the director of many fine BW films including Rebecca.) Too bad that Psycho was his last BW film.<br/><br/>Be sure to watch the ""Lee flees by auto"" sequence with the sound turned off at least once to aid in understanding the enormous value of Bernard Herrmann's all string film score to the tension of the film. (the same should be done in the ""Stewart stawks Novak by auto"" sequence in Vertigo- again to Herrmann's score.) I think a compelling case can be made that Herrmann's association with Hitch brought his films to a new level during the Rope to Marnie period.<br/><br/>(Spoilers to follow.)<br/><br/>Keep an eye out for the foreshadowing here. Wiper blades in Lee's car and the knives on the wall (the only diagonal props) at the hardware store pointed at Arbogast's head from two different angles!! I haven't seen this mentioned in any of the literature about the film, perhaps because the knives pointing effect is so obvious that it is hard to call it ""foreshadowing"". <br/><br/>And don't miss the rope pulling the car out of the swamp and ""hanging"" Perkins at the end while the mother's skull/teeth are double exposed for a fraction of a second."

Many other good films to be sure, such as Vertigo, N/NW, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt, The Man Who Knew Too Much (34), 39 Steps, Frenzy, but this one has the most impact for me.

","""A boy's best friend is his mother.""<br/><br/> The great grandaddy of all the slash-'n-stab horror movies is also the best out of the whole bunch. Marion Crane, a young woman who works at a real estate company, steals a large sum of money from her office and makes a run for it. She arrives at the seemingly innocent Bates Motel, next door to an old mansion, run by young Norman Bates and his unseen, tyrannical mother. Norman is a friendly but quiet fellow who stuffs birds and runs the Bates Motel primarily by himself, and explains to her that his mother raised him alone, but has become deathly ill, and he now looks after her. When Marion asks why he doesn't leave his mother, he explains how he is psychologically chained to her. Later, when Marion goes back to her room to take a shower, she is stabbed to death by a mysterious figure in a dress, who we assume is Norman's mother. The next day, Norman, mortified by what his mother has done, puts Marion's body in her car trunk and buries it in a swamp. Later, a private detective comes searching for Marion, who meets his end when Norman's mother stabs him and pushes him down the stairs. Convinced that something is horribly wrong, Marion's sister, Lila Crane, and fiance Tom go to the motel to investigate. Lila is horrified when she goes into the basement and finds Mrs. Bates's carcass down there, still dressed in her clothes and wig. Suddenly Norman bursts through the doorm, about to kill her, when Tom wrestles him to the ground. When Norman is finally in jail, a psychiatrist explains to Lila and Tom about his bizzarre split personality. During Norman's growing up, his mother had found another lover, and Norman had gone insane and poisoned them both. He then dug up his mother's corpse from the cemetary and kept her in the house, pretending she was still alive, imitating her voice and conversing with her, dressing in her clothes, and pretending to be her. He developed two seperate personalities- one that was his own, and one that was his mother's. Because Norman was attracted to Marion Crane, ""his mother"" became jealous and killed her. Norman was completely oblivious to any of this happening, but when he was caught and arrested, his personality was completely erased and his mother's took over him completely. As he says at the film's end: ""They're probably watching me. Well, let them. Let them see what kind of person I am...I hope they are watching. They'll see. They'll see, and they'll know, and they'll say... 'Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly!'<br/><br/>As I said before, this movie spawned bazillions of imitators, some good, some bad, some truly horrible, but this stands above them all as the best horror/suspense movie of all time and Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. There are surprisingly few jump-out-the-closet scenes in this film- while it's true that the shower-stab scene, the death of the private detective, and the revelation of Mrs. Bates' corpse are effective in getting the audience's blood flowing, most of the movie's real substance occurs on a human level. Anthony Perkins is brilliant as Norman Bates, who goes from being cheerful, intimidating, and truly disturbed, and leads the audience through the film to its conclusion. There are times when the audience even feels sorry for him, in all of his madness, which is more than can be said about a buttload of modern movie serial killers. Hitchcock's master direction shines through, cramming every frame with symbolism, detail, atmosphere and mood. This movie is something that every single person on this planet should see, at least once. If you haven't yet, you should."

Maybe Hitchcock was a pioneer in his genre and important for future horror-film-directors. But this is not a reason to still love the film. Also worth mentioning is the acting (not realistic) and the technical aspects (the photography isn't that good) which for their time of course wasn't that bad, but compared to, for ex.

Maybe Hitchcock WAS a genius, but his films are outdated like Jesse Owens world-records."

","Whats the fuss about the movie anyways? I guess in it's it may have been a hit but when i saw it last year (2004) I was not impressed. The much talked about scary shower scene didn't even mildly startle me. Its a good movie but not sure why its considered a ""timeless classic"". <br/><br/>My Dad was full of praise before we even started watching it. There was this last scene where it was meant to be ""all revealed"". I kind of guessed that Norman's mom was dead earlier and again it wasn't scary. I don't find skeletons and corpses on screen scary but then maybe its me coz I never am scared at the movies.<br/><br/>The movie is basically good. Well directed, well acted and for its time it must have been technically sound too. But a classic? This seems a case of nostalgia and faddishness taking over in judging a movie than the movie itself. People seem to be rating ti based on what it meant to them than on if they like watching it NOW. If i have to see an old movie I would choose Streetcar Named Desire ."

I was utterly disappointed as this film was not so chilling as I had expected it to be.Psycho is more of a character study of some oddball persons.In the beginning Hitchcock takes us on a guilt trip of a woman who is in love with a married man.Funny thing is that both of them know that they cannot find any happiness in their so called secret love.Later on we are taken for a ride as this bizarre woman steals a lot of money and without any rhyme nor reason decided to leave her hometown.Now everybody knows what happens after that.Psycho is a film about matter of taste.

Yes I enjoyed it very much and I was thinking the whole way through. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman great, his friendly smiles, his comments his speeches ""We all go a little mad sometimes"") and just his general acting, the way he walked and moved. The story is Janet Leigh steals some money from her boss and takes off in her car to go to another city for the weekend. She stops off during a stormy night for a stay at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates. She gets into the shower in her room, but never comes out. Janet's family come looking for her, questioning all the places in the area, and they are curious about the Bates motel, for Norman isn't normal, and his loveable mother who sits in the house behind the hotel, isn't so loveable either. I long running time, but every second of it was needed and worth it. A must see!!"

","It took me 48 years to see this movie. Not a fan of the horror genre, I generally avoid them. But there have been a few that I've see that are really good. Psycho is a good film but time has passed it by, it is a movie out of time and just does not carry the punch it did in 1960.<br/><br/>Technology advances degrade much of technique used in this film. Audiences today are too sophisticated to be drawn into a film like this. Modern horror movies depend heavily on special effects and not on the subtleties used in Psycho. Being released in black & white is an advantage and helps give the film a feel of being the classic it is.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins is superb in the role as Norman Bates. Other than Martin Balsam and Perkins though, the rest of the actors deliver only average performances. The lines are rigid and often lame, again the effect of time passing the method by. Perkins however can take the worst role and give it smoothness.<br/><br/>I'll not reveal any spoilers but for a movie so referenced and so often used in comedy and serious pieces, it is impossible to see this movie today without knowing what happens to the main characters."
"invisibleunicornninja","4","3","16","22 November 2018"," Very boring.
","This movie is so bad that I almost would've thought that I watched the wrong movie if it hadn't been for the opening credits. Are all these positive reviews fake? Has no one that has seen this movie also seen a good horror movie? Are people really that easily manipulated? I don't know. I'm going to try to avoid any spoilers in my review of this mess, as people seem to care about it, but honestly there is so little to this movie that there isn't really anything to spoil.<br/><br/>The first hour of this movie is extremely boring. Everything is dragged out to pad the runtime. The entire opening scene doesn't even have anything to do with anything that happens after. Towards the middle of the movie, there is a scene in a shower that is so poorly edited and acted that it left me laughing hysterically. I'm pretty sure the scene was supposed to be scary, but honestly I can't see anyone being on the edge of their seat from a performance like that. After that scene, a detective character shows up, and he is kind of interesting, but he dies after less than 10 minutes, so it's kind of pointless. The movie remains mildly entertaining after that, but it's not amazing or anything.<br/><br/>The main thing that makes me hate this movie is the closing scene. The truth about the villain is revealed in an exposition dump that lasts like 5-10 minutes. The reason why I don't like it is because this could've been a very interesting plot point that could've been developed over the course of the movie, but is instead just relegated to a plot twist. If we had spent the movie following a villain like that, it would've been really interesting, or maybe even scary. You could say that they didn't do this because they were focusing on the victims, but this movie has no character development. No one grows over the course of the movie, and you don't learn about the personalities or backstories of pretty much anyone.<br/><br/>The filmmaking is ok. It's competant. Nothing special. The only interesting shot that stands out is one around a staircase. That's it.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really boring, pointless, and meandering movie with a wasted concept. The only reason why anyone is praising this is because people like Alfred Hitchcock. Or they're just easily scared? I don't know. I really don't recommend watching this one."

","Psycho starts in the town Tuscon in Phoenix where secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is given $40,000 to deposit by her boss George Lowery (Vaughn Taylor) but she decides to steal it, Marion drives off across California where she stops at the Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) & rents a room although it would turn out to be the last thing she ever did...<br/><br/>Produced & directed by Alfred Hitchcock Psycho has become one of the most well known films ever & it's iconic & often imitated shower sequence one of the most recognisable few minutes in cinematic history, does this automatically make it the classic the whole world & it's brother claim though? I liked Psycho for sure but I think it was a film of it's time, it was a groundbreaking film by all accounts but I wasn't even born when this was originally released & I would imagine Psycho would have more impact back then than it does now. The shocking plot twists, the way the star of the film is suddenly killed, the psychology behind Norman's motives & it's realistic approach to violence & murder probably made Psycho a groundbreaking cinematic event when it came out in 1960 but viewing it for the first time in 2007 it's undeniably a good film but one I didn't cream my pants over, unlike some it seems. I think it's a very good film, a film which I would call a thriller more than a horror & I thought it was entertaining but not outstanding. Because the shower scene is so well know it's not going to shock anyone the way it did back in 1960 & the other aspects of the story are so well known the same thing applies. Don't get me wrong as that isn't Psycho's fault in itself but, well I just knew what was going to happen & that can't be good.<br/><br/>Director Hitchcock does a great job here, he keeps the camera right in people's faces which gives it a claustrophobic feel. This is pretty stylish & is very atmospheric which the black and white photography really helps. He keeps things moving along, the character's & dialogue are good & it passes the time harmlessly enough. The violence is tame by todays standards.<br/><br/>According to the IMDb Psycho had an estimated budget of $806,947 which seems like a very specific number for an 'estimate' don't you think? It's well made with good production values throughout. The acting is also very good from all involved.<br/><br/>Psycho is a great film & I'm not saying it isn't but I didn't think it was the absolute classic many say it is & to an extent it's become a victim of it's own success as everyone knows the story already, definitely worth a watch all the same. Followed by Psycho II (1983), Psycho III (1986), the made-for-TV Bates Motel (1987) & Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) & it was remade virtually shot-for-shot in colour as Psycho (1998)."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","2","9","8 August 2005"," Phenomenal directing and a chilling Perkins make this a true classic.
","""Psycho"" is one of those movies everybody knows, over the entire world. It is regarded as a true horror classic and for a good reason. ""Psycho"" might not be a movie that scares you but it certainly is a 'creepy' movie with a chilling Anthony Perkins as the 'psycho' Norman Bates.<br/><br/>The directing by Alfred Hitchcock is truly masterful. He tells the story with lots of almost poetic like style of directing. There are many sequences that I truly regard as classic and renewing for the genre and no, I am not just only talking about the famous shower-scene. Also the role the characters play in the movie is really done superb. I mean, the character who we'll all think will be the hero and main character in the beginning, gets killed half way through the movie, how brilliant is that? This movie opened the door for more adult horror with layers. Before this most horror movies were movies with a supernatural story and monsters in it. This is one of the most important movies that made horror movies what they are today.<br/><br/>Another factor that makes this movie a classic is the 'villain' played by Anthony Perkins. He plays a truly chilling psychopath what makes his character a truly classic one.<br/><br/>Also the musical score only consisting out of stringed instruments by Bernard Hermann is a real classic. Most people will probably only remember the music used during the famous shower-scene, a shame because the rest of the score is also magnificent and deserves to be heard by everyone. Hermann and Hitchcock were truly both, two persons that were ahead of their time.<br/><br/>Basically it's pointless whether to recommend this movie or not, since this is a movie that literally almost every person has already seen.<br/><br/>One of the most influential, flawless, chilling, classic movie ever made.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"kannibalcorpsegrinder","10","1","3","10 November 2018"," A classic in every sense of the word
","After picking the perfect moment and taking her boss' money, a woman on the run stays at a remote motel to let the heat die down, but when she disappears and the private detective hired to find her does as well the woman's sister and boyfriend decide to check out the Bates Motel for themselves.<br/><br/>This is one of the best horror films ever made. The biggest impact featured here is the film's technical prowess since the Black & White cinematography is so gorgeous and so sparse in that we see so little that the suspense is just dripping off the screen. One of the best examples of this is the death of the investigating officer where he's just calmly walking up the stairs when we see a door open ever so slightly on the balcony unseen, and then the killer walks out and stabs him which causes him to fall down the stairs. The way that he falls is so creepy because he falls in such a supernatural way that it just sticks out in contrast to the rest of the material around it. It reaches the level of technical highlight just as much as the infamous shower scene that includes probably the most famous death scene in film history without violence or obvious nudity. The rest of the technical qualities here are just as impressive which really shows the genius was known for the time it was made where it is a sign of good filmmaking of giving the viewer just enough to give them a little jolt whenever it comes into question with the rest of the scene. Many people know of the relationship between Norman and his mother, and the very first time we know of her when he's talking about her in the parlor room is a perfect example of that which is one of the creepiest scenes by the way he's saying things and how he's saying them that something's off and yet he keeps an air of respectability that lends itself perfectly to his character and the relationship between them which is rather creepy. Even the motel where they're staying is like that. The dark interiors, the weird stuffed animals along the walls, and the secrecy that surrounds it is remarkable that most of the time we are wondering the secrets behind it. That allows the film to really get a lot of suspense out of so many scenes that it has the effect of being able to draw in a viewer and really highlights the fantastic work in the later half as the ruse is unveiled with the sequence down in the cellar. Armed with one of the finest and first twist endings in the genre, there's a lot to really love with this one that holds it up over the one main minor flaw. The biggest letdown from this one is the fact that the film does stumble a bit in the middle half where it slows down to a rather bland and sluggish pace as it focuses on her sister trying to find someone to go with her to look into the disappearance. These scenes don't really maintain the kind of impressive atmosphere or pacing that the rest of the film completely excels at. This one does slip down to a rather minor degree as the various starting points to the later half and it's not that enjoyable to sit through. As well as some obvious issues that are raised specifically about the time-period that don't apply to modern-day issues, there's not much wrong with this one at all.<br/><br/>Today's Rating/PG-13: Implied Violence and off-screen Brief Nudity."
"bankofmarquis","9","1","3","29 October 2018"," Perkins performance belongs with the All-Time great performances
","I'm sure all of you have (at least) heard of the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film, PSYCHO. And I'm sure most of you have seen (at least in part) the famous ""shower scene"". But when was the last time you really sat down and watched this film? It had been awhile for me and I walked away with the following impression:<br/><br/>PSYCHO is not all that scary, but it is suspenseful as heck with strong Direction by the ""Master of Suspense"" and very strong performances anchoring the front and back end of the film.<br/><br/>PSYCHO was billed when it came out as a ""Janet Leigh Film"". So, to give this review context, let's look at who Janet Leigh was at the time. Before shooting PSYCHO, Leigh was generally cast as the ingenue and/or love interest in mainstream fair such as LITTLE WOMEN, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD and HOUDINI (a modern ""comp"" to her might be someone like Anne Hathaway before she started doing ""edgier"" work). Leigh did show that there was more to her than just being an ingenue when she played the morally ambiguous wife of Charlton Heston's character in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL. This film (probably) gave Hitchcock the idea to cast Leigh in PSYCHO.<br/><br/>When 1960's audiences first saw Leigh on screen in PSYCHO, I'm sure that most of them were shocked for, instead of being the pure and wholesome ingenue and wife, she plays the entire first scene in a bra and slip. Her character, Marion Crane, is not morally ambiguous, she is morally corrupt - and when Leigh's character has a chance to act on her moral corruptness, she jumps at the chance. The rest of the first half of this film is Leigh trying to get away with her ""crime"". She is quite good in this part of the film and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (deservedly so).<br/><br/>And then...Anthony Perkins shows up.<br/><br/>We are about 45 minutes into the 1 hour and 49 minute film when Perkins' Norman Bates first appears on screen and an interesting thing happened - I couldn't take my eyes off of him. I was enjoying Leigh's performance but instantly pushed her aside (and to the background) when Perkins shows up. Without giving plot away, let me say that there is much, much going behind Norman's eyes and the performance by Perkins strongly suggests this, without going over-the-top or being melodramatic. It is a perfect blend of actor, character and performance and I was shocked that he was not even NOMINATED for an Oscar (Peter Ustinov would win for SPARTACUS). Perkins performance is one of the all-time greats with one of the most interesting and unusual characters - and portrayals - of all time.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for Perkins' and Leigh's strong performances have to go to Director Hitchcock who was at the height of his Directing powers (and power). From the ""get go"", you can feel the Director's hand in this film, building suspense from scene to scene and shot to shot, first with Leigh's character and, later, with Perkins. Both characters are trying to get away with something and Hitchcock pulls his camera in close to make a point - from a distance all seems good, but when you get up close, you can tell that things are very bad, indeed.<br/><br/>The filming of the famous ""shower scene"" is well documented and is a Master Class in film and editing. It is worth the price of admission on it's own - as is a scene on a staircase with Private Detective Arbogast, played by Martin Balsam. Hitchcock chooses to heighten the realism in this scene on the staircase by going a more esoteric route (rather than traditional filming of the events) and, one can argue, it doesn't belong in this film. Until, that is, you think about it and then it makes great sense and absolutely, positively has to be in this film in that way.<br/><br/>Another aspect of this film that begs to be mentioned is the Film Score by the great Bernard Herrmann - Hitchcock's regular collaborator. The music in this film punctuates the action on the screen - from the persistent beat and pacing of the opening credits music - driving the audience forward into the action - that does not let go, reaching it's peak and crescendo in the shower scene and then floating down gently like an animal catching it's breath after great activity.<br/><br/>Does the entire film hold up almost 60 years later? Almost...but not quite. Most annoying to me was the ""wrap-up"" scene at the end where a character spells out everything for the audience. As if we are not smart enough to ""get it"" - and perhaps the audiences in 1960 weren't.<br/><br/>But that is a quibble for a film that is a classic and is one that, if you have not seen (or seen for awhile), begs to be seen. Check out this film, not for the scares, but rather, the suspense that is generated by Hitchcock and his performers throughout. A GREAT entree into the world of Alfred Hitchcock films.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

It wasn't too bright or too dark and it outlined characters faces and the blood during the ""violent"" scenes. The camera was great when shooting at different angles. Especially in dramatic scenes, the camera would focus in and out of the scenes to add more flare to the subject and take long shots. I felt like the meaning behind the movie wasn't that strong because it was just a ""horror"" film. Behind it, though, there was definitely a hint of mistrust and deceit. It kind of showed that psychos are everywhere , no matter where you go and that you should be very careful in going to new places and with strangers because they could not be who they say they are.

","When one considers the fact that PSYCHO is based on the depredations of Ed Gein (by way of Robert Bloch), it's almost impossible to imagine that even as great a Movie Maestro as Alfred Hitchcock could turn it all into such a stylish and suspenseful masterpiece. But he does. (Let's not forget to give credit where credit is due: Robert Bloch is the man whose imagination transformed the ghoul Gein into Norman Bates; Stephano fashioned his scenario from the novel.) For those who aren't familiar with Gein, he was a cannibal necrophiliac who wanted to be a woman- his mother in the book and in the movie, but female, period, in real life. He would actually dress up in a ""suit"" made of a woman's skin and dance around his deserted farmhouse at night. (I've always loved the song DANCIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT by King Harvest, but whenever I think of Ed Gein these days- which ain't often-, I think of that song...) THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE was also based on Gein's atrocities and comes closer, I think, to the real horror of what he did, but Bloch and Hitchcock first separately and then combined turned it into one of the Truly Great Murder Movies- one for the ages."

","Still considered a ground-breaking film today, Psycho shocked audiences when it was released back in 1960 because they had never before seen a graphic murder scene shot with such brutality, intensity and at the same time discretion. Though the infamous ""shower scene"" does not reveal a plunging knife nor a single bare breast, it still manages to be unsettling nonetheless due to its sheer realism and plausibility. The plot of Psycho comes with many twists and turns and is pretty unpredictable seeing as how it starts out very simple. A Phoenix secretary steals forty thousand dollars and takes off. But when she runs into Norman Bates, the peculiar owner of a small motel who is very attached to his invalid mother, things get complicated. The acting in this movie is nothing less than phenomenal. Janet Leigh does not have a large role but still was able to make the most of it. As previously stated, the acting is phenomenal-in the case of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, a little too phenomenal. I felt he truly could have been a great actor-had it not been for his disturbingly convincing performance in Psycho. He makes you believe he really is a psychopath. Perhaps one of the most disturbing moments in the film is when he stares directly at the viewer, his eyes glowing with evil mischievousness. <br/><br/>Psycho is a disturbing but interactive film that tests the viewer's knowledge. Shot in gritty black-and-white, the cinematography only adds to the unsettling nature but it also adds to the artistry of it as well. When one tallies up its great acting, haunting atmosphere and twisting plot, it is easy to see why Psycho is ranked amongst the greatest films ever made."
"askewglasses","9","1","3","19 August 2013"," Must be Psycho for not Loving It
","Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest."
"pixrox1","10","1","3","6 August 2013"," PSYCHO is nearly a perfect movie . . .
",". . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to ""humor"" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 ""Making of"" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a ""necessary evil,"" feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the ""Roaring Twenties"" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum ""cooling off period"" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of ""being humored"" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!"
"zensixties","8","1","3","14 February 2013"," Great film making, but lets face it: this plot and dialogue are weak
","Psycho is so overpraised as the greatest horror film of all time that it's hard to break the trend, but here goes. One obvious weakness is the utter ridiculousness of Norman's insanity. I mean, come on! He becomes his mother after he kills her? That would be the only case in all of human history I believe. And the psychologist figures the whole thing out after like 10 minutes with him?<br/><br/>The other weaknesses concern the whole film prior to arrival at the Bates Motel. We get a mediocre beginning with Janet Leigh and that guy in the hotel room; I don't find her attractive--sorry. Why is it exactly they were keeping the affair secret? Who knows and who cares. <br/><br/>Then some rich Texan comes in, Hitch's non-actress daughter has the part and says ""I declare!"" He says ""I don't, that's how I get to keep it."" Cheap dialogue really. Then Leigh steals the money and drives away, then buys a new car which does nothing, but raise the suspicion of a cop and car dealer? This film would be completely forgettable if not for the great Anthony Perkins, the great film soundtrack, and a great director.<br/><br/>To drive my point home, imagine the film without the soundtrack and cutting out the Anthony Perkins scenes. What have you got left: mediocrity!"

","'Psycho' is one of the most iconic films of all time, and this film had a huge impact with an audience, and it has been considered one of the best films ever made. It is the sort of film that haunts us with its gradual build-up to disaster, excellent cinematography, and its ability to allow the user to imagine the horrible events taking place. (The creepiness of this film is in the stuffed animals at the beginning of the film, the huge house upon the hill, the darkness of the night, and that unforgettable and iconic shower scene.) This film is the master of suspense with some great camera angles. Mr. Bates ascending and descending the staircase in the empty, creepy house with the body of his mother heightens the horrors. It is easy to put oneself in the place of the characters. This film will keep one engaged with the constant action and the mystery. There's even a little element of humour and disgust. This is definitely one of the best films of all time. Everyone should see this at least once in their life."
"kevinmanf","10","1","3","13 March 2006"," A disturbing masterwork
","In most films we participate as passive voyeurs. Not in Psycho which is a brilliant study of suspense, horror, paranoia, mood and evil hidden under a mask of innocence. From its very beginning to its shocking and ironic ending, we have Alfred Hitchcock directing the audience and in his own words, playing the audience ""like a piano""  leading us exactly where he wants. To call this a chilling masterpiece is a cliché but it is no further from the truth.<br/><br/>The film is filled with unforgettable sequences. From Marion's (Janet Leigh) escape always with the company of the police that seems to be following her  a great way of sinking us into Marion's paranoia to her arrival at Bate's Motel where we the audience believe are safe from all danger; the conversation Marion maintains with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) about his hobbie as a taxidermist; and of course, the shocking shower sequence. The horror of this scene comes from the fact that it takes part at a moment of extreme intimacy and vulnerability and also due to Hitchcock's craftsmanship: the screeching violin and the camera which does not focus on the wounds the stabbing causes but rather, leaves it to our imagination which is much more effective than any graphical representation. But even before we arrive at the famous Bate's Motel, where the key events take place, Psycho already feels disturbing perhaps because we fear for Crane's plight, perhaps because of the chilling score, perhaps because we fear the police's intentions, perhaps because Hitchcock gives us minimal vistas except those of suspicion therefore we feel trapped in Crane's guilt and paranoia. Whatever the reason, Psycho has already established itself as a film that is more than anything else about our paranoia and uneasy feelings.<br/><br/>Another key element is Hitchcock's character control. We never expect the death of Marion (the film's main character) so early on. But what could have been a dangerous move is handled brilliantly as Hitchcock shifts our sympathy from Crane to Bates so that when he attempts to sink he care, we fear for him (we know that if the car does not sink we will be jabbed by fear and we also feel that Bates is too innocent a character, to suspicious a person that he would inevitably be accused of the crime if the car is discovered), just as much as we feared for Crane. The performances are worthy of mentioning especially Anthony Perkins who embodies innocence but at the same time, a disturbing presence. The ending, a close-up of Crane's assassin is chilling, highlighting this character's evil.<br/><br/>The genius of this film is that it is always in full control of the audience, always feels visceral and chilling. We are lead to feel disturbed and uneasy even when there is nothing visible on screen to disturb us."
"breezybrisbane","10","1","3","11 March 2006"," Now that is what I call a movie!
","I agree with other posters that this is film, pure and simple. No social messages, no poignant emotion, just entertainment, plain, pure and simple. It is the type of horror film only the likes of it's fine British director could handle. Anthony Perkins gives a fine performance, and its too bad that this role is what ultimately ended up stereotyping his career. I found his character to be excellent, phsyco but not ""mad"". <br/><br/>As for Janet Leigh, well, lets just say I was kind of happy she died early on. The shower scene lives up to all it's expectations.<br/><br/>If you want to see real Hitchcock, see this."
"pyrocitor","10","1","3","10 March 2006"," The grandfather of all slasher films
","Master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock's already tremendously successful career reached arguably a new height with Psycho, a powerhouse film way ahead of its time (the filmmakers even seemed to realize this fact; the film's tagline was ""A new- and altogether different- screen excitement!!!"") which inspired and pretty much pioneered the slasher film genre. It's the story everyone knows, with innocent worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) running from the law with a stolen $40 000, making the mistake of checking into a certain infamous motel along the way, run by a quirky and antisocial proprietor (Anthony Perkins) and his mysterious, never seen mother. <br/><br/>The key to Hitchcock's classic as opposed to the hundreds of generic garbage teen slasher films theaters are unfortunately bombarded with every year, is the suspense element. Hitchcock proves his genius by realizing that the key to truly inspiring fear in the hearts of an audience is by showing less rather than more. Instead of having horrendously gory deaths every 30 seconds we have a single, infamous shower stabbing, which becomes all the more chilling by how we as an audience have to essentially imagine exactly what is happening. <br/><br/>What is truly frightening about Psycho is the eerie tension constantly building throughout the film, reaching a point of almost feeling tangible it is so vivid. This is of course helped by the truly creative and innovative camera work, representing the film's spirit of being way ahead of its time. Psycho is perhaps one of the most cleverly shot films in cinema history, which only amplifies the feeling of dread throughout, ably backed by Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.<br/><br/>The film also boasts some rather spectacular acting, especially for its time period. Anthony Perkins is nothing less than superb in his infamous performance as the eccentric, socially awkward Norman Bates. Perkins creates a genuinely believable character, who is all the more unsettling and yet captivating by how strangely realistic as a real person he is. Janet Leigh also helps maintain the excellent tone for the movie with her iconic performance as on-the-run Marion Crane. Vera Miles also gives a strong performance as Lila, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam is great as the Detective searching for Marion.<br/><br/>Psycho can be considered as nothing less than a classic, withstanding the test of time and coming off as just as masterfully made and honestly tense and frightening to this day. Fueled by excellent acting, and helmed by a master of the craft, Psycho is now one of those movies which would be considered almost essential viewing. Simply put, if you have yet to see this movie, don't continue to miss out!<br/><br/>-10/10"

One rainy night, she takes refuge in the Bates Motel, run by the kind, young Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who also takes care of his ill mother. This sets off a series of horrific events when Marion, Sam, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and a detective (Martin Balsam) try to discover the secrets of the Bates family.<br/><br/>my thoughts: There is really nothing new to say about PSYCHO that hasn't been said already. It's just the perfect thriller. It has a great script, beautiful directing, well developed characters, and much more.<br/><br/>The characters are greatly casted. Anthony Perkins definitely portrayed one of the horror genre's best characters in Norman Bates - a kind, handsome young man who has a lot of dark secrets to hide. Janet Leigh is a very classy actress and it works in the role of a woman who has done some pretty bad things but she is still sympathetic enough to care about. Vera Miles, Martin Balsam, and Simon Oakland also do great while John Gavin is a bit wooden. Not as bad as people say but still wooden.<br/><br/>The setting is also great. A simple, deserted motel with a large, dark, and creepy mansion just over the hill from it. The Bates Motel is a lot like the character of Norman himself. Seems simple and looks nice, but has terrible secrets behind it. The motel and mansion are just like characters in the film.<br/><br/>The music is very suspenseful. I don't think any horror score can match this other than CARRIE. The sound effects that come with the knife make the death scenes much more effective, as the same sound did 16 years later when Carrie used her powers.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock is a great director. The shower scene, the staircase scene, and the finale in the cellar alone are reasons to see this film. I envy anyone who hasn't seen it.<br/><br/>Definitely check it out, it belongs in any movie fan's collection."

The mystery surrounding Bates and his mother is now known as one of the biggest shocks in cinematic history, along with a certain shower scene that just about everybody remembers.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock uses lighting and camera angles, along with creepy atmosphere, to give us one of the best horror movies ever. The movie is black and white, but this only adds to the scariness of the film. This movie also contains one of the best musical scores of any horror film.

"boy-13","10","1","3","25 August 1999"," ....ultimate Hitchcockian masterpiece....
","This ultimate Hitchcockian masterpiece is an artful, suspenseful, beautiful, and horrifying thriller! So many taboos of the era were abolished by this film - violence, brief nudity, transvestism, and (gasp!) a flushing toilet. While all of this has lost its shock value by today's standards, the overall grasp this film has on the viewer will never be outdated. Considered by many to be Alfred Hitchcock's greatest work, this is undoubtedly one of the highlights of film history.<br/><br/>The story begins in Phoenix, Arizona, with a woman named Marian Crane (Janet Leigh) and her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in a hotel room enjoying an afternoon tryst. They are in love, but the problem is that Sam is married and can't afford to get a divorce. No problem, actually. Marian happens to work at a bank. So, later, she steals a bundle of cash ($40,000) and heads off to Los Angeles where Sam lives. During her road trip, this blonde beauty tires and checks into the Bates Motel. There, she meets the odd, bird-like hotel proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She converses with Norman in his scary, bird-filled parlor and soon comes to realize the strange relationship he shares with his mother. Soon, out of left-field, Marian is slashed-off in what is probably one of the most famous scenes in movie history - the wet and bloody shower scene. This was certainly a film first - the demise of the main character halfway through the picture (it was actually an experiment by Hitchcock to gauge audience reaction). Now what? Well, an investigator (Martin Balsam), Sam, and Marian's sister Lila (Vera Miles), all converge on this house of horrors to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Marian. What will happen? Who will survive? It's all too suspenseful and fun.<br/><br/>The acting is on a tremendous level and Hitchcock's direction, as always, is just awesome. Plus, it is impossible not to love the violin-drenched soundtrack by composer-extraordinarre, Bernard Herrmann. ""Psycho"" is a historical event. Not only because of the top-notch production itself, but because of the facts behind the film. For instance, did you know that the infamous shower scene that only lasts 45 seconds, took Hitchcock one week to film to his satisfaction? It's interesting to note, too, that actress Miles was chosen for the role of Lila as a consolation prize of sorts. See, Hitchcock had cast her as the lead in 1958's ""Vertigo"", but she became pregnant just before production. Therefore, Kim Novak got the dual role. But Hitchcock didn't forget about the lovely Miles, giving her a role in one of the most famous movies ever. Also, ""Psycho"" was a work of secrecy and surprise. Hitchcock bought the original novel by Bloch, from Bloch, for $9,000, anonymously. Then he bought as many copies of the book that he could find, just to keep the end a secret. Then, when ""Psycho"" was released in theatres, Hitchcock had strict instructions with the theatre owners not to let anyone in the film late, since Leigh's role was so short and she was billed as the ""star"". This is a terrific film in every aspect. No wonder ""Psycho"" was listed by the American Film Institute, in 1998, as one of the 100 Greatest American Films.<br/><br/>Hitchcock cameo: He is the man in the cowboy hat standing on the sidewalk outside Marian's office."

What great acting by Perkins. His delivery of such lines as ""We all go a little mad sometimes... Haven't you?"" with the chuckle in the middle.

"gbrumburgh","10","1","3","28 April 2001"," Hitchcock's landmark horror that led to a slew of slayers.
","This is the 1960 culprit that catapulted the horror film to an altogether new and gruesome plateau.  It's the ship that launched a thousand blood-spurting imitators, although that was never Alfred Hitchcock's intent. Unfortunately, 90 per cent of those writers and directors inspired by his unprecedented work in ""Psycho"" never got past the initial primitive thrill of seeing on-screen violence for the first time.  They didn't ""get"" the homework that went into this brilliantly macabre masterpiece.  Just what DID make the infamous shower scene and ""Mother"" Bates' stairwell confrontation so shockingly memorable, other than providing front row forum seats to the carnage?<br/><br/>With ""Psycho,"" the master of suspense would tempt us to enter the intricate, insidious mind of a violent, psychotic killer, something he surely tampered around with in ""Strangers On a Train.""  Hitch himself created the essential tool kit for modern day terror  implementing story, set-up, characterization, photography, camera technique, mood and music in order to weave an elaborate spider's web that would playfully entice, then seduce his intended victim, the audience.<br/><br/>Norman Bates will forever be enshrined as THE infamous poster boy of cinematic psychosis.  As expounded by Simon Oakland's psychiatrist in the last reel, Norman was an isolated, terrified, severely undernourished man-child consumed by a hideously abnormal fear of change.  In the end, the self-suffocating Norman lashed out like a wild, kicking, screaming child at a world he never knew or understood.  Smart enough to distance himself and the Bates Motel as far from the highway of humanity as possible, it still wasn't far enough.  For somewhere down the line, fate, coincidence, or maybe just a primal need for human contact, would inevitably lead a John Doe (or Marion Crane) to his door.<br/><br/>The most compelling scene for me is when the verrrrrry brave Lila Crane sneaks into the decrepit Bates' house behind the motel to investigate her suspicions as to sister Marion's disappearance.  After coyly tormenting us throughout the first three-fourths of the movie, Hitch finally lets us in on the equally decrepit world of Norman Bates and his mother.  Norman's bedroom holds the key elements to his enslaved childhood.  The pathetic little bed with his careworn stuffed animal nearby, the little phonograph with Beethoven's ""Eroica"" record in place.  It's such a private, eerily invasive moment that one feels guilty for possessing this natural Peeping Tom' curiosity.<br/><br/>Seeing Norman huddled up looking maniacally serene, immured within the confines of a ""new"" prison and armed only with a security blanket, you know that the poor innocent fly that lands on his hand, a fly he promises to respect, will never see the light of day again.  And neither will Norman...despite the inferior sequels that tried to alter his obvious fate.<br/><br/>We can only thank Anthony Perkins for sacrificing a brilliant, promising, and highly versatile film career after bestowing upon us the most definitive, sympathetic creature of violence ever to assault the eyes. There will never be another one like him.  Janet Leigh, one of Hollywood's biggest, fluffiest stars at this juncture, graciously cut short a dramatic ""starring"" role and instead offered us the screen's most tragic golden girl of all time.  Both of their sacrifices were rewarded with film immortality.<br/><br/>I was introduced to ""Psycho"" at the age of 9.  My older brother and I had the option one night of seeing ""Psycho"" or Jerry Lewis' ""Cinderfella"" at the local Riviera Theater.  I wanted Jerry Lewis but my older brother had clout and, of course, won out.  Needless to say I lost a good portion of my innocence (and my hair!) that night, succumbing to the frequent nightmares and shower traumas that obviously accompany such a youthful experience.  Oh, yes, there is that abnormal fear I developed of screeching violin strings...<br/><br/>On a bright note, my faith in today's horror suspense was restored after experiencing the bravura Shyamalan-directed ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" a raw, but creepy and effective little thriller filmed on a pittance.  Both took stock of Hitchcock's tool kit for terror.  ""Blair Witch"" proves once again that the real horror of shock films today lie not in its low-grade budgets, but in its third-grade scripts and mentality.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock opened our eyes in awe, wonderment and, yes, horror.  But never in disgust.  And he never sacrificed his story or characters for the sake of shock.  We can only apologize for all the gratuitous ""Friday the Thirteenth"" and ""Halloween"" dreck that rose out of his ashes."

The murder scene in the shower is the BEST murder scene I have ever seen in my life.  And believe me, I have seen loads of movies to choose from.  The murder scene made Argento's murder scenes look like Sesame Street.  There was an editing of a scene which showed nudity, many people complained about this but I salute the MPAA for cutting out the nudity scene.  This movie is pure, it does not need even a flash of nudity.  I want you all to understand one thing, recently they remade this movie with a newer cast, more money, color, etc. and they could still not come close to touching the power Psycho had.  It is not just because it's a remake either, it's because something was completely missing. This movie is unbeatable in its field."

","before i first watched psycho, i had a vague idea of what it was about. actually i didn't. i knew that janet leigh got stabbed while she was taking a shower. that's all. so i knew nothing, because that's public knowledge. like if a psychiatrist says psycho you say shower. well it was ten at night in the height of summer and i was laying down to go to sleep when my mom said scott come here! i went down to the living room just in time to see the black and white almost generic credits roll by. i thought what is this? my mom wouldn't tell me so i just sat down. as soon as i saw janet leigh i knew what it was. so before the movie progressed too far, i got some popcorn and pop and strapped myself in for the ride. i didn't know what i was in for. as soon as leigh turned on the water, i looked at my mom and she was asleep. i woke her up, knowing that there was no way in heck that i was watching the first ever graphic murder scene complete with the screeching violins of bernard herrman alone. and i thought the shower scene was bad! the second murder and the final attempted murder at the end resulted in strewn popcorn all over my living room floor! i was scared out of my mind. just when i thought i had made it through this roller coaster of a movie, i saw anthony perkins in a jail cell at the end thinking. it wasn't bad until norman looked down at a fly crawling on his hand. this was the scariest part in the movie i think. so now its twelve thirty in the morning im the only one awake in the house and my room is upstairs and to the left. i wasn't going to bed. the only fault with this movie is that i think it ruined anthony perkins career because he never was able to escape norman bates. but this movie is incredible. excellent twists in the plot, first rate soundtrack, an excellent cast, and of course, the masterful direction of hitchcock make this film one of two perfect films that i have seen in my life (the other one being Remember the Titans)"

","Not many people know it, but Robert Bloch loosely based his original novel on the story of Ed Gein, a farmer of Plainfield, Wisconsin who collected body parts from the cemetary and who killed two women. Almost too weird to be true, Bloch sensationalized the original story and created a top notch horror story which became a movie that started a whole new series of slasher and killer movies. Psycho is a masterpeice in direction, style, acting, writing, plot and execution. The story centers around that of a lovely, would-be female thief who absconds with a lot of money. The movies rotates around the movie's main character like a pin wheel before shooting in and absolving the story with a climax and one of the single most recognizable visuals in movie history. Anthony Perkins is a vulnerable but likeable maniac with a character, a far cry from his hockey masked and claw handed progeny. Janet Leigh proves how the shower is the most vulnerable spot for a person to be, and Martin Balsam creates a believable detective far from the trench coat gumshoes in the old nickel and dime stories. Spoofing the role later in the flick, Silence of the Hams, he proved just how far this movie has seeped into the consciousness of movie-goers."
"jaspervanzyl","10","1","3","4 March 2001"," The best film of all time!
","When Alfred Hitchcock started to direct this film in 1959, he could have had no idea that a film starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh could bypass the brilliance of his films starring James Stewart (Vertigo, The Man Who Knew too Much and Rear Window). But how wrong he was...<br/><br/>""Psycho"" went on to become the highest grossing black and white film of all time, (In a time when colour films were already popular) the highest grossing horror film of all time and the highest grossing Alfred Hitchcock film of all time. The film made Anthony Perkins a superstar, but sadly, this was more harming to his career than uplifting, as the movie-going public always have (and always will) only seen him as Norman Bates, and nobody else. This was concurred as Perkins never again made a film of real value, but in 1983 ""Psycho 2"" was a huge hit for Universal Pictures. Janet Leigh on the other hand, went on to make a few well done done films in her respect.<br/><br/>
About the film: Anthony Perkins' performance as the stuttering Norman Bates is in my opinion the greatest film performance of all time. His nervous, boyish acting style brings a simple charm to the character, and he even succeeds in creating a sympathetic approach from the public. He even succeeds in hiding his character's madness, and couldn't do it better. Janet Leigh is perfect as the thief, and you even have more sympathy for Norman as for Marion. The rest of the cast, (John Gavin - Sam Loomis; Vera Miles - Lila Crane; Martin Balsam - Milton Arbogast and John McIntire's Sheriff Chambers) are all as good as it gets, but no one matches Anthony Perkins performance. Sorry to say, but John Gavin is miscast. He looks too gentle, too moral to ever cheat on his wife. This is the only bad thing about this cinema classic.<br/><br/>The classic shower scene not only created a single shock, but a film memory to haunt for generations to come. Alfred Hitchcock filmed this scene with great care and delicacy. You can sense this with the fact that not a finger is out of place, and even Janet Leigh still showers in fear.<br/><br/>I was disgusted when I learned that Perkins wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award, because he should have won it! He wasn't nominated for ANY prize of ANY kind, and to crown it all, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. Well deserved, I should think, but Perkins was the real reason that the film reached such success, not Leigh, nor Hitchcock.<br/><br/>I salute both Anthony Perkins and sir Alfred Hitchcock for what they've done for film history, and for the fact that there will be only one Tony Perkins, and one Alfred Hitchcock."

","What else can I add about this film?  One of the more famous settings ever (the motel), one of the most famous movie names (Norman Bates), and of course, probably the most memorable killing on film (shower, anyone?). There's no real point in summing up again, but, what the hay.  Leigh embezzels money and skips town.  She ends up at a remote motel and has dinner with the owner (Perkins).  Though long winded, the scene in the parlor stays captivating with the dialogue and the subtle music softly in the background.   They both discuss the things wrong in their lives, his biggest problem, his domineering ""mother"" (and I always wondered if people who haven't seen the film thought of when every critic always put quotations around mother).  She retires for the night, and while unwinding with a shower, is brutally knifed by some woman.  The mother?  You'll find out if you haven't seen it.  The rest of the film deals with Perkins trying to cover up the crime, as others come looking for Leigh.  I say it's Hitchcocks best, but that's mostly based on the fact that I didn't like his other movies (""Frenzy"" was ok).  Performance wise, you couldn't ask for much more, as Perkins is terrifically understated as Norman, the role that pidgeon-holed the rest of his career.  He pretty much carries the film as the others, good actors no doubt, have little screen time.  A sequel followed 23 years later(!), one I went for more being a kid of the 80s. Part III was good as well (Perkins directed nicely), but IV was a lame made for cable film.  There was also an awful remake in 98, check it out at your own risk.  As far as the beginning of it all, it can be slow in spots, but is a well told story and one of only a few films before the 80s that I liked."

","As much as I like the 1998 remake it was very unnecessary in my opinion. Why remake something that is already perfected? Psycho is probably the best horror movie this world will ever see. I think the fact that it's in black and white actually adds to the suspense of it all. Most of the movies from the 60's have faded with time and aren't spoken of much anymore but psycho even before the remake is still very remembered, very fresh in our heads, and still held in the very highest respects. (and thats not the only one of Hitchcock's movies that is.) I will always love the famous shower scene and always think about when I'm home alone in the shower and hear a noise. Not every movie has a scene in it that can live in your head like that. One of the ideas in this movie that i particularly like is how Marion was going to go back and fix what she had done wrong in the morning but it was too late. No one would have ever known after that that she was sorry and she was going to bring the money back it just brings up and interesting point. I wish todays horror movies were this good."

I'd heard there was a shower scene, but not having seen the film I didn't know whether she was stabbed, shot, strangled or what. So when the curtain is pulled back I wasn't surprised. Shocked at the fact Norman tries to stab her about three times and misses, and finally catches her. Arbergast getting stabbed in the eye (?) by ""Mother"" at the top of the stairs is hideous, but at the same time funny. Part 3 consists of Sam & Marion's sister Lila investigate her whereabouts and Bates is caught trying to stab Lila as ""Mother"".<br/><br/>A frightening film, it scared the sh*t out of me, I don't mind telling you !!<br/><br/>Whether I'd watch it again is another matter...."

","Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece does not instill fear in you like the modern horror flicks (using shock tactics), but instead subtly introduces it to you throughout the film. This might be because of the industry rules at that time as well, since violence that is too overt wasn't tolerated then. But only Hitchcock can use the rules then to construct a masterpiece, that even now, can cause that lingering fear to creep up on you.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the Norman Bates portrayed by Perkins - he is the original and will always be the best Norman Bates there is. The use of 'scary' imagery - spooky house on  top of a hill sihouletted by lightning behind, etc...some call it crude, but in Hitchcock's hands, it is dynamite.<br/><br/>Rent it if you've never watched the original (you haven't?!?!), you won't regret it."

"Andrew-162","10","1","3","30 June 2000"," Hitch's 2nd Best, But That Is Saying A Whole Lot
","Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is probably the best horror movie ever made, and though slightly inferior to his Vertigo, it remains a true showcase of the master's talent. Though I was not around the 1st time the movie came out, I was lucky enough to recently catch a screening of it, with a guest appearance by Janet Leigh. I had already seen the movie twice, and anticipated everything that was about to happen, but it didn't really matter. It still scared me so much, I was petrified to think how terrified I would be if I saw it in the theaters in 1960, not knowing what was about to happen. We all know the plot--Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles 40,000 dollars from her company and is on the run. She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a friendly young man who is restrained from being close to anyone but his possessive mother. They talk, and she gets in the shower. Before she is done her shower, she is stabbed to death by Norman's mother. But who really stabbed her? And is she really dead? Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Marion's boyfriend (Jon Gavin) hire detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to investigate. Then he is similarly stabbed to death before he can question Norman's mother.... Psycho is simply amazing, one of the true artistic pieces of the cinema. Joseph Stefano's disturbing, sick screenplay will not soon be forgotten, though the plot is not the main part of the movie. The cinematography is some of the best ever put on the screen, from the several pans from the Bates Motel to Norman's house to the opening shot across the city. It is dark--undeniably bleak and dark, as is the mood of the movie. The art direction is necessarily scary--Norman's house is perfectly secluded from the rest of the world, and looks very spooky, as does the motel. As Balsam notes, the hotel seems to be ""hiding from the world."" The acting varies--Balsam is quite good as the always suspicious detective, Leigh is ideally cast as the every day woman who sees a chance to get away from life and takes it, and Perkins is nothing less than fantastic as Norman Bates, a roll that would define his career, and one he will always be associated with. However, Miles and Gavin are wooden anti-characters with no personality whatsoever showing. But that really doesn't matter. Hitchcock liked the idea from the start--getting a big star and killing her off in the first reel. It certainly shocked audiences, who before came into movies whenever they wanted, sometimes even 30 minutes to an hour into the movie. They were not allowed to do that with Psycho. ""The film you should see from the beginning--or not at all"" the taglines stated. Psycho is a perfect example of audience manipulation--everyone assumes that the story is about Leigh, and when she gets bumped off, Hitchcock takes the audience down a completely different road. The shower scene is one of the most memorable and suprprising scenes in film history. The scenes in which Leigh is driving are suspenseful, even though there's nothing really happening. And when Perkins is trying to dispose of Leigh's car by pushing it into the swamp, the way the car stops sinking for a second--everyone suddenly wonders what he will do now--but then it sinks away again. Surprisingly enough, the audience wants the car to go down--we want Perkins to get rid of the evidence. And untrue to Horror formula, the climax of Psycho takes place not in a rainy dark night--but in the bright, sunny daylight. These are all examples of audience manipulation--which no one does better than Alfred Hitchcock. But yet--Hitchcock's direction, I think, is not the best part of the movie--or at least it is tied for first. The best? BERNARD HERRMANN. If you do not know that name yet, write it down. BERNARD HERRMANN. He has done the score to the Hitchcock movies Marnie, The Birds, The Wrong Man, North By Northwest, Vertigo (ohh, the Vertigo score), and Psycho. He also did the score to Scorcese's Taxi Driver, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. He won an oscar for his score for The Devil And Daniel Webster. His score for Psycho is certainly his most well known--especially the shower scene part. Though not his best (Vertigo is his best) the score is the part of Psycho that stays with you after the film is done, days after. That keeps haunting you, that keeps scaring you. Psycho would be three or four times less scary without the shrieking violins of Herrmann's score. Herrmann also pulled an exercise in audience manipulation--for the score, frightening as it is, consisted of only 4 violins. The music truly sets the mood for the movie. Creating the madness and worry in Marion's mind while she is driving, creating the true horror of the murders, and creating the calm but suspenseful serenity of some of the dialogues, where there is no music at all, and the film is eerily silent. You know the shrieking violins are soon. Bernard Herrmann's scores are not often enough credited as a huge, HUGE part Hitchcock's success with his pictures. So write that name down if you don't know it already: BERNARD HERRMANN. And see Psycho. If you've already seen it, see it again to catch the little things you missed before. I guarantee you there are some."

","""Psycho"" is amazing suspense and terror at it's best. It is quite possibly considered to be the grandfather of the slasher films and Alfred Hitchcock does his absolute best to keep people on the edge of their seats for the whole film. Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a secretary who embezzles $40,000 and runs off to be with her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). During a rain storm, she stops at the Bates Motel, run by a quiet young man named Norman (Anthony Perkins) and his ""mother"". She has dinner with him but ""mother"" doesn't seem to be too pleased and while Miss Marion is taking a shower, she gets stabbed numerous times in an absolutely horrific scene which doesn't lose it's effect even after 40 years. It IS scary! We then meet Lila (Vera Miles), Marion's sister who teams up with Sam and a private investigator Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam -- who also meets the wrong end of the knife), to figure out what happened to Marion. The ending is great and explains the reason why Norman acted the way he did throughout the film. This is definitely Alfred's best film. He seems to balance suspense and terror and even a little black humor here and there. Amazingly, this film spawned 3 sequels and is the best of the bunch. One of my top 5 favorites!"

","Psycho (and Alfred Hitchcock movies in general) is one of the most overrated films in cinematic history. First off this has nothing to do with any distaste for ""old"" or ""black and white"" movies, as I very rarely watch anything post-1980. But this movie is just really boring. Maybe it's because it is so iconic that any scenes that are supposed to be scary have been burned into pop culture, thereby dulling its power. The first half of the movie, while slow, held my interest enough but once the main character is killed off, I found the movie unbearable to sit through. Yes I understand that this film was a trendsetter as far as slasher flicks go, but I think a real good movie will draw in and hold its audience's interest just as much as time goes on - and Psycho does not! At least not mine. If its place in horror film history is really the only selling point for this flick then it really should be in a museum and not on your television. The Hammer Films, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Val Lewton's films, Black Sunday, The Exorcist - now those are movies that have stood the test of time and retained their entertainment value and fright factor. I give this five stars for the good camera work and Anthony Perkins, who really eats up his role."

","Hitchcock may be one of the greats, but that's no excuse for doing sub par work and making a half-good movie. You can't do that, man. What reasons do I have for assaulting a classic? It's 1 in the morning, I'm not wearing pants, I have insomnia as a result of depression, and I thought that Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece make-you-wet-your-adult- diaper thriller was a load of horse manure.<br/><br/>I first saw Psycho with my family one Halloween. I expected what the DVD case said: a thriller. What I got was not much in return. The story follows Marion Something who decides to rob her perfectly nice boss and go on the run with the money. Why? Doesn't matter. She is then pursued by a theorizing cop for a wholesome round of filler suspense. I wasn't embroiled in her life. I was bored. She then stops at a motel and after a long bout of small talk with the creepy care-taker, is murdered. I haven't marked this as a spoiler because it isn't one. It barely happens halfway through.<br/><br/>I don't give a flying, enchanted sh!t about shocking the audience if it removes the stupid main character from the stupid movie. The rest of the movie is a detective (about whom I saw no reason to care) looking into Marion's disappearance and ultimately the wacky misadventures of Marion's sister and Marion's butt buddy Sam. THIS WEBSITE lists Marion as fourth in the cast and I'm expected to pay attention. I found myself disengaged from the story. I blame the screenplay. Upon closer inspection and after a second, forced viewing in film class, I saw that there was still three-act structure and an antagonist. There's even the first conflict between the protagonist and primary opposition at the middle as Dan Decker states in Anatomy of a Screenplay. I was still not interested and a movie can be uninteresting if it follows some of the rules. Ask yourself this: how much is actually known about Marion, Lila, or Sam?<br/><br/>Psycho was expertly directed, shot, and edited. The shower scene lived up to its expectations. The ending was creepy and plot-twisty enough for me. But for all that, I still found that I didn't care.

","I didn't really like Hitchcock's Psycho.<br/><br/>The plot is way dated by today's standards. You can tell the film was made specifically to shock audiences in 1960, but today it fails miserably to be convincing; especially because of the film's constant attempts to keep you convinced that Norman's mother is the real killer. The film stresses this so much that other aspects of the plot suffer. For example, characters hardly ever have any logical thoughts/theories and don't make logical decisions or actions. I pretty much figured out that he'd already killed his mom from the moment her ""character"" is introduced. I'm sure the film was fantastic when it first came out, but to me it just isn't any more. <br/><br/>I can understand why many people would find the film to be really good. It was definitely groundbreaking and utilized a lot of interesting camera and editing techniques. Also I thought that Anthony Perkins' performance was great. However, it is by no means a timeless film like most of the movies we've seen in class.

"Jon-Fougner","8","1","4","25 March 2006"," Politics of Sight and Height: The Ocular and Epistemological Illogic of Psycho
","For those who can stomach it, Psycho is a technical and visual chef d'oeuvre deserving of multiple viewings. It has yet to be surpassed in the horror/thriller genre. It participates in Hitchcock's lifelong fixation with sight, a theme addressed by these notes, which assume the reader's shot-by-shot familiarity with the film.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's interest in the human eye is manifold: aesthetic, physiological, psychological, epistemological. Does eye imagery signify knowledge? Or its opposite? How? Eyes function as the mediating nexus between the unknown, outside world and our internal reckoning of it. But far from being the locus of strength and understanding for protagonist, audience, or even antagonist, eyes (and vision) instead serve Hitchcock's epistemologically sadistic project of illogic and fracture. Hitchcock delights in buffeting his protagonist's eye to assault who resides behind that superficies, just as he enjoys striking through the very screen at the audience seated uncomfortably behind it.<br/><br/>That Marion's struggle (and our own) is fundamentally an epistemological one is made transparent by her run-in with the disembodied head of a highway patrolman, eyes shielded behind ludicrous sunglasses. His eyes are not the first to accuse herwe remember her boss' glareand they signal her informational disadvantage. They take in information but betray none of their own secrets (or vacuity?). Thus does Hitchcock subvert Carol Clover's assaultive/projective/masculinereactive/introjective/feminine dipole: the patrolman's gaze is informationally assaultive precisely because it is introjective only. (We will see the assaultive power of the introjective gaze suggested when Norman eyes Marion through the peephole.)<br/><br/>Hitchcock showcases his editorial encoding of the epistemological (pseudo-)order of Psycho's world in the driving sequence immediately following this encounter. This sequence intercuts with rigorous regularity among three types of shots: third-person shots facing Marion; POV shots through the front windshield; and POV shots of the patrol car. The exacting regularityfacilitated by mirrors, a classic Hitchcockian tropepretends to signal an order, a logic. We imagine Marion trying to parse the auteur's sententious geometry. But no understanding emerges. Elegant as it is, the shot pattern means nothing and reveals nothing, since Hitchcock is a cynic. Alongside such theoretical obfuscations, physical objects designed to enlighten instead prove occlusive: rather than informing, a newspaper conceals (money); rather illuminating, headlights blind (Marion).<br/><br/>Eye imagery participates in another spurious rule-of-thumb: the equation that height equals knowledge and therefore power. Hitchcock implies this parsimony in the dinner scene in the parlor. At first, level shots of Marion are interpolated with steep low-angle shots of Norman's birds eyeing her as their prey. Then level shots of her eating take turns with shallow low-angle shots of Norman, a subtler predator but a predator nonetheless. At the first mention of his mother, his eyes turn up the hill to her, the most psychically powerful predator of all. In contrast to the retina-dominated view we have heretofore had of him, his upturned eyes now acknowledge their own master (Mother) and expose their whitesthe polar opposite of the policeman's absorptive black holes. (There are several other eye references in this scene. For instance, Marion mentions wishing for her own ""private island,"" a pun on the ""private eye-land"" that the Bates residence will become when Abrogast arrives.)<br/><br/>This particular ocular motif is one of several at work during the most profoundly dissociative crisis of the film: Marion's murder. The first noteworthy shot is Marion's POV as she looks up at the projective eye of the shower (a six-foot showerhead was built to get the shot). A virtually identical shot follows her murder. But whose POV is it now?! That the POV outlasts its owner is a callous offense to be sure, one which forces the viewer, in the name of consistency, to retroactively recast the first instance as an aperspectival moment of purely aesthetic cinema. Our identification with her is retroactively denied. As we fall into the black hole of the drainwhich, in concert with the projective showerhead to which it cinematographically replies, constitutes a further sham logic on the director's partand then emerge from Marion's vacant retina, we are cast out of all comprehension. The ultra-close-up dismembers her face, as if unseating her very self from her eyes and draining it out her gaping mouth and nostril. It is no accident that her eye now lies an inch from the ground. Her effacement from the land of the knowable is consummated when she is swallowed down into the swamp's mammoth retina. <br/><br/>Culminating the corruption of the height heuristic is the relegation of the final battle to the Freudian basement, rather than the Freudian attic, the latter which is understood as the true pinnacle of psychodynamic knowledge and power for several reasons, viz: (1) topologically, the attic has the highest altitude on the Bates estate; (2) historically, it bears all the artifacts of Norman's imprisoned childhood (particularly ironic is the ""Eroica"" record), the personal font of his identificatory crisis; and (3) symbolically, it represents Mother, the ultimate authority. Instead, Marion discovers the truth in the unceremonious fruit cellar! And what a truth: far from projecting from on high, Mother's eyes are instead absorptive sockets, penetrable by a mere swinging light bulb. Meanwhile, the paradoxical co-location of Norman-qua-Mother in the same room with Mother's corpse collapses the Bates family structure, necessitating Norman's exile from Eden.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's cinematic forked tongue utters its final deception in the spurious resolution of the last shot, the excavation of Marion's car. Structurally, the shot replies to the opening (rather than swooping down, we are dragging up) and, of course, to the film's fulcrum (the submergence of the car). Has the truth been excavated? The revelations from the exhumation will prove forensic at best, and the arbiters of forensic truththe policehave been shown to be so off-base that we should expect little enlightenment from them. ""Murder will out,"" we hear Chaucer groaning. But will it? Let's not forget: Hitchcock is just kidding, here as always."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","1","4","6 August 2005"," Hitchcock's best film, by far
","Hitchcock was a masterful director... no one can deny his talent for creating and sustaining suspense. He had a gift for making memorable and impressive films, and Psycho is without a doubt one of the most well-known and popular. One of the reasons is of course the famous shower scene, but that's only one of many memorable and well-done sequences. The reason we remember that particular scene is not only how nicely filmed, tightly edited and effective it is... but also how credible it is. We believe in it, despite how little it shows of what it depicts, we believe that it happens, despite all we see is innuendo and hinting. The plot is great. Entirely credible and realistic. The whole film is psychologically accurate. The acting is superb, particularly Anthony Perkins. The pacing is great; you're hardly ever bored. The writing is excellent, both as far as story and dialog go. There are plenty of quotable lines. What makes this film work so well is how realistic and believable it is. What makes it shocking is how surprising it is. What makes this film have such an impact is that it's perfectly credible. I won't reveal any more, in case anyone reading this review don't know the twist of the film. If you are one of those people, watch this before you're told of it. It's incredible. I recommend this to any fan of horror, thriller and/or Hitchcock. 10/10"
"GOWBTW","10","1","4","19 July 2005"," This is one of Hitchcock's very best films!
","Who would dare to put Janet Leigh in the shower and let ""Mother"" stab her many times? HITCHCOCK! Who would show Janet Leigh in bra and half-slip? HITCHCOCK! Who is the master of mystery and mayhem? HITCHCOCK! Yes, it's macabre master himself, Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, British film maker who makes a film for the American audience. This man is not afraid, he is bold, brainy, and very well rounded in his work. And this movie is in my opinion, one of the best he's ever made. Janet Leigh(1927-2004) did an outstanding job playing the thieving Marion Crane. The question does puzzles me in the beginning of the film is why was she wearing white bra and half-slip? <br/><br/>Very kinky to start, but very interesting as well. Women like that don't wear white, supposed a downpour would occur and she wore black underneath, it would be quite embarrassing. Or is it? Other than that, she does drive over to the Bates Motel where it's run by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins,1932-92), may look sensitive, but BEWARE! He always have to listen to Mother. I say Norman needs to avoid Mother, she's a real bad influence! Bates is also a voyeur, he happens to watch Marion undress. Naughty, naughty! For a man who kills women. After he kills Marion which is most likely the most infamous scene, he would try his best for her sister, which is stopped by Sam Loomis(John Gavin). I wonder if Perkins was in to transvestitism to get the role at that time? Hmmmm! Well anyway, this is one of the few hits in the 60's that can be enjoyed for horror fans of every generation. Still for person 17 and over! All I have to say is, WATCH OUT! YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET STABBED! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rating 5 stars!"

I have seen all but 3 of Hitchcock's movies, and this one is the BEST he ever made. If you love suspense, I highly recommend you watch this film. Buy it! ALfred Hitchcock turns a seemingly grim story into a masterpiece of a film. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles some money. She goes to meet her boyfriend whom she wishes to marry, and on the way decides to stay at the Bates Motel. If you want to find out what happens next, you'll just have to watch the movie. :) I promise you, it is a movie you won't soon forget. WARNING Psycho is not a movie to be seen by anyone under 13, due to it's violent content. Still, it is a fascinating movie to be enjoyed by more MATURE audiences. I love Psycho! I give this movie a 10+. Oh, by the way, you might have heard about the shower scene, but you just have to watch it to see how good it really is. It's true- you might not want to take a shower for a while after watching this movie. I didn't."

","First time I saw this flick, I kept wondering, ""Who's psycho?"" Certainly not the real-estate woman, Marion Crane; she's criminally foolish, but not insane. And, it probably isn't her boyfriend Sam. Maybe it's that deluded ""other girl"" in the realty office? She IS kind of weird. But, it can't be that nice man who runs the motel. He's awkward with women and ""devoted"" to his invalid mother. Then, when Mother kills Marion in the shower, Norman cleans up and covers up, like a dutiful son. We'll have to cart IL' Mom off to the Looney Bin mighty soon! She's PSYCHO!! I was absolutely surprised (I was only a boy of 19) when the real psycho-killer-mad-slasher was exposed. Sure, that basement scene with the late Mrs. Bates, Norman, Lila and Sam is as contrived as the cavalry coming to the rescue at the last minute, but it sure gives your gut some big butterflies. It's just the best Hitchcock ever."

"TexMetal4JC","10","1","4","10 July 2001"," If anyone has ever made a perfect movie, this is it.
","Made with the crew from his popular TV show, Alfred Hitchcock filmed PSYCHO in B/W in the midst of the height of his color classics -- REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, DIAL M FOR MURDER, TO CATCH A THIEF and THE BIRDS. But it is PSYCHO that has become synonymous with Hitchcock. It is PSYCHO that has become synonymous with screaming and blood and knives and schizophrenia and horror.<br/><br/>If ever anybody has made a perfect movie, PSYCHO is it. It is the penultimate in shocking horror, a directorial masterpiece supported by acting that will never be surpassed. The stars aligned for this movie, and it is doubtful if a movie can ever surpass the greatness of this film.<br/><br/>The points have been hashed and rehashed over and over again: Perkins' incredible acting, the plot twists, the sheer twistedness of the movie, the place it holds as the father of the modern horror movie. All of it amazing.<br/><br/>
No scene has been more popular in the annals of film than the shower scene (Oh sure, GONE WITH THE WIND and CASABLANCA and CITIZEN KANE have memorable lines, but what movie has a minutes-long scene that is internationally famous?). Unfortunately, its notoriety makes it somewhat of a disappointment to watch now, but repeat viewings reinforce the technical beauty of the scene where the original horror was lost.<br/><br/>But enough, as anything said will only add more hype to a movie that does not need it. PSYCHO is quite simply the perfect movie, a film that could possibly stand forever as the best ever made."
"ken-243","10","1","4","30 June 2001"," The best of the Hitchcock canon
","Probably the best of all of the Hitchcock films, mostly due to the surprise mid-film demise of the film's main character.  The basic problem with any suspense film is the audience can be secure in the knowledge that the big-name star will survive the film--somehow. Psycho breaks this tradition and throws the audience a completely unexpected curve. Psycho also demonstrates what a good director can do with a low budget and, basically, a one-set picture.  Good performances all around, particularly from Perkins. Nearly a perfect piece of cinema, marred only by occasionally sloppy editing and a few unfair red herrings, such as using an actress (Virginia Gregg) as the voice of ""mother"" instead of having Perkins do it. Brilliant Bernard Herrmann score uses only strings. Title sequences by Saul Bass seamlessly set-up the story. Would-be horror film directors need to thoroughly understand what makes this film a masterpiece before they shoot their first frame of film. There is almost no blood or on-screen violence."
"fletch5","10","1","4","1 July 2001"," Remarkable.
","When Saul Bass' opening credits begin to roll (combined with Bernard Herrmann's legendary score), you know you're in for a treat. However, the first half an hour of ""Psycho"" can get slightly tedious as it mostly consists of Janet Leigh driving a car. But as soon as she reaches The Bates Motel, the atmosphere increases to an electrifying level.<br/><br/>
""Psycho"" made an enormous impression on me the first time I saw it (I was just 12). Luckily I had no idea about the twist in the end because it would have ruined the whole thing. Although the movie relies much on Hitchcock's innovative use of clever camera angles, its greatest asset is Anthony Perkins' outstanding performance that simply cannot be praised enough.<br/><br/>
As some others have pointed out, the casting of John Gavin as Leigh's boyfriend was a terrible choice, but I believe Hitchcock wasn't very pleased with him either. Gavin's practically nonexistent screen appeal reminds me of those anemic actors in ""Strangers on a Train"". Can't believe he was to become the new James Bond until Sean Connery was lured back, thankfully!<br/><br/>Regardless of that minor flaw, ""Psycho"" has earned its status in the history of cinema. It's a remarkable achievement within Hitchcock's career and an impressive work of art whose impact multiple viewings can't wear off."

"Mac-59","Null","1","4","22 March 2001"," Terrible
","I've always thought of Psycho as a masterpiece of classic horror, one that makes you cringe and sparks true fear, especially when pulling the shower curtain across, leaving you exposed, naked to monstrosities lurking on the other side: and that was before I'd even seen it. Now that I have seen it....I believe that Hitchcock is the most overrated director of all time. With the exception of the the shower scene which is effective in the same way Blair Witch was, it preys on basic human emotions, this one being vulnerability. I mean, what could be more vulnerable that a naked woman in a shower in a strange hotel, a woman who's sinned and you know is ""gonna get it"" anyway? The only surprise is the short amount off time it takes to discard the leading lady. In that sense, it is a true shock.... but with that exception what does Psycho really have. Nothing. And I have proof. Consider the new adaptation of Psycho by Gus van Zant. It bombed at the theaters and was slayed by critics, even though Zant's version is identical in almost every way. And these are the same critics who call the original Psycho a masterpiece. Their only critique should have been on the acting or the photography, but alot of them attacked pacing and story line, even though they were the same. It's the memory of a scary film that you saw when you were young that won't let you destroy the illusion. Well an illusion is all it is. Rear Window and North by Northwest are boring films speckled with a few exciting moments, nothing more and so is Psycho. I feel the same way about Toxic Avenger. When I was 5, I thought it was fantastic, best movie ever-then I saw it again a year ago and it was filth, complete garbage but at least I let go of the memory of the film and concentrated on the film itself. Some of those Hitchcock fans ought to do the same...."

","Although I found the film compelling enough, it is obviously a bit dated. It must have been very suspenseful at the time of release, but not by today's standards. It was a bit more of a talkie - like most films of the time. I thought Anthony Perkins was exceptionally good as Norman Bates. I found the ending not very convincing as they tried to explain the Norman Bates/Mrs Bates setup. Maybe at the time it was acceptable, but I was kind of expecting more.

","The minute Bernard Herrmann's menacing score begins for the opening credits, you know you're in for an intense combination of horror, humor and suspense. Hitch really does a job on us with this one--disposing of the heroine (Janet Leigh) with a shocking shower scene. Then playing further tricks on us before the shock ending reveals just how twisted Norman Bates is. <br/><br/>Anthony Perkins was forever identified with his role as the motel keeper, all boyish charm and pleasant manners while he concocts his wild schemes. Janet Leigh deserved her Golden Globe award for her performance as Marian Crane, the embezzler who has fallen into her own private trap and wants nothing more than to return the money toher employer. Little does she--or we--know what's in store for her.<br/><br/>Summing up: one of the finest chillers Alfred Hitchcock ever directed with every frame of film calculated to keep you absorbed until the stunning climax. <br/><br/>Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam all do fine work here. But the real star of the movie is Bernard Herrmann's gripping and very edgy background score, never more brilliantly menacing than when Janet Leigh peers through her windshield and the driving rain to see a sign that reads: Bates Motel. By the way, Pat Hitchcock, the director's daughter, has an amusing office scene with Janet Leigh in which she imagines that the only reason a man isn't flirting with her is that she's wearing a wedding ring. Touches of sardonic humor like this are evident throughout. Great film."
"baumer","9","1","5","27 December 1999"," The grand daddy of them all
","I love horror films. I have reviewed all the Fridays, all the Jaws', most of the Halloweens and a few of the Nightmares. Halloween and Jaws are, to me, the two best horror films ever made. And even though I don't think Psycho is on par with some of the best horror films ever to grace our screens, you have to give credit where credit is due. Psycho is a pioneer for horror films and it is because of Psycho that we have films like Halloween and Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and directors like Hooper and Carpenter and Craven. I was born 12 years after Psycho was made and I really didn't get into film until at least another 10 years after that, but I can tell you that Psycho must have shocked and revolutionized film. Could you imagine a film maker so bold as to tell theater owners that they are not to permit anyone into the theater after it starts? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill the main character half way through the film? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill someone so graphically in the shower? Sure you can imagine all that. It's 1999. This film is almost 40 years old. But imagine what it did to audiences in 1960. It must have shocked the hell out of everyone back then. Psycho is a film like no other.<br/><br/>There have been films that have done it better than Psycho but none of them can say they were the first. Psycho is a great film and it is enjoyable, unlike other older films like Citizen Kane that are only listed as great because they were the first to do something but has nothing redeemable about it. Psycho is a creepy film and it gave birth to a genre and I am thankful for it because my favourite horror film has Psycho to thank for it's inspiration. Halloween uses the camera the same way Psycho did and Carpenter is a carbon copy of Hitchcock for this one film. The two films even share a common name and character, Sam Loomis. <br/><br/>There really isn't anything else that I want to say about the film, there are more than 100 reviews in here and many of them are by people that know a hell a lot more about the film than I do, but I just wanted to say how thankful I am that a movie like Psycho came along and paved the way for future films like The Evil Dead and Last House On The Left and such. This may be the first twisted horror film of it's kind and that is worth mentioning.<br/><br/>If you want to know how horror has revolutionized and evolved to the way it is today, you can look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant masterpiece, PSYCHO."

Psycho never quite achieved that with me. Other films of the period such as ""The Innocents"" and ""Night Of The Demon"", were in a different class in terms of scare movies and still to this day have a scare factor and tension that ""Psycho"" sadly lacks.<br/><br/>Great film that misses it's main objective for me."
"The_Void","9","1","7","7 October 2005"," The master director's most important film?
","There's no denying that Alfred Hitchcock is one of the true geniuses of cinema, and Psycho is his most popular film. Whether or not it's his 'best' is up for debate; but no matter what; it's definitely up there. Psycho is the film that inspired the entire 'slasher' sub-genre, and is also a textbook example of how to make a thriller. Every shot in the film is perfectly orchestrated, and by keeping the immediate action simple; the master director is able to fully focus on the proceedings, making the resulting film more thrilling. The influence that Psycho has had on cinema overall is astounding, and it's hard to imagine cinema now without this film. The fact that over forty years on, Psycho is still better than every film it influenced is no coincidence. The plot follows Marion Crane; an office worker who is entrusted with $40,000. Seeing her chance to escape her mundane life, she takes the money and runs. Unluckily for her, she stops at a small roadside motel; The Bates Motel. Managed by a quiet young man named Norman, the remote motel has more secrets than it's appearance suggests.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock creates a superb macabre atmosphere around the central location. Just the motel itself is frightening, without the rain effects and the psychopath that inhabits it. The master director has proved time and time again that he knows how to handle a movie; and the way that he orchestrates the surrounding here shows that implicitly. Everything about the plot is well worked, and the twist right at the centre of the film shows that. It's hard to carry off a twist like the one here and make it work, as the audience have put so much time and effort into the central character; but Hitchcock is more than equal to the challenge, and the way that he shifts the focus and still manages to retain all the intrigue is awesome to watch. The pivotal scene of the movie is, of course, the shower scene. The technicalities of this scene warrant the seven days that it took to film it, and the resulting montage represents some of the best footage ever to come out of Hollywood. I don't subscribe to the idea of 'less is more' usually, but the shower scene is so skilfully done that it's hard to not respect it.<br/><br/>The central character of Norman Bates is, without doubt, one of the most frightening characters in cinema history. Unlike many of the resulting slashers' killers, Norman isn't overblown or even unrealistic; you can really imagine this character being real. Of course, the excellent performance by Anthony Perkins really adds to the character. There are some actors that were made by one role, and Perkins is one of them. The rest of the ensemble work brilliantly together, with Janet Leigh providing the central character until mid-way through, when Vera Miles steps in. It's a shame, really, that Psycho is so well known because now everyone knows it's twist, so it's hard to really enjoy the movie the way that it's intended. I knew the twist already before I saw the film for the first time - so it's lucky that the movie is so good, because otherwise, already knowing what happens could have spoilt it. Overall, there's a very good reason why Psycho is one of the most respected movies of all time. There are some films that you cant be a cinema fan without seeing - and this is one of them."

Second I really liked the idea , he is a schizophreniac who dresses like his mother because he misses her and feels guilty about killing her, but wasn't it better if the detective in the end didn't tell all the stuff about him they was too evidently. They had to let us think a lil bit.
Third why the movie started with a scene of this woman when she died so soon and what happens with the money and why did she wanted to steal them. It was unexpected to kill her, first I though that she is the psycho. And like the whole movie was centered about her, like she is the psycho.

","When I first saw this movie, I didn't like it. I was bored, and I think I rated it six out of ten. But I was younger, with less film experience and much less patience. Therefore I decided to give it another chance.<br/><br/>Nominated for four Oscars, Alfred Hitchcock's horror thriller ""Psycho"" is considered one of the best films of all time and one of the most influential films in the genre. The oldest R-rated movie can also be found on the lists of the most controversial films because, in its time, it was something new and shocking. Frankly, I was a little bored. Although technically well-made, with great camera, music, and performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, the story and overall atmosphere made no special impression on me. The introductory part, until Marion arrives at the motel, was needlessly dragged on for half an hour and, after hundreds of watched thrillers and horrors, neither did the rest of it particularly hold my attention. With all due respect for the status of this film, its impact on the history of cinema, the cult scene in the shower and one of the most legendary twists of all time, my subjective impression does not allow me to rate it higher than<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","The movie caught my eye as we watched it but the movie in itself was outstanding. All the scary scenes,were not jumpscares like they are now. No they were more than that. Alfred Hitchcock used psychology, which i think hints the title. He uses your own imagination against you, getting into your brain and playing with your emotions. He lets your imagination run wild before he shows who was doing all these horrific things. He played the system on this one i think, knowing back then the hays code back then was just terrible. Some parts of the movie he will have you thinking and another part he will have you shaking in your boots. Back to the hays code part of this, you have to admit he did slip through the cracks a bit on this one. The code was extremely strict back then not letting homicide,suicide or even nudity be shown back then. He did not put any in there explicitly letting it be shown. Yet he did let you know what was going on in obvious ways , such as showing blood running down a drain and other things of that nature. This movie was outstanding in my opinion . Every dark vs light aspect was just right showing characters in dark clothing to be evil or crooked, and lighter colored characters to be loving and good. Even the small things like the Mcguffin he got just right in my opinion , you didn't know the importance of it until he wanted you to and that was the crazy thing about this movie, i think every actor and actress played their parts very well. Not letting the plot of the story get tangled and brought off course at all, i think this is one of the best if not the best movie of the early years of films.<br/><br/>-Ehvyn Baker"

Mixed into this web is a private investigator (Martin Balsam), Marion's sister (Vera Miles) and Marion's secret beau (John Gavin).<br/><br/>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on Robert Bloch's book, ""Psycho"" made a huge impact when it was released in 1960.

"junkmail-48566","10","0","1","26 July 2018"," The greatest thriller of them all!
","Get over the concept that Hitchcock chose to film this in black and white! ""Psycho"" was made as a bet with Hitch's agent, Lew Wasserman, after both read an article in Variety that pointed out that an upstart company, American-International, was packing them into drive-in theaters to see low-budget horror films directed by Roger Corman. Hitch claimed he could make a better film than AIP for less money than they spent on a film, and Wasserman took him up on the bet. ""Psycho"" was made for $80,000 using Hitch's television crew instead of his usual cinematic crew. Hitch was always fussy about his leading ladies, and he selected Janet Leigh for the role of Marion Crane, who agreed to play the role for half her usual salary. Anthony Perkins however, as Norman Bates, is the central character of the film, and while his interaction with Marion is minimal, he will forever be remembered for his performance here. Vera Miles, one of Hitchcock's favorite actresses, plays Marion's sister Lila, creating tension over her concern for her sister's well-being. Of Hitchcock's total body of works, ""Psycho"" is the film that stands out in most fan's minds as his greatest. Everyone involved here did their absolute best, and the results are obvious on the screen. The only flaw in the film is the distortion heard in Bernard Hermann's music score. The score exists by itself without the film and is available on LaserDisc, LP and CD, however it's distorted on every medium. Hermann re-recorded the score as a suite for a 1969 Decca/London Phase 4 stereo vinyl release called ""Music from the Great Movie Thrillers."" The LP has been reissued on CD as ""Great Hitchcock Movie Thrillers"" and lacks the distortion of the mono recording in the film. SPOILER: Of note to trivia fans is that the sound effect of the knife used in the famous shower scene was created by using a Cassaba melon, and in no shot of the rapid 45 pieces of film fired at the viewers does a knife penetrate Marion Crane on-camera, and the effect of the blood running down the drain is actually Bosco chocolate syrup."

It's the buildup that matters, whether Janet Leigh's negotiating the open road with a guilty conscience or just stepping into the shower. I knew exactly what would happen, but I still couldn't look away. Hitchcock knows how to ratchet suspense; it's like seeing the master at work.

","Psycho, one of the best horror films of all time, has become irretrievably embedded in popular consciousness. Few are unaware of the iconic shower scene and the shrill string instrumentation that accompanies it, whether they have seen the film or not. The production values are, without exception, exemplary, even though the film was made on a comparatively small budget and largely with a television crew.<br/><br/>The expressive and natural performance of Anthony Perkins in the role of Norman Bates launched his career and dogged him for the rest of it on account of his subsequent typecasting. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane convincingly betrays an increasing sense of alarm at her immoral behaviour and her helplessness at preventing it. Bernard Hermann's score, which adds tension throughout the film, even to seemingly innocuous scenes, has been rightly singled out for praise, not least from the director himself. I doubt whether a better reproduction of the sound of stabbing someone with string instruments is possible. The music for the main credits sets the tone for the film, foreshadowing the drama, danger, and violence that punctuates it.<br/><br/>The cinematographer uses black and white film to its full advantage. The result is, in my opinion, as impressive as the film's score. The lack of colour robs the film of vitality and warmth, creating a sense of dread in the viewer. Shadows and darkness provide cover for illicit deeds or an elegant way of framing images. In a memorable scene, the long shadow of various birds of prey makes them appear alive and even more frightening, as if they were ready to attack the character or, by extension, the viewer who shares her perspective.<br/><br/>The shower scene deserves a special mention. The scene occurs in the middle of the film, at a point when viewers have become absorbed in the story, forgetting, if only slightly, that what they are watching isn't real. Shooting the scene from the perspective of the killer was a stroke of genius. A tranquil scene of a woman enjoying a warm shower greets the viewer. The woman even begins to hum jauntily. Immediately the viewer feels as if he shouldn't be spying on this woman, much less pulling back the shower curtain. Soon they see themselves stabbing her relentlessly and viciously. Hitchcock grants the viewer no respite as the murder is shown from a multitude of angles. The jarring montage of violent images frightens and disturbs. Indeed, one would be forgiven for looking around the room afterwards to see whether there are any murderers lurking in the shadows. The dissonant strings, at once, accentuate the helpless cries of the woman and the violent rage of the killer. The scene concludes with a close up of the lifeless eye of the woman. The eye may signify the viewer's vicarious participation in the murder through watching it, confronting him with his perverse enjoyment of the gruesome scene.<br/><br/>Psycho does have its flaws. The exposition at the end of the film is superfluous as the climactic scene provides the same information, obviating the awkward insertion of an ad hoc monologue. The scene in which a character falls down stairs, which, to be sure, would have thrilled contemporary audiences with its groundbreaking special effects, has not aged well. The clumsy and conspicuous use of special effects shatters the illusion, reminding the viewer that he is watching a film. The deputy sheriff's lack of interest in investigating the theft of $40 000 beggars belief.<br/><br/>The virtually unrivalled excellence of the bulk of the film, reaching its apogee during the shower scene, transcends any residual imperfections. Psycho, through its elevation of the horror genre and its inspiration of subsequent generations of filmmakers and film enthusiasts, is surely deserving of its place in the canon of American cinema."

","Marion Crane works for an estate agent in Phoenix; one Friday afternoon a client pays $40,000 in cash for a property and her boss ask to take it for the bank as he doesn't want it in the office over the weekend. Rather than going to the bank she sets off to California. It is a long journey and after spending one night in her car, after she is woken by a suspicious police officer she buys a new car. Then, as it starts to rain, she leaves the main road and stops at a remote motel for the night. The motel is run by Norman Bates who tells her that he lives in the neighbouring house with his aged mother. He appears to be friendly as he offers to make her something for supper. She hears his mother expressing her disapproval of him being alone with a young woman before she has her supper in the office. The then returns to her room and prepares for bed. Now things get creepy; Norman takes a picture off the wall and uses a spy hole to observe Marion as she gets undressed. Then as she takes a shower somebody enters her room and brutally murders her. Soon people are starting to wonder what happened to her and the $40,000. Her boss has sent a private detective to find her and her sister goes to see her boyfriend, who has no idea where she is. The detective checks a string of motels before finding that she stayed at the Bates motel. As the story progresses we learn more about Norman and his mother all leading to one of cinema's most shocking conclusions.<br/><br/>This film is rightly considered a classic; I would love to have watched it without knowing about what happened. For the first half of the film follows Marion Crane, setting her up as the protagonist; everybody else we see, including Norman Bates, appears to be very much secondary characters so anybody lucky enough not to know the film's first famous twist should be genuinely surprised. Until her death it looks as though the film would centre on whether she would be caught or whether she would see the error of her ways and return the money. After the infamous 'shower scene' the tone changes dramatically as we learn just what is going on at the Bates Motel and ultimately discover Norman's shocking secret. Janet Leigh does a fine job as the good girl who has made a bad choice but it is Anthony Perkins who stands out with his nuanced performance as Norman Bates; at times charming at others chilling. Hitchcock's direction is superb; he manages to show brutal murder without actually showing and of the actual brutality; just a raised knife, Marion screaming and blood going down the plug hole blood that isn't even red as the film is black and white. Obviously this isn't suitable for younger viewers but I'd say it is a must see for all older film fans."

","I was eleven years old when ""Psycho"" was first shown at theaters in 1960. My mother absolutely prohibited me from seeing it, so, naturally, I was soon headed by bus to the Ritz Theatre in downtown Elizabeth, New Jersey by myself so that there would be no witnesses. I was so shocked after the first half hour that I don't think that I had a clue as to what followed, even if I could understand it at the time, and I couldn't.<br/><br/>From the opening pan shot of 1959 downtown Phoenix and the subsequent zoom into the intimate hotel room of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin), this movie never fails to maintain my interest even after many viewings over the past 57 years. It's just that good. No viewing, however, will ever have the same, terrifying impact of the first.<br/><br/>As talented as Alfred Hitchcock is as a director, and this movie ranks among the best of his many brilliant works, I do not believe that ""Psycho"" would have the same shocking effect without Bernard Hermann's extremely tense score, which consists solely of nerve-racking string instruments. <br/><br/>In addition to the outstanding direction, musical score, and photography by John L. Russell, I thought that the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins were exceptionally good. In the case of Leigh, I have followed her career from her earliest films of the late 1940's (The Romance of Rosy Ridge, Act of Violence, etc.), and I believe that this is among her best work. The handling of the resolution of Marion's inner conflict at a critical moment while she dines with Norman is especially effective, and her entire portrayal is Oscar worthy, even if she does only appear for less than thirty minutes. Apparently, Perkins' acting career fell victim to his own success here as his depiction of Norman Bates was so iconic that he could not easily be identified by audiences as anyone else. In his small but notable role, Frank Albertson as the fat cat who actually owned the $40,000 was quite memorable, and he seemed to relish his role as he flirted with Marion, a much younger woman. Pat Hitchcock, the director's daughter, as Marion's colleague at the real estate office was also very amusing, as she was in her father's ""Strangers on a Train"".<br/><br/>The one major flaw for me, as well as for other reviewers here, is Simon Oakland's awkward monologue at the end, which I found not only unnecessary but harmful to the film as a whole. While I didn't understand a word of it at the age of eleven, it still annoys me as a senior citizen today. Norman seated in the padded cell with the very creepy voice-over and the haunting, subtle superimposition over his image doesn't require Oakland's tedious explanation at all. What makes it even worse is the psychiatrist's odd gleefulness as he confirms Marion's horrible fate to Sam and Lila. As this is such an impressive film overall, I never allowed this awkward ending to ruin the rest of it for me."

From the stinging violin music to the murder itself, this much copied masterpiece has no peer. Its imagery was/is so memorable that it typecast Anthony Perkins for life.<br/><br/>It's also impossible to forget the look of the house on the hill, the scene with Martin Balsam on the stairway, or the ending (smiling face) view of Norman Bates (Perkins) in the padded room.

But this movie achieve to tense and frighten audience without any of these and give a new impulse to movie sector. Absolutely, step forward with its distinctive subject according to its time.

","I know exactly how to go about this, I daresay. I'm gonna begin by clearing the air as regards one defining aspect of the movie, namely that it is black and white. Now, you can rest assured- the quality is impeccable, as there are lots of movies of lower quality out there; the cast, in addition,is top-notch.And I mean it. AAAnd the black-and- white thing , if anything, is a huge PERK. You heard me! it is an advantage, amounting, all in all, to the uncertain and suspenseful vibe that the movie conveys.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm gonna be short and sweet as this is not a book review and nobody (at least I know for a thing that I detest them) really goes in for lengthy comments.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this tour-de-force is a must. A M U S T. and it isn't so because your teacher says so , or some haughty maven crows about it. It is because a friend says so- with a mere interest that people should watch art and good movies instead of preposterous time-wasters. This movie is the best psychological thriller I've ever seen( and certainly the great masterpiece people make it out to be). And there are a great deal of them. I'm not gonna ramble on about this, as there are a couple of movies that come close , but after pondering my choice well enough, I can assert that this is the best all-around, a cut above the competitors, and puts some of the nowadays tentative horror-things to shame, as the principles are timeless.<br/><br/>Pick it, no second thoughts about it. I'm gonna say just this- this is even better than Fight Club, as it is better proportioned in terms of length-content , and needless to say other praiseworthy works such as American Psycho."

","There are so many in depth reviews of Psycho. Some reviewers and message boarders have gone over the top reviewing this film and bestowing deep meanings upon it.<br/><br/>But it is a simple film at the end of the day. A square and mediocre yet beautiful woman falls in love and decides to take a risk. It is a desperate make or break attempt to escape her mundane life as a nine to five worker. But it is almost as if the whole world conspires to spoil her plans for a new life - right from the time her boss who sees her on the road as she is driving away, the nosy and sinister looking policeman, the gas station attendant and then of course ..... Norman Bates. The film then spins off into the hunt for the woman. <br/><br/>I found the first half more compelling than the second. Bernard Herrman's score is used to great effect.

"caseynicholson","9","0","1","14 August 2016"," A Great Hitchcock Suspense Film
","Let me begin by saying that I grew up in the 80's, meaning that I am of the generation that was reared in the age of ""Friday the 13th"", ""A Nightmare of Elm Street"", and ""Halloween"". Those ""slasher"" films as they're often called set the stage for later horror flicks the likes of ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", along with a slew of other more modern horror films that follow in the legacy of movies with very intense villains.<br/><br/>The first time I saw ""Psycho"" was around five years ago, and I had heard that it was the prototype of all of the above modern horror movies that I'd grown to love from my adolescence. I was quite let down, as this film is far from a Freddie, Jason, or Michael type of movie. Instead, this film is a ""horror"" film of a different time and era--the era in which Alfred Hitchcock was synonymous with the genre. And, inasmuch as that's true, ""Psycho"" has an altogether different feel than any of the post-""Exorcist"" or post-""Halloween"" horror films which have come to be more popular nowadays. Another way of putting it might be that this movie may rightly be considered a ""horror"" movie, but it's not really a ""scary"" movie by today's standards. Creepy at points? Yes. Scary? No.<br/><br/>That said, I gave this movie a second chance today at a screening at a local historic theater. This time I went into it expecting a Hitchcock movie rather than a modern horror film--and I was not let down. Expectation is everything when it comes to what you get out of a movie, and when before I went hoping for an introduction to a gruesome killer the likes of Michael Myers, I left feeling like I'd been ripped off. But when I watched this movie knowing what to expect--a film high on suspense, with a psychopath as the main villain, albeit one that is a bit cheesy by today's standards--I found myself thoroughly enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>I don't think I'm alone in feeling that this film has lost its horrific element in light of modern horror story telling. At one of the most climactic parts of the film (not the well known shower scene, but rather the climax involving Mrs. Bates later on toward the end of the movie), everyone in the theater literally laughed out loud. Perhaps not robustly, but still--the audience's reaction to a scene that was meant to be grotesque was laughter. That's how cheesy parts of this film can be by 2016 standards.<br/><br/>And yet, still, when you watch the film for what it is--a suspense filled Hitchcock movie which deals with concepts of ethics and karma, along with the story of a hermit turned psychopath, this is an extraordinary movie. <br/><br/>Two of the things that I like most about the film are the great camera work and its score. The movie is in black and white, but its picture quality is sharp (I saw it in digital projection), and the cinematography is as good as any ever put on the silver screen. And that theme song! The violins rushing this way and that--definitely one of the movie's best attributes.<br/><br/>All that said, I'm giving ""Psycho"" a score of 9/10 stars, which is much higher than I would have given it when I expected a more modern touch, and indeed much higher than I imagined myself giving the movie when I walked into the theater. Perhaps the only thing making this movie fall just short of a 10/10 is that there are a few little plot holes that seem somewhat obvious if you think things through for a moment--but I won't go into those as it would require spoiling some things. The point is that this is a great movie, so long as you know what kind of vibe to expect. I highly recommend it--just know that you're watching a suspense filled Hitchcock movie, not a modern day horror film."

","As a Horror Host on the great Internet I have shown and watched more over a number totaling easy upward of one million. Psycho starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh is by far one of the greats made by Sir Alfred Hitchcock in 1960 . The film was inspired by the killings of a psychotic that also inspired the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and many other movies. I am sure that many of you are familiar with this film but I am not going to ruin a great classic as this by giving away the ending or too much of the films happenings. It is even in this day and age considered a cinematic triumph both in story and special effects. This film's story-line could well happen today and in the future.

","To me Psicosis, is one of the best suspense movies i have ever seen, along with the fear factor that comes with it. No doubt, Alfred Hitchcock is still known as the master of suspense. Also the Music and the sound effects makes you to stay awake and focus on every movement that the actors do. What a great job either Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh did in this film which was nominated to several categories at the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. Psicosis has become a cult movie and the fact it is a black and white movie, it makes us to use our imagination in every detail of the movie. So we can picture our own colors at Psicosis. To conclude, I would say this a piece of art, this movie needs to be shown to everyone, from new cinema students, actors and those who love directing suspense movies."
"C22Man","9","0","1","16 July 2016"," Triumph of Fear
","What is so striking about Psycho is how much it differs from Hitchcock's usual stylish thrillers, even in his bleaker work like 'Vertigo'. Made with his TV crew, on a small budget and shot in black and white, the film shares more characteristics with noir and pulp than it does with his grand suspense pieces. In saying that, the film still delivers everything you would expect it to and more. It contains some of the most iconic imagery, characters and shocks ever put on screen. Being more terrifying than it had any right to be. It's Hitchcock holding the audience in the palm of his hand. And now it feels as if every important aspect of the film has become a big part of pop culture. <br/><br/>The best word to describe the film is unnerving. From the moment the plot is set in motion the sense of dread never lets up. Said plot involves Marion Crane, a secretary who steals $40,000 from a slimy customer and leaves town. We get some insight into her actions, mainly her lover Sam having to pay his ex-wife alimony and their inability to marry as a result. It's a classic Hitchcock theme of a normal person caught up in crime. Marion isn't a bad person, just one forced to do something morally wrong which she later regrets. She stops off at the deserted Bates Motel and seems to get along with the quirky but seemingly pleasant owner Norman, which includes a fascinating dialogue scene in his parlour. However, the film turns on its head, as one event completely changes what we thought the film was initially about into something else entirely. <br/><br/>Hitchcock's idea to kill off the leading lady barely halfway through proved to be a brave and ultimately inspired decision. It's a genius choice because it keeps the tension raised throughout. We know that if a main character can be axed off then surely nobody is safe. It is this thought process that provides the suspenseful moments with an added punch that makes them memorable and even more unsettling. They keep us constantly checking over each frame, afraid that anything might leap from the shadows and strike a killer blow. Playing with the audience's uncertainty and understanding just how powerful the feeling of unease can be. Bernard Herrmann's chilling, pulsating score weaves in and out of these scenes, adding even more layers of tension. <br/><br/>Despite becoming famous for its sudden violence and shocks, the film has only a few moments that rely on startling the audience. Yet because these moments aren't overused they retain the fear factor. You see very little blood or wounds or gore that is usually associated with the genre. Most of the scares come from the imagery used and the way tension is built. A good example being the highway policeman who seemingly stalks Marion, with dark sunglasses leaving his face expressionless. The scene at the car dealership is truly frightening, the way in which he simply stares at her from across the street. It's pretty amazing how so much discomfort can be built from not only something so simple but someone who is meant to be a figure of good. He represents Marion's last chance to confess her crime, which would have ultimately saved her life. It shows how much we're invested in Marion's dilemma that we are terrified of her being caught.<br/><br/>What always amazes me is just how well paced and executed the whole film is. There are long passages with minimal dialogue or plot development, where events play themselves out slowly and cautiously. And they remain effortlessly gripping throughout. A good example is Norman disposing of the body. Who'd of thought that a ten minute long sequence of cleaning up a murder scene could be so riveting? The film is deliberately sparse in that sense. A lot of time is devoted to building up the atmosphere and tension, giving us a feel of the characters and the environment that everything is taking place in. However, the dialogue heavy moments are just as engrossing. Any time Bates opens his mouth you can guarantee that something interesting will come out. The tense scene of him being grilled by detective Arbogast is a good example of that.<br/><br/>You have Hitchcock's typical blondes in Janet Leigh as the reserved Marion and Vera Miles as her more inquisitive sister, both elegant and enjoyable to watch. But the truly fascinating character is definitely Norman Bates. What a wonderfully deranged individual. A man who appears to be controlled by his mother. You can tell instantly that something is not right with him. His quirky demeanour hides something disturbed lurking below. A great deal of that is down to Anthony Perkins superb performance. The things he captures complete the character, the way he moves, stammers, smiles, defends his mother, it's all perfectly done. This film very much becomes Norman's story, his actions are what keeps the plot moving forward. He ultimately becomes the character that everyone remembers.<br/><br/>So what ends up making Psycho so memorable? I personally think it is down to how competently made and detailed it is. Hitchcock did something that many films of its ilk miss out on completely, he made the story, characters and scares all hold equal importance. The story is weaved perfectly, which in turn makes us feel something for the characters, and leads to the horror being so much more impactful. It is also the ultimate example of why atmosphere and tension will always beat gore and shock value on the scare scale. This is Hitchcock at the peak of his powers, working with a crew and cast that excel in every area and adding his own faultless direction to the mix. As a result it remains as powerful, gripping and terrifying as it has ever been."

","I watch this film in Professor Fitzsimons' class. The title, ""Psycho"", gives me the scary impression. I am afraid of shocking bloody scenes like murders, wars and accidents, so I watch the film through fear. Marion stoles money because she wants to marry his boyfriend, Sam. It is the beginning of tragedy and mystery. I watch it, with wondering who psycho is. At first, I think Marion is psycho because she stoles money and loses her credibility for so private reason, but she is not, contrary to my expectation. It interests me more in what is going to happen next or in the end. I get chills when I find who psycho is. He or she looks nice and kind in the first half of the film. I am so shocked and I nearly lapse into a distrust of humanity. However I don't hate such a surprise ending. As I said, I don't like shocking scene, so I couldn't watch the scene of murder. However, I was enough scared by the background music. It works very well to cause a lot of tension and to fill my heart with fear. This film is old, but I have heard it (maybe on ""Finding Nemo"" by Pixar). I think the background music is so famous that it is used for other movie or TV programme, also great and important for the film. Finally, please let me say this. I like Hitchcock's skills in expression. In the first half, he places taxidermy naturally and in the end, he expresses someone like taxidermy. Although I don't understand this without professor's explanation, I am moved by Hitchcock's ability and expressive power."
"filipemanuelneto","10","0","1","10 July 2016"," An immortal milestone
","This film revolves around a small roadside motel run by Norman Bates, a seemingly nice man who lives under the undisputed authority of his mother. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this film, considered by many his ""magnum opus"", has a screenplay by Joseph Stefano and a cast led by Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles.<br/><br/>I don't consider this film a horror movie, although its considered as such by most of people. It doesn't scare me, but let me uncomfortable, holding me to the screen. And I think that's what Hitchcock wanted to achieve. He was the master of suspense and knew how to hold the public, causing shivers of discomfort without putting the audience screaming in fear. The plot is brilliant, but the beginning doesn't show it, is intentionally unattractive in an effort to bring the public completely at ease... until Norman comes in. Norman Bates is one of the most psychologically complex characters I've ever seen, and was developed to the extreme by the director and the artist who gave him life. It looks like a nice guy, who even flirts with the attractive woman he just met. <br/><br/>The bathroom scene is perhaps one of the most famous in the film (I read somewhere that liquid chocolate was used to give the color that Hitchcock intended for the blood in the tub), and the incidental soundtrack used in that scene has become an icon for itself. But the end of the film is even better, with an absolutely staggering climax that makes all the audience feel that it was worth seeing the movie (even if you already know the whole story). The photograph, in black and white, makes a decisive contribution to increasing tension in the audience, and I am sure that this was a conscious and deliberate choice of Hitchcock to achieve that, showing again the great quality and talent of this director.<br/><br/>Nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Art Direction in Film Black and White, Best Cinematography in Black and White, Best Direction and Best Supporting Actress, this film didn't win any of them, which shows us that, sometimes, the Academy also makes mistakes. But ""Psycho"" doesn't need an Oscar to be a tremendous success. It is, and will remain, a milestone in film history, a cult film for Hitchcock lovers, for thriller lovers and for any lover of good movies. Movies like this one never dies, they are art... in its purest form."

","Of all the films Alfred Hitchcock is the most famous, the scariest, the most unexpired, the most innovative and unique, despite countless attempts to reproduce this success. However, during the life of the Maestro, no one dared to direct the sequel, and only in 80-e years have appeared three ""Psychosis"" and ""Psycho III"" was shot by actor Anthony Perkins, who almost all his life became a kind of hostage to his role of serial killer Norman Bates. But thousands of all kinds of thrillers, chillers, suspension, shockers and other newly formed genres, efforts were made to intimidate the audience with what Hitchcock techniques. It would seem that ""Psychosis"" was to suffer the fate of some outstanding paintings pilfered, that is, on HR and even angles. The halo of glory around masterpieces often makes overly picky to determine their real incorruptibility. But ""Psychosis"" still draws from the first seconds, holds incredible tension and scares to shiver. Alfred Hitchcock was sensitive to the internal mechanism of the creation of fear and like an experienced psychiatrist, he knew of a secret nerve endings, touching whom are able to bring a state of uncontrolled psychosis, a genuine nightmare. Unlike many imitators, the ""master of fear knew that fear breeds deep within us and not outside. The Director forces us to be afraid primarily of their own assumptions, conjecture, foreboding, happening fancy, just designing myself a terrible starting situation. The viewer inevitably identifies himself with a young Secretary Marion crane, caught by night in a secluded Motel. His owner Norman Bates has a secret, which unravels along with the heroine, who is in double danger, as her on suspicion of stealing money from the Bank is wanted by the police. And it is precisely the nightmare that is hidden in everyday reality, psychosis seemingly normal world — that is the main thing, the fear of the people in the tapes of Hitchcock.<br/><br/>In the ""Psychosis"" this feeling pushed to the limit, to the border territory, beyond which is the abyss of madness. And, accordingly, honed to perfection all cinematic techniques, means of artistic expression: from the brilliant to the oppressive music of Bernard Herrmann. The genuine innovations in which formal search is always meaningful, ""tied up"" in the story and accurately understood, still continue to strongly influence several decades later. And in the movie, as in most technical form of art, famous works, and especially, with innovative refinements, saved even harder. This film is still an absolute masterpiece of cinematic professionalism, skillful involvement of spectators in the game of fear. Incidentally, he was also among the most cash in the long career of Hitchcock (budget of $0.8 million was surpassed at the box office in forty times!), and the picture looked in the USA, over fifty million viewers."

","This is one of the best horror films you'll watch in your life, and no this review is not just another band-wagon follower. This movie isn't overrated and its reputation isn't exaggerated. It truly is excellence if you've ever seen it on the silver screen. The utilization of the protagonists is unique and makes for a standout dynamic in this film, while at the end the twist is truly completely unexpected. And I'm saying this now at a time when we've seen it all in every possible way, so at the time this was just light-years ahead of its cinematic period all things considered. All actors play their part just fine and help establish at each moment, along with the excellent cinematography (all in subtlety and allusion) and soundtrack, a particular feel, or a specific lingering emotion. It's really very well done, and some parts are just spot-on like it is rare in film. But Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates just steals the show here amongst the cast. In this film, there is an unsettling weirdness that oozes out of him, and it is never overdone, nor is it ever unremarkable. It's just...just right. Moreover, the plot revolves around a fairly common, and very real occurrence: the Oedipus complex. And it's so well carried out throughout the film, and never gives in to over-exaggeration although it would remain of course a very extreme case. But never does this turn into overdramatic cheesy 60's horror cinema, and the tensions are handled perfectly, as always with Hitchcock, cleverly and meticulously. The only criticism I would give this is the too obvious explanation at the end and overall that ultimate elaboration scene just isn't realistic, in regards to a few things. Finally, the very last scene with Norman Bates' inner-monologue, and the way Perkins acts it out, and that smile. Just ...perfect."

","This movie really influenced horror movies today so its a great film and easy to appreciate. The use of loud and sharp music adds to the fear. The shower scene is a great example of a lot of things the music that starts to play to imply something sinister is about to happen. The Hand holding the knife and the terrified expressions. All of that is intense. The most brutal part to me though is actually after the killing because the girl is just dead on the shower floor and all wee see is her face and the entire time the shower Is still running that right there is chilling. The shower still going is so genuine the fact that the clip doesn't end right after the act just makes the murder feel real like shes dead and there is nothing left but the water. This film is filled with groundbreaking shots. That being said I find Hitchcock to be a little corny in instances.

I feared for the danger of the innocent lives, but in a way, I also felt the fear of the killer's private details being exposed as well.<br/><br/>I like how Psycho initially tries to be one kind of movie and then startles the viewer once it develops into an entirely different animal.

","This film by Alfred Hitchcock does a very good job of hiding the twist ending that comes. My summary line doesn't even begin to tell of what one can expect to see when viewing this film. Through use of close-ups, Hitchcock shows us the facial expression of how a particular character feels by minor changes in their face, even more so their eyes. He enjoys the use of reverse shots, but in his case, I feel they up the sense of suspense through primarily upping the tension one feels during this movie after the famous shower scene. Because if that happened within the first 20 minutes of the film, when will the next, over an hour, time left of this film?! So Hitchcock already has us invested and a bit uneasily inquisitive, to where we're itching to want to low what happens next. The magnetic film is also accentuated by the use of voice-overs not by the on- screen person. The 2 main ones are during the time Marion Crane rushed away into the night after she's committed her crime; the second was at the end, when inner voices, voices that may or may not be one's own, come out to play and act very ""tell tale heart"" with how easily the latter contributes. This film will shock, captivate, and engaging discussion, and a lack of realism that is beneficial to the telling of the film. If one has not seen it, buyer beware, the shower scene will forever be scorched into your memory."
"J-Hargett","10","0","1","6 May 2016"," The best classic horror film to date
","Psycho is without question in my mind, the most intrigued and best display of a thriller/horror film to date. Beginning with Alfred Hitchcock's iconic style, Psycho is a classic Hitchcock film in its anxious, innovative, voyeuristic, and suspenseful camera angles and movements. The film also has a great twist ending that Hitchcock often favored in his films. The voyeuristic camera angles gives the film suspense and anxiety as you feel like you're there watching the violence unfold. Hitchcock pushed the envelope of the time with Psycho and its inherent sex and violence which aids in its timelessness. The story is riveting and kept me engrossed through the films entirety. The events unfold in true Hitchcock fashion leading up to a brilliant climax with a compelling twist. Anthony Perkins' adept performance as the charismatic yet suspicious Norman Bates only aded to the film's grace and tact. Norman Bates' character development is amazing to watch as it is slowly fed to us little by little; as well as other characters such as Marion and Lila Crane, or Norma Bates. Psycho is a classic horror movie that defined the very essence of the horror and psychological thriller genre. It is a film i throughly enjoyed and will continue to enjoy as it is highly re-watchable to me. The film is just simply, perfectly executed."

","Alfred Hitchcock is so much more than a film director. He is the prototype for the making of suspense thrillers, an exemplar of genius filmmaking, and the innovator of true terror. Hitchcock changed film forever when he released his box office record breaking phenomena Psycho. With an explosive cast starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and Janet Leigh, Psycho is a work of cinematic art. Said to have been the very first slasher film Psycho had both a cinematic and a social influence. Hitchcock opens the film with what many believe to be one of the best opening credit sequences of all time. He splits the words as they come across the screen alluding to what we are going to find out later about Mr. Bates. The story starts with us meeting Marion Crane (played by the beautiful Vera Miles). Hitchcock portrays Marion in a way that regardless of the crime she may be committing the audience cannot help but to root for her. Even though we watch her commit this crime Hitchcock paints it in a way that we do feel like she is justified. She steals the money from a man that does not appear to deserve it and her motive for taking the money is love. Hitchcock even alludes that she was going to return the money but she is murdered before she has the chance to. Which is why the stabbing in the shower scene is so horrifying and to this day seen as one of the most influential scenes in film history. Audiences during this time were not used to their protagonist dying suddenly. This scene was influential in the sense that it influenced society the same way films like Jaws and The Blair Witch Project did. The shower scene made something that normally would not be associated as scary terrifying. After Psycho's release people were afraid to shower showing the influence Hitchcock had even outside the theater. Anthony Perkins gives a stunning performance of Norman Bates, a severely troubled man who appears to live alone with his mother. After our protagonist is murdered, the audience has no choice but to sympathize and find a new one. This is so meticulously done by Hitchcock it is barley even noticed. We start to root for Norman because we do not yet know he is the murderer but associate him as a dedicated son. We watch him cover up the countless number of startling murders his mother commits until we find out that he is actually playing the role of his mother in one of the biggest plot twists of all time. Psycho has indisputably become one of the most renowned films in history. It has influenced an entire genre and has become the blueprint of great horror films. To this day it is seen as frightening for first time viewers and will continue to inspire filmmaker's worldwide."

","Excellent film, a real classic. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. The score is iconic and the film wouldn't be the same without it. Anthony Perkins's performance was brilliant and complex. I already had a vague understanding of his character prior to viewing the film, but I was shocked once Norman Bates' many layers were revealed to the camera. There was never a dull moment in this movie, and almost every part of the plot came as a surprise. Hitchcock is a terrific director and the suspense in Psycho never faltered. The lighting and editing augmented the cloak and dagger mood of the film. There was an excellent use of shadow to show everything that was happening without compromising the plot. Nothing in the movie quite happened as expected, making it the perfect thriller."

The directorial style of Hitchcock spellbinds you once you are halfway through the film.

So many classic scenes, music, etc, etc. I watched this in two different cinema classes, and we talked about it in my third cinema class. I have watched it a good few times and I will say that it is a good movie, but there are certain movies that are too dissected and too reviewed and they lose their magic. For some people, this does not happen, but for me, it does. Pieces of work done by artists should just be free to interpretation, not to reviews or dissection. This probably does not make sense, and I am sorry. I hope this was somehow informative, but it probably was not."
"barryrd","9","0","1","21 April 2016"," Psycho Superb!
","This is a splendid movie that shows Alfred Hitchcock at the top of his form. This movie came right after North by Northwest, also by Hitchcock, so it has to be one of the best one-two punches by a director in film history. The first half of the movie, dominated by the character of Marion Crane, is to me, the superior part, without any disrespect to the rest of the film. Janet Leigh's controlled performance is so convincing we feel every nerve-wracking moment after that first excruciating misdeed. From the opening scene over the skyline of Phoenix into the hotel room of Marion and Sam, I was drawn into the movie in a way that only a great movie can achieve. Audiences often complain that a movie can seldom measure up to a good book; however, a great movie can do visual tricks and show nuances very effectively in the hands of a great director. This movie is a case in point. The camera zooms into an envelope holding $40,000 or a peephole where Anthony Perkins, as Norman Bates, observes Marion undressing. The music is like chalk on a blackboard as the sharp violin strings heighten the nauseating fear that we feel along with Marion. The closeup of the police officer in sunglasses is almost terrifying. The pounding of the rain on the windshield is something almost everyone can feel and in this case, it seems like the world is crowding in on Marion. Scene by scene we go from one vignette to another. Vera Miles, as Marion's sister, and John Gavin, as Marion's lover, give brilliant performances as they try to get to the truth of Marion's disappearance. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Martin Balsam as Abrogast, the private eye. Anthony Perkins gives his career defining role, although he had many great roles. This was the only Hitchcock role for Leigh and Petkins and they made these characters their own. Highly recommend because it shows the great potential of film/making."

How are filmmakers able to successfully use villains as the hero? There are a couple articles that look into this question a little more, it also looks into why they use the hero.

Pedalino tells us that the filmmakers are playing more towards the real life scenarios. While watching the hero defeat the villain is satisfying it is not real life, and people soon forget their feelings towards the film. Whereas watching a scenario where the villain either defeats the hero or gets very close to doing so, leaves us with mixed feelings."

","It's funny to see so many reviews of this classic marked for spoilers because the shower murder scene of Marion Crane is perhaps the most prominent example of film being embedded into the cultural psyche - and then parodied and mimicked so much that it birthed an entire new genre. It is Hitchcock's greatest use of montage - each cut as an assault on the audience's senses, each as another slash of the knife to Crane's dripping, screaming face. Eisenstein's theory means we do not actually see knife ever puncture flesh, but the separate images creates a merged meaning. And would it be half as iconic without Bernard Herrmann's contribution? The screeching strings are built up apprehensively before the pivotal scene, and when they finally match up with the knife, it slips in seamlessly with each slash, each cut, and it is frantic, horrifying. <br/><br/>Hitchcock made history by killing her sensuous lead star less than halfway into his movie, but his mastery is shown in how effortlessly he moves our sympathies from the blonde to Norman Bates (actually they are not so different; compare the last, wicked smile with the furrow of the brow and the sneaking grin of Leigh in the exchanged car, as night's darkness descends on her but the light illuminates her face all the same - and those mischievous eyebrows!). We are continually shown the cop in the distance, a latent anxiety that makes the car swap all for naught. And we expect this to pan out somehow. This anxiety becomes Norman's as he discovers the murder - quickly, briefly, absentmindedly, as if he was just changing the sheets, he cleans up the mess. He puts on his boyish, gangly persona back on, and we pause as he does, hoping too the car will resume bubbling and sinking. And as his social facade is shaken by probing questions, we rally for him to regain his confidence and wish the detective away. <br/><br/>Perkins is at the film's centre, with a brilliant, brilliant performance. With each rewatch it becomes a game to note his marked switches of his persona, his adoption of the psychopath's empty chuckle and stare. The social skills breakdowns are subtle; just a tiny pause, an awkward question, but not enough to make Crane too apprehensive. His wary eyes darting around just ever so slightly. His 'hobby' of taxidermy treads on the line between normal and deranged, but it is not until later do we recognise the sexual motif of the birds (his mother being his first stuffed corpse) and the way Perkin's body language uncannily points towards his internal psychological delusion. As if we did not receive the message clearly, Hitchcock superimposes a skull onto that final, chilling stare. <br/><br/>Hitchcock also went to great lengths to hide his mystery whilst not compromising his visuals. The shadow behind the shower curtain and illuminating only the feminine wig. The bird's eye view of Arbogast's demise, complete with rear projection effect so it feels like he is falling into the stairs (not dissimilar to Hitchcock's own dolly zoom). The female silhouette high up in the Bates second-story window (it is not so far-fetched to imagine Norman propping up his late mother and having conversations with her). In one instance, the lazy-eye of the sheriff seems to address the audience itself and ask: ""Who then is that woman buried in the Bates grave?"" I have come to accept the final psychiatrist's explanation as a necessary evil; it was a different time, as evident by Hitchcock's promos which forbid late entrants to theatre showings. Would a modern viewer ever entertain the idea of walking in halfway through a film only to realise the star had already been killed off? But Hitchcock set a precedent; no doubt viewers were all thoroughly confused to find Leigh bubbling under the swamp, but it only piqued their curiosity, their determination to unravel the mystery of Psycho."

"one-nine-eighty","9","0","1","5 April 2016"," An absolute master-class in film
","An absolute classic, if you haven't seen this yet you must have been living under a rock Shame on you for not watching it and make a note to immediately get a copy and watch it. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? <br/><br/>I could tell you that Janet Leigh only ever took baths after watching the famous shower scene played out on a big screen and realising how vulnerable women in showers were. I could tell you that liquid chocolate was used for blood to make it look more authentic in black and white in the film. I could tell you that Hitchcock decided to film in black and white on purpose because he wanted to keep the costs down and also because he was fed up with the star studded glossy films of the time. I could even tell you that Bernard Herrmann's musical score inspired Hitchcock to double the fee Herrmann was receiving, especially after seeing and hearing the shower scene which Hitchcock had originally intended to be silent. <br/><br/>This film has been talked about, written about, studied and idolised to death - but deservedly so, so lets not look at trivia and facts and progress with this review. <br/><br/>Psycho is a departure from the standard horror movies of the time which generally had physical monsters in them. This film looked more at the human psyche and how much of a horror your average Joe Anybody could be - and believe me Anthony Perkins does a fine job on delivering that. The film helped to break a lot of stereotypes which Hollywood had in place and with it's perfectly emotional delivery the films is an absolute master-class on how to make something out of seemingly very little.<br/><br/>This is arguably Hitchcock's finest film and plays on many emotions through sight, sound and feel. An amazing cast of stars bring the characters to life, the setting is authentic and feels right and the musical score (Bernard Herrmann) is just as famous as the film itself, both rely heavily on each other to deliver perfection but it could equally be said that they would be brilliant standing alone too. Although I wasn't around during the 60's and 70's I have been led to believe that this film is as authentic as it comes for summing up the era and this is absolutely down to Hitchcock vision. If you sit down having not seen this before you could mistakenly think this is a robbery/heist based film with the leading lady, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) on the run from her employer for stealing $40k. Although stealing is bad Marion being the central lead assumes the role of heroine and the audience are almost encouraged to root for her. As it turns out the money is not that important and soon takes a back seat to the plot - albeit the other characters looking for Marion are motivated in part by the desire to find the money and clear or validate the accusation Marion is facing. Up until arriving at the Bates motel you are only fed snippets of information about Marion, any time you get close to discovering more about her via the other characters, they are soon met with a dead end. Norman Bates (Perkins) seems to manage to delve the deepest into Marion but what he finds out isn't happy news to his mothers ears. <br/><br/>I'm not going to delve too much into the plot of the rest of the film in case you haven't seen it - the last thing I wasn't to do is spoil the ending (if you are one of a few people who haven't actually seen this). What I will say is watch this and enjoy, it's a good old fashioned horror film which has embedded itself in pop culture and the halls of film legend due to it's depth, charm and it's absolute quality."

","Psycho is one of those rare perfect horror films that manages to show no blood or gore. Psycho is less than two hours but manages to show you just how smart Alfred Hitchcock is. While most of the parts are just there to build suspense the big ending when you find out that Norman Bates has been playing the role of his mother for the last ten years and has been having conversations with himself in his mothers voice while living in a small house near the Bates Motel you are truly frightened. But near the end while Norman Bates is in a cell at the police station you can hear his inner thoughts, Norman Bates then looks at the camera and smiles and for a brief second you can see his mothers skull.

","Recorded in 1960, Psycho is a film that will remain an ageless classic due to chiefly to the superb storytelling of Alfred Hitchcock. Similar to Robert Wise's film The Haunting, Hitchcock is able to use the audience's imagination against them. Just like the fact that no ghosts are visible in The Haunting, Psycho does not actually show violence. Instead, it is implied and more terrifying that way. Hitchcock's use of sound in this movie makes it more suspenseful as well. Particular creepy is the sharp violin music that plays just before a character is brutally murdered. Hitchcock also uses foreshadowing to create added levels of suspense throughout the film.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane in the film. She steals $40,000 from her employer in an attempt to get away from the daily stresses of life with actor John Gavin who plays character Sam Loomis. Marion flees Phoenix to join Sam in Fairvale, but the journey is long and Marion is forced to stop for the night. Fearing that she will be caught, Marion chooses to stay at a run-down hotel that is off the beaten track. It is at this hotel where Marion meets Norman Bates who is played by Anthony Perkins. Unknown to Marion, Norman is a violent psychopath who develops an alter ego as his mother. Unable to control himself, Norman eventually stabs Marion to death, puts her body in the truck of her car, and pushes her car into a muddy pond on the property to dispose of the evidence.<br/><br/>After Marion's mysterious disappearance, her sister Lila who played by Vera Miles, goes in search of her at Sam's place of employment in Fairvale. Actor Martin Balsam plays Private Detective Arbogast who is hired to track down Marion and the missing money. Arbogast assumes that Marion went to see Sam, so he questions Sam and Lila about her whereabouts. With no leads to go on, Arbogast tries to retrace what would most likely have been Marion's trip from Phoenix to Fairvale. It is during his investigation that Arbogast stops at the Bates Motel and talks to Norman. Norman eventually admits that Marion was at his hotel, but claims that she left. Unconvinced, Arbogast alerts Sam and Lila that he has found a trail and that he is going back to try and talk to Norman's mother.<br/><br/>In order to know what will come of the investigation, one will have to watch the film. However, one thing is very clear and that is the theme of this film. Be wary of traveling alone and not letting anyone know where you are going because you never know when you will run into someone like Norman Bates."

","WOW is all I can say . At first I wasn't into it because I thought it might be boring because of the black and white, but I'm glad that I stayed tuned to uncover mistaken identities and truth. Marion Crane played an astonishing role as a pretty, innocent, lovely woman, disguising her mischief. Although she had stole money I hoped for her to get away safely. Unfortunately she encounters a dangerous person, Norman Bates, who although is by far the most disturbed person, he has to be my favorite character. He made his role believable, shocking the audience with his dark, mentally illed mind when he turned out to be acting as his mother when all the while she was dead for years. All alone, he made it seem like there were two people in that house where he stayed. Confused, Marion was in for the worst from the beginning and her death was tragic. The killer was definitely a mystery until the end when you find out it was Norman acting as his deceased jealous mother. This movie was crazy, it was exciting after the murder because everyone thought Marion had ran away with the money. Norman kept his cool around her family when they came looking for her, until her sister discovers his mother's dead body in the basement and Norman is forced to reveal himself as the real killer, of his mother, and Marion. It's kind of creepy that he does this, but I love the acting and the multi tasking that he does , and how he leads the audience on to believe the mother was actually alive and killed her. This is a great movie, I loved it . It's a good example of mystery and thriller. Although it is a older movie it is a good modern story because Norman's sickness is a modern disease."

","SPOILER ALERT: Norman Bates committed the murders. PSYCHO has been around for over 50 years, and if you haven't seen it by now it's your own fault. Of course, it's been several years since I first saw it and, going through a Hitchcock marathon, I thought it would be an appropriate time to revisit it. My only memories of seeing it the first time are wondering what the big deal was. However, now having seen many films since then (including several more Hitchcock pictures), it seems even better to me the second time around. This is in large part thanks to the Bernard Herrmann's score, which punctuates all the right moments and backs off when necessary. The first thing other than the main theme that people will probably think of is the celebrated shower scene, but this time the moments where the score takes a back seat, or goes away entirely, stood out more. In particular, the scene where Norman and Marion have dinner in his parlor came off as extremely creepy, and the way in which Norman's demeanor changes within that scene was nothing short of amazing. Also, in contrast to NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO has a rear-projected driving scene which actually worked for me. Again, a lot of this has to do with the score, but Janet Leigh's facial expressions and reactions to what goes on around her helped just as much to make it work. What also makes this film stand out from a lot of Hitchcock's other pictures was the conscious artistic choice to shoot in black and white. Although he said it would have been too gory to shoot in color, it gives the film a distinct griminess that stands in contrast to the high glamour of his other work. PSYCHO is decidedly unglamorous, and it succeeds because it fits with the subject matter. Lastly, Hitchcock is notorious for playing with audience expectations, and PSYCHO contains perhaps his greatest cinematic joke: the (apparent heroine) is killed off nearly halfway in to the film. Now her death does provide the dramatic momentum for the rest of it, but I can only imagine how audiences 1960 would have been shocked by this twist. In terms of his overall corpus (at least what I've seen so far), I'd put it up there with REAR WINDOW and NORTH BY NORTHWEST just shy of VERTIGO. The only thing that brings it down a peg is some needless psychoanalysis in the last scene. For me, it would have been more powerful to cut most of that out and skip to the chilling final shot that gradually zooms in on Anthony Perkins' face. Still, even with that scene, PSYCHO is definitely one of Hitchcock's finest, and laid the groundwork for the next generation of horror films."

"GrungeFan1996","9","0","1","1 July 2015"," An American Classic!
","First of all, I'd like to point this out, Psycho is a psychological thriller, not a horror movie, so don't expect a bunch of jump scares or gory scenes, so if you want that, watch the Friday The 13th Series or something. Psycho is undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time! Director Alfred Hitchcock really hit it home with this one. Psycho is about a woman named Marion who steals $40,000 and drives out to Fairville California with the intention of giving the money to her boyfriend Sam. On the way to Fairville, she stops at a motel called the Bates Motel, where she intended to spend the night before finishing her drive. The Bates Motel is run by a young man named Norman Bates who seems harmless, but stutters a lot in his speech. Marion is murdered that night in the motel. A few days later, she (obviously) has not been seen since she left for Fairville, a detective named Arbogast, Marion's sister Lila, and Sam go to look for her, and well, I won't spoil the rest. This film is not scary in terms of jump scares and violence, seeing as there is a very low body count, but it is scary because of the fact that things like these actually happen and you could be a victim of murder. The first half of the film is where the film shines, with fantastic acting and it builds up to the final standoff. The final 20 minutes are typical, cliché moments that we've all seen in thrillers, but Psycho is able to do it without being boring or repetitive. The film has a great ending that you'll probably never forget. Psycho is a classic and a landmark in American filmmaking, one of Hitchcock's greatest pieces of film! 9/10!"

","Psycho is the most interesting movie I've watched. EVER. After stealing $40,000 from the bank where she works ($40,000 is worth more then than it is now) and wants to drive to where her boyfriend lives. But before she can get there, a huge thunderstorm starts and she takes cover at Bates Motel. At the desk is a shy, nice man, who gives her a room and invites her to dinner. The rest is permanently engraved in horror movie history! Norman Bates is a truly sympathetic villain. In fact, I shouldn't even be calling him a villain. It wasn't his fault that he grew creepily close to his mother, it wasn't his fault that he thought he was her. Anyone would act like that if they grew close with a crazy, demanding, over-bearing mother. His mental illness took over creating the last, creepy, narration by him, or, more correctly, his 'mother'. I don't think anyone was suspecting that twist at the end...I know I wasn't! Psycho isn't ridiculously scary, and you probably won't start screaming during the famous shower scene, but you will be creeped out. And, in my opinion, being creeped out is MUCH more fun than being scared. Thanks for reading my review, now go watch Psycho!"

","Never seeing this film or any other work of Alfred Hitchcock, I was intrigued to see what many people loved about him. There is just something different about him, but in a good way. First of all, Psycho was released in 1960 in black and white. At this point in film history, almost every single movie that was released was in color and watching this film definitely gave it the feeling of a film released in the 1930s-40s. The shower murder scene is one of the most famous scenes in film history and is definitely worth noting. Never seeing the scene in its entirety, I wasn't sure what to expect. Originally I was a little bit disappointed in the realism of the scene but after further analysis, I realized that Hitchcock might have done this on purpose just to fit his mold of uniqueness. Overall, I was a fan of the film as the suspense seemed to build tremendously behind a very creepy character of Norman Bates. I'm not sure if I would call myself a huge Alfred Hitchcock fan but his work is certainly unique."

","There's a shower in this movie...even if you haven't seen Psycho you know this. I really wish people continued to follow Alfred Hitchcock's request to not talk about this movie after you see it. I found the first half boring because everyone knows about the infamous shower! But after that...it got scarier because I didn't know anything post-shower. Okay I knew about Norman's mother but that's beside the point! This movie did manage to creep me out, especially the last shot. If there's one thing I love about this movie, it has to be the music. The music plays your nerves like a fiddle, and it is fantastic. Even Hitchcock himself said the music makes this movie. If you're looking for a suspenseful thriller, then stop by the Bates Motel and stay a while...speaking of the Bates Motel, I haven't seen that show yet, but I hear it's good."

","I've seen this long before the film classes I took. I remember watching it for the first time and really liking it, and it struck me as a different film I could thoroughly enjoy simply for its content and camera work. Of course it had the famous shower scene, but how everything was put together was just so, so pretty. Its black and white film is stunning and crisp, and even the opening credits were interesting to watch.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure why certain characters did what they did since it sometimes made them seem out of character, but I guess for the sake of its environment and sequence of events it made sense for what it was. The lighting was great too, especially when the main lead talks with Norman with his taxidermy in the hotel rooms. It looks so eerie yet it draws you in and you want to know more about it when you see it. That and I could see how this movie could be so inspirational for future filmmakers, especially with shows based off of this film like Bates Motel (which I need to watch), simply because Norman's relationship with his mother was mysterious and vague, yet the film showed just enough for you to get the best impression without too much of an explanation. Then again, would anyone really want to know? Considering what happened? All in all, a pretty good watch and something I would recommend to anybody looking for something interesting to watch."
"nicole10221991","10","0","1","27 April 2015"," the ""horror"" movie that changed everything!
","i first watched this movie when i was nine years old and what stuck with me at that young age was the infamous shower scene. as i grew older (im 23 now) i appreciated the movie on many different levels. the first thing i will say is because of this well acted, well directed and nerve wracking film the horror movie genre was changed for the better. before Hitchcock came around there were horror monsters like Dracula and The Wolfman. Psycho gives us a look at a real threat, an average good looking man. Because of this movie that ""showed"" a woman being stabbed to death we now have all these other horror films from Friday the 13th to Saw. Psycho is the reason horror is what it is today. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates was absolutely fantastic! He is cute yet downright insane, something even today most people would look past. we have always wanted to believe that a killer looks gross, crazy or evil not good looking and Anthony Perkins gave us that. The ending is perhaps the greatest in horror history. when Vera miles finds the corpse of Mrs. bates in the cellar and Anthony Perkins appears dressed as his dead mother with a knife.. awesome! words really cant describe this movie, it is so much more than brilliant. it is technically the first slasher film and with good reason, you have mystery, murder and insanity! anyone who appreciates good horror and mystery should watch this, the acting is genuine, you really feel for the victim (janet leigh) and Norman Bates which is hard to do. Psycho makes you feel sorry for the killer as much as the victim. Bravo Mr. Hitchcock!"

","What more can be said about Psycho other than 'WOW'. Psycho isn't just an iconic horror film, it's an icon completely as an item and a piece of art. The film that cemented Hitchcock's star in the hall of cine-fame, Psycho narrates the infamous story of Norman Bates and his warped motel, inhabited by the elusive silhouette of his over-bearing mother. When a beautiful young runaway flees work with a chunk of her employer's money, of course her first thought is to check into the nearest motel, inevitably leading to one of the most notoriously scary scenes in cinema. Worth a watch in all kinds of weather, the film was nominated for four Academy Awards upon release and features a young Janet Leigh and a handsome Anthony Perkins. Scary, extremely tense and mildly psycho-sexual, Psycho is great."

","Psycho is truly a great example of the ending of 'classic Hollywood.' Director, Alfred Hitchcock is now a household name. This horror film was the begging for a new generation of movie types and movie goers. In an attempt to not make the movie too graphic the camera angles were mostly looking right at a characters face, relying on their acting to key the viewer into what is going on. The director also doesn't really use too many dim lights in the scenes where the most horrific things take place. This is an odd difference to the typical horror film we are used to seeing. However i do not feel that this in anyway took away the overall feel of the movie, and the horror scenes within."

","I cannot decide whether Psycho is good film or not. It is easy to understand the story of this film but a word and existence of psychopath has been spread by this film and it has made the world that allows to reduce a punishment because of psychopath. While I was watching this film, I was frightened because I felt as if I would be killed by someone. In other words, I feel realism when I watch this film. One thing which has us felt realism is camera-work and sound effects. For example, Hitchcock connected a lot of short scenes without a break, which is called montage. It relieves tension of frightening and also a monochrome relieves it too. While Hitchcock removes scares a little, he leaves some fright points. Another thing is angles. In this film, a main character is not decided, so the story is described by a few people' angle and our sympathies for the person who is described mainly then are switched immediately. Finally, I'll mention about the whole picture of this film. I think this film is composed of three parts. As I mentioned before, the main character is not set clearly so our sympathies change quickly. I think the main character is Norman. In the first part, Marion is described mainly, however, she is not the main character any more in the after parts. After that, the main is Norman. I don't know the meaning of the first part. I wonder Hitchcock can make it more surprising."
"wandereramor","8","0","2","31 August 2014"," Man, this is the weirdest adaptation of A Rose For Emily I've ever seen
","A woman with a secret meets a man working at an out-of-the-way motel. He is neurotic but charming, and the two of them decide to eat dinner together. She learns about his problems getting out from under his domineering mother, and encourages him to stand up for himself. And then he stabs her to death.<br/><br/>Psycho works so well not because it is gory or innately terrifying but because it uses the familiar tropes of romantic comedy to set up a string of horrific murders. It suggests that the ordinary people we like or even feel sorry for are just as dangerous as the ones we instinctively fear. Norman Bates' twisted psyche ties together love, violence, and the Oedipal complex -- Hitchcock's favourite themes, perhaps never realized so well.<br/><br/>I've always been something of a Hitchcock skeptic, and Psycho contains its share of the overcomplication and affectedness that often dogs his work. There's a lot of glut here -- the whole plot line of Marian stealing the money, the tedious investigation sequence after the first murder, and the clumsy exposition that puts everything in a neat little box at the end. If Psycho is great, it's not because of Hitchcock but because of Anthony Perkins, who makes Norman Bates somehow pitiable and terrifying at the same time. The scenes he shares with Janet Leigh are captivating, and more than make up for the less memorable material surrounding them.<br/><br/>Psycho may not live up to its reputation, but it's still well worth a look. You won't get a more pure exhibition of Hitchcock's obsessions than this, and you're not likely to see a better performance anytime soon."

","I do realize how ground-breaking this film was. I was born a year before the premiere, and it was still widely talked about ten to twelve years later. Janet Liegh was yet another of Alfred Hitchcock's cold blondes. And it is hard to do a better tormented crazy than Anthony Perkins. But I am not at all sure that this film has aged well. Some of Hitchcock's iconic visual images, such as the camera looking into the shower head, and the camera following the detectives face in tight as he is falling down the stairs, are still being copied today. But there is so much ""arty"" direction today that it badly distracts from the films. And that sort of blows back on Psycho. Still a classic nonetheless."

","Although the background conflict drive is introduced very early in the beginning, the story took quite a long time to build up until the first real conflict occurs. And it takes up to about half an hour to reach the real focus of the movie. The thriller aspect is kept very nicely using the conversation dialog with the camera shooting elsewhere or at outside of the conversation's room. The conflict's final climax is indeed a great twist. It may even be one of the best twists of its time. I like how the movie retains focus after the the character that has been the sole focus of the movie is depicted dead. The acting is just a decent one. What's quite irritating to me is that most of the male actors try very hard to have the fake commanding accent. Janet Leigh acted nice enough, though. She handled her gestures nice in making the conversations more alive."

","The rule of thumb for any movie, good or bad, is to never give away the ending, especially if there is a twist at the end, and Psycho has the biggest twist ending in any movie. But the reason why this movie is so great is that, by the way it's shot, paced, acted and filmed, the twist still shocks you, even when you know it. That's the magic of Hitchcock's directing, that his movies can't be spoiled because all the scenes work together perfectly. The shower scene is one of the most parodied and copy scenes in movie history, and yet watching this movie, and experiencing everything that happened before it, the scene is able to shock you. I won't give away the ending, but if you do know the ending, don't think the movie has been spoiled for you, in my opinion, this movie is impossible to spoil."
"lachlan-mcdougall","7","0","2","15 May 2014"," When is too much Hitchcock too much Hitchcock?
","As always, Hitchcock has to be regarded as the consummate film-maker. Psycho builds upon his lavish traditions of suspense building, sly camera work, and jarring shocks delivering everything one wants from the great Auteur dabbling his toes in the waters of horror.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around The Bates Motel in which the Freudian wet-dream of a proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) murders unsuspecting women out of some hazy, deep-seated love-hate relationship with his mother. Little more is really needed to form the set-up for an early example of what has come to be known as 'slasher flick'. Also, one doesn't want to give too much of the plot away while writing here as some (such as me until a few nights ago) have managed to avoid seeing this film so far.<br/><br/>What I will talk about, however, is the fantastic camera-work that has gone into this film. Hitchcock makes expert use of his decision to produce this film in black and white (some claim he did it to reduce to the gore, others that he did it as a cost cutting measure) casting his demented antagonist in half shadows, highlighting his ambiguity of self and drawing the viewer into his dark, half-formed world of shadows and madness. The conversation scene between Bates and the beautiful Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), for example, is one of the most wonderfully awkward and subtly terrifying dialogue driven moments in the history of cinema, and, of course, no-one can forget the deftly handled and instantly recognisable shower scene.<br/><br/>My issues with this film lie precisely and paradoxically in the things that make it so wonderful, however. I mean, Hitchcock's self-conscious and self-aware self-referentiality and toying with Truffaut's Auteur theories are wonderful as an exercise in film theory, but Psycho, at times, runs the risk of piling signature atop signature until it becomes somewhat a pastiche of Hitchcock's own style. The death of Marion so early in the piece, the bird motif, and the unbelieving policeman are all nice flourishes from a film-school perspective, but at the same time they come across as snide and self-important.<br/><br/>Now, I won't criticise the man and his style too much, but I will say that Psycho is perhaps not the best example of Hitchcock's ability to weave high-art film-theory in with his genre fiction fantasies of murder and mayhem.<br/><br/>Still though, Psycho is up there as one of the finest and earliest in the grand tradition of slasher horror, and as a genre film it really can't get enough kudos. Sharply directed, shot, and edited it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats thrilled to the max even a full fifty years after its initial release, and I imagine it will continue to be a favourite of many switched on film buffs for many, many years to come. An undeniable masterpiece of horror cinema, and a film that must be watched to truly become a part of cinema culture."
"launsbachc","Null","0","1","9 May 2014"," Pushing the envelope
","Alfred Hitchcock is one of America's most famous classic Hollywood directors. A contributor to this is his directing of one of America's most famous horror films, Psycho. Aside from being extremely captivating and an overall great film the movie has a lot of significance in terms of both historic significance and social significance. For film history Psycho was one of the first and most iconic films to really push the envelope on what the current rating system, studio exects, and viewers would allow and embrace. The studio was not very keen on the subject matter and screenplay. In anticipation it would be a dud because of what they thought to be its bad taste, Hitchcock was granted a very low budget to make the film and most of the profits were to go to him. This proved to be a mistake. Psycho was a huge hit among audiences and made Hitchcock a very rich and well known director. Audiences praised Hitchcock and the movie. The reason for the studios and some others distaste in the film were its all around subject matter and some of the gory, revealing scenes. Obviously the most notable is the shower scene in which Norman Bates is seen murdering Marion Crane as she takes a shower. The scene was highly controversial because it revealed an unprecedented amount of nudity, blood, and violence for that time period. This kind of event was never (never ever ever) revealed in a film before. It is now easily the most iconic scene in American film history. Despite the controversy audiences were enthralled with the scene and the movie itself. Other controversial scenes included the opening one in which Marion and her lover Sam are featured sharing a bed together with Marion wearing only a bar and a scene where Marion is flushing a toilet that has toilet paper in it. Furthermore there was controversy over how the killer and villain Norman is depicted. Instead of the audience being left with disgust for his action the conclusion of the film makes us feel almost a sense of sorrow for him. It is revealed he committed the heinous crimes because of the psychological abuse he was subjected to by his mother, as a viewer we begin to attribute his horrible acts to being a result of this rather than him being inherently evil. The fact that the film was such monumental success despite its unorthodox subject matter for that time period is significant of the change in attitude toward film subject matter that was occurring in America. Viewers were becoming desensitized and willing to embrace and even enjoy racey material. This shift in attitude signifies the coming end of classic Hollywood and the code era."

With one of the best scenes taken from behind a shower curtain, at this point you can only see Lila Crane as a silhouette of a person with a knife appears behind the shower curtain, Lila Crane then meets a grizzly demise as she is attacked. The mystery of the character leads you to believe it was either Norma or Norman Bates but at this time you are unaware of Norma Bate's death, so you are torn between the friendly but creepy Norman or the unseen (Except for a shadow in her bedroom window) Norma. The fast edits and audio throughout this scene represent the chaos that is currently taking place, the screeching of a violin shows that it is a violent attack and is used to shock the audience with loud and uncommon sounds. <br/><br/>The final scene of the film shows Norman Bates in the prison cell alone, the frame starts of as a wide shot but is slowly getting closer to Normans face while a voice over, which is in his mothers voice is talking about how he's not even going to hurt a fly. This show's that he has truly gone insane and believes he is fully innocent. As the framing of the shot comes closer to his face, he looks into the camera and smiles while the screen fades to the vehicle where he hid Lila Crane's body that is being pulled from the swamp.

","In the most legendary (and most imitated) film from ""The Master of Suspense"", Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, a chilling, disturbing, and crazy psychopath who causes terror to those who arrive at The Bates Motel. Originally released in 1960, Psycho's violence and implied sexual moments were the center of controversy, especially the now famous shower scene and the opening hotel love scene. While its definitely tame in today's standards, Psycho still manages to be filled with the ultimate suspense and thrills.

The rest of the cast does a fine job too especially Janet Leight. The movie is also full of so many twist and turns most of these are common knowledge now but back in 1960 no one knew what hit them. The music, we cant forget Bernard Herman's excellent music score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly, the music was most famously used in the shower scene now one of cinema's most recognizable moments.The twist ending is great it will catch you completely off guard. Psycho; a movie full of twists and turns, suspense at every corner, perfect music, great acting and all lead by probably the greatest film director of all times, Psycho does receive from me a 9.5 out of 10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop whatever your doing and see it now."

","Before Halloween, this is the movie that started it all. I love it, it's suspense and horrifying and it makes me wonder how it was done so beautifully. This film blew my mind and is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film. I'll always love the shower scene, it brings the chill down to my spine. The music in the film is outstanding. <br/><br/>Now these days a lot of Slasher movies got their inspiration Psycho. I've seen plenty of Slasher movies, some of them are good in their own way while many others just don't live up to their predecessor. but Psycho will always be the best.

","In my opinion, Psycho is what today's movies are not. You have to be watching the whole movie to know what's going on. Today's movies, you could glance at the screen every once in a while, and you could know what's going on. Not Psycho. Psycho keeps you at the edge of your seat, like why was the cop on to her? Is it going to be a big part of the movie? Why do they care so much that she was in a hurry? Loved every minute of it. The music, the ending, this movie should be studied upon by other horror directors! Horror is an art form, an Psycho is the Mona Lisa! <br/><br/>So yeah, definitely watch it."

","A secretary steals 40,000 dollars from a client and goes on the run, only to end up at the Bates Motel. Enter Norman Bates a man with a devious side to him who is controlled by his domineering mother.<br/><br/>One of the most classic and shocking films for its time, and directed by the master of suspense. Hitchcock to this day is still considered one of the greatest film directors of all time and it is easily believable as you watch his direction through photography, lighting and pacing. Psycho is one if not his most revered film. The pacing and the tension grow with each passing minute and for the first time viewer one truly has no idea what to expect, other than the growing feeling that something isn't right. Shocking for its time, and with a twist ending that in this day and age may be easy to figure out but for its time truly took the viewer for a surprise. With a famous score that anyone who hears it will instantly recollect this film. One of the most famous scenes in all of cinema as well, the infamous shower scene. Psycho is a an unsettling film though ages in many aspects still a cinematic treasure that any fan of film can enjoy, as it is in my opinion a timeless classic."

","In true Hitchcockian 'shades of grey' office worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) rashly decides to take a stash of cash from her employer and ditch Los Angeles to join up with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With her internal moral regret mounting, even conspiring against her to the verge of paranoia, she ultimately ends up in a dilapidated off-road motel run by the reclusive, but amiable Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who literally has skeletons hiding out in his closet. When Marion Crane famously gets gutted in the shower by Bates' mother, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and boyfriend Sam become aware of her disappearance and initiate a hunt. Similarly, her employer sends out detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to track down Marion and the stolen money.<br/><br/>With a movie so awash with interpretations and reviews, not much noteworthy can be added, except from personal input, especially from the future-past perspective, as in: How does ""Psycho"" hold up against its contemporaries? And as such ""Psycho"", one of Hitchcock's best works, has aged pretty darn well, outdoing a vast majority of by-the-numbers rip-offs, due to the the ambiguous societal commentary lingering in between the killer rampage. Norman Bates, despite his awkward presence and facial tics, is by no measure a crazed psychopath, who deals in excess, instead Hitchcock affords his main antagonist a very thoughtful character structure, which also helps to build tension. Hitchcock, masterfully, builds context and content, especially with regards to the interaction between Marion and Norman, each running away from their own demons, suggesting that the difference between the two is much less pronounced, than we would like to believe. This gruesome take hits best during a genuinely fresh conversation between the two in the hotel office.<br/><br/>Once the initial murder takes place, Hitchcock never lets go of a sense of tension, but the story focuses more on the thriller/horror essence, no longer affording space for such thoughtful commentary. Anthony Perkins carries the movie with his impish, offbeat, charm, delivering a still crisp and tense conversation with the nosey PI Arbogast. For the most part ""Psycho"" remains a gripping experience, even though age has caused many false notes to supplant true fright with corny music and overused shock gimmicks. As such the most famous scenes, including the bathroom murder and the big reveal, have lost their impact, referenced to death and outdone by the coming slew of slasher films. Possibly this even works for the better, as the much ridiculed sequences no longer define the movie, instead letting it breath by its own."

","An attractive woman by the name of ""Marion Crane"" (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her office then heads for California in a hurry. After being followed by a cop she pulls over at a used car dealership and trades her car for another before setting out again. That night it begins to rain hard and she decides to stay the night at a motel along an old highway-the Bates Motel. From that point on things begin to happen in a most dramatic fashion. Now, rather than reveal the details I will just say that this is one of the best horror movies ever filmed. It has good acting, good directing, excellent cinematography, plenty of mystery and awesome suspense. Along with that, one particular scene involving Janet Leigh in the shower is possibly one of the most memorable horror scenes ever filmed. Having said that I believe it should be pointed out that this movie is 53 years old (at the time of this review) and as a result it doesn't have the graphic imagery or gore that some people are accustomed to today. As a result there could be some viewers who might miss the subtle touches a real master like Alfred Hitchcock was able to implement to such a fine degree. Equally impressive was the acting of both Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (as ""Norman Bates""). As a matter of fact, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for ""Best Actress"" for her performance. In short, while this movie is definitely a bit old it is still worth watching for all fans of horror or suspense."
"Ahmed_Abdellatif","8","0","1","14 December 2013"," A masterpiece, once upon a time
","The movie has a great story writing and quite an ambitious and experimental directing of its time,worthy of Alfred Hitchcock. However it failed to be the timeless masterpiece it is promoted to be, as other titles by Hitchcock like ""Dail M for murder"" as an example. The acting is done in a theatrical, grandiose method that takes off some of the thrill and immersion, as well as the setting which makes everyone ridiculously well dressed and in best shape. In a sense you can't believe a handsome young man who dresses and speaks as royalty can run a shady motel or work in a hardware store, but it happens in the movie consistently which is quite disengaging. Even a psychiatrist speaks in more of a literary manner rather than a scientific one as one should. That was a trend of the time, so it can be forgiven,however it makes the movie end a bit flat and the characters lack connection. This movie is one of those movies that laid the ground to many likes afterwards but fell short of being a masterpiece itself"

We are asked to understand the struggles and eerie life Norman Bates go through and the vulnerability of Marion Crane. <br/><br/>This movie appeared to be filmed with such ease and with the right amount of effort that it delivered an excellent motion picture - no overacting, no overdone effects, no over-the-top stuff - just the perfect balance for pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Grade A"

","An excellent classic horror flick. Hitchcock raised the bar for all horror movies without showing any blood, guts or nudity. A trailblazer for his time indeed. Hitchcock deliberately wanted ""Psycho"" to look like a cheap exploitation film. . . That is the mystery of why Hitchcock marred the ending of a masterpiece with a sequence that is grotesquely out of place. Whenever anyone speaks about Psycho, the first images that come to mind are those of Janet Leigh being hacked to death in the shower. The scene is so famous that even people who have not seen the movie are aware of it. Bernard Herrmann's strident, discordant music has been used in countless other movies to denote the appearance of a ""psycho."" The brilliance of the scene lies in the editing. Those who go frame-by-frame through it will note how much is left to the imagination. We see a knife, blood (actually chocolate syrup), water, and a woman's naked body (with certain parts strategically concealed from the camera), but only briefly is the penetration of the blade into the flesh shown*. The full horror of the murder is only hinted at on-screen. It takes the power of the viewer's imagination to fill in the blanks. Brilliant movie indeed."

","Arguably Hitchcock's Magnum Opus, 'Psycho' is a classic. It not only made contributions to the horror genre, but is also considered one of the most important films in the cinema history. And rightfully so. It is really worth of all the hype.<br/><br/>Just mentioning a few things: The script is magnificent: The character development is great into the film intentions, the plot is well established, the conflict as is well established, and the resolution is... well, if you to see for yourself! And as a typical good thriller,it's full of extremely well-conceived plot turns and twists which probably would catch anyone to watch this film, being familiar with the genre and style or not. The soundtrack is just classic... seriously, which person in this world never heard the track in the infamous 'shower scene'? Also, it plays a big part in the scarier moments in the film. <br/><br/>The acting as well is nothing less than excellent. Anthony Perkins as the Bates guy is just perfect. But my shoot-outs are really going to sir. Alfred Hitchcock. I have to say that this movie only would work with HIM being the director. No one could do what he did. This is also what makes Psycho so good and special. If you haven't watched it yet, don't waste your time: Do it now! 10/10"

","Psycho is an excellent,scary and landmark Horror Masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made that is filled with amazing direction,a terrific cast,a fantastic script and a masterful score. All of those combinations make Psycho not only a masterpiece of Horror cinema,but also a masterpiece of cinema in general and is Alfred Hitchcock at his very best.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch,Psycho tells the story of Marion Crave(Janet Leigh),a real estate office secretary that has been given 40,000$ in cash to take to the bank but when Marion doesn't do so,Marion takes the money and goes on the run. Scared and tired,Marion decides to stop at a Motel ran by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins),a young man that runs the Motel and takes care of his Mother. The stay at the Motel leads to horrific and strange turn of events.<br/><br/>What can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho that hasn't been said before? The film is a flawless Masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest,scariest and most iconic movies of all time and is the first modern Horror movie that changed the Horror genre as we know it. Prior to Psycho,Horror movies from the 1930s to the 1950s had been done by Universal Films and Hammer Pictures and Horror films mostly dealt with monsters like Zombies,Vampires,Werewolves and creatures from outer space or were set in the 18th or 19th century in castles. But then in 1960 Psycho came out and changed Horror films forever and brought Horror into the modern world and gave viewers a different kind of monster which was a human being and Psycho would set the standard for Horror and Suspense Thrillers that came after Psycho and despite Hitchcock giving cinema many classics and Masterpieces Psycho is Hitchcock's most famous and iconic film. Psycho is a great film that right from the very beginning the movie pulls you into a frightening and terrifying nightmare that is relentless and powerful like a tightrope with white hot suspense that never stops until the very end. Psycho is also a great film because it gave audiences a new and different kind of Horror film that breaks all of the rules and conventions that are associated with Horror and Hollywood films with Hitchcock make people think the film is going to go one way when it goes another and the film gives you a sense of dread and offers no salvation or happiness. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Psycho are done with great timing and much detail and when the scary scenes happen they hit you like an unexpected punch in the face and your heart will be racing because with each scary and suspenseful scene Hitchcock is frightening you not only physically but mentally as well. The style and brilliance of Psycho would influence Horror films and Thrillers that came out years after Psycho's release. Probably the scariest and most suspenseful scene in the film is the famous shower scene,a classic and iconic scene that Hitchcock filmed with such a masterful stroke using clever camera angles and tricks making you watch in awe and terror. It's a scene you will never forget and will change the way you take showers forever. While the film is scary,Psycho wouldn't be as nearly scary without the atmosphere. During the 1950s,Alfred Hitchcock had filmed his movies in color but with Psycho Hitchcock filmed this movie in Black & White thanks to Jack L. Russell's beautiful and visually stunning photography which gives the movie a dark and beautiful Film Noir look that is harsh and bleak almost like you're in a living nightmare. The main characters in Psycho are wonderful because they are not Horror movie stereotypes or Cartoons but real people that viewers will relate to because of the horrific and dangerous situations that happen in the film. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano is amazing and memorable,with Stefano giving the main characters dialog that is tight and incredible. The ending of Psycho is amazing,scary and is an ending you won't expect or see coming. The ending of Psycho is twisted and shocking and is one of the things that makes Psycho a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The whole cast is great. Anthony Perkins is excellent and iconic as Norman Bates,with Perkins bringing intensity and power to the role. Janet Leigh is brilliant in her most famous and iconic role as Marion Crane,with Leigh bringing depth and class to the role. Vera Miles is terrific as Lila Crane,Marion's sister. John Galvin is wonderful as Sam Loomis,Marion's boyfriend. Martin Balsam is fantastic as Milton Arbogast,a private detective. John McIntire(Sheriff Al Chambers),Simon Oakland(Dr. Fred Richman),Lurene Tuttle(Mrs. Chambers),Frank Albertson(Tom Cassidy),Patrica Hitchcock(Caroline),Vaughn Taylor(George Lower),John Anderson(California Charlie)and Mort Mills(Highway Patrol Officer)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Alfred Hitchcock is excellent and stylish,with Hitchcock constantly moving the camera and using amazing angles giving the film a great visual style and tone while doing a terrific job with the scary and suspenseful scenes. Masterful direction by Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The score by Bernard Herrmann is brilliant,scary,intense and one of the greatest and most iconic scores in movie history and it truly matches the film's dark and frightening tone. Terrific score by Herrmann.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Alfred Hitchcock,Horror films or movies in general,I highly suggest you see Psycho,an excellent,scary landmark Horror Masterpiece,one of the greatest films ever made that you can watch again and again and is Alfred Hitchcock at his best."

And the story behind the movie is really something, not only the book that inspired the movie but also the behind the scenes (i recommend that you take a look at the movie Hitchcock with Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren or read a little about it, it's very interesting). Perkins makes a terrific performance as Norman Bates (the best i've seen). Janet Leigh equally fantastic, and don't forget Vera Miles, John Gavin and the detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) who made also a great job.

","Immortal for its contribution to cinema, notorious for pushing the boundary of what's accepted in mainstream movies & setting an extremely high benchmark for horror films to follow, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho remains the most influential, successful & famous work of his legendary career and is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest achievements in the history of filmmaking.<br/><br/>The story of Psycho concerns Marion Crane; a secretary working at a real estate office who is entrusted with $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank but ends up absconding with it in order to start a new life. Caught in heavy rain & tired after a long drive, she pulls over to spend the night at Bates Motel whose owner-manager seems to be very much under the dominion of his mother.<br/><br/>Throughout his career, director Alfred Hitchcock has enriched the world of cinema with some truly groundbreaking thrillers & despite that, Psycho feels like something of a first from him. It's his first stint with the genre of horror, it breaks through the barriers of censorship unlike any film before and over the years, it has played an major role in influencing not only films but pop- culture as well.<br/><br/>The screenplay is a gem in itself for the story is cleverly written by Joseph Stefano & also features many memorable quotes. Filmed on a modest budget, the black-n-white cinematography only ends up working in favour of the film as it makes excellent use of sharp focus, smooth tracking shots & meticulous detailing in capturing its events, while also providing an ageless look to the whole story.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the film features a reliable cast amongst which Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins end up impressing the most. While Leigh beautifully captures the guilty side of Marion, Perkins as Bates is show-stealing considering that he starts out pretty calmly but steadily levels it up as the story progresses & is absolutely chilling in the film's final moment.<br/><br/>Editing is also worthy of its praise for it paces the whole story ingeniously & gets its own moment to shine in what happens to be the film's most (in)famous sequence. Yet, the maximum contribution amongst all aspects comes from Bernard Herrmann's spectacularly terrifying score which makes its presence felt from the very beginning & ends up intensifying the film's overall cinematic experience by a great deal.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, with its tense atmosphere that looms over the plot from start to finish, outstanding direction, tight screenplay, superb performances, stunning grayscale photography, clever editing & relentless score, Psycho is a breathtaking work of perfection that marks the creative height of Alfred Hitchcock's glorious film career and not only is it the most influential example of its genre but is very much the sole reason why modern horror exists in the first place."

"RyanCShowers","Null","0","1","23 September 2013"," Hitchcock Exceeds Anything He's Ever Done
","Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career.<br/><br/>Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower.<br/><br/>The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters.<br/><br/>The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal.<br/><br/>Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself ""Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife"", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene.<br/><br/>Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film.<br/><br/>Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>Rating: 10.5/10"

","Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor.

","As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he ""Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman"". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all."

What starts seemingly as a satire on human behavior, quite unexpectedly changes gears and becomes a crime thriller. There are moments where one actually holds his breath. The plot goes like this: A Phoenix secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. The story initially revolves around this secretary, Marion (Janet Leigh), but drifts after some point of time. I won't discuss too much about the story in my reviews as I myself hate to know the story of a movie before watching it. The background music is quite fitting. Psycho's definitely worth your 1 hour and 48 minutes."

","This movie wasn't bad. Interesting plot and continued suspense, though it has definitely shown its age - and not just in technology. The amount of horror and suspense is limited, compared to films of the current day.<br/><br/>The plot twist, if you could call it that, was transparent and I definitely saw it coming. I don't know if this is due to having seen so many movies already or due to exposure to modern cinema, but I was not surprised at the ending.<br/><br/>One other surprise, which I suppose might have been revolutionary for its time was the killing of what you thought was the main protagonist in the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, not bad, but I wasn't particularly thrilled at it either."
"Sonic_Ocean","8","0","1","28 May 2013"," Hitchcock executes suspense gracefully in 'Psycho' in a way that feels organic and raw, with every shot being memorable and iconic
","I am completely at a loss of words for what to say about 'Psycho' that has not already been said before, therefore I will just reiterate what others say and that the film is all deserving of its iconic status. Every shot is memorable and when I think of either the horror or the thriller genre, the shower scene instantly comes to mind, as well as the other scenes with suspense in the film. Everything feels so meticulously placed in that the suspense hits you the same way a song approaches a bombastic crescendo.<br/><br/>The genre has come a long way and today's generation's expectations are more harder to please due to the market in the genre, but 'Psycho' laid out the blueprint to making a thriller that has basically become the standard and you can see it in pretty much every modern suspense film, it's ridiculous. And while this might not shake up anyone today, this definitely shook up many people and to watch it in that context really shows how far we've come in the genre today.<br/><br/>And with that, I think it's safe to say that Hitchcock rightfully deserves the title as 'the master of suspense.' And with other classics under his belt, such as 'Vertigo,' 'North by Northwest, and 'Rear Window,' his diversity in utilizing the concept of suspense, whether its playing with his audience's perceptions or leaving them on the edge of their seats, is evident in each of them. As a growing movie lover (my first love being music), I have to say that despite its status in pop culture lore, 'Psycho' is still a crowning achievement in what it basically is: a great movie."

","Psycho. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Based on the novel by Robert Bloch. Starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin. Rated R with a running time of 109 minutes. Given an 8.6/10 on IMDb.com and 97% Fresh on Rottentomatoes.com <br/><br/>""A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and subsequently encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.""<br/><br/>""Bates Motel"" the modern prequel series to Psycho has left me absolutely intrigued. I had heard of Hitchcock's masterpiece but I had never actually seen and with myself being an immense film addict, how could I have possibly missed such a remarkable gem? I'd known the entire plot. Every twist turn and stab. I honestly thought I was capable of understanding exactly what I was going to get here, but boy was I wrong. Thrills beyond belief and spectacular story-telling. <br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock is an absolute cinematic genius. Choosing to keep the film in black and white, killing off his protagonist halfway through the film, pushing and pulling the audience in every direction he wants them to be in. His camera angles and overall eye for entertainment has yet to be matched by any modern filmmaker. This man and this film are not only responsible for revolutionizing the horror genre, but showing the world the validity of it. Expect to be mesmerized by this piece.<br/><br/>We are given Anthony Perkins, who doesn't just play the role of Norman Bates, but he becomes him. The character is embodied with such power and perfection that seeing Perkins in any role but this terrifies me beyond belief. Vera Miles and John Gavin team up as Lila Crane and Sam Loomis. Together they weave a team of compassionate and caring people, searching for answers in a mind bending mystery. Miles performs beautifully. She's innocent and loving and just wants to find her sister, but there's this air to her that strikes me, making me wonder how complex Lila is capable of being. If you're able to portray a character to the point that a viewer wishes to know more about that character, I give you the utmost respect. John Gavin as Sam Loomis bored me at the start but soon he became ideal. Loomis and Bates are compared and contrasted in an ironically obvious but eye-opening light. They are both extremely handsome men but Loomis is intimidating, strong, manly. Whereas, Norman Bates is a shy, childish, coward. The scenes where the two actors battle in out in conversation kept me on the edge of my seat. Once again, I have to add that Anthony Perkins is a genius and every motion, reaction, and word that comes from him in this film delivers an unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>My only complaint worth noting is the scene in which the psychologist explains Norman and His Mother to the audience. It's a bit drawn out and the psychologist is delivering shocking and heartbreaking information but there seems to be little reaction from him or anyone in the room. Rather than telling me what happened, I'd have rather seen it for myself, Something that's easy to do in film. But this scene is necessary and it won't take a single thing away from this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Psycho is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's a horrifying thrill-ride with a twist that no one will ever see coming and what it did for the movie world will never be forgotten. Alfred Hitchcock toys with our wildest emotions and fears and spawns a true work of art. I'll have to ask my mother what she thought of the film because, well, mother knows best. But, I'd say that if you decide that Bates Motel has No Vacany's for you, well Norman and I will both in form you that we have 12 Vacancy's and all 12 should be filled by you."

","By watching the newer version of this movie first it didn't make seeing the original as good as it would of been if I had seen it first. The movie overall was great it had all the elements of a great thriller you didn't know who the real killer was until you got close to the end of the film. The plot was great the way the story unfolded was another strong point in the movie. The actors played their roles really well especially the killer his character was great because he was just nervous a the time but got defensive in an instant whenever his mother is involved which kept it really entertaining given the fact that you don't see the mother you only hear her. If you have a choice which movie to see first choose the first one because it will make you appreciate it a lot more than if you see the newer one first."

","i don't think they could have cast a better actor for Norman Bates than Anthony Perkins, he was just the right amount of charming with just that hint of psychotic. i have always heard about the movie and seen small clips, so i thought i knew what i was in for, but i didn't know the story at all. i was very surprised once i figure everything out. Hitchcock surely is the master of suspense and it shows very much in this movie. on the DVD version there is a ""making of psycho"" feature and it talks about the decision Hitchcock made to shoot the movie in black and white because he thought it would be too gory in color, in my opinion it would not have been too gory, but it certainly would not have felt the same. this film is an absolute classic suspense movie and if you haven't seen it yet i would definitely recommend it."

","Probably Alfred Hitchcock's most famous and recognised movie. Personally I can't find an explanation for its ratings, it probably lies in its originality, mostly concerning when it was made. Psycho portrays a story of this woman from Pheonix, Lila Crane (Vera Miless) who stole 40000$ from one client and runs away. She draws the attention from the police, so she decides to change cars and drives by night until she gets lost and finds a motel. She checks in in that motel, with a very peculiar keeper, Norman (Anthony Perkins), who revealed a very cool personality, indifferent to current paradigms, who lived with her very annoying mother, increasingly senile. Anyway, somebody enters her bathroom when she was in the shower and stabs her several times, presumably the insane mother. The missing money causes discomfort back in Pheonix and when her client finds out she's also missing he hires a private detective to look for her. He eventually gets to the Motel, but he is kileef as well, this time inside Normans' house, suspecting he'd be hiding Mrs Crane. Then, it's time for her boyfriend and sister to look for her. It's a fine movie. Very old school, no one dares to make such a bizarre movie nowadays. Probably inaccurate concerning the psychopathology involved, naturally to help the twist, which is perhaps spectacular but definitely repeated and copied too frequently over the years turning it predictable. It arouses quite a curiosity on Vera Miles as we're used to watch her in Westerns, a lot less demanding though emotionally richer. There's probably a lot of subjectivity or taste interfering with my rating, but when it comes to art, taste comes before justification. 6/10"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","14 August 2011"," Time has dulled Psycho's cutting edge but it's still worth watching
","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is one of the most famous movies of all time. People who've never seen it are nonetheless familiar with the infamous shower scene and its spiky musical accompaniment. In a way, this familiarity works against the film, as does the parade of imitators down through the years.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I may not be the most objective judge of this film's merit. I first saw the pointlessly faithful remake and I also read Robert Bloch's novel (which is the same in most respects). So, the movie was basically 'spoiled' for me, though with all of the references in popular culture you'd be hard-pressed to go into the movie 'fresh' to begin with. For a movie that hinges on a pair of twists, that's a considerable issue. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have other impressive elements, though.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh received an Oscar nomination for her performance but as far as I'm concerned Anthony Perkins easily outdid her. He went unrecognized by awards bodies at the time but the character of Norman Bates is now one of the most famous creations in cinema. In support, Martin Balsam is a welcome sight while Vera Miles & John Gavin are acceptable though they aren't really given a lot to work with.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hitch's direction was expertly handled, as always, and it resulted in the last Oscar nomination of his career. The cinematography was also Oscar nominated but I wasn't especially impressed by it, though I will say that the Oscar-nominated set decoration/art direction was indeed worthy of recognition. Bafflingly, Bernard Hermann's now-legendary score seems to have been completely ignored at the time.<br/><br/>In the end, I think that ""Psycho"" ranks a bit below Hitchcock masterpieces like ""Rear Window"" & ""Vertigo"". Admittedly, there are some absolutely great parts but it also starts slow and has an overreliance on twists (which you might already know even if you haven't seen the movie). That's not even getting into the scores of lesser imitators that have explored similar territory over the years. So, while ""Psycho"" is undoubtedly a landmark film with some very impressive elements, I'd say that time has been kinder to its reputation than its content."

","I don't really like horror films but this one was OK. I found it very suspenseful which helped keep my attention. I liked the murder in the shower scene because it is a great example of an early movie right after the abolishment of the Hayes code. Never before were we able to see a showering woman murdered. This is one of the most influential and memorable scenes in not only horror films but American films in general. The beginning of the movie seemed very real and I think helped me get into the movie. The only thing is I don't get why she was trusted with that much money, I feel that is pretty unrealistic, however it is a movie so anything goes. Overall pretty good horror movie and it definitely paved the way for the modern day gory horrors we watch today."

After I finally got the chance to watch it I realize that there is a good reason as to why it is a classic movie.

","Psycho was the first of its kind in many respects, most notably would be the violence and sexuality that was shown in the film. The film opens with a shot of two lovers threw a hotel window then goes on show Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, changing in her hotel room and of course, the infinite shower scene which combines nudity with violence. Such violence had never been shown before in fact caused a great deal of terror within audiences and although film has certainly progressed in terms of the allowance of sexuality and violence this film is yet to seem outdated. In fact, any of the scenes the involve Norman Bates still terrify me. Hitchcock allows the interactions between Marion Crane and Norman Bates to unfold slowly and switches the camera's point of view back and forth between Norman's when he is observing Marion and the omniscient allowing the audience to watch Marion go about her business in the motel room this adds to the suspense during the entire beginning of the film. Anthony Perkins is outstanding in his role as Norman Bates and his mother of course. He plays his role so well that the audience fears and feels for him. He allows the audience to see the struggle between his wants and the control his mother still has over him. There is nothing bad I can say about this film it is fabulous in every aspect."

","It's very hard to talk about this movie without any spoilers, because when I want to review a good movie, I want to bring the best out of it, and to do so with this masterpiece, I would have to mention certain scenes or cases that involve spoilers.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>I'll try my best. Psycho is best described as an excellent flick that contains strong and effective scenes with good acting, powerful suspenseful moments and a brilliant plot! And when I say brilliant plot...I mean BRILLIANT!<br/><br/>Psycho is shot in black and white, gray-scale/monochrome gray color, but that only makes it more distinguished and interesting as an independent movie from the 60's<br/><br/>A young woman, named Marion Crane, decides to steal 40.000$ from her employer's client when she gets the chance. She then escapes with the money and is determined to start a new life with her lover, Sam Loomis, in California where she believes they can live happily together. On the way, she comes across with bad weather and a heavy rain. After driving a while, she decides to stop at the nearest motel by...The rather isolated, Bates Motel. A week passes by and one day, Marion's Sister, Lila, arrives at Sam's store only to inform him of her sister's disappearance!<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock did a great job as a director in this movie. I especially felt that the opening scene was shot amazingly well from a wide angle which then, dives into the house. And not to mention...the legendary shower sequence! Brilliant directing :)<br/><br/>The cast is good. Janet Leigh has her moments as Marion. Vera Miles, who played her sister, also did a great job. Martin Balsam was outstanding as detective Milton Arbogast and John Gavin did his job of portraying the heroic Sam Loomis... But the one who I think stole every scene completely and made it into his own, was Anthony Perkins, I mean..that guy was, without any doubts, way ahead of his time! It's stunning to watch him transform into, and become, Norman Bates. His manners and stuttering... he definitely at least deserved an Oscar nomination in my opinion (and probably many others).<br/><br/>About the spoilers...Let's just say that this movie has a great conclusive ending and delivers the plot and twist in the best way possible.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was extremely good and think that people ought to watch it and forget about modern-day special effects or brainless gore that people have gotten so used to. Just sit down, relax, have yourself some popcorn and prepare to get blown off by an amazing and down-right suspense, nerve-thrilling movie...prepare yourself for...PSYCHO!"

","Alfred Hitchcock was knick named the master of suspense and he definitely lived up to it. Psycho possibly one of the most famous thriller films of all time is a classic that should be study by all film makers. The editing with the combination of the photography and cinematography and the music score is what makes this film so good. The music is what jumps right out you and you wont ever forget. The film gives off a extremely creepy, scary vibe through out the whole film. The shower scene when the girl is murdered still gives me the chills and I've seen it millions of times. This classic Hitchcock has you terrified of a mean old mother that you barely see through out the film. The house Norman lives in set the standard for what creepy old house's should look like in Hollywood. The creepy vibe Norman gives off is not as powerful but you still feel it. Having him chew on candies was the perfect touch. The low angle of him with the stuffed birds over his head really add to his creepiness factor. Hitchcock in this excellent film also throws in a huge twist that no one ever see's coming. I really felt like Norman stole the show as far as the acting went, but I thought Lila Crane was also very believable. A very scary thrilling film that will leave you on the edge of your seat, that is a must see for any scary movie fan,"

Every one knows it or at least knows the score or the shower seen. It has been copied in so many movies and TV shows. Every time I think of a spooky house I think of the ""Psycho's"" house on top of the hill. The camera angels used were a major part of the movies uniqueness, it really added drama. And even though the shower scene didn't show the the woman getting stabbed it didn't matter. It was a montage shot (lots of short shots put together) and it added thrill. Then at then end of the scene when you see the blood spinning down the drain and then it spins into her lifeless eye is the BEST."

","This film i thought was directed very well. The camera angles were also shot nicely. Alfred Hitchcock directed this film. In the beginning of the movie we see a long take of showing the city and then the camera focuses on a building and then goes right to the window and into the room. Lila Crane who is played by Vera Miles steals 40,000 thousand dollars from her work and we see her in a car. While she is in the car the camera is facing her and we can see cars in the back. We can also hear her thoughts while she is driving. In this movie the camera like to focus on the objects. Lila arrives at a motel. She meets Norman Bates. Norman plays his character well. He is very psychotic. He has two personalities. But the audience doesn't find that out until the end of the movie. He or should I say his mother ends up killing Lila. We never actually see her get stabbed with the knife just see her struggling and then falling down and see some blood. I like how the camera focuses on the drain in the shower and then we see her eye. The music in this movie lets the audience know that something is gonna happen. So there is a lot of suspense throughout the movie."

","Psycho is undoubtedly Alfred Hitchcock's most famous film, and not for no reason: it's a masterclass in suspense, tension and terror that, even half a century after it first stunned audiences with its raw, psychological horror, has lost none of its ability to shock.<br/><br/>For those who don't already know, Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, creepy proprietor of the Bates Motel, situated off the old highway 15 miles from the town of Fairvale. Janet Leigh is bank employee Marion Crane, who has let temptation get the better of her and absconded with $40,000. Feeling tired after a long trip on the road to visit her lover Sam Loomis (John Gavin), Marion decides to check into the Bates establishment, where she meets a sticky end whilst taking a shower (c'mon, don't tell me you didn't know...).<br/><br/>When Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) travels to Fairvale to see if Sam knows anything of her sister's whereabouts, she is tailed by private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), whose expertise eventually leads him to the Bates motel where Norman and 'mother' wait with butcher's knife in hand.<br/><br/>Working from a script by Joseph Stefano (based on the novel by Robert Bloch), Hitchcock delivers a flawless exercise in horror that sees the director develop techniques so effective that they are still imitated to this day, but which are rarely as well executed as they are here. Hitchcock's finest achievement with Psycho is undoubtedly fooling his audience into assuming that Leigh is the central character and then suddenly bumping her off, metaphorically pulling the rug from under the viewers feet; but he also manages many other brilliant touches, including Marion Crane's tense flight from Phoenix, where she imagines how events are unfolding at the bank, Norman's disposal of Ms Crane's car in a swamp (with her body in the boot), a moment of wonderful dark humour as the vehicle momentarily refuses to sink, and of course, the macabre ending in which Lila discovers Norman's mother hiding in the fruit cellar.<br/><br/>Add a cool title sequence by Saul Bass and a fantastic score by Bernard Hermann, itself often imitated, and what you have is a bona fide classic of the horror genre (yes, horror) that any self respecting fan should ensure that they see at least several times. It's that good."

The scene of murdering is really classic, especially when the camera zoom out of her eye slowly. Besides, taking a shower is the time to feel relax, is not any idea or attention in the mind. Therefore, when the murder show up, it break down unconscious and makes the audience feel frightened. Nevertheless, it is weird because we could not see the knife touch her body. Moreover, the scene that after she bought the new car, we would hear the voice of the conversation while she was driving. These voices told the other parts of the story that help the audience more understand. Furthermore, the setting is really good, especially the house with the perfect quantity of the light is very horrible. Plus, there are a lot background musics that make the movie more scary and excited.

Very light and crystal clear. The film has a straight forward plot structure. The film draws you in. It keeps you interested. First you are following the plot of a lady who has stolen money and on the run. Then she gets killed and you completely forget about her, now you are forces on this creepy hotel and weird owner. The first murder scene is done so well. The woman is in the shower she doesn't notice but the audiences can her, Norman's mother's shadow. You don't see the mothers face but you see her stab. You never see the knife actual stab the girl. This scene I felt was tastefully done. You know that girls gets stab by Normans mother not by seeing her pierce the skin but by the motion of the knife that is shown and the girls lifeless body in a pool of blood. I love how the camera tied the nest scene in by going to the shower drain. Then moves out slowly from her eye, then to the unknown hidden money to a shocked Norman cleaning up his mother's murder. Though the movie you develop pity for poor Norman. He is a kind genuine man. You think he would never hurt a fly. His seems nice and charming a little bit on the weird side. He stuff birds but makes it weird is how much he enjoys it. You feel bad for him because it seems he is trapped by his mother. That she has turned him into a mama's boy. At the end you're in for a crazy twist. Though out the movie the suspense builds up, you can wait to see this bitch. But then you are surprise when you see the mother and who she really is. I never would have guess. I thought that the film was brilliantly done. How the mothers face in never relived till the end. Or why you could only her mother when she is having a conversation with her son when you don't see them. But in the end you understand why and how the film got its name.

The first half of the movie, if you hadn't seen it before, you would think is about the stolen money, that Norman is going to steal the money from Marion and escape his 'trap'. This all changes when the woman we have spent a while getting to know is murdered in a memorable shower scene by a woman in black. Norman cleans up after 'mother' and dumps all her belongings including the money he didn't know was there in the swamp! So what next? This is the genius of Psycho. Janet Leigh was a big star at the time and to see her dispatched so coldly would have been a great shock and after all she was the main character wasn't she? Brilliant. <br/><br/>Anthony Perkins is outstanding as the nervous but friendly Norman Bates. There is no showmanship to his performance, it is ahead of its time. Janet Leigh is equally outstanding as the doomed Marion Crane and when she is killed you miss her for the rest of the film. The weak link is John Gavin, he is the old school of actor, very handsome and strong leading man type which in contrast to Tony Perkins modern approach shows badly. When they share a scene together you can see the difference in class between them but its a minor flaw. <br/><br/>Finally Bernard Herrmann wrote a wonderfully twisted and eerie score to accompany Hitchcocks sure direction. Its a work of genius. If you haven't seen it - get it on your list!"

","If you have not seen this film, watch it. Simply because it is Hitchcock's most suspenseful, intricate psychological thriller that has ever been known. It has influenced every horror film in some way.<br/><br/>Beginning in Pheonix, Arizona, Marion Crane is having her lunch hour in a hotel room with a married man. They discuss marriage, and money. Later, a discontented Marion easily steals $40,000 to help fix her problems. Frightened, she leaves town and shakes off a policeman and she swaps her car. Later it starts raining and she spends a quiet evening at the Bates Motel...<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, especially Anthony Perkins as the innocent, troubled Norman Bates. Bernard Hermann's score is suitably eerie and years ahead of its time, complementing George Tomasini's interesting editing.

After enormous commercial success it achieved classic status over the years; despite effective moments of fright, it has a childish plot and script, yet it remains a hugely successful confidence trick, made for very little money by a TV crew.

","This is the mother of all slasher films and that chilling feel that some horror movies have. Instead of straight horror like monsters and ghosts, Psycho makes a physically normal human being more terrifying than any movie monster you've ever seen. What's so scary is that it could have happened, and if I'm not wrong Psycho is based on a true story. This movie is still chilling after all these years.<br/><br/>I really wish modern day movie makers would go back to the feel of Hitchcock's movies. There's just something really scary about them. The realism, the acting, the cinematography and the music are just unique. There are few, but still some people who managed to continue the feel of Psycho. Take John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) a knife wielding maniac attacking babysitter at Halloween night. he wears a mask to hide his face and has no human emotions left whatsoever. And take the 2000 film American Psycho, a normally looking businessman who's well liked for his success, performs random violence and gruesome fetish killings at night. I Alfred Hitchcock had still lived i think he would have been very proud of the Psycho legacy.<br/><br/>I must admit after years with seeing parodies and hearing references certain scenes of the movie isn't particularly scary anymore. Like the shower scene which has became a bit of a cliché by now. Nonetheless it's still a unique moment that shocked the audiences in 1960. But I warn you, even though some scenes are a bit outdated, it will still give you a scare. I'm serious I saw ""the Exorcist"" with no problem, but this movie freaked me out.<br/><br/>This movie deserves attention for it's legacy and it's great actors and of course Hitchcock himself. I give it a 9/10."

","Alfred Hitchcock has been considered a master of suspense and an artist of anxiety. In 1960 Hitchcock directed one on the most famous movies of all time, Psycho. Psycho starred Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin. This film helped set the stage for future horror movies.<br/><br/>In the beginning of this film, office worker Marion packs her bags and drives off with $40,000 worth of stolen cash. She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman and learns of his controlling mother. Marion is stabbed to death later that night in the shower by what looks like an old woman. This shower scene was famous ever since. The use of believability and artificiality makes Hitchcock stand out because most horror movies at the time were clearly fiction. <br/><br/>Throughout the entire film there is something going on that the audience hasn't got completely figured out. It builds up to something big and in the end it's not what the audience expected at all! Hitchcock has perfected his style of creating what is least likely to be expected. His movies are always a surprise at the end, making each one so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>Hitchcock has perfected his style of creating much-too-human monsters!"

","This black and white film needs that black and white artistic elaboration to find its complete value. We are entering a progressive descent into some kind of hell but we go down one step at a time without knowing there will be more steps after this one. This descent is represented in the film by the steps going up to the house behind the motel, then the steps going up and down from one level of the cabins to the next, then the staircase inside the house going up to the rooms but also going down to the fruit cellar. This image, which is a metaphor of the mind when it is swallowed up by insanity, is essential and cannot be in color because an insane mind is a whole set of hues and shades of grey. But Hitchcock in this case constructs the plot itself that way. Sexual temptation for the boy friend, then mutual and reciprocal financial temptation for the money and the girl, then the run, the escape. And then one step at a time the trail is getting hotter and hotter. The boss seeing her driving out of town. The cop finding her asleep in her car on the shoulder of a road. The cop following her and observing her swapping her car for another. The motel to escape the rain and get some rest. The sandwich and the milk, the discussion and the mental trap for her, the poor thief, and for him the poor surviving son. And you can go on and on and that will lead you to the end, but with only one question in your mind. How is it possible that such doom can fall upon someone? But who is that someone? The son, Norman Bates, a killer of his own mother and her lover who was left free to survive in society? The poor thief Marion Crane who was trusted with the un-trustable, so much money that her jaws fell down? There is in this film, maybe more than in most Hitchcock's films, the sense of some kind of doom or fate or destiny governed and controlled by some kind of insane authority. Hitchcock was showing then the God he never alluded to in this film that was governing this world must have gone not AWOL as some may say but insane, frankly schizophrenic. For this sinister world to make sense, you need to state that the master mind of our cosmos is a double personality, good old god on one side and good old Satan on the other side and the fight between the two are not even close to the beginning of an end and our lot will be like that tossed from the benevolent hand of god into the malevolent hand of Satan and/or vice versa as many times as these two will find some pleasure in doing so, as long as we will not cut the branches and the roots of this divine and devilish schizophrenia that is finding its source in our very flesh and mind and that is outsourced by our spirit or brain into some autonomous though totally virtual, an absolute simulacrum, of reality, an outsourcing movement that gives us the illusion of sanity paid for by that mental and spiritual alienation that the invention of these two supernatural beings represents for us. Better be alienated in spirituality than divided in reality. That explains so well the fact that such lines of thinking and representing our own experiential life can lead to all kinds of possible bigotry and fundamentalism, as soon as we decide we are standing on the only side worth it, that is to say the side of good, the side of god, the side of light, without understanding that there are so many shades of light and so many hues of shade that if we all stand one-sided and one-spirited and one-minded for what each one of us consider as pure light we are absolutely doomed to commit our daily genocide every day between our morning shower and our breakfast, just as an appetizer for our day of labor. And Hitchcock builds that fate upside down for the poor Marion Crane: the genocide of Norman Bates' mother happens between Marion Crane's evening snack and her before-going-to-bed shower, a shower she will never finish taking and that will be turned into a long bath in some muddy pond. The final and concluding image of the car containing the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life. He even imposes onto us a five minutes psychological ranting discourse from the local psychiatrist to convince us that all is normal since everything is upside down, but is it? Is it not the reverse: everything is upside down since all is normal, or is it everything is normal because all is upside down, or whatever? Add a touch of color to that film and you will produce a big meaningless mess. Black, white and grey become death so well, just like mourning becomes Elektra.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"elshikh4","8","0","2","21 December 2008"," Clinging to The Past !
","I think that's an important horror piece. Bold, and nasty. But being just the well-done even original horror, doesn't make it outlive all the other movies of the genre as sure it did. What I loved about Psycho, regarding that I don't ""love"" the Horror genre in the first place!, else being a brilliant case of Jekyll and Hyde as son and mother, or being that awesomely suspenseful and highly creepy, is that it has unique interpretation, and talented inner meaning of its own that will give it the immortality it deserves. In short, this genre movie.. Got brains!<br/><br/>Norman Bates is nothing but a rare perfect type of a person who lives the past, and can't let it go. He is a clear proof that the strong clinging to the past, with losing the contact with the present, makes you a monster indeed. Look at him, lost it after the murder of his mother, the time stopped in that sick point, and also him. So when he couldn't utterly face the truth, the reality, he had to continue living yesterday endlessly and dopily, which led him to be the freak he was. He managed to kill his days by killing his best dreams / the nice girls, because he was a slave of his fear to face the world with his desires, transforming into the most ravenous, as well as the most alive, stuffed animal in the house.<br/><br/>Norman buried his mother so himself into this motel where only his demons were being comfortable. This old palace illustrated perpetually the dark bygone, or the importunate sins, when we don't have the ability to break it away to become our chosen big tomb, and our dreams' slaughterhouse. Strange that nobody ever helped Norman, but since when anybody ever thinks of a troubled person like him in a greedy world that runs after the money, and the money only. Actually, it could be the reason why Norman Bates pulled off murdering whoever came to the motel, as he was stronger than them all, since he doesn't want the money.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of suppressed kid in Anthony Perkins's performance as Norman, and how that could make him a serial killer in a way. The dialogue was plain and deep if you catch on the film's main motif, and interesting also with its sarcastic indications at the second watching: ""Mother didn't feel like herself tonight!"". And (Bernard Herrmann) is the best when it comes to create great horror music; I read once about making his music for black and white films into black and white feel too, by his own special orchestration. This man got both the eloquent style and the commercial captivity superbly. I'm obsessed with the opening credits' hot score, it said it all, and it can infiltrate into your deepest nastiness, or deal with what's under your skin of the most awful thoughts ever.<br/><br/>I adore the brief, yet marvelously clever, zoom-in on Norman's face after he drowned the car, aside from being darkly expressing and distinctive at the 1950s' end, it's a slight touch confirms how Hitch was madly in love with the art of cinema. Though, still the most terrifying moment was when we have the chance finally to meet Mrs. Bates' face, but as for now, it's definitely the moment after, when Norman as Mrs. Bates smiles at the camera's eye refusing to harm a fly, and in one split second, we saw the ghost of the real mother's empty skull while the mix of the lifted car / the film's last shot; I believe Hitchcock made it confident that someone would see it as well as relish it in the assured next watching. As you see, one watching isn't enough.<br/><br/>For negative points; unlike millions, I hated the bathtub's crime scene; yes, it was new, frightful, and Hitch enjoyed handling it cinematically, but it took sex and violence to extremes on screen, representing a new age of exploiting these factors in a shocking manner. A manner that would pave the way for more shocking, less human horror movies. I know that it's art, and the artist is free, and their creations have to develop, and push the boundaries, but maybe I don't like this kind of development, or encourage pushing these very boundaries.<br/><br/>Btw, he lost reason behind the rest of Psycho's franchise as being lower is easy, they were only the exploitation, as cheap horror movies, with nothing under the surface to present, let alone the matter of breakable surface already, with less artistic everything, as if the producers took the worst of Norman Bates and Marion Crane themselves; killing madly yet to earn some big bucks!<br/><br/>Psycho is some climax for Hitchcock, in terms of ability and popularity. It's a fine genre movie with possible meaning, which means very fine in my book apart. And the best about it was that it achieved being the most *film* among all the genre's movies."

The overall acting was good. The few violent scenes looked pretty cheesy, but for its time not horrible. Would recommend this film to any level of viewer from newbie all the way to movie buff.

","One of the most famous movies of all time, and quite possibly influential horror film in history, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho traded the supernatural beings of the genres past Vampires, werewolves, zombies and the like for an all too human monster. The film made Norman Bates a household name and permanently guaranteed its director's status as the master of suspense.<br/><br/>Psycho is a curious shocker devised by the master of suspense Hitchcock as a tease and received most critics as an unpleasant horror piece. After enormous commercial success it achieved classic status over the years, despite effective moments of fright, it has a childish plot and script and its interest is that of a tremendously successful confidence trick, made for very little money. Probably the most visual, most cinematic picture he has ever made. I think the film is a reflection of a most unpleasant mind, a mean, sly, sadistic mind.<br/><br/>After many talks about a remake finally one come with Psycho in 1998 starring Julianne Moore, William H Macy and well. A terrible actor called Vince Vaughn. This version isn't a sacrilege, it's just pointless. To those who like the remake it is all very well having your tongue praising the film, but it does help having a brain in your skull. It also spawned two sequels and a TV series starring Lori Petty. The first sequel is a reasonably inventive sequel, if on the gory side. It probably holds the record for longest delayed follow up.<br/><br/>The narrative is very unusual for its date of release as there are two separate narrative strands. The storyline firstly is from Marion stealing the money which is helped along with misleading the audience into believing that the patrolman and Marion will be a story about a girl who steals money. The film has influenced many other especially What Lies Beneath which is literally a Hitchcock Pastiche. I also like that it is black and white photography as the blood colour (red) was to gruesome to show in 1960. And also it was less budget. What I like about the film is that it lends to the horror genre like Silence Of The Lambs is that they have no actual supernatural undertones even slashers like Halloween and Friday The 13th have supernatural undertones; honestly how many times can you be shot and survive only to appear in another.<br/><br/>The film is definitely one of my favourites. Like Spielberg's Jaws, Coppola's The Godfather, Lynch's Blue Velvet, this is his best film."
"blippster","10","0","1","1 October 2008"," The most suspenseful film I have ever seen. A classic.
","Alfred Hitchcock famously said: ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it."" I think that what Hitchcock meant by the line is that a moment in a movie that is considered 'scary', such as a murder or a stabbing, is not scary at all on its own; it is the lead-up to and anticipation of it that is scary. I agree with this statement, especially in the case of 'Psycho'. The murder scenes in 'Psycho' are very sub-par by today's standards, in that you don't see much blood (and the blood you do see isn't very vivid, as it is black and white), and in one stabbing scene, you don't even see the knife penetrate the victim's flesh. The murder scenes are also obviously fake, and by today's standards of gore, are almost laughable.<br/><br/>However, these negative points boil down to almost nothing when you compare it with the positive points in ""Psycho"", and I believe that some of the biggest positive points of the movie were the extremely well made suspense sequences, especially the scene where Lila Crane is in the house at the end. Alfred Hitchcock is known as ""The Master of Suspense"" and these scenes are a very good example of why he is called that. As Hitchcock said, the terror is in the suspense. In this movie, there are only three sequences which could be defined as ""violent"", although, because of the heart-pumping terror of the suspense scenes, ""Psycho"" is, for me, one of the scariest movies I've seen.<br/><br/>When comparing ""Psycho"" to new horror movies, ""Psycho"" wins hands down. While most modern horror movies are infinitely more violent than ""Psycho"", none of them seem to have the same gripping, heart-wrenching feeling because of their lack of suspense. With most new horror movies I have seen, such as ""Saw"" the movie didn't really get much scarier after the first bit of violence. For ""Psycho"", the effect was almost opposite, and the lack of violence was, in fact, one of the movies strengths.<br/><br/>I would say that ""Psycho"" is what a real horror movie is. When making a horror movie, one should focus less on the gore, and take a page out of Hitchcock's book by focusing on the suspense.<br/><br/>A solid 10/10!"

"moviesleuth2","10","0","1","24 July 2008"," Truly Terrifying
","If you go on YouTube there are a number of short films that can be viewed from there. ""Psycho"" feels like one of those, both in its story and its construction (though ""Psycho"" is about 10 times longer than most of the shorts you'd find on the internet). That's part of its charm; it's simplicity gives Hitchcock a lot of room to work with, and really develop every last detail to create its greatest impact. The fact that the film survived almost fifty years (and a remake) proves that all the work paid off.<br/><br/>The less said about the story, the better (in fact, the best thing to do is to go into this movie knowing as little information as possible). I will say this: A woman (Marion Crane) has just stolen $40,000 from her boss and skipped town to join her boyfriend, and on the way she stops at a motel.<br/><br/>There are two names (of real people) that are always going to be associated with ""Psycho:"" Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins (arguably Janet Leigh would also be mentioned, but she doesn't create the impact that the other two do in my opinion). Both of them work wonders here. Hitchcock has created the perfect film; everything works so brilliantly that I can't even find words to describe it. Down to the last detail, Hitchcock meticulously constructed one of the most awesome and terrifying films ever to grace the screen.<br/><br/>People may not remember Anthony Perkins' name, but anyone who has heard of ""Psycho"" will recognize the name Norman Bates (which is the point of acting, though the opposite is the case in today's world). That is how effective his performance is. I recently watched ""The River Wild,"" where Kevin Bacon does a terrific job of portraying a character who is sympathetic in the beginning and a total psychopath later on. Anthony Perkins accomplishes the same thing, and his performance is a lot more effective. At the beginning, he's a young, boyish sort of man who is a motor-mouth at the beginning because he is absolutely smitten with the beautiful woman who has just stopped at his hotel. His charming personality slowly turns to being a frightening one as the movie goes on, and this is accomplished with the same effectiveness. It is especially noteworthy that he does this completely in sync with Hitchcock's direction.<br/><br/>The other actors are understandably overshadowed by the Hitchcock and Perkins, but to their credit no one can hold a candle to what they accomplished. Actually, the other performances are very strong. The females are the most successful, especially Vera Miles. Miles is the perfect anchor for the film. She finds a balance between anxiety and determination. Even though she is not given much to work with, she creates a sympathetic sister. Wide-eyed Janet Leigh is also good (though she overacts slightly at times) as Marion Crane, and her scene when she talks to Norman is delicately handled (though even she can't help but be out-shined by Perkins). Martin Balsam brings a noirish feel to his character, but he still fits right in. Like Perkins, John Gavin has a change of character, though he goes from charming to determined instead of psychotic. Gavin makes Sam Loomis easy to sympathize with.<br/><br/>James Berardinelli, a film critic that I greatly respect, said that ""Psycho"" is not Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film is not his best because it lacks the story and character complexity of ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo,"" the latter of which I have not seen. I respectfully disagree. Why? Because it doesn't need them. ""Psycho's"" simplicity works to its advantage, and it's clockwork like procession adds a deeper level of fear that a film with more complexity in any area would not be able to create.<br/><br/>I often say that ""Halloween"" is the scariest movie of all time. Strangely, though, I gave that film an 8/10 and this one a 10/10. The reason is because while ""Halloween"" is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen (and in some parts scarier than this one), it is not without flaws. ""Psycho"" is flawless and, maybe because it's been a few years since I have seen John Carpenter's film (and a lifetime before I will see it again), more polished. I also said that ""Halloween"" creates a high level of suspense with minimal violence, and that is true, but ""Psycho"" does it with even less.<br/><br/>Earlier in this review I said that it is better to go into this film knowing as little as possible. This is true, though ""Psycho"" is so well-known that many people already know a lot about it, especially the ending twist. I was one of those unfortunate souls who knew about it, and while I have to admit that a lot of the impact was lost because of this, Hitchock still delivers the goods well enough to warrant a viewing.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" was remade shot for shot by Gus van Sant in 1998. It would be interesting to see what difference there is in the two versions (though I've heard the remake is terrible). Still, I'm going to see the remake and be the judge. But maybe I'm making a mistake, for the reported awfulness of the remake may taint the praise I have for the original. That said, nothing, not even ""Halloween,"" can hold a candle to ""Psycho."""

","Vertigo is defitely Hitchcock's masterpiece from a director's standpoint. It had new and innovative cinematography techniques and a very complex plot line. It was no doubt one of a kind and is still unrivaled by any other thriller because it is impossible to copy it. Psycho is the exact opposite. Psycho was the first true slasher film, but even more, it was the first thriller/horror blockbuster. Sure their had been others before it, The cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Frankenstein for example, but none of them hit home the same way that Psycho did. Psycho is a triumph for the common movie watcher. It is a movie that any one can enjoy because it is deceptively simple. Even more than that, however, it is probably one of, if not the, most influential films ever. Many films have tried, unsuccessfully of course, to imitate its one of a kind plot and execution. Any slasher film about a family going to a secluded place and being stalked by an invisible killer can be traced back to psycho. But even with the endless copies and even one remake, no movie has ever captured the horror of Psycho. The Exorcist was a text book grossout film, Jaws was scary for frequent beach goers, and Alien was a horrific movie about our friends from outer space. All three of these don't approach psycho for one reason and one reason alone: The Shower Scene. It is hard to still get the full efect of the shower scene because there is so little blood. It is nothing compared to some of the brutal murders from movies such as Last House on the Left. It, however, taps a nerve that no one else has, and that is not from too little effort. No, it is great for one reason and one reason alone, it is a SHOWER scene. This is the reason it is so scary. I could not take a shower with the curtain closed for a week after I saw this movie. The reason it is so scary is because most people in America take a shower at least once a day. Sure Jaws is scary, but some people go there whole life time without going to beach. Everyone takes showers. It is also hard for the average person to realize just how vulnerable they are in the shower. This is the reason why this scene is so powerful. It uses an event that happens in many households every day. This is what sets psycho apart and this is why it is so unique. So, in conclusion, My advise to any slasher film fans is to watch Psycho, love Psycho, worship Psycho."

","The irony of the film PSYCHO for me is that while I wasn't born when it came out in 1960 and didn't get to see it until some 20 years after its release, I actually DIDN'T know anything that happened in it when I first saw it! So the shock, awe, and surprise for me was the firsthand reactions of someone who had never seen or known anything about the film. Of course, that was back in an age where there was no internet, very few channels to watch on TV, and spoilers weren't put out forever and a day. I was lucky. I hope anyone who hasn't seen film and enjoys films is as lucky as I was.<br/><br/>You know the story: THE GREATEST MACGUFFIN EVER TOLD! The great Alfred Hitchcock totally fools us into thinking that this masterwork is about retrieving a stolen $40,000 when in fact it is about SOOOOO much more than that! Marion Crane (played by the great Janet Leigh in a complex, sexy, heartbreaking performance) steals the money from her boss, an insurance agent, then 'steals' off (pun intended) 'into the night' (actually it was daytime) with the money. Along the way she has thoughts of various conflicting thoughts and emotions of the results of her actions and ends up at the Bates Motel.<br/><br/>Ahh, the Bates Motel! The most famous location in all of film history! Marion meets the proprietor and manager Norman Bates (played by none other than Anthony Perkins in one of the most stunning, sterling, fascinating, perfect performances in film history). Norman is the mama's boy to end all mamas boys! The parlor conversation between Norman and Marion has got to be, to this day, one of the most fascinating talks between two lost souls ever put to screen. The angular way that Hitchcock shot it adds to its brilliance. The albeit too brief 'relationship' between Norman and Marion is never talked about enough for me: it's obvious that her sexuality intimidates him and is rather off-putting. And you can tell that she finds his sweetness and vulnerability a refreshing change from the big city jerks that she is used to. Two great performances, both of which should have won Oscars. Leigh was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and the fact that Perkins wasn't nominated for Best Actor may be the all time biggest oversight in Oscar history.<br/><br/>PSYCHO is fascinating on so many levels and gets a lot about human nature right: the aforementioned sexuality that lies within all of us, the different levels of guilt that all humans possess (virtually every character in this film is guilty of SOMETHING), the ways that men objectify women, and fact that all of us at heart are shaped by our parents, whether we'd want to admit it or not.<br/><br/>This is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film accomplishment for me, and that says a lot because he is my favorite director of all time. He got nominated for Best Director (the Academy got that part right), but didn't win (Academy got this one wrong). And PSYCHO is in the top 5 films of all time for me also. It is a landmark that ironically inspired thousands (maybe millions) knock-offs about psychotic mama-boy serial killers. But this is the film with the real heart and soul. No remakes, retreads, or sequels necessary."

","Everybody knows the famous score; everybody knows the villain and most people know what kind of man Norman Bates is like.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" starts off with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who robs a sum of forty-thousand dollars before driving through the California state with almost being caught by her boss and the employer she robbed the money from to the cop that pulls her over. Marion then wonders more into the state where during her departure not only does she get a new car to be incognito but stays at the Bates Motel where Norman Bates comes out and sees that she's by herself and needs company. To Marion, she thinks Norman is just a nice guy until the voices from the house start to ring where maybe something isn't right after all.<br/><br/>And that's where it all begins.<br/><br/>I love Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" as a thriller, but I don't get why people are calling it a great horror movie just because of the shower scene and Norman dressing like his mother. I think of Psycho as a crime/thriller/drama film where people need to understand that Marion committed a crime of stealing the money and after her death in the film, her disappearance along with the money is still involved when the detective starts questioning those involved with Marion about her whereabouts.<br/><br/>This is the only Hitchcock movie where I can't keep my eyes off for one damn minute."

","June, 1960. The movie theatre is quiet; 45 minutes ago, the halls were buzzing with anticipation, but not anymore. Nobody has been allowed into the cinema since the picture began, and the audience is dead quiet. Through the walls of the theatre, one can hear the muffled whirr of running water. Silence. An indistinct shadow is seen approaching through the curtain. Accompanied by the fierce screech of violins, hundreds of voices suddenly utter a deafening chorus of horrified shock; some patrons collapse into the aisle. Bernard Hermann continues to pound the violin with extraordinary intensity, and a bloody streak carves its path towards the drainpipe. Audience members reel with a frantic mixture of stunned confusion and gripping fear. The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, has just painted the most extraordinary masterstroke of his distinguished career. The simple act of taking a shower will never again be the same.<br/><br/>Though he produced many films that could justifiably be considered masterpieces, it is unlikely that Hitchcock ever directed anything more popular and influential than 'Psycho (1960).' The first of only two Hitchcock horror films, it shocked many with its unique narrative structure, and the infamous ""shower scene"" has become permanently imprinted in the movie-going public's collective memory. Hitchcock allegedly produced the film in order to reclaim his designation as ""The Master of Suspense,"" as he considered Frenchman Henri-Georges Clouzot to have temporarily seized the title with 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and especially 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' Interestingly, the latter film has a particularly alarming bathtub sequence, and perhaps 'Psycho' was the film through which Hitchcock was able to respond to (and improve upon) the achievements of his chief rival. Gone are the larger-than-life artistic flourishes of 'Vertigo (1958)' and 'North by Northwest (1959)'  this is the Master of Suspense at his leanest and meanest, a film completely stripped of its spectacle and lowered into the unfathomable depths of the disturbed human mind.<br/><br/>Adapted by Joseph Stefano and Samuel A. Taylor from a 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' opens with the character of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real-estate secretary who impulsively steals $40,000 from her boss and flees in the direction of her California boyfriend. Her cross-country flight ultimately leads her to the Bates Motel, managed by the awkward and mild-mannered Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a man who submits loyally to the wishes of his mentally-ill, domineering mother. Meanwhile, Marion's boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and sister Lila (Vera Miles) set out in pursuit, their search ending  inevitably  at the Bates motel. The story sporadically shifts from one character to the other; after convincing audiences that Marion Crane is ""the wrong man"" of so many of his previous pictures, Hitchcock deftly strikes at the heart of their sympathies. In his early film 'Sabotage (1936),' the director had condemned his own decision to murder a character with whom the viewer had been asked to identify, though here he once again dared to break his own rules, and we've never forgotten it.<br/><br/>Paramount was so aghast at the story's graphic subject matter, labelling it ""too repulsive,"" that Hitchcock's budget was severely restricted, and the director was forced to finance the film through his own Shamley Productions. These budget limitations proved crucial in developing the unforgettable atmosphere, and were a major factor in his decision to film is black-and-white (which he also did to avoid incurring the wrath of the censors). Though 'Psycho' received a mixed critical response upon its release, its commercial success was extraordinary, and film-goers lined entire city blocks to experience the director's latest. Conversely, fellow British director Michael Powell's thematically-similar 'Peeping Tom (1960)' had been severely trashed by critics and audiences alike just months earlier, and the career of the beloved filmmaker was, for all practical purposes, left in ruins. Furthermore, the success of 'Psycho' triggered the emergence of the ""slasher"" flick, and subsequent years saw a slew of inferior, gory and imaginatively-titled knock-offs, such as 'Maniac (1963),' 'Paranoic (1963)' and 'Fanatic (1965).'<br/><br/>Though discussions of 'Psycho' rarely stray from the film's more disturbing moments, it's interesting to consider the various crucial scenes of human interaction. Marion's supper with Norman in the parlour room, surrounded by the seemingly-passive but strangely-threatening stuffed birds, is a masterpiece of nervous tension, awkwardness, and the tiny inflections of human speech that communicate more than mere words ever could. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman Bates to quirky perfection, and his character {perhaps modelled from Dennis Weaver's jittery hotel night manager in 'Touch of Evil (1958)'  also starring Janet Leigh} is a man who initially demands our pity and understanding. Even after the atrocity in the shower, Hitchcock, as he also did in 'Frenzy (1972),' builds a suspense sequence around a villain's attempts to conceal the traces of his crime. Martin Balsam is rarely mentioned when discussing the film, but his characterisation of detective Milton Arbogast is letter-perfect, his shrewd but amenable tone successfully lulling Norman into a false sense of triumph, and yet the audience knows full well that the experienced investigator sees the transparency of his lies.<br/><br/>Despite the prevalence of cultural spoofs and references, 'Psycho' is a thriller that still holds up exceptionally well, even though most viewers are fully-aware of the first major twist. When I first watched the film several years ago, I was completely ignorant of Mother's true identity, and I gasped aloud at the revelation in the fruit cellar, the swinging lightbulb casting a shifting luminance on the rotting corpse of Norma Bates, as Bernard Herrmann's intense, imaginative and very memorable musical score screeches in the background. Few moments in cinema have succeeded in giving me the same icy chill as the image of Norman in the prison cell, consumed by the mental consciousness of his overbearing mother, and that sinister smile that fades subliminally into the decaying shadow of a human skull. Norman Bates will continue to live on in my nightmares."

Most people say that the scenes like that bathtub hole or murderer with knife make it enormous. I agree with the people who think like that but in fact there is a more important scene that you watch breathless. These scenes are that the psychiatrist made inferences from Norman Bates' view and words. I will never forget these scenes.<br/><br/>According to the story, Marion Crane works in an estate agent and she is wanted to deposit 40.000 $. Crane doesn't return to the agent. Everybody believe that Crane runs away with his friend Sam Loomis but the truth isn't like that. Crane starts to stay in Bates Hotel that takes part in the way that goes to his friend's town.

","I really liked the movie but I don't think that it lived up to what I had expected I to be. Don't get me wrong it really was a very good film but It had been hyped up so much that I thought it was going to become my favorite. The movie is about a young woman who is having an affair with a married man. The man she is having an affair with is not financially stable to be able to leave his wife and pay alimony. When her boss asks her to deposit 40,000 dollars in the bank for him she decides to take the money instead. She decides to drive to California from Arizona to meet him and start a life with him.<br/><br/>Her journey there is very suspenseful, she gets followed by a police officer and you could tell that he's onto her. The police officer even follows her into a car dealership where she decides to trade in her car for a new one. At this point I am already jumping out of my seat because of the music that Hitchcock uses to follow the action in the movie. I can see why the soundtrack to the movie made it even better but I couldn't stand it! It was driving me nuts I had no idea when to expect something bad to happen, I guess it did its job because it sure had me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>I guess the one thing that did bother me was the pace of the movie, I felt like it was just way too slow. Perhaps this is just because it was in black and white so it seemed a little duller and slow to me. When I was watching it I already knew to expect the shower scene to be the best scene of all. I was absolutely shocked that it happened so fast in the movie. This movie is very well known but the shower scene is infamous so for it to take place so early in the movie it really made me wonder where the movie was going to go next. It is the biggest turning point in the movie, but I have to say it didn't really scare me. Don't get me wrong I love the fact that it was not gory but I just didn't think it was very realistic. Im sure that is just because I have already seen so many movies that were brutally gruesome but considering that this one wasn't it definitely made its point without giving away the identity of the killer. The end of the movie was mind blowingly hilarious and terrifying all at the same time, I don't want to give the ending away but its definitely something that you don't see coming. The twist reminded me of the feeling I had when I watched the sixth sense, it was that good! Overall I have to say the movie was pretty good, the climax and twist definitely makes up for any other shortcomings that the film might have had. I just wish I had been around when it first came out, Im sure that I would have appreciated it a lot more."

","Sir Alfred Hitchcock plays his audience like a fine instrument in this movie. He surprises at every turn. He layers some of the greatest suspense he ever put on film. This film will always have a place amongst the classic films.<br/><br/>Despite it's greatness, this is the most humble of films. When Hitchcock made this film, he actually did it on the cheap. He used the summer vacation from his TV series & used his regular TV crew to film this. The cast agreed to work for little money.<br/><br/>The genius in this movie is all Alfred Hitchcock. All he did was take an ordinary summer vacation, applied his genius to it, and produced an all time classic film. Hitch looked at this as a challenge. He wanted to prove it didn't take a bunch of money & a lot of studio smoke & mirrors to produce a great film. He succeeded beyond anyones wildest dreams.<br/><br/>Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins will never be forgotten for their parts in this masterpiece. Nor should they be, for their performances sparkle. Janet only had to work a portion of that summer. Perkins summer performance would last the rest of his life.<br/><br/>This is one of the first films to actually use a throne (toilet) in the film. Until Psycho, movies had never shown a toilet on screen & it is eerie how this throne comes on screen relating to the famous shower sequence. The 5 minute movie trailer with Alfred Hitchcock showing you around the Bates Motel set is a classic trailer for any film.<br/><br/>Regardless, it is Sir Alfred who really brought all this into a great film. No one else could have done it better. This film proves it doesn't take money to make a classic, just genius. We just don't find much of that around these days."

","A groundbreaking film from beginning to end even by today's standards. Psycho has been reviewed over and over in Film schools and Universities and with very good reason. Alfred Hitchcock was a savage stuffed bird genius. He was so very inventive, courageously creative and true to his cause. He was so ahead of his time. Psycho has no clichÃ©s, on the contrary it broke boundaries and crushed all sorts of taboos in film making. Apart from shocking this film must have been downright scandalous too. This film is great from all angles. Starts with Janet Leigh fleeing the city with the stolen cash like an escaped canary to freedom or the unknown dangers outside. Hitchcock was obsessed with birds and totally inspired by them, yes hence the movie 'The Birds'. The suspense in Psycho is superb. We are constantly at the edge of our seats and what comes to us is way beyond our expectations and imagination. Anthony Perkins was perfect for the role which was to follow him for the rest of his days. He even had the right shape for this part and that is were I think they failed the most in trying to remake this film, it was a small but very effective detail, they did not take into consideration the shape of this man Hitchcock had chosen. Hitchcock was also the first as far as I know to ever slash our starring attractive blonde actress to pieces in the middle of the movie and sending the film off into another direction with our suspense at its peak. The shower scene is an all time classic that must have downright shocked the audience at the time because even watching it today will keep you with it imprinted in your memory forever, no matter what we are used to seeing on our screens today. The irony in those shots is that as they were being shot Hitchcock is going ""cut"" ""cut"" ""cut"".....That knife is the beak of a bird of prey. Metaphorically there are birds everywhere in this film as in most of his work. The mother is a stuffed bird."

","I have recently seen this film because my daughter had to study it for her media coursework. I think it is a very clever film with many connotations. The storyline is original, it quickly unfolds capturing our attention, leading us from scene to scene as the story gathers danger. The film is particularly enhanced with symbolic interpretations that strongly feature throughout such as the mirrors, birds (and references to), lines, weather conditions and most renowned of all- the screeching discordant tones that warn it's audience that something gruesome is about to happen. This film is one of morals and lost opportunities. The ending is quiet an eye-opener and is a kind of summing-up or conclusion, giving the audience an explanation/answer. Psycho is a thought evoking film that is very watchable."
"drownnnsoda","10","0","1","1 June 2006"," Hitchock's Most Famous Film, And Probably His Best.
","""Psycho"" is one of the greatest horror classics of all time. The film follows Marion Crane, played by the legendary Janet Leigh, embezzles $40,000 from her employer. She goes and buys a brand new car with the cash, and hits the road to start a new life. That night she gets caught in a really bad rainstorm in the desert, and she spots the bright lighted sign of the Bates Motel, which she decides will be her destination for now. She checks in, and the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), makes her a sandwich. He seems nice, if not a little strange. She then goes to her room, undresses, while Norman spies through a hole in the wall.She enters the bathroom, and begins taking a shower. And I'm sure most of you know what happens from there on. Anyways, Marion's sister and lover begin to worry about her disappearance and hire a detective to investigate.<br/><br/>""Psycho"" is a true classic, plain and simple, and one of the best horror films in history. The whole story (based on the book by Robert Bloch) is very interesting and the film keeps you guessing, because you never really know who Norman's mother is - the mystery shrouded around it all is effective and eerie. The infamous shower scene is now known by thousands of people, so it's kind of trademarked this series of films (although all of the sequels are awful besides ""Psycho II"", which was just alright), and the editing of the scene defines the ""less is more"" saying. The tricky editing used fools the audience into thinking they are seeing more than they are, and it is brilliantly done.<br/><br/>After Marion's murder, Janet Leigh's presence is felt like a ghost throughout the rest of the film, while her sister and boyfriend try and find her. Anthony Perkins is near perfection as the kind but strange Norman Bates, he gives the character much depth and a feeling of unease. Janet Leigh is excellent as well in the role of her career as the ill-fated Marion. The film is black and white, which gives it that classic movie feel, I like old black and white movies, although you don't see very many horror ones. The pacing is excellent and the film holds interest wonderfully. The ending is a bit of shocker, and that final frame is one you won't shake easily.<br/><br/>Ovearll, this is probably Hitchcock's best film ever. The story is great, the acting (especially by Perkins and Leigh) was pitch perfect, and the film was genuinely scary with some a heavy doses of suspense. The shower scene is classic, too - if there is one scene in all of Hollywood history that won't be forgotten, that shower murder is it. Undeniably one of the greatest horror films in history. 10/10."

This movie has so many deeper meanings, it's impossible to list them all.

In fact, he seems very sweet to me.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing bad about this film, and it is my all-time favourite film. Every person who likes watching a true classic horror film, this should be at the top of your list.<br/><br/>Shot in glorious black and white, the cinematography, music and suspense in this film are all filmed to perfection.

","When I began watching this movie I felt that a film from the year 1960 couldn't possibly have an effect on somebody who has seen all the major horror movies of the last 30 years or so. Exorcist, Omen, The Shining, Friday the 13th, etc. etc. etc. etc. Never have I watched a movie that layered such powerful emotional scenarios into digestible brain food that nourishes the darkest places of my psyche. . As the movie went on I felt Norman Bates' madness slowly bubble and build so exquisitely that it was indeed a guilty pleasure to witness his final all out blitzkrieg into sheer madness. At this breaking point it was I too who had lived the moment with all of the unfortunate guests of the Bates Motel. Oh I am not a psycho per SE, but after watching this movie I felt like I lived every experience in the first person. It was after the movie directly after the last scene that I realized that a movie this special had eluded my eyes for so long. I almost felt heartbroken because it would have been the horror/terror movie to judge all others. I recommend to any teenager getting into film to really watch this, perhaps alone, perhaps not. I am just floored by the powerful use of music and the absolute shock value. The psychological thriller was born from this film. I thought SEVEN was shocking, and to some degree it was. But I was shocked deep to my core after viewing this masterpiece. Nothing in film will shock me ever again, I truly believe this. This Hitchcock fellow was something special. It took me 30 years to see this, and its much more than just a shower scene. Thats only the beginning. Oh the classics. Lets not confuse Classic with Old like so many of us are so quick to do. This movie transcends Classic and is more modern than the stuff Hollywood is pushing out these days. Still shocking after 46 years."

","What can be added to the praise that this film has received? Not much, so I'll just give my own personal reasons for liking it. The plot is superb and simple. A young gal nicks 40 grand and heads outa town. She ends up at a crusty old motel with a nutcase of an owner, Norman Bates. The odd chats, the murder in the shower, the cover-up, the hunt for the missing lady, the private eye's death, the unmasking of Bates' multiple personality. All brilliantly done. An excellent score as well, it really fits the picture. This film is no nonsense and also highly entertaining. Numerous cinematic devices are employed by Hitch to great effect. The remake didn't have the same character for whatever reason. Black and white worked. I'd recommend the DVD with Hitch's personal tour of the set, it was very funny."

","i say full marks to Hitchcock what a film i am a huge fan ,The best thing of this movie was it never failed to keep me thinking and that meant i would never be bored or take my eyes off it (wish there was more please give me more .....but i have to say when Janet Leigh dies in the shower scene and she is lying on the bathroom floor and the camera shows her face i could see her vein in her neck still moving ,but it never spoiled the movie for me ,? also was there one more movie made or was there two .I think the name psycho was a bit under stated as the title, and i say that due to the beginning of the movie focuses on a couple with turmoil pressures in there lives and Marion crane steeling money to get some badly wanted or needed freedom at last which in turn the price she finally pays or receives is death"

","It goes without saying that Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is easily his best film. The best horror film ever made. The best surprise ending ever unveiled. And the best Anthony Perkins film ever (although that isn't saying much).<br/><br/>One of the most revolutionary films ever made, Psycho has so many thrills and shocks ever made. What might look like child's play to today's audience, must have completely blown away the minds of movie-goers from its time. Hitchcock throws caution to the wind and it pays off big time. What no other director would dare to put on screen, he does with surprising bluntness.<br/><br/>To reveal Psycho's secrets to someone who hasn't seen it would be crime. The score of Herrman is the real star of the film that gives it a legendary status. No other film score has ever added more depth and intensity to propel a story. A truly horrifyingly great stay at the Bates Motel. Mother knows best."

","this is a roller-coaster ride of a scary movie. you could tell when you first hear that scary music, that something terrifying was on the way. The first half hour of the movie was kinda like a crime movie. It showed Janet Leigh stealing 40,000 dollars from her boss. then she drives far away to Touson,Arizona to find her sister. But she gets tired, so she pulls the car over and rests. In the morning she is woken up by a cop, she tries to flee. but he asks for her ID. then she goes to a car dealership, to get a new car, 'cause the same cop from before is following her. she gets a new car very quickly,and is acting very suspisicous. then she buys the car,in cash. she continues driving, but it's raining bad, she put the wipers on. but she can't at all. then she sees the big bright ""Bate's motel"" sign, and pulls over. then she checks in and the motel manager,Norman Bates, a very lonely mama's boy. he seems like a nice person, she checks in under a fake name. then Norman goes to his creepy-ass house on a hill with steps right next to the motel, to get Marion some food. Marion goes into her room and hears from the house, Norman and his mom arguing. then Norman comes down the hill with the food. then him and Marion have a talk, and he says his mom is bed-ridden. after their talk, Marion goes back to her cabin. moments later, she takes a shower, which turns out to be the most shooking and most effective scence in film. Marion gets stabbed and killed by Norman who's dressed up as his mom. Hitchcock does it so brilliantly and dosen't show a single stab, also the movie's black and white so he used chocolate that goes down the drain just like blood. Another terrifying and clever scence is when a detective goes to the Bate's house to question the mom about Marion. as he goes up the stairs, a door opens a crack, then out of nowhere comes Norman, who stabs the detective, he falls down the stairs and the camera falls with him. how you find out Bate's is the killer, is Marion's sister and Marion's boyfriend go to the motel, they never heard from the detective. they pose as a couple, and Marion's sister goes up to the house,while Marion's boyfriend questions Bates, she finds Mrs. Bates, who turns out to be dead in a chair,she screams,and up pops Norman dressed as his mother and talking in his mom's voice. he has a split personality. one of the scariest and most original films of all time. it also opened up the doors to a new horror genre,slasher. very effective!"

","HUGE SPOILERS<br/><br/>Whenever someone mentions ""Psycho"", the first thing that comes to mind is Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates. But ""Psycho"" is more than Perkins' extraordinary performance and Hitchcock's masterful direction. The movie offers a great plot of mystery and horror. It all starts as a dramatic situation but turns into a story of horror and beyond reason. <br/><br/>Marion Crane escapes from his routine life and steals $40,000 from her work in order to start a new life with her boyfriend. Marion knows it's wrong but her moral won't stop her from doing her purpose. Everything seems to work on wheels until she stops in the Bates Motel where soon she will find her cruel fate. At this point of the movie you don't expect that it will be the main character's last scene!. This is where ""Psycho"" turns into a shocking movie, and at the same time the viewer is slapped in the face by Hitchcock's unique way of creating a suspenseful/creepy atmosphere. But it's until the audience meets Norman Bates (played masterfully by Mr. Anthony Perkins) when things start to get a new point of view. The story gets rid of the angelic heroine that turned bad and now focuses on the mysterious Motel's owner. Norman seems to be a shy guy with a dark vibe that makes his presence uncomfortable. His major problem is his over-protective mother than won't allow him to do anything that she considers is against moral. As Norman talks about his mother and how he's affected by her ""madness"", the viewer can determine that he is mentally disturbed but knows perfectly how to behave. Anthony Perkins acting is terrific because he knows how to create an uncomfortable atmosphere whenever he's on screen and mainly because he seems to be the kind of guy that is silent but dangerous at the same time. This is where the real suspense of the movie begins. And after Marion's murder things seem to get out of control for people who are used to scripts that don't get out of the standards. The main character is dead by half of the movie and from then, the situations become more interesting (in the point of view of a general audience) and you don't know what's gonna happen next, not even from a guess. This 180 degree twist has to be the most important in terms of contribution to any genre (being in this situation the Horror genre). What will happen to the people trying to find Marion? what about the $40,000? Who is behind Marion's murder? And most important of all, what's behind Norman Bates' behavior? Watch ""Psycho"" in order to witness one of the most important movies of all time. Even if you don't like the Horror/Mystery genre, this movie will leave you satisfied because it offers everything a good movie needs : Good acting, masterful direction, excellent script, and a perfect score.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins delivers a performance that needs special mention. The man knows how to portray a psycho like no other can. Thank you Mr. Perkins for the performance that most people respect in the genre. Janet Leigh also delivers a believable performance. She showed that she is a great actress. <br/><br/>The death scenes are beyond great this time. You don't see coming Mother ! whenever she raises the knife! Excellent scenes. Always copied, never matched. Also, the score deserves a honorable mention. This is probably the best score in any Horror film! Followed by Carpenter's in ""Halloweeen"" maybe. <br/><br/>Please, do yourself a favor and watch this movie in order to witness why this is the most influential movie of all time. The story is excellent and it's backed by solid acting and a wonderful direction by the master of all; Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The shower scene is one of the most important scenes of all time, not to mention the shocking ending. This is truly a scary movie on it's own. No need of gore, f/x, or abuse of twist situations."

","A young woman defrauds her boss and attempts to get away with the money. On her way to escape, she stops at a deserted motel owned by an introvert Norman Bates (Perkins), and quite unexpectedly gets killed from the hands of Norman's mother. A young couple, with the helping hand of a private eye, follow the tracks of the missing woman down to the motel. And soon the murder unfolds the mystery behind the perpetrator's mind.<br/><br/>Psycho is a masterpiece of a thrilling, typically Hitch meta-genre cinema. Counting the number of references in other movies, you can easily call it a cult classic, which should be dug in the ground inside a time-capsule. The famous shower scene is just one thing why you simply must see this one, although labeling this movie as 'horror' is a bit misleading. Yet, some people consider it a proto-slasher movie, take notice everyone. And after those 45 years it is still a great watch for newbies.

","As a teenage movie buff, three films profoundly affected me and this is one of them (the other two for the curious are ""War of the Worlds"" which I saw at far too young an age, and ""Witness for the Prosecution"" another Hitchcock effort with a completely unexpected gob-smacker of an ending).<br/><br/>All three I have watched since, ""War of the Worlds"", though still an impressive sci-fi, no longer terrifies me, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" I've seen over and over and still put on my top 50 best films of all time and Psycho, well Psycho remains in a class all by itself. I am still gripped by the wonderful confluence of a great plot, marvelously acting, a superlative director and a score that enhances all of the above.<br/><br/>No one needs details of the plot from me. Everyone knows the plot. I am a lifelong fan of the great Hitchcock so should mention I have a bias to all things Alfie. This remains one of his best and broke new ground when first released. Like the above-mentioned WFTP and ""The Exorcist"", movies now had a new twist; you could not be admitted to the theatre after the movie had started.<br/><br/>As one can imagine, this engendered great excitement for the cinema audiences. What would the ending be? What were all the blood and guts warnings all about ? We read stories of fans passing out in the theatres where Psycho was played. We could hardly wait. We could not even imagine in our fevered brains what Hitch had created and was going to wreak amongst us.<br/><br/>We were not disappointed. Psycho embodied every horror we had ever let fester at the edges of our imaginations and then some. The shower scene had our hearts and minds freezing over and gripping each other in delicious icy horror. The slashings did not have to be shown, barest glimpses of corpses were revealed. There was nothing graphic on screen. The true terror resided in our imaginations and lingers there still. Many of us lock windows and doors in our own houses when taking a shower; many of us have never taken a shower again.<br/><br/>Once in the seventies I saw the set where this was made, the old house on the hill, and the remains of the motel. Perhaps it is all gone now. What a thrill, to see where it all began, to walk in the footsteps of the great Alfred.<br/><br/>This is a 10 out of 10 for the breakthrough into a new genre of film-making. Absolutely faultless, unforgettable and imminently re-watchable. In magnificent black and white. Leigh, Perkins and supporting cast flawless. Bravo to all."
"patrick_dunne","10","0","1","25 October 2005"," 10 reasons to like Psycho
","Sometimes a film will make you fall of your seat laughing. Maybe it will shock you beyond belief. Or, it could make you weep. These are all reasons to love movies. But, what really makes a movie great is the fact that it has more than just on good point. Psycho has many great points.<br/><br/>1) The story takes many twists and turns. It seems to change a bit after every set of minutes. The ending is the biggest twist of all. Psycho is nearly unpredictable.<br/><br/>2) Perkins performance alone is deserving of an Oscar. We see him twitch and tremble as Arbogast interviews him. He slowly becomes mistrustful and dramatic as he talks with Marion. Anthony Perkin's performance in here deserves to be ranked among the ""Best Male Performances of All Time!"" along with Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>3) Hitchcock knew how to work a camera! His creative style brings the film to life. He films on top of the car hood to see Marion and her stalker in the beginning. The camera spirals backwards, using Marion's eye as the starting point after the shower scene. During the staircase scene, there is a stunning bird's eye view so we can see the killer and Arbogast.<br/><br/>4) The dialogue is fun and smart. How unforgettable is ""We all go a little mad sometimes""? It will keep you entertained and thrilled to hear. Even if the film is full of dialogue, it manages to keep you interested.<br/><br/>5) Do you know how much Hitchcock worked on this film? I heard the shower scene took days to film! Think about all those shots! Good thing it was all worth it, because the shower scene is one of the best parts of the film.<br/><br/>6) Another small, but genius part in Psycho was the part in the cellar. Lila Crane accidentally falls backwards and hits the light bulb, causing it to swing back and forth, to create a spectacular lighting effect.<br/><br/>7) The musical score is one-of-a-kind. I hear it re-playing in my head all the time. It's often parodied in shows and other movies. But, don't listen to them. The best music is in the opening credits.<br/><br/>8) The murder scenes are visually fantastic. The staircase scene brings sickening pleasure to the mind.<br/><br/>9) The voices we hear when Marion is driving away explain what's happening back at her hometown. This saves screen time and allows the story to continue without wasting precious time.<br/><br/>10) The ""main character"" Marion is killed off right after the infamous shower scene. I guess she really isn't the main character, (Norman is.) but it makes a fun twist, and the story still continues to flow.<br/><br/>Multiple things like this define a movie. So what if it isn't scary? Psycho is a one-of-a-kind film. It's THE Psycho. It's THE movie. It will forever remain timeless.<br/><br/>10/10"
"domino1003","10","0","1","24 October 2005"," Serious Mother Issues
","Alfred Hitchcock had created a classic film about a young man with serious mother issues. As ""Psycho"" begins, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)is desperate to keep hold of her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin), who is struggling to keep financially afloat (Alimony and paying his father's debts). She decides to help by stealing $40,000 from a client of her boss. Skipping town, she stops at the Bates Motel during a stormy night and meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who is devoted to caring for his mentally ill mother. But it soon becomes apparently how ill she is when Marion is brutally stabbed to death while taking a shower.<br/><br/>Soon on Marion's trail is her sister Lila and Private Detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam). With Sam on board, they soon find out the secret of Norman and his mother.<br/><br/>Perkins could never escape the role of Norman (He eventually came back playing Norman 3 times), and you can understand why: under that sweet facade is a very unstable individual. The film works on 3 levels here: Hitchcock's direction, Bernard Herrmann's music and the performance of Perkins. The infamous shower scene still pulls a punch (And caused Leigh to swear off showers for the rest of her life).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, give it a look. Avoid the horrible remake at all costs."
"Holdjerhorses","10","0","1","24 October 2005"," Original Release . . .
","In one of life's little ironies, my mother and I attended the opening of ""Psycho"" together. Unusual in itself, since I was in 10th grade and cannot remember EVER attending another film with Mom. Neither of us had any idea what we were in for.<br/><br/>The audience was seated (as contractually required by Hitchcock) before the lights went down. The theatre was pitch black except for the small ""Exit"" lights. So effective was Hitchcock's pre-publicity for ""Psycho"" that everybody was already nervous: all we knew was that ""Psycho"" was going to be ""shocking."" Suddenly, out of the darkness, Bernard Herrmann's immediately nerve-jangling score attacked and the massive curtains slowly opened in front of the screen. ""Uh-oh,"" I recall thinking. No one had ever heard a score like this.<br/><br/>Once the title and credits ended and the quiet pan across Phoenix's skyline began, I relaxed -- but only briefly. For here we were peering into a hotel window where the magnificently endowed Janet Leigh (in a bra and half slip) and a shirtless John Gavin were concluding their lunchtime tryst. Not the scene I would have chosen to be sitting next to my Mother for.<br/><br/>By the time the shower sequence stunned everybody, I can still remember my Mother squirming audibly and uncomfortably next to me with every stab.<br/><br/>Happily, she and I had a healthy relationship. Walking out after the lights came up, we were as silent as everybody else until we hit the sidewalk and daylight. She shook her head: ""What did you think of THAT?"" <br/><br/>""Damndest thing I ever saw!"" <br/><br/>She agreed.<br/><br/>It would be 13 years later, after I'd moved to Los Angeles and was writing for films and television, before I attended another opening that had an equally jolting impact on the public: ""The Exorcist."" I can't add anything to the comments already made about ""Psycho's"" technique and brilliance -- except perhaps to point out its film-making economy, still endlessly studied in film schools around the world.<br/><br/>Try this: shut off the sound. ""Psycho"" STILL plays, coherently, as a maniacal SILENT FILM study of a psychopath.<br/><br/>One shot in particular still haunts me for its storytelling simplicity. It's certainly not the most ""spectacular"" sequence in ""Psycho,"" yet its meticulous planning and perfect placement say perhaps as much about Hitchcock's command of film as anything else in his long career.<br/><br/>After Marion Crane's brutal murder, and the camera pulls back from her lifeless eye, the camera moves out of the brightly lit bathroom over the sound of still-running water, across her empty motel room, past the rolled-up newspaper (containing the $40,000) on the nightstand, to the open window and the Bates house on the hill, where Norman is heard shrieking, ""Mother! Oh, God! Blood! Blood!"" After the assaultive flash-cuts of butchery (and the screeching violins of Herrmann's score, and the stabbing sounds) we've just witnessed . . . we're given a chance to catch our breaths over the near-silent sound of the shower. ""What on earth can happen NEXT?"" The lead character is dead.<br/><br/>In this brief, quiet coda to one of the most electrifying sequences in film history, Hitchcock ""lets"" us recover . . . sort of. In fact, the camera's simple movement re-establishes the entire story arc of ""Psycho's"" first third, backwards from the murder to the reminder that Marion's stolen cash has led us here and lies in plain sight, waiting to be discovered, then forward in time again to the unknown horror on the hill. (The seemingly simple shot of the house through the window is actually a rather elaborate process shot that itself involves several elements, including that menacing sky.)<br/><br/>Equally remarkable, Bernard Herrmann's disturbing score. If you can find it and listen to it apart from the picture, you'll appreciate its demented insect-like constantly unnerving, web-spinning, unsettling, biting, frightening power.<br/><br/>Shockingly, Herrmann's score occupies barely thirty-minutes of the total screen time. Yet it's unforgettable.<br/><br/>Here is a film, and a director, that is as effective and appreciated over 45 years later as it was the day of its release. Costing under a million dollars, it will retain its position as one of the finest, most visceral suspense films ever made . . . long after Spielberg's (another fine director) heartless, emotionless, expensive special-effects extravaganza, ""War of the Worlds,"" has been forgotten (if it's not already)."

","I first saw this movie when I was a young girl and had never seen anything like it. I had never seen a woman in a bra, in the movies, and had never seen anyone flush a toilet. Also, it was always a man who stole the money. Never a young pretty woman. One of the best scenes in the movie, I believe, is when Norman and Marion are in the parlor. Anthony Perkins was so convincing as a disturbed young man. He was trying to defend his mother for her ""illness""and saying at the time,how much he hated the prison she had put him in. The fact that I lived down the street from a taxidermist might have added to my fear. I also did not have a clue as to the state of his mother. That came as a real shock. This must have been the first horror movie. It is also true that a lot of my friends took only baths after seeing that movie. Never a shower. Janet Leigh's eyeball and the drain was clever. I suppose it pales in comparison to todays slasher movies, but for it's time, it was a terrifying day at the movies. When you view this movie, remember the time in which it was made."
"divaclv","Null","0","1","8 October 2004"," Chilling, even after all this time (spoilers)
","The recent passing of Janet Leigh reminded me that I hadn't yet seen the movie which will undoubtedly stand as her legacy. Sure, forty-plus years of pop-culture saturation had made me aware of the basic outline of ""Psycho""--the plot, the music, the shower scene--but never had I sat down and watched it from beginning to end. Well, no time like the present.<br/><br/>What is it that makes ""Psycho"" haunt and disquiet us, even today? Certainly there are plenty of movies out there that are more gruesome, with higher body counts and more graphic portrayals of sudden and bloody death. And there are many films good at providing sudden scares and shocking denouements. Yet so few make us glance uneasily over our shoulders or shiver in quiet moments long after they've ended. Perhaps it's because Alfred Hitchcock has created a picture of evil that is not only very real on screen, but is also disturbingly recognizable and accessible.<br/><br/>In ""Psycho,"" we are reminded that darkness and death are far closer to us than we like to believe. That any person, given desperation enough and temptation enough, might resort to grand theft as Marion Crane (Leigh) does.<br/><br/>That someone so shy and genial as Norman Bates (played to perfection by Anthony Perkins) can be possessed of terrible secrets. That the space between life and death is a brief one indeed, one which we can cross (or be pushed over) at any time or place: through a door, at the top of the stair, or--of course--when we are naked and vulnerable in the shower. We don't think about these things; we cannot if we are to function in life. But Hitchcock makes us pause and remember them for a few moments.<br/><br/>With so much focus on that famous shower scene, it's easy to forget that there are many moments of brilliance here. Such as Marion's clearly-drawn paranoia when she's absconding with that money. The deliberate manner in which Norman cleans up after ""Mother."" The death of Detective Arbogast, in its own way as sudden and shocking as poor Marion's demise. And the final revelation, which was no doubt a surprise to the first audiences and which now in retrospect makes the rest of the film even more chilling.<br/><br/>And of course, there's Norman Bates himself. Nervous, accommodating, and seemingly harmless (at least until he's revealed spying on Marion's room), the last person you'd expect to have blood on his hands. But after all, isn't that what we always hear people saying on the news, as some neighbor or relative is taken away for a brutal crime? ""I can hardly believe it...he was quiet and kept to himself, but he seemed like such a nice person."" Norman could be anyone we know--and that alone makes him more frightening than all the supernatural monsters and slashers you could name."
"Captain_Couth","9","0","1","9 October 2004"," Alfred Hitchcock Classics: Psycho.
","Psycho (1960) is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. The movie is loosely based upon the novel by Robert Bloch and it was adapted by Joseph Stefano. Psycho made stars out of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (sadly it also sent the two to typecasting hell in the process). Hitchcock proved that he could adapt to the changing styles of Hollywood and make a true horror classic. He wisely shot the movie in black and white (giving the film an even creepier aura)and used a lot of great camera angles and trick photography. Anthony Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, a young man who's life has been ruined by his overbearing mother. Janet Leigh is perfect as the young woman with the shady past trying to find a new life.<br/><br/>Psycho was not only the pinnacle in Alfred Hitchcock's film career as a director but it also changed the face of horror. Just when film makers such as himself where being phased out by Hollywood, Mr. Hitchcock redefined not only as a director but in the process changed the face of horror forever.<br/><br/>The success of this movie spawned three direct sequels, a pilot for a t.v. series (Bates Motel) and a badly made remake (Although I have to say the cinematography was beautiful). It has also been parodied to death and referenced in many horror films and comedies. Psycho has not only achieved worldwide fame but it's also a part of Americana as well. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it already. Truly a one of a kind film.<br/><br/>Highest recommendation possible."

","This movie started it all. Since then, Hollywood made many good serial killer movies, and this here is the father of it (or should I say ""Mother""). It also defined the ""rules"" for a good horror movie: twists; creepy, mysterious and ghostlike creatures; a sinister ending and something to think about in a psychological sense. Anthony Perkins is the inspiring source to all Norman Bates, John Does, Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers crawling beneath the surface of normal life. The other actors are okay, I guess, but the best part of the movie is really Perkins.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie gets 10 points of 10 from me. A true masterpiece and today almost as chilling as it was 44 years ago."

","Though I haven't seen very many of Hitchcock's movie, I have to say that this must be one of his best, if not the. PSYCHO is such a classic and influential movie in so many ways.<br/><br/>PSYCHO is the story of a woman named Marion (Janet Leigh) who goes to stay at a hotel run by a sweet, lighthearted, yet still somewhat creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who lives in a house nearby with his mother. Little does Marion know, somebody in that house is a deranged freak. She ends up being killed that same night she checks in, in the infamous shower scene that will ALWAYS be a classic moment in film history. The rest of the movie is basically the murder scene being investigated, and everything is brought up to one of the most chilling and shocking conclusions you can imagine.<br/><br/>What else can I say about PSYCHO? Great in every aspect. Acting, scripting, casting, directing (of course)... everything is so natural and subtle. The way that Hitchcock prepares everything for the viewer ultimately leads to total surprise when you least expect it.<br/><br/>There's really not much else I can say about this movie, not much more praise I can give. It's a horror classic and deservingly so. It's also one of the first psychological thrillers, and, I believe, manifests Hitchcock's genius best. This is what horror is meant to be. 9/10."

","One of, if not the most influential horror movies ever, with many plot devices which have now become clichés, and proving that Hitchcock was the master of all genres. The themes can be talked about over and over, but it is the build up of suspense, coupled with Perkins's performance which keeps it fresh today. Perhaps not jumpy enough for some, although there are plenty of those moments, the film relies on the director's knowledge of the viewer: we are in his hands. Probably my favourite scene-when Bates bursts out of an upstairs room, with the overhead shot. Deliberately gritty and bleak, and no pimply teens to be found...those were the days. 9 out of 10"

","When I watch Psycho I always see something new with it.  That is something which is a joy when watching a film over and over again and always finding something new about it.   Psycho is that kind of film.  I studied the way Psycho was filmed in my Film Studies class and when  you are taught to look at the film in a completely different way to when you actually watch it. Marion is a woman who has no idea.  We are told by Hitchcock to not feel sorry for her because she is someone who has just robbed a man of his earnings and is on the run.  Whilst she drives to her destination she is hearing all the voices of the people she had cheated and feeling guilty and on her way she bumps into many situations with a policeman and a car salesmen who make her feel un comfortable even more than she already is. She then arrives in the place where she thinks she is safe in the form of The Bates Motel.   A secluded place where not to many visit.  Here she bumps into the shy and vulnerable Norman who takes an interest into Marion the moment she steps into the motel.   With Norman being so alone at many times except when his mother wants something from the house just above the motel he takes a shine to Marion as he is never bothered with guests and they bond over some tea.  Marion does notice something unusual in Norman but believes this is because of his all demanding Mother and it takes it's toll on him but what she doesn't know is that Norman's life and way of living is more sadistic and terrifying than she cold ever imagine.  I want talk anymore because everyone else knows what comes next.  <br/><br/>What I found interesting about Psycho is how Hitchcock took the movie way beyond the lengths that any other films gone in the history of Hollywood.  I mean Psycho was the first film ever to show a toilet being flushed and when Critics and audiences saw this they kicked up a huge fuss and little others thing to moan about.  Psycho is one of the films which I do find terrifying and it must have been even more terrifying when it was released back in in 1960.   Hitchcock is a director that was very rare to come across in the way of playing the it's audience and his way of brilliant filmmaking and when you look back at his films especially Psycho you realise he has put most of the directors we know where they are today."

","Psycho is one of the most famous movies in American history. Now that I've seen it, I'm not suprised. The basic plot is: (even though people who haven't seen it already know)<br/><br/>The story is about a woman named Marian Crane who steels 40,000 dollars (at that time a 10 years salary!) and runs off to meet her boyfriend. On the way she stops at the BATES MOTEL, a hotel with ""12 rooms and 12 vacancies"" that is owned by a young man named Norman Bates. Norman has his own troubles, he lives with his mother, a spiteful and controlling woman. After a long and moving talk with Norman, Marian makes up her mind to return the money. She goes and takes a shower and is murdered by who appears to be Norman's mother. A few moments later Norman finds her dead. The remainder of the movie is about Marian's sister and boyfriend attempting to find out what happened to Marian, and Norman is trying to cover for ""mom"". Mom ends up to have been dead for 10 years. Norman killed her (for why see movie) and couldn't live with what he had done, so he tried to recreate Mom, in the end he developed Multiple Personality disorder. HE killed Marian and 2 other women before her AS his mother. He would later ""awake as if in a daze"" to discover what he had done. ""Mom"" killed because Norman had been in love with Marian, and the 2 other women and he NEEDED his mother to care about him enough to do anything to keep him with her. At the end we discover the more dominate half of Norman (the ""mother"" half) has probably taken over forever, but he is sent to a place that might be able to help him. (Norman VERY likable when he is him, I hope the place does it's job!)<br/><br/>
Amazing performances by all the cast, especially Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. He is believable as the simple, lovable kid and the...... Psycho! I give this movie 10/10 stars, because it is, as far as I can tell, flawless."

","What an incredible movie!  Coming from a person who absolutely HATES scary movies, that's a lot to say.  Not to shoot down Psycho, it was an amazingly scary movie, it would have been even worse had I seen it back in the sixties when it first came out.  With the way the movie industry makes horror movies now a days,  with all the guts and gore, Psycho was definitely a head of it's time when it was released.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock was a talented director, a master of the macabre to say the least, and his quirky traits popped up here and there throughout Psycho. First off, as with his other movies, Hitchcock makes an appearance so look for him during the first fifteen minutes or so.   Another quirky characteristic was his obsession with the bathroom, or better yet with the words bowel movement.  This is evident with the initials of the Bates Motel. Idiosyncrasies  like these make and otherwise terrifying movie more enjoyable for the viewer because knowing Hitchcock's habits, they can look for these types of things throughout Psycho.  And definitely look for them, because there are a lot more things to pick up on than just the two mentioned above.  <br/><br/>It's not just Hitchcock's eccentricities that make him a great director, his foreshadowing plotline and intense cinematography make it hard to beat. With the first appearance of the Bates Motel and mansion, you can tell bad things are going to ensue.  The hotel itself isn't all that scary, creepy yes, but not edge-of-your-seat terrifying.  Unlike the mansion, one look at the sinister house on top of the hill will send chills down your spine. Clearly something bad has happened or will happen there.  As for the notorious shower scene, the camera angles used allowed Hitchcock to create a truly chilling scene without all the guts and gore of today.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a impressive movie for the time, one that all horror movies since should try to live up to.  Alfred Hitchcock created something truly  ahead of the time, a movie that no other horror movie can compare to, and for that I think it deserves ten out of ten stars."

","Psycho<br/><br/>	Lets assume for just one minute that Alfred Hitchcock's movie Psycho is not an American classic and that, hypothetically, it was so boring it could put an insomniac to sleep.   Would I have a lynching mob outside of my door with burning torches in hand?  Well, I think that I'll take that chance with this review and challenge the opinion of many before me. 	<br/><br/>         The movie Psycho was hyped as a masterpiece, an American classic from the mind of the `Master of Suspense' Alfred Hitchcock.  But to me Alfred Hitchcock was the master of losing my attention.  The movie starts out slow, painfully slow.  The acting was fine, it was nothing Oscar worthy, but it did the trick.  Nothing in the story stands out in the first forty-five minutes or so which I think was meant to build suspense.  The first part of a story is the crucial time to grab the audience's attention so that it can hold it for the rest of the tale, any attempt to grab their focus later is too late.  The dialogue and action is very low energy and uninteresting, it was nothing worth wasting your time watching. 	<br/><br/>        To be fair, the frame of mind before you watch the 1960's movie Psycho is important.  One must realize that at the time of the movie's release, the public hadn't been desensitized by excessive violence in the media yet, and that the standard for what was suspenseful was very different then.  But this movie is dull in any decade. 	<br/><br/>      There was something interesting about the character Norman Bates. Something about his funny little quirks and his dark and tangled depth that was hypnotizing to watch.  Whenever his character appeared, my eyes were drawn to the screen.  And the plot twists involving Norman were commendable at the least, 	<br/><br/>        But one character is not able to keep an entire movie afloat.  And you can't give a movie a title of `classic' just because it totes clever writing.  I'm not naive to think that just because I don't like Psycho doesn't make bad, but I soul searched very hard and still couldn't see what all the hype was about.   To me, a classic is something that transcends time and is entertaining and good no matter what year it is.  Psycho just doesn't measure up to classic' status."

This is a film the viewer needs to see for themselves and not ask any questions to a person who has seen it because the suspense is so great.<br/><br/>The acting was well done in this film.  Janet Leigh who played Marion Crane had the most notable performance. She portrayed a sweet, but yet paranoid and guilty crook very well.  Anthony Perkins who played Norman Bates also did a great job portraying his character.<br/><br/>What made this movie so amazing is the directing. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in film making. If it wasn't for him, horror films wouldn't be the way they are today. His techniques formed great suspense. The music he chose illustrated the anticipation of the film notably. Comparing this movie to the new version of Psycho which was made in 1998 is incredibly different. Even though the 1998 version was almost identical to the 1960s version, nothing compares to Alfred Hitchcock's version, proving that his techniques of using black and white film makes the film appear scarier. His original camera angles make him truly a great director that sets him apart from the other directors.<br/><br/>This is a must see film! Though it is not the scariest movie out there the ingenuity of Psycho makes it one of the best horror films of all time.

","Classic as well as classy, Psycho brought more to the table than your average wannabe slasher movie.  <br/><br/>This film had all the right elements: a good solid plot/storyline filled with scandal, deceit, horror and MURDER which was all backed up with excellent camera work, cinematography, and good old fashioned directing from the one and only, Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Being a Hitchcock creation, there is much to be expected from the flick and needless to say, the man delivered to the fullest.  Well-choreographed camera movements strongly portrayed the emotion of each character within the shots and captured the audience's attention right from the get-go.  Every shot had life and individuality.  Creative camera angles and close-ups illustrated the characters' movements/interactions with Swiss precision. The shadows that were used in the murder scenes were a nice touch.  This gave away the premonition that obviously, something bad was about to happen, but was still very intimidating and spooky and worked well with the classic black and white tinge the film was presented in.<br/><br/>The film's soundtrack did more than just add suspense.  The music made the scene a lot more believable and provided a brilliant hook for the viewer to latch onto.  The gut-wrenching stroke of each string given by Herrmann's mini orchestra brought out the obvious emotions in every scene it accompanied whether it was worry, fear, despair, etc.<br/><br/>The inner monologues were another nice touch.  If the shots and the soundtrack weren't enough for the audience, Norman and Marion's inner monologues filled in the blanks.  They both showed not only their thoughts, but also, their persona.  It allowed the audience to tap into their minds and really see what was going on inside of them.<br/><br/>Of course you can't talk about Psycho, without talking about the legendary shower scene.  Honestly, this reviewer got more than a few hearty laughs in when watching this `horrific' display of violence.  The scene was obviously needed, but could've been a lot more believable.  The sound effects were okay, but the actual knife slashing and the body contact weredare I sayCHEAP!  This reviewer is fully aware that it was the 1960's, but come on!  Hitchcock was a cinematic genius!  He could've made the scene a little less comical and a lot more horrifying.  But hey, it was good, almost as good as the ending.  Now this reviewer doesn't like to reveal secrets, but would like to say that the ending may not have the same effect to a modern-day audience as it did to a 1960's audience, because inconceivable endings like this one have been duplicated and butchered by following directors over the past 40 years.  Just try to keep in mind that this film is an original masterpiece and maybe, you'll see a hint of Hitchock's creativity and brilliance.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an superb film.  This psychological thriller undoubtedly deserves the prestige and positive reviews it has received from countless critics.  It has set the standard for what a good cinematic thriller should be.  Psycho is for anyone who loves a good mystery and/or overall excellent film.  Do not let the black and white discourage you, instead, embrace it and welcome it.  You'll learn to appreciate it with this film.  Weathering years of positive and negative criticism it is obvious that this is the work of a genius and has every right to be called, one of the greatest films of all time.

"imahottieandahalf","9","0","1","20 February 2004"," is it mystery? is it suspense? no! it's PSYCHO!
","Alfred Hitchcock, born in 1899, is known as the `Master of Suspense.' Becoming a director in 1925, he has been entertaining people ever since. One of the classics, and probably close to the most widely known, is Psycho, made in 1960.<br/><br/>     Now putting into fact that they didn't have much to work with concerning special effects in those times, this movie may not be the most frightening ever. But, special effects aren't what Hitchcock was all about. He was a man of mystery and always wanted to keep tension between the viewer and the film. He could create the perfect scene by moving the angle of the shot just one certain way. Filming techniques and plot seem to be his forte.<br/><br/>
     In Psycho, one method that Hitchcock used to create a dramatic scene is the placement of the camera shots. For instance, in a ""get away,"" he would film the character while they were in a car, then show a scene out of the car. He repeated this same idea, coming closer to their face every time it re-entered the car...so close that it almost makes the viewer uncomfortable.<br/><br/>
     Another aspect of Hitchcock's movies that makes them very memorable are the sets and the way that the characters move, talk and act.  For example, a character may stutter, fidget, or talk fast when presented with certain situations.  With sets and designs, he always tried to play with the look and feel of a scene.  The mansion that was used in this movie created a very mysterious aura around it.  This could be because of the placement, which was, on top of a dark hill with many ascending steps.  It could also be because the lighting was always dim and never really showed the details, creating wonder and mystery. <br/><br/>     Obtaining an overall 8.6/10 stars, this movie is clearly brilliantly made, being loved by millions.  With drama, suspense, a good plot and a great director, you've created a masterpiece."
"meggs212","Null","0","1","20 February 2004"," a classic and creative film
","Psycho has to be one of the best and most classic horror films of all time. Alfred Hitchcock was very smart and creative about the techniques that he used which is why they have become a major part in filmmaking today.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with Marion (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin) in a hotel room.  She wants to marry Sam, but neither of them have the money, especially Sam; he had to give most of his money away in alimony. When Marion goes to work, her boss asks her to deposit $40,000.  Knowing that she could start a new life with the large sum of money, Marion takes off with it and the suspense begins. While she is driving down the road, the camera zooms in very close to her face, making it awkward for the audience and the screen seems to get tighter and tighter and with the terrifying music playing it has you on the edge of your seat.  Not all of the techniques that Hitchcock uses are technical; a lot of what makes this such a great movie is all the twists in the storyline.  When Marion arrives at the hotel she is staying at there is a huge mansion in the background that appears to be very spooky.  The camera shoots up at it making the viewer feel very small and intimidated.  The shadows that are seen behind the curtains were a great effect and added to the spookiness of the movie.  I thought that the music was one of the best techniques. A movie isn't scary unless it has the right music.  I'm sure the audience could tell that he must have been a perfectionist; there was so much effort put in to this movie beyond what most would expect.   <br/><br/>There is so much to discuss about this movie, especially the end, but I don't want to give it away.  I would rate Psycho 10/10.  It was truly a classic in it's time as well as it is today."

","Psycho is a fantastic movie, mainly for those who love the details of movies.  The director, Alfred Hitchcock, was the first that did what people would call a `horror movie.'   Using camera angles, music, and voices in a person's head, he creates a truly suspenseful movie.<br/><br/>First, he creates suspense by having voices in the character's head.  These are the voices of people that the character knows.  They generally are saying things that may be going on while the character is not there.<br/><br/>Then he adds some camera angles.  During a time when the main character is scared Hitchcock will show the face, then quickly, move to something else. Then, when he returns to the character, the shot it much closer to the character's face.  After a few repeated times of doing this, the camera is uncomfortably close to the actor/actress' face.  <br/><br/>Lastly, he adds the final touch; loud, clashing, orchestral music.  Music in a film can really alter the viewer's mood.  This music definitely adds to the suspense.<br/><br/>If I were to rate this movie on a scale of one to ten (ten being great), I would give this movie a 9.5.  It is a fantastic movie that many people could enjoy."

","In the opening scene of Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock does a terrific job by playing the dissonant overture of music in the beginning while rolling the credits. In which is giving viewers a taste of what the movie is going to be like beginning to end. As most of us know, Hitchcock is known for holding viewers in suspense during his movies. He is, without a doubt, `The master of suspense.' <br/><br/>When Marian Crane (Janet Lee) is fleeing town, that is where the suspense starts. At that point, she is stopped at a traffic light, and people are crossing the cross walk. The man who walks in front of her boss in the crosswalk is Alfred Hitchcock. A typical Alfred Hitchcock film always has him playing a small part, such as a man smoking a pipe while reading a newspaper. After Alfred Hitchcock Walks in front of her car, her boss walks right behind him, and notices Marian in the car. She then notices her boss, and took off. <br/><br/>As she is driving down the road, she has voices running in her head about stolen money, while the dissonant music plays in the background. First time viewers think this is when she dies, but she doesn't until later. That just goes to show how Alfred Hitchcock is, `The master of suspense.'<br/><br/>
Hitchcock has an interesting way of making movies, too. He was the first person ever to come up with the dissonant music for horror films. His lighting and camera techniques are also interesting. For example, when Marian is being followed by the cop, the camera shows an angle of the cop car in the rear view mirror of her car. <br/><br/>Not every movie is perfect, though. In the bathroom at the Bates motel, also known as the classic shower stabbing scene, Marian gets murdered. As Marian is screaming, this reviewer noticed that she giggled a little bit. Other than that, the part it was perfect. If you haven't seen Psycho before, but want to see it, then sit down and watch it till it is done."

","Alfred Hitchcock was either insane or genius. Or maybe it was the combination of the two that made Hitchcock such an amazing director. He opened so many doors for future horror films and for future directors in general. Hitchcock wasn't an immediate hit though, even though he made over 50 films in his amazing career that spanned 5 decades. There was much debate over the violence in Psycho. But Hitchcock did become very famous, and his work was and is still very much admired. 	 Psycho is brilliant. Plain and simple, it is a movie that could not have been made, written or directed any better. In 1998, Gus Van Sant did attempt to re-create this classic. And even though it was done shot-by-shot, it flopped at the box offices and definitely vexed many hard-core original Psycho fans. The original is without a doubt a timeless thriller, it was perfectly made. There are so many reasons why Psycho is ranked so high in movie lovers' hearts, but the psychological aspect of it has to be one of the biggest. 	 Again, the psychological aspects of this film are astounding. It's one of those thrillers where in the end, one can only think `whoa'. Hitchcock had this amazing way of involving the viewer in his films. He makes the viewer hang on the edge of their seat throughout the whole movie. And it's not the sort of suspense that we're used to. It's different. He used music and camera angles and little hints along the way to add to the suspense. There are only a handful of these kinds of films, and Hitchcock can for sure be credited for those, maybe not for making them, but making those directors and writers able to show their creativity in this new form of horror movies.<br/><br/>	 This film definitely deserves 12 out of 10. It exceeds viewers expectations and leaves them still thinking."

","Alfred Hitchcock shows massive skill in the overall display of his film, Psycho.  Using almost all new views and carefully plotted signs, the ""Master of Suspense"" was one of the first to use dark plots to entice his audiences. Psycho is what would now be considered a lot less than terrifying; with thousands of movies out frightening viewers, a movie from the 1960's wouldn't seem like such a big deal.  Psycho is the number one prototype of scary movies, the movies seen today use ideas and camera angles that Alfred Hitchcock mastered.  The design of the movie is to make the audience uncomfortable; and by using intense orchestral music and close-ups on the emotion of the characters the director accomplishes that goal.  The plot starts out simple and assumingly bland, and what is amazing is that Alfred Hitchcock used such a simple story that could be told in minutes and reformed it into one of the best thrillers of all time.  Combined with the acting Psycho is crucial to the movie industry itself, the characters themselves are outlined wonderfully and add a sense of anxiousness essential to the script.  <br/><br/>The movie takes more than one watching, but should be seen by a diverse group of people.  It is a good movie and can therefore be enjoyed by an indifferent audience, while serious moviegoers could also enjoy its subtle hints and background scenes.  From young ages to old, the value of the movie stays mainly constant; it really depends on the opinion of the viewer for that particular genre.  What makes Psycho unique is that even the most frightened person can see the worth of it, if that person gets up enough courage to stick with it."

","40,000 dollars in stolen money, a beautiful woman and a lonely motel owner combine to create one of the greatest psychological thrillers ever created for the big screen. Alfred Hitchcock, the undisputed `Master of Suspense', does his best work with this film. After just one viewing, it's easy to see why this film is rated so highly on the AFI's 100 best list and countless other film review lists. 	 	Right from the opening shots of the movie, you can tell it's the work of a master. Well executed camera movements drop you right into the story and you're hooked from there on. Fantastic photography in classic black and white is accentuated by great lighting. The film style and lighting combine to create eerie shadows and an overall sense of uneasiness that's hard not to notice. In addition, composer Bernard Hermann lends one of the most chilling and well recognized scores to the film, adding even more to the thrilling layers of the story.<br/><br/>	`Psycho' is more of a psychological thriller than a horror flick, contrary to what a lot of people think. It's a film that's comparable to Silence of the Lambs, if you can compare the two. The thing that makes this film such a thriller is the great acting from the stars, Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Perkins is evil at times and friendly at others. He pulls off one of the best schizophrenic acting gigs ever recorded on film. Leigh and Perkins have very good chemistry together, especially in the scene which takes place in the motel parlor. Very creepy.<br/><br/>	`Psycho' is a well written and filmed piece of work. It's such a terrifying story that's made even more so by good technical execution. It's a gripping story with some good twists that leads up to a terrifying climax. It's a good thrill even for those squeamish few who don't enjoy blood. It's more of a mental horror from one of the best creators of suspense films. This is one of Hitchcock's best works. Check it out and you won't take a shower for a week.<br/><br/>

"Blondeatheart56","10","0","1","18 February 2004"," Definitely the best horror film of all time
","""Psycho"" has been called the best horror movie of all time, and it's no surprise that it has considering that it was directed by The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.  Hitchcock, who has directed (and sometimes produced) 53 films,<br/><br/>was definitely successful with this one.  It makes no difference that 'Psycho"" is a 1960 film, it is just as good, if not better, than any horror film made today. The film has an eeriness to it.  Even though it is not constant killing after killing, it is still very creepy.  The biggest factor contributing to the ""on the edge of your seat"" feeling in the film is the music.  Throughout the entire film the music is unsettling, suspenseful, and it gives the viewer an uncomfortable feeling that is hard to explain.  A scene as simple as someone driving in a car can become<br/><br/>intense and even a little scary once the music begins.  It is never dull and it is always interesting.  There is no doubt that ""Psycho"" without it's fast paced, loud, and startling music would not be the truly terrifying film that it is. Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, the psycho.  Perkins' acting job is very<br/><br/>well done and actually really believable.  He doesn't need to stick with one type of acting to be good.  He can be a nice guy, he can be mad, he can be sad, he can even behave as a lunatic and in all situations his acting is realistic. When it comes to Anthony Perkins' acting job in ""Psycho"" there is no cheesiness to be found. There are many other great performances by great actors/actresses in ""Psycho."" Such as Janet Leigh as Marianne Crane, Vera Miles as Lila Crane, and John<br/><br/>Gavin as Sam Lumus.  While all of their acting jobs are believable and<br/><br/>entertaining to watch, there are a few times when they may have overdone it or come across as cheesy.   But put those times aside and you're left with one very good actor and two very good actresses.  Besides, nobody's perfect. ""Psycho"" is a black and white film that takes place mostly at night. Because of that, some of the backgrounds in a few scenes don't look as realistic as they could.  The viewer may be able to tell that they aren't real and if they are real the viewer is likely to think that they aren't.  This does not take away from the film at all. Regardless of some cheesy acting or backgrounds that look fake, ""Psycho"" is<br/><br/>still the best horror film of all time, and there's no arguing with that."

","Of all things in the 1960's, one must be afraid of someone going psycho. No, I'm not referring to psychedelics, but psychotic people. Now, in any case there is always a psycho person roaming about. Though aren't we all a little psycho at one point? Which brings me to a point that at some point people tend to go into the dark side. Total control blinded by instinctual desires of a greater existence. Though what end will one end up? That's what I feel about the aura of the movie Psycho' by Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>In most suspense movies, or even horror the most crucial element is sound. Now, the music for the film created a tense feel, which made it feel subtly unsettling. As I delved into the score I felt a little bit cheated by the repetitious use of the theme song throughout the movie. This did not however take away from the suspense.<br/><br/>Movies like this are not to be spoiled. For the way the movie was filmed it created a sense of mystery. While certain key elements of the plot play through, Hitchcock was a master at distorting the truth. Having the camera at an angle to not see a face, or make it seem very closed in. Under these styles of filming the suspense lasts throughout the entire picture.<br/><br/>Now, I'll be brief on the shower scene. Everyone and their mother have at least heard of this scene. The woman was Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who is also the main character. Well, as I watched this scene in its entirety I was a little shocked by how it was filmed. Now I know it must have been painfully hard to film the scene and not reveal too much skin. Though how it was done was more artistic as opposed real.<br/><br/>Finally Hitchcock is a man of many surprises. To build a multi-perspective on what is going on in a film has been adapted into many works after his time. For this movie I would gladly recommend this to anyone, who can see past its age. Though I feel this film has the strength to live on. I guess it is how Hitchcock used his skills. His movies are bittersweet. One part all is well, and the other part is psycho."

","When you watch Hitchcock's thrillers you can make a game out of it. For example, Alfred Hitchcock puts himself in small shots in the movies that he is making, weather it's walking in the street, or on a bench reading a newspaper, etc He also uses the same prop or theme though out the scenes. It's kind-of fun and hard to find these key elements on the movies. Because Hitchcock was `The Master of Suspense' you were not supposed to give out the `spoiler' so the reviews are made up of the technical aspects of things. 	The music in the movie fits well. It puts the audience on the edge of their seats in terror. The music is a key to determine what was going to happen next, it was easy to foreshadow. 	The technology for the 1960's wasn't all that great, because when ever some one was driving and the shot was in the car it was easy to tell that there was a green screen behind the car, but you could tell that the car was really driving when the shot is out side of the car. There are mess-up's in the great movie that were some-what knowesablt. For example, when the camera did a close-up you could see the camera's in the scene. Everyone knows this movie for the shower scene, and yes, the best scene ever can have a mess-up when Maryann is screaming you can hear her laugh for a split second."

","This is a very fine movie. Yet I grew a bit weary of it after the 4th or 5th time. The first time I saw it I raved. That is also when it left it's greatest impact. After you are knowledgeable of the conclusion, some of the impact wanes, if you know what I mean. It is a great movie but I think a bit over-rated. The second time I viewed it I am more able to appreciate the 'Hitchcock' technique of steering the viewer to assume a conclusion. In lesser hands this could have been mediocre. (See the sequels) Hitchcock has never failed to capture beautiful angles with each camera shot. Even after several viewings a veteran can still be unbalanced by Hitch's foreboding approach. Despite loving this film it would probably not be one I would select to show at a Halloween get-together - especially to those who have seen it a few times before. I am more 'chilled' by other movies. However, at a film discussion get-together - YES. If you haven't seen it - DO! You will love it!! If you've seen it once do see it again and enjoy Hitch's story-telling. He is quite good. If you've seen it frequently you are probably like me and don't NEED to see it again although it remains dear to your heart. I've often wondered how Hitch would have handled 'The Sixth Sense'?"

","I'm only 13, but I saw the movie for the first time when I was about 8 or 9, and I'll tell you, it scared me to death! The reason it was so scary is probably because of a few reasons: DEFINITE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>1. Obviously, the shower scene is the most terrifying part of the whole film. After I saw that, it was truly hard for me to take a shower for a while. And, of course, my mom's bathroom (we lived with her brother and mother, and there were three bathrooms in the house) was being fixed up by her brother, but she wanted me to shower in that one to test it out. But there was no door to lock, so I was almost in tears.<br/><br/>2. The ending freaks me out every time I see it. Not because Norman was the killer, but because of the cars we see being pulled out of the swamp. I always wonder what was in there. Well I know what it was (the bodies), but what did it actually look like? That thought always scares me.<br/><br/>3. The fact that mother says that she would never hurt a fly. that was pretty weird!<br/><br/>Now, most people say that ""The Exorcist"" is the scariest movie ever, but I just thought that it was an excellent, not scary, movie, and I saw it when I was about 11 or 12. But ""The Exorcist"" was shattering when it was first released. No one had ever seen that before in a movie, such as the foul language said by a 12 year old innocent girl, the whole concept of possession, the vomiting, a very bloody crucifix masturbation scene with a 12 year old girl, the head spinning. That to me doesn't make me afraid of anything, but Psycho does. That is what I think makes a truly frightening film.     Rating: 10/5"

","It was a little weird when I sat down to watch Psycho for the first time a few hours ago. Being a fan of horror films, I've been told by everyone that this was the one I have to see. Talk about a reputation to live up to, I didn't honestly see how it could be as good as it was supposed to be. I recently had been hearing great things about A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum', and was disappointed in that, so my solely-based-on-reputation expectations were a little shot, plus I'd heard so much about the shower scene I figured that was the big payoff. Well, in a way that only Alfred Hitchcock can do it, any expectations I had were not only met but shattered. I cannot imagine the impact this movie must have had on audiences in 1960, even watching it forty years later on my DVD player with the volume turned down he rocked my world. If you're someone who hates top 200 lists because they're usually all the same, ignore the fact that this on every one and give it a chance, it honestly deserves any attention it's got over the years. All of the acting is solid, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is believable in his difficult role and Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) gets scared with the best of em. The soundtrack is perfect, and there's some great cinematography in a few of the more dramatic moments, making Psycho' close to a perfect horror film. I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and say that if you haven't seen this movie yet, stop what you're doing and go rent it/buy it/steal it, whatever you need to do to watch it. Rating: 34/40"

","Psycho (1960) Director: Alfred Hitchcock Writer: Robert Bloch (Novel), Jospeh Stefano (Screen play) Stars: Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates), Janet Leigh (Marion Crane), Vera Miles (Lila Crane), Martin Balsam (Detective Arbogast), John Gavin (Sam Loomis).<br/><br/>Psycho is a classic horror film and is the one that set the standard for all future movies of the genre. It was released in 1960 (And then remade in 1998), and regarded as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film. I made the mistake of watching the remake first, but I watched the original while at my sister's house and could tell which one was better. I could clearly see why this is probably the greatest horror film ever made, and by history's best director.<br/><br/>The events of the movie left me in awe, and an instant Hitchcock fan. The film starts in Phoenix, Arizona where Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real estate agent receptionist, is trusted to deliver a large sum of money from a customer and put it in the bank. However, Marion's wicked side takes control and causes her to flee from the city to her boyfriend's (John Gavin) house in California. Due to her suspicious acts, she attracts the attention of a policeman, forcing her to trade her car in. Soon the trademark stormy weather causes more troubles for Marion, making her spend the night at the mysterious hotel, with 12 cabins, 12 vacancies, and 12 showers. Marion's story soon evolves when she meets the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and learns he has a dark past of his own. From then on the plot twists will shock you, and the suspense will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Perkins is very convincing as Bates, and the way he fills the role of mother's-boy Norman is certainly impressive. Janet Leigh offers a great supporting role, and makes you feel sorry for throughout the film, despite her character's evil deeds. Balsam, for the short period he is in the film, gives that classic detective character whom we all know and love.<br/><br/>The setting is possibly one of the best sets in Hollywood, because it is so eerie and mysterious. The Bates mansion, which overlooks the motel, sends chills down your spine as you see the dark silhouette sitting by the window. The camera work for the film contributed greatly to its success, like many other Hitchock films. The affects are astounding for a 1960 film. Hitchock's decision to film in black and white paid off, as it gave the movie charm, and hid the fact most of the blood was just chocolate sauce. The music is the most famous movie music ever- the screeching violin in sync with the killer's knife landing on their victim. Psycho has been parodied again and again, because it so popular. It was followed by Psycho II (1982), Psycho III (1986) and psycho IV: The beginning (1990). The movie may not be appreciated so much by younger viewers, but anyone old enough will love how the film is shot, written and acted, as well as making you think. Watch this classic at night, with the lights off. And if you don't like being scared, shower before the movie."
"Travis69","10","0","1","22 October 2003"," Psycho review
","Scream all you want, Psycho is the greatest horror flick of all time. Much of the praise is due to three ingenious elements directed by the great auteur Alfred Hitchcock: camerawork, editing, and sounds. Cleverly, our sympathy for first-half protagonist, Marian Crane (the beautiful Janet Leigh-mother of Jamie Lee Curtis), shifts towards a creepy commiseration for antagonist (?), Norman Bates. Both characters are indeed psychotic, though on different levels. We feel for Crane, knowing that her misdeed-scamming her boss out of $40,000-is wrong; and we're just as sure to be annoyed when an ominously curious state policeman tracks behind. <br/><br/>Indeed, several could relate to Marian Crane, having had the feeling of splitting from the real world and all its dilemmas before, or merely Arizona, in her case. Crane's destination is Los Angeles, assumingly comparative to the numerous venturing for more glory and escapism. On her way she decides to spend a night at an off-road dive; it's raining hard and who needs more with another pesky trooper? Rather than using the typical fat, old, balding loner from the Psycho novel, Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano employ a relatively more normal, attractive personality to exemplify the Bates Motel manager. With that, Anthony Perkins sets off one of film's greatest performances. For much of the second half, mama's boy Bates becomes the character we are more concerned about.<br/><br/>The cinematography in Psycho is as creepy as the plot. Shot in black and white, not because Hitchcock had to, but because he wanted to, our two main characters are followed in medium shot thoroughly at every step. Every reaction is recorded to its highest definition, from Bates searing eyeball scheming on his guest's undergarment, to Crane's multiple changes of expression when the pursuing officer veers right. Psycho is a non-stop showcase of vigorous zooming and follow-framing. What makes this formalist approach to film-making so great is its unconventionality. Alfred Hitchcock was keen on every detail, providing a window for viewers to snatch every bit. <br/><br/>Hitchcock also provided psychological clues to the story in his score, perhaps one of the top three to five greatest ever composed (even Busta Rhymes wanted to `Gimme Some More'). The screeching violin play chillingly reflects the screeching sounds of birds, symbolism often found throughout Psycho. Even the sudden clash of windshield wipers during Crane's stormy drive to Los Angeles is a conceivable preview to what lay ahead.<br/><br/>Perhaps nothing is more impressive, however, than the editing. Oftentimes the first thing mentioned about Psycho is the notorious `shower scene.' Aside from changing the entire landscape of the film, from a quickly-paced protagonist goal to a slower-moving character study, the scene contains a barrage of amazing edits. In this horrific slashing scene, we miss nudity and contact-gore if you will-yet, to much of our delight. The pacing of this classic montage is more attractive, in essence, because of its unpredictability. And with Hitchcock, why expect nothing else?<br/><br/>

Hitchcock is marvelous in his manipulation of both the audience and the picture.  To think this was robbed at the Oscar! Bernard Hermann, one of the greatest composers ever, proves his strength with total vigor.  It is all to obvious why Hitch kept relying on him.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is required viewing to anyone.  If it makes you want to take a shower again (I doubt it will cause any phobias of that)...so be it. Nonetheless, an important film that isn't afraid to be detailed with some pretty deep and disturbing material.  I will take it over a billion Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street sequels any day, any time.  No one will be able to match Anthony Perkins' eccentric mannerisms, not in a thousand years.  Kudos to Hitch for casting him.<br/><br/>Overall, if there was one flaw I felt with this movie, it was that the shrink at the end did to much explaining to the audience and didn't allow Hitch to create something on his own that would have done the same job more effectively.  4.5 out of 5 stars."

","Psycho still holds up as brilliant entertainment more than 40 years after its release. So great is the film's influence on modern cinema that this fact is, in itself, amazing. Psycho broke cinematic ground in many areas, and immediately spawned countless imitators (William Castle's ""Homicidal"" comes immediately to mind.)<br/><br/>First, consider the elements of the film's success. A razor sharp script. One of the 5 best musical scores in the history of film. One of the best acting performances (and certainly the most underrated) in film history by Anthony Perkins. Near perfect black and white photography. All these things fit together so seamlessly that it is easy to overlook them.<br/><br/>Second, consider (and it is difficult for modern viewers, since so much of Psycho has been imitated to the point of becoming a cliche) the ways the film broke new ground.  (WARNING -- SPOILERS FOLLOW)<br/><br/>a. It killed a central character, in a completely shocking and surprising way, halfway through the film. It killed a female character! It killed a *sympathetic female* character!!<br/><br/>  These things *just weren't done* in a film before then. Let me tell you, I watched the film, at the age of 16, on the big screen. After the shower room scene, people were in a state of complete shock. My mother, who sat next to me, had dug her fingernails about a quarter inch into my forearm. The man sitting in front of me had an asthma attack. The impact of Psycho on film audiences was so powerful it is really difficult to imagine.<br/><br/>b. It completely succeeded in fooling the audience with a major twist.<br/><br/>Let me assure you. Virtually NO ONE who watched Psycho had ANY IDEA Norman Bates was the killer until the final scenes. The killer with a split personality has now become a tired cliche in cinema, but at the time it was revolutionary. EVERYONE thought the killer was this crazed woman we hadn't seen yet. Every one of my friends and all the adults in my neighborhood saw Psycho. Everyone admitted, laughingly, that they had been completely fooled.<br/><br/>c. It actually created a phobia for many of its viewers!<br/><br/>For me, and for many other people, Psycho actually created a phobia. For years after watching it, many people actually felt creeping fear every time they drew a shower curtain shut. For the master of suspense, there could be no higher tribute.<br/><br/>I cringe when I see people call Psycho ""overrated"" or wonder aloud ""why it wasn't shot in color.""  Good grief!<br/><br/>To understand the true genius of the film, you had to be alive at the time and watch it on the big screen. But please, please go back and watch one scene -- the ""sandwich dinner"" and ensuing conversation between Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Watch this scene, and all it manages to convey, then watch the identical scene played, in color, by two pretty good actors (Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche in the dreadful 1998 remake. Vaughn knows what he's up against, and can't begin to come close to Perkins. The question is, could any actor in the history of film play this scene as well?<br/><br/>That one scene, in my opinion, should put Tony Perkins in the acting hall of fame, and should have won him an Academy Award. But in those days, horror films were automatically ruled out."

","Psycho ain't for kids. Not because of the much celebrated shower scene, but because it asks something of its audience that a lot of children haven't developed yet.<br/><br/>Hitchcock takes all the time in the world introducing us to the world of Marian Crane (Janet Leigh) before the bottom falls out of reality. And there's the real horror. This poor fool wallows into a trap of her own making, wanders into another set for her by the amazingly weird Norman Bates, played intently by Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>After the prime horror of the story is completed, no one can do anything. Not the detective Arbogast, not the handsome but useless boyfriend, no one, because the prime horror was committed long before Marian Crane ever stepped into that shower, and it came out of the excesses of the nuclear family. But you're in Hitchcock land now, and what seems clear, beautiful and all-American is hiding a deep corruption steeped in fear of sex and death, and that is heavy indeed. <br/><br/>A film like this reeks of a certain conscious angst, which is perhaps why the full color remake of a few years ago was so presumptuous. Psycho works because we have Robert Bloch and Alfred Hitchcock playing out some of the darkest realms of the subconscious in black and white. It is we, the audience, who add the color, in this dream that surrounds the dream. No color remake can ever hope to attain the same effect.<br/><br/>In the meantime, this tight horror film stands, not only in its own time, but for the foreseeable future."

","Warning: if you have not seen Psycho stop reading and immediately run to your nearest video store and pick up a copy of it at all costs. (may contain spoilers) Psycho was released during the year of 1960. It was director Alfred Hitchcock's response to a frenzy created by the media's first publicized serial killer Ed Gein. Psycho brings back memories of a time when film was just as much about story as it was style. Hitchcock embodied that, a true storyteller at heart. He was an inventor, using misbegotten images and twisting them into something darkly erotic through voyeuristic tendencies presided inside of characters. Hitchcock didn't make films to scare the audience with what happens, he made films to scare the audience with what they shouldn't see but can't help but want to. I have always said that it is not hard to scare an audience if the initiative is there, but it takes a true mastermind to produce scares that will not take away from the films point, rather uphold it. Hitchcock was that mastermind. Who else could have made a murder scene in which we see a victim stabbed to death but never once actually witness the knife penetrate the flesh and still have it disturb audiences forty years later? The story to Psycho is simple, given the routine inspection. The idea, on the other hand is complex, twisting and turning around corners and bends, leading the audience to grasp onto central ideas and characterization only to turn it around and reinvent itself, as if to have never even implied any motives in the first place. That was Hitchcock's way. Janet Leigh is Marion Crane. We open to a scene of her with her secret lover. She has a headache and is going to work; they may never see each other again. Our interest has already flared. After arriving at work Marion asks for the rest of the day off after she takes an envelope filled with forty thousand dollars in cash to the bank (a client's payment on a new home). But instead of depositing the money she skips town without telling anyone and checks in at the Bates Motel. Here she meets the owner, Norman Bates, who ensures her that he has a vacancy, `in fact I have twelve. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.'  Normal takes a liking to the girl, he is lonely and has no one but his mother. He watches Marion through a hole in the wall of his parlour; he even invites her up to his hillside home for diner. His mother won't allow this, she is much to overbearing we learn, not from seeing her but understanding her through voiced assumption. Mystery begins to peak. This all seems minimal, it isn't. These opening scenes are a form of admission to the good ones, not to say they are any less enjoyable. They build up character, making us feel like we are part of something that we aren't through melding words of falsehoods. We see them as important to building story, they are really a distraction through explanation. Now comes the shower scene, one of the most famous scenes in film history. I should not be giving anything away by saying that Marion is killed off during this scene, that was  one of the many twists. When it was first released audiences could not understand why Hitchcock would be killing off his main character in a climatic occurrence a mere halfway into the film. There is a reason for it as far as I can see. A lot of people regard it as the pivotal scene in the film, it isn't. The scene on its own does not have enough constitution to regard an explanation for itself. The key scene occurs mere minutes before, in the parlour, a scene that coined the popular phrase `A boys best friend is his mother.' It represented a breaking point in the life of Ed Gein that could explain the motives behind all actions to follow. It was speculated that Gein killed his brother after talking ill of his mother (Marions murder), but there was never any proof found to support this logic (we never see the face of the killer). It is for that reason why the parlour scene is to be placed in such high regard. Listen closely to the dialogue in comparison to such a true-life event and then survey the shower scene as, not an action on its own, rather a physical reaction from an emotional exploit. The remainder of the film is almost of an entirely different ilk, as Marion's sister and lover search for an explanation as to why she has gone missing, and a deeper pursuit into the Mrs. Bates character. I won't get into it, for these scenes are so full of uncomfortable mystery and bitter intrigue that they almost need to vindicate themselves. But what I lastly wish to touch upon is the Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins reminds me of an old Vince Vaughn (who ironically played Bates in the Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho). He delivers a chilling performance from his nervous paranoia, what he says doesn't scare us, but what we think he isn't saying gives reason to worry. Perkins gives a truly masterful performance. There is not a lot of stones left to be turned when talking about Psycho. It has been receiving critical praise for over forty years. And though Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980 he is still greatly missed and still considered one of the most influential and important directors of all time. Revisiting this film only reminds us that, even though he has been taken away from us, his vision will forever live on through his timeless classics."

","It is not really necessary for ""Psycho"" to frighten viewers anymore. In 1960, it was the most terrifying film ever made, and had full houses screaming their lungs out at theaters all over the world.  It was the first ""slasher movie"" and so much more.  Everything in American movies changed after ""Psycho"":  sex, violence, the star system.  It was revolutionary.  And ""Psycho"" ruled the 60's as the shocker of the decade.  CBS had to cancel the TV debut in 1966 because it was too controversial.  When local channels started showing it in 1967, it terrified millions more in the privacy of their own homes.<br/><br/>40 years-plus later, maybe ""Psycho"" will scare you, maybe it won't. But what it WILL still do is prove itself a masterpiece of filmmaking.  Hitchcock and his collaborators were at top form. <br/><br/>Look at the editing, the composition of shots, the camera movements.  Look at the unforgettable performance of Anthony Perkins as nervous young motel manager Norman Bates.  Look at the unforgettable performance of Janet Leigh as motel guest Marion Crane.  Look at all the great performances in support, from the millionaire at the beginning to the psychiatrist at the end.  (The great overlooked performance is that of Martin Balsam as Arbogast, one smart, funny, and tenacious private detective.)<br/><br/>And LISTEN to Bernard Herrmann's classic score -- the greatest score ever written for a thriller.   The ""screeching violins"" are the most famous motif in shocker history (only the ""Jaws"" shark theme comes close),and the ""three notes of madness"" at the very end of the film were so great that Martin Scorcese put them into ""Taxi Driver"" and George Lucas put them into ""Star Wars.""<br/><br/>""Psycho"" scared millions in 1960.  It made history, and it really doesn't matter if it scares you the same way today.  But try watching it alone one night, after midnight, with the sound turned up high to catch Herrmann's music.  It's still pretty scary if you let it be."

","**** out of ****<br/><br/>Psycho is arguably one of the greatest movies of all time, but it without a doubt, rules its genre with an iron fist. The direction and cinematography are of the highest order. They create a dark, gritty, and claustrophobic atmosphere. This adds to the suspense, which is constantly building in every scene and never allows the viewer to look away for a moment. Also, the creepy sets make a perfect backdrop for the horror that is occurring on screen. Still, a movie cannot be complete without good performances and this movie has many of them, but it also has one great performance. Anthony Perkins is perfectly cast as Norman Bates. He is highly disturbing and obviously out of his mind, but we can't help being drawn in by his boyish charm and rooting for him through much of the movie. Which, is a perfect example of classic Hitchcock. He can manipulate you and can make you feel or believe anything he wants you to."

","What can I say. Alfred Hitchcock was a genius. This has to be one of his best works.<br/><br/>PSYCHO is about a woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who, instead of depositing some money like she is supposed to, takes it for herself and goes on the run. She feels as if she's about to be caught, so she checks into the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). During her stay there, she is murdered. So is the detective who comes searching for her. Nobody can figure out what happened.<br/><br/>PSYCHO is one of those rare movies that is near-perfect. Hitchcock can create such suspense in a way that no one else can. All of the acting is supreme, and the plot is just remarkable. It's a little confusing at first, as you wonder who the murderer is, but it is entirely cleared up by the end. That's refreshing amidst movies like MULHOLLAND DR. and MEMENTO, that leave many loose ends for you to tie up. PSYCHO does not do this, which I liked about it. And the ending ... absolutely gave me chills.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. One of the best horror movies of all time."

","CAUTION: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from the 'slasher horror' genre is the fact that it actually has a well-written, well-performed script.  Rather than the dialogue serving merely as links between gruesome murders, the script is loaded with innuendo, emotion, and most importantly, clues.<br/><br/>The 'sympathy' aspect of the film begins in the opening scene, when Marion Crane is upset that she must meet her lover in secret and cannot yet marry him.  She believes she is hard-done-by and put-upon...until she meets Norman Bates, a good-hearted but spineless young man who is kept tightly under the thumb of his dominating mother.  <br/><br/>The scene in the motel parlor between Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh demonstrates the high level of acting that went into this film.  It contains some of the film's most memorable lines, including:<br/><br/>""Mother, what is the phrase...isn't quite herself today.""<br/><br/>""A boy's best friend is his mother.""<br/><br/>""She just goes a little mad sometimes.  We all go a little mad sometimes.""<br/><br/>One does not watch this film merely for the forty-five second shower scene (although that scene alone, still as horrifying the fiftieth time as the first, is well worth it).  It is well-written, acted, and especially directed.  Besides the shower, there are countless memorable scenes and shots that require no dialogue at all:<br/><br/>--> The first appearance of the motel and house<br/><br/>--> The room of stuffed birds<br/><br/>--> Norman's 10-minute 'clean up'<br/><br/>--> Martin Balsam going down the stairs<br/><br/>--> The discovery of Mother in the basement<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is the scariest movie of all time.

","This was the first really terrifying movie that audiences were ever to witness. Directed by perhaps the greatest of all time in Alfred Hitchcock, Psycho displays the first psychotic killer in film. Very few have had the same impact as Norman Bates when you think there is Freddy Krueger, Jason, Dr Hannibal Lecter and of course the killers from the Scream movies. I think it is only Lecter that matches up to Norman Bates. To the violence driven teenagers of today, ""Psycho"" is a film that they probably will not respect or fully understand, but for those who are willing to try this a film that you MUST see.

"boucha_p","Null","0","1","22 April 2003"," Greatest thriller of all time
","Never before has a director captivated an audience more than when Alfred Hitchcock did it with the release of his 1960 film, `Psycho'.  This film starring Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins attracted never-ending lines at the box office and sent the viewers home fearing for their own lives. `Psycho', which is referred to by Robin Wood as `perhaps the most terrifying film ever made' did not become a classic because it is an excellent shocker, but because it contains immensely deep themes, images and ideas that came together perfectly.  This is a film that will never be duplicated, not even by the great Gus Van Sant. There are many elements that fused together to make this film the ideal horror film of all time.  One major component that was essential to the effectiveness of `Psycho' was the casting.  Janet Leigh plays the typical 1950's bombshell.  She is calm, reserved, and very lady-like.  However she shares something in common with almost all the other characters in this movie.  Like her coworker with her tranquilizers, her boss with his bottle of whiskey, Cassidy with his tax-evading ways, and Norman with the obvious twist, Merion has a secret.  She is involved in a sexual relationship with a man that is deeply in debt.  This ultimately leads to her stealing the money and winding up in a disastrous situation.  To the audience Leigh represents a good-looking version of an everyday American woman, letting the audience know that this kind of thing can happen to anybody.  Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins is also perfectly cast.  He is a very sensitive, vulnerable, and nervous character.  He also seems to be stuck between boyhood and manhood, which is evident from his messy room and sworn allegiance to his mother.  Together with Leigh, the two are able to create the friction and tension that is so evident throughout the entire movie.  This was something that Van Sant was unable to do by casting Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn in the same roles.  Heche has been a very controversial figure in the public eye over the last few years.  As a result, the audience is unable to pick up the same sense of guilt that was so beautifully displayed by Leigh.  Vaughn as well may have performed well in the role, however he was clearly not meant for it.  One cannot simply jump from being a `swinger' to being a reserved, childish momma's boy. One of the many themes of `Psycho' is the idea that this sort of thing can happen to anybody.  This is seen in the opening shot where the camera is weaving through the city, and randomly chooses a hotel room of a random high rise building.  There we see two young lovers doing something that is for the most part human, although not ethical at this point in history. Merion the pockets a little cash to help her boyfriend get out of debt, so they could proceed to have a happy life together.  Once again, although it is not ethical, it is not unheard of.  On her way out of Phoenix Merion experiences some turbulent weather, forcing her to pull off to the side of the road to check into a motel.  We all know what happens from there.  The point is that it could have been any car pulling into that motel.  Perhaps if another car had pulled in just before her, this never would have happened.  It could have been your car. What makes `Psycho' one of the greatest thrillers of all time is audience identification.  This is achieved through a series of point of view shots coming from the eyes of Merion, as well as an eerie score performed by Bernard Herrmann.  This can be easily observed for the moment Merion gets in her car to leave town.  By letting the audience look through the eyes of Merion, we the audience, essentially become her.  The audience is in the mindset that we want her to get out of town unseen, and we hope that her boss doesn't think twice when he sees her on the road out of town.  When the audience is introduced to the police officer, it is once again through the eyes of Merion.  We feel her anxiety, and we want to get out of there just as much as she does.  `Like her, we lose all power of rational control, and discover how easily a 'normal' person can lapse into a condition usually associated with neurosis' (Wood, 124).  In the second half of the movie, the audience floats away from Merion, and to Norman.  Although he has committed a harrowing act, we are still pulling for him to cover up each detail. For example, as he covers up the crime he committed, we see only hands mopping up the bathroom, our hands.  The audience thinks, `Oh my, what have I done?' (Wood, 128). One thing that the remake of `Psycho' was able to do was let movie lovers realize how good of a film the original was.  By assembling a perfect cast, interweaving a series of deep themes and ideas, as well as forcing the audience to identify, Hitchcock was able to take this simple film costing less than a million dollars and turn it into his masterpiece, as well as an all-time classic."

","First time I watched Psycho when I was fifteen. For me it was a really true movie, because I have also a mother with some despotic states of mind, like Norman. Of course not so horrible, but I can emphathise with Norman very well. From that first watching Hitchcock has become my most favorite director, and I suppose he will always be.<br/><br/>Psycho was the complement of almost forty years of his movie-direction work and he took advantage of what he had learnt during the whole cinematographic time. From the silent season where the modern film tricks were not available, through the black-and-white film-noir epoch where metaphysics was essential, until the birth of technics in the time of wide-screen technicolor.<br/><br/>I can still listen to Bernard Herrmann's schizophrenic music against a background of the schizo-designed titles, as well as I can still see all the great scenes of the movie, even as I watched it more than twenty times.<br/><br/>Anthony Perkins interpreted the performance which is in my opinion the best I have ever seen. And I really know what is behavior, motion and gestures of a boy in a family with a despotic mother, as I mentioned.<br/><br/>Some people do not like Psycho because there are some horrible scenes. But they do not take account that the real artist cannot be fashionable. Psycho is one of those movies where the artistic beauty is in everything, included the horrible scenes.

","`Momma's boy!'  I remember the taunt from grade school, directed at introverted and overly sensitive boys who had little athletic vigor. Momma's boys were always objects of social opprobrium, because they were exceptions to the rule.  <br/><br/>Or were they?  At the time that Hitchcock directed Psycho, Western society had been through several industrial revolutions, which removed the father from the traditional household industry, so that the sons received their fathers' discipline, not their teaching.  And, lacking initiation rituals that removed older boys from their mothers and initiated them into the society of other men, most young men were insecure in their manhood, momma's boys who were wannabe men.  Unlike the archetypal hero of Norse mythology, who stole the key to the wild man's cage from under his mother's pillow in order to free him, these men had never released the wild man from within themselves, from their mothers' control.  <br/><br/>And that's why Psycho is so terrifyingly brilliant:  it taps into the hidden fears of a society in which young men enter adulthood overly attached to, and overly socialized by, their mothers.  Psycho illustrates the hidden dangers of a fatherless Western society.  <br/><br/>Norman Bates, for example, the disturbed young man of Psycho, has twelve cabins, all empty.  They represent his masculine development, perhaps even the twelve labors of Hercules, all of which have been usurped by his mother. He's content to leave the cabins unused, changing the sheets once a week, watching the sun rise and set every day without incident.  He's totally emasculated by over attachment to his mother.  Never having released the wild man, he's incredibly passive;  but, his passivity is precisely why he's also a homicidal maniac.  He's sensitive and overly delicate, unable to mention the toilet to a woman.  If he had any male friends, he wouldn't be able to belch or fart in front of them.  But his sexuality is so repressed that, when it breaks forth to the surface, it manifests itself as the fear of voyeurism or the angry control of violence.  Is it a coincidence that, at the time the film was made, the larger society as a whole was becoming obsessed with pornography, which offers both voyeurism and the false empowerment of imaginary control?  Is Norman Bates an aberrant microcosm of the rest of us?  Is that why his character is so scary?<br/><br/>Watch it for yourself, and decide for yourself.  This is one hell of a classic."

","Many of Alfred Hitchcock's movies are considered classics, but ""Psycho"" is easily his best. But the reason for that isn't Hitchcock, it's the cast and story. <br/><br/>Hitchcock is the kind of director who succeeds best when his movies deal strictly with person to person situations, and ""Psycho"" does this best. I have seen many, many Hitchcock movies and my peak of interest in all of these movies is when there is an intriguing situation between two  or more people, such as the one-sided murder plot and its resulting conflict in ""Strangers On a Train,"" and the attempts of Barry Kane in ""Saboteur"" to clear his name of sabotage. However, in the case of these two movies and many other Hitchcock films, the person to person situation is almost destroyed by an overly large climax that is ridiculously corny. The merry-go-around scene in ""Strangers On a Train"" is an embarassment, and the Statue of Liberty scene in ""Saboteur"" is a few steps too far. Other bad climaxes include the hilariously bad fall Jimmy Stewart has at the end of ""Rear Window,"" and the lackluster mountain climax in ""North by Northwest."" ""Psycho,"" however, avoids these kinds of climaxes. ""Psycho"" stays on a person to person level throughout the entire movie and does not include a terribly corny ending (unless you count Norman being able to perfectly imitate an old lady's voice). Considering the odd set-up, a man assuming the role of his mother, the story of ""Psycho"" is executed rather realistically. Also (and I don't mean to slam Hitchcock) ""Psycho"" contains far more realistically portrayed characters than any other Hitchcock film. In other Hitchcock films, only one or two characters have any depth, while in ""Psycho"" there are five characters (Norman, Marion, Lila, Arbogast, and Sam) that have depth (though John Gavin's performance is a little stiff). Even supporting characters like Al Chambers and the detective at the end are very believable. Pat Hitchcock, however, as Marion's friend at work, does her part in destroying depth (as she did in ""Strangers On a Train""). But most of the scenes in ""Psycho"" are very well-acted, especially the questioning scene between Arbogast and Norman and their light-weight argument outside. As usual, ""Psycho"" contains the Hitchcock knack for irony (""The first customer of the day is always the most troubled,"" and ""Insect or man, death should always be painless), but, for the most part the realistic performances save the movie from too-much corniness and truly make it one of the finest movies ever made (one of my top five). 5 stars out of 5. The underrated ""Psycho II,"" (released in 1983)  contains excellent performances all around and contains no irony whatsoever. Although ""Psycho II"" is generally liked, straying away from Hitchcock didn't sit well with some."
