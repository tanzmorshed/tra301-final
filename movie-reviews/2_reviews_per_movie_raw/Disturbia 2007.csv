","Not expecting a masterpiece, I can honest say I was very pleasantly surprised at just how much fun I had watching this movie. While it clearly tries way too hard to be hip, and the staggering amount of product placement serves only to distract, the story serves its purpose of allowing DJ Caruso to pull every trick out of the book, to very satisfying effect.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf just about gets by on his charm, but also hints at his ability as an actor, which was firmly cemented through his stunning performance in 'A Guide To Recoginzing Your Saints' last year. His character is nothing new, nor is his predicament, but he remains likable enough and it is hardly difficult to see why he is so taken by his new neighbour, played by the gorgeous Sarah Roemer.<br/><br/>David Morse is appropriately creepy as the neighbourhood nut-job and Carrie Anne Moss, while given little to work with, is fine as LaBeouf's mother.<br/><br/>The story unfolds well, and the red herrings serves to stretch the anticipation until the brutally tense finale. If you're looking for 90 minutes of unabashed, self-indulgent fun, you could do a lot worse than 'Disturbia'."
"freaky_dave","8","243","346","15 April 2007"," A Terrific PG13 Horror thriller
","Disturbia is one of the best PG13 thrillers that I've seen in a long time. After all the other rated PG13 thrillers that have come out in the past six years or so, DJ Caruso, who directed, proves that it has always been possible to make a good suspenseful thriller these days without all the gore.<br/><br/>Shia Labeouf plays Kale Brecht. After witnessing the death of his father in a car accident, he becomes sullen and withdrawn. This leads to him being put under house arrest after he punches out an unsympathetic teacher. Imprisoned in his own house, and unable to go beyond 100 yards, he finds himself turning into a peeping tom and spying on all the neighbors. One of them is the attractive new girl in town named Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and another may be a killer named Mr. Turner (David Morse). With the help of the new girl Ashley, his friend Ronnie (a great comedic turn by Aaron Yoo), Kale goes about investigating Mr. Turner to see if he is the killer or not. The three teenagers use cell phones and the internet as well as video cameras in the investigation, and DJ Caruso shows some of his sly wit by using these same devices in the film to not only investigate the spooky neighbor, but also to create some humor to go along with everything else.<br/><br/>The plot is a familiar one. That would be because the great Alfred Hitchcock used it first with his famous suspense thriller Rear Window. Yes Disturbia is a blatant rip-off of that movie, but it is done with skill, and the acting by all, including Carrie Anne Moss as Kale's mother, was very good. All the characters are likable, and David Morse's turn as the creepy Mr. Turner was well done as well.<br/><br/>Disturbia may not be a great movie, but it is definitely one of the best PG13 thrillers in years. It outshines such horror thrillers as Cursed and Pulse, as well as the recent horror thriller The Messengers. Disturbia also once again proves that you don't need a bunch of gore to make an effective horror thriller. Horror directors take note."
"xander34","8","142","201","16 April 2007"," Solid and Entertaining
","Disturbia star Shia LaBeouf appears to have a great future ahead of him. In the past few years, amidst forgettable roles in I, Robot, and Constantine, he contributed strong performances in films like A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, and now in the thriller Disturbia. Although it is basically a remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window, Disturbia is unique in that it mixes elements of teen comedy, romance, drama, and gripping suspense in an entertaining way. Not to say the film is perfect, as it definitely isn't, but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and then some. <br/><br/>All of the acting is decent and believable, with standout performances by the aforementioned LaBeouf as Kale, and David Morse, as the suspected villain, Mr. Turner. Serving as great comic relief is Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) while the new girl next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), provides a romantic interest. Also notable is The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss as Kale's mother who is great as always, yet underused.<br/><br/>Kale gets put on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher in class. It's his third run in with the law since his father died in a car accident a year earlier. Under house arrest, he begins to learn the secrets of everyone surrounding him through the use of binoculars and video cameras. His most important realization in his voyeurism is that his somewhat reclusive neighbor shares many suspicious similarities to a wanted serial killer whom the police have not yet identified.<br/><br/>It's generally difficult to create such suspense under the restrictions of a PG-13 rating (do not watch this at the theater between 7-9 PM to avoid the loud middle school crowd), but instead of just trying to shock, the film conveys paranoia and fright through the use of mood and mere suggestions of menace. The script could have used another rewrite to further develop the cast of characters, as the only one who is fleshed out at all is LaBeouf's. <br/><br/>LaBeouf, who turns twenty-one in June, is looking to join Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Gosling as one of the few great actors under the age of thirty if he keeps turning in strong performances in interesting projects. His star is certainly rising with Transformers due this summer and the fourth Indiana Jones film in the summer of 2008. <br/><br/>We have to realize that even though there is so much that makes Disturbia unique, at heart it is a very commercial effort. The twists are quite obvious, many characters are underdeveloped, and there's product placement everywhere (which is realistic nonetheless). However, at a brisk 104 minutes, it would be a lie to say the movie wasn't extremely satisfying, and an undeniably entertaining film."
"theshadow908","8","291","434","15 April 2007"," Best thriller I've seen in a while.
","Disturbia tells the story of a teenage boy named Kale who is sentenced to three months house arrest after punching a teacher in the face for making a comment about his recently deceased father. When his mother takes away his TV and his computer, he resorts to spying on the houses surrounding him. Things begin to get frightening when he begins to suspect one of his neighbours is a serial killer. He gets his friends involved with his impromptu investigation, and soon the neighbour realizes he's being watched...And he's not too happy about it. Disturbia is loosely based off the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window, but it is still a film all in itself, and it is the best thriller I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>What makes this movie better than most horror movies that are released today is that is doesn't rely on excessive gore and gross out tactics to frighten you. It relies on mood and suspense, and that works so much better. As the film went on, the tension got so high that I was literally on the edge of my seat rubbing my hands together because I was so anxious to see what was going to happen next. I actually felt the adrenaline rush that the characters in the film must have been feeling when they were snooping around in the neighbour's garage. The movie has a realistic feel of how creepy it would be to have a serial killer living across the street from you and you had no way to prove it. Everything in this movie is done well. The writing, the directing, the way it all pans out. I was actually shocked when I left the theatre over how good this movie really was.<br/><br/>The acting was very good from everybody involved. Shia LaBeouf has come a long way from Even Stevens. Something tells me that he has a nice career ahead of him. David Morse is perfectly sinister as the neighbour. He's just one of those actors that you might not know who he is to hear his name, but he pops up here and there and you always say, ""Cool, it's that guy."" Overall, this was an amazing thriller, and I'm glad I went to see it because I really wasn't expecting that much. It leads me to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump out absolute garbage like the Saw trilogy, Hostel, and Dead Silence when they could be making movies like this instead.<br/><br/>8/10"
"rumli","7","170","257","8 April 2007"," A Solid Thriller
","This movie was extremely well paced -- there was very good character development without excessive dialog. The story is exciting and thrilling: a modernized Rear Window. The acting was very solid, and every actor, major or minor, sold their part. Shia LeBeouf was a likable protagonist, Carrie-Anne Moss did a great job in her role as the mother, and David Morse played an exceedingly ominous and creepy neighbor. The climax is very suspenseful, although it did contain a few minor lapses in rational behavior by both the heroes and the villain, but I suppose that could be written off as desperation. Overall, it was refreshing to see a well-paced thriller with great suspense, humor, and character development."
"areatw","7","9","10","24 December 2016"," One of the better mystery thrillers
","'Disturbia' is a solid, entertaining thriller that does exactly what it says on the tin. Whilst it's nothing new or special, it is well made, suspenseful and effective in building and sustaining tension.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf and David Morse deliver solid performances as Kale and villain Mr Turner. Their characters are interesting and unpredictable and work well with the theme of the film. 'Disturbia' is well paced, the developments are appropriately timed and the film does a good job at keeping you guessing.<br/><br/>All in all, a perfectly decent mystery thriller. One of the better ones I have seen of late, and one I would recommend."
"shiner310","5","127","192","9 April 2007"," A major disappointment
","The first half of this movie is really promising with its solid establishment of the characters and plot. yes, it's a rehash/ripoff of ""Rear Window"" but that's okay. And for those of you who haven't seen that classic, rent it immediately.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes of this movie feels like another movie. The filmmakers abandoned their slow and methodical escalation of suspense and throw us a wicked and stupid twist. All of the sudden, without any provocation or motivation (spoiler alert), the David Morse character goes ballistic. He goes on a senseless rampage which allows the filmmakers to give us some gratuitous and ridiculous ""shock sights"", such as the bodies in the pool of water under the basement.<br/><br/>what's even more ridiculous is the fact that Morse was all along a very smart if brutal killer and yet, at the end, he acts totally irrationally. Why? because the filmmakers couldn't think of anything clever to do.<br/><br/>a waste of the talents involved."

","Apparently... in Disturbialand, all adults are idiots. As a teenager, you can point out direct evidence of a murder and the adults will simply laugh at you. Your mother will insist on going over to the murderer's house and apologizing for you. The murderer will suddenly and stupidly (after years of calculated planning of all his murders) start attacking all of his neighbors.<br/><br/>What could have been a decent homage to Hitch, is instead, a direct descendant of John Hughes. There's the misunderstood (but extremely perfect) lead, who lives in a perfect house in the perfect neighborhood, and who has a crush on the perfect member of the opposite sex. Amazingly, he has the perfectly funny Asian sidekick and he's a perfect outsider at the perfect teen party (he's so perfect that he can't attend!), and he has the perfectly, ever absent parents (a dead father and mysteriously disinterested mother).<br/><br/>They should have made Molly Ringwald the killer.

","Disturbia is an updated teen remake of Rear Window. With an eye on the slacker humour market, director D J Caruso fails to make it tense or exciting or thrilling. It is not the first movie where a horny teenager thinks he has a suspicious neighbour but this is a poor one.<br/><br/>Kale (Shia LaBeouf) has not got over the car accident that killed his father. A year later, Kale lashes out at his Spanish teacher and is sentenced to 3 months under house arrest with an electronic tag on his leg.<br/><br/>Out of boredom Kale starts to spy on his neighbours. The sexy teen Ashley (Sarah Roemer) who is soon attracted to him. However Kale notices that creepy neighbour Mr Turner (David Morse) is acting suspicious at a time when there are news reports of a serial killer at large. Kale thinks he has seen Mr Turner kill a young woman at the house and he is now showing an interest in dating Kale's mother.<br/><br/>Kale, Ashley and school friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) investigate him but Robert soon becomes suspicious that he is being watched.<br/><br/>This is a limp hackneyed thriller that is slow to get going and then goes off the rails at the climax. The director thinks we would be more interested in teenagers hooking up or even worse Kale doing stupid things such as chasing after some kid pranksters so he keeps breaching the conditions of his house arrest."
"Samiellovesmovies","8","10","12","5 February 2018"," Very fun

"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","76","125","25 April 2007"," A new introduction of a terrific story
","The first time I saw this preview, the first thought that came into my head was ""Oh, my God, how could they rip off Rear Window?"", Rear Window is one of my all time favorite movies. But my boyfriend and I had nothing better to do last week and decided to see it, I have to say that actually, it wasn't as bad as I expected, I have to admit that it was a pretty good re-introduction to one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It had a new and fresh feeling with teens and it worked, despite how it seemed a bit more predictable than Rear Window, it still was pretty clever.<br/><br/>Kale has had a rough year, while driving his father back from their father/son fishing trip, they get into a horrible fatal car accident, the Father dies, but Kale is alive trying to deal with the guilt of what happened. But a teacher pushes him too far in his high school Spanish class and he hits the teacher, putting him on house arrest, he cannot leave outside his property. But he's in luck when a hot young girl moves next door, they quickly develop a peeping tom type of relationship, they spy on the neighbors, but when they see the neighbor across the street on a date, but the date ""never leaves the house"" and they want to prove him as a cold hearted murderer, but is he? You'll have to see this movie to find out.<br/><br/>So Distubia was a pretty good movie, I would recommend it, although before you see it, I would highly recommend seeing Rear Window, but this was a good updated version that I'm sure you'll enjoy. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and will make you ask questions over and over again, those are always the thrillers that are worth seeing.<br/><br/>7/10"
"snow0r","7","54","87","21 August 2007"," a simple story well retold
","After the death of his father, Kale (LaBeouf) becomes angry and withdrawn. When he's failed in Spanish, he attacks his teacher, and is placed under house arrest for 3 months. Stripped of his mod cons (iTunes and xBox Live go out the window), he turns his attentions outside, and learns some disturbing truths about his suburban neighbourhood in a sinister take on the voyeuristic aspects of modern life.<br/><br/>After making some loose connections between an ongoing missing persons case and one of his neighbours, Kale enlists his friends to help him find out what's going on. However, Kale is powerless to really influence events; if he leaves his garden, the police show up. It's a tool that works to great effect in terms of creating tension, placing him in the same position as the audience. He can only watch events as they play out outside his window and hope they turn out for the best, as we can only watch events on our screens and (presumably) hope for the same thing.<br/><br/>There are obvious connections to Rear Window, the movie even being dubbed Rear Window for the MTV generation (although aren't we a bit past that now?), but while the original was a masterwork of suspense and doubt, Disturbia disposes of the subtlety and goes straight in for the kill with a surprisingly greasy David Morse and clichés aplenty (blood spatter, dark and stormy nights...).<br/><br/>Of course, it requires some suspension of disbelief (where does an unemployed teen get the money for video home security systems?) but it is nonetheless an enjoyable, well-paced thriller. Good stuff."
"jaredmobarak","8","122","224","13 April 2007"," Coffee and donutsDisturbia
","I understand that the new movie Disturbia is about a person who is unable to leave his room and must look out the window for entertainment. During his peeping sessions, he finds that his neighbor might be a killer and by doing so, tries to get everyone around him to help find out the truth. That premise, and that premise alone, is the ONLY thing that likens this movie to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of tension and technical genius, Rear Window. Director D.J. Caruso has taken this script, no credit listed to the writers of that classic, and created a contemporary world around which he can create a cat and mouse chase from the small radius that our protagonist is allowed to travel within having a house arrest anklet affixed to his leg. If the critics are to be believed that this is a ripoff/remake, then every romantic comedy coming down the pipeline is one as well. Boy meets girl, boy must win girl, conflict causes relationship to stay strained, boy ultimately wins girl. Actually since every rom-com follows that exact plot sketch, they are more derivative than Disturbia to Rear Window because Caruso takes a premise, updates it, and makes it his own.<br/><br/>Worried that this might end up as another lame duck attempt from the director, I didn't have too lofty of expectations. I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf, ever since his ""Even Stevens"" days, and knew he could give it credibility. Fortunately, after the highly disappointing Taking Lives and the ho-hum Two for the Money, it seems Caruso has come back to the form he had with his brilliant debut Salton Sea. Maybe it was the recent work on ""The Shield,"" but we have some nice grit, close-up composition, and stylish camera-work. The realism from Sea is back and Disturbia brings it all to make one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year. We have fantastic humorLaBeouf's delivery and everyman rapport lends to this wellas well as effective scares and edge of your seat suspense. This is a PG-13 movie that knows what it is and rather than titillate with coming as close to the line as possible, stays in check and deals out a healthy dose of mood and emotion rather than blood and sex. I'd even go as far as saying Sarah Roemer's girl-next-door is the most sensual role this year. It is all about her confidence and eyes, her body language makes it work, and you fall for her just as LaBeouf does, whereas the usual R-rated nudity and over the top craziness has been going so far as to numb audiences by doing what every film now does. Credit Caruso for showing restraint for everything and leading us along by uncovering pieces of the story only when we need to know them.<br/><br/>Besides LaBeouf, Roemer, and a funny turn from Aaron Yoo, the main driving force here is David Morse. This gem of a character actor is at the top of his game as the villainous, did he or didn't he, neighborhood serial killer. He is good as the conflicted heavy who does wrong only when the world around him has forced him to, (like in Dancer in the Dark and Down in the Valley), but he is perfect as the all out creepy, sly-smiling force being accused of kidnapping and killing numerous women. Morse was allowed to run free and he took the opportunity and went even further with it. Where many suspense films like this would become laughable eventually, the realism brought out through LaBeouf and Morse keep the audience enthralled and interested in how everything will play out. I was never bored and at times actually wondering what would happen next because I was so caught up. When the climax comes, I actually was surprised thinking it was crazy that they would get us there so early, but I was just so into it that I didn't realize how much time had past.<br/><br/>Disturbia is a genre film and won't be winning any awards any time soon. What it may lack in total originality it more than makes up for in mood and effective thrills. It had everything you could want from a movie without making you have to think too much. Sit down, go for the ride and walk out of the theatre with the knowledge that your time was well spent. D.J. Caruso, thank you for redeeming yourself."

Why, if he has secret place where he kills and keeps his victims, would he keep one in the vents and kill without close his curtains? For example, there's more stupid stuff... And the girl, the new neighbor, what a hell does she see in such a loser like Kale? I really thought, as they showed the father being killed, that they were connecting Mr Turner to it, but no.

Great job alienating your ""broad"" audience.<br/><br/>WAAAAAY too many shots of the ""hot"" girl next door doing Yoga, slow-mo swimming, sun bathing, and your teenage angsty stuff.

","I had seen the trailer of the movie and found it appealing. Later I found that it is somewhat similar to Rear Window  the Hitchcock movie and is on the same lines; that made me go and see this movie.<br/><br/>It is the story of a young boy Kale (Shia LaBeouf) who is sentenced to 3 months of house arrest and finds ways to peep through his windows in neighbors' lives  one, the recently moved neighbor girl Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and another middle aged guy Mr.Turner (David Morse) who our young boy and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yo) suspects as a killer. Is Mr.Turner a killer? Or this is just paranoia of our young gang? The Director D.J.Caruso  who has specialized in crime thrillers in past 4-5 movies, does a very decent job in keeping the audience engrossed in the narrative and unfolds the story slowly and nicely. The movie presents many aspects of drama, and takes us through a ride of varied sub-plots with good interest. There are a couple of minor annoying scenes  like the love aspect (quite unnecessary I thought, but may be required for today's young audiences) and the usual cliché of thriller movies. But overall the movie is entertaining.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is not a great actor, but does a decent job, so does the Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yo and David Morse.<br/><br/>The camera work is excellent because it shows only that much which would make you eager to peep beyond the camera frame to see what is there  and that keeps you engaged. The music is okay.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is not close to the classic Rear Window, but I should say that I liked the movie.<br/><br/>(Stars 6.75 out of 10)"

","I hated this movie! I don't care what kind of star power you have ( if you can even call the kid from ""Even Stevens"" a star), how much money you have, or how well your movie is made, if the script is bad you have nothing. Disturbia is a stylish, highly-polished thriller. Everything looks good, it is well-directed, well-acted, and has an authentic, modern-suburban feel to it. However, once you get past the impressive first five minutes, the film falls completely flat! Without giving anything away, the movie has absolutely no surprises. In fact, Disturbia is so formulaic that anyone over the age of 10 should be able to predict exactly how the movie ends, including what happens to every single character. The dialogue is cheesy and ridiculous, every character besides the main kid (Kale) is completely one dimensional. By the time anything that is supposed to pass for scary happened I was so bored I didn't care who lived or died. This movie had absolutely no emotional resonance. I watched it alone, late at night, in the dark and was not scared once! I have worked in video retail for almost six years. Maybe I've just seen so many great movies that this one just seems especially bad. It is a mediocre film at best. There are good performances, but the actors really had nothing to work with. David Morse's suspected killer is a complete waste of his talent. I am happy I have a job where I can directly influence what people are renting (at least in one neighborhood of Seattle). I am going to make it my personal mission to keep Disturbia out of as many hands and homes as I possibly can!!!"

","As the all mighty great and powerful Hollywood continued to mine ""Hitchcock's"" works for inspiration, they landed upon the idea of re-imaging ""Rear Window"" for a modern audience. Directed by D.J. Caruso, Disturbia actually turns out to be a solid suspense thriller. The first half of the pic is all jocular with hormonal character introductions that come with giggly slices of humour, and then there's the big shift to the thriller that most viewers were expecting, as the makers manage to pull it off with a great final act that is edge of the seat viewing.<br/><br/>There's nothing new on offer here, the formula has been (and will for ever more be) done a zillion times, but the two fold splicing of genres works well and the makers aren't trying to fool anyone with their approach work. Cast are fine, Shia LaBeouf's follows on from his enjoyable turn in ""Transformers"" with this pleasing on the eye show, he shows signs of some good acting chops around some rougher edges. Sarah Roemer is solid enough, and nails down that teen love interest characterisation, whilst Carrie-Anne Moss puts a bit of meat onto the adult bones of the Mother character.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in what is one of the key roles, David Morse is underused, he does OK with what he has to work with, and convinces in a two layer role, but one feels his talent doesn't quite come to the fore here. Still, it's a minor complaint, for this is a solid genre entry with both halves of the film never less than entertaining - even if you might find yourself yearning for some ""Hitchcock"" genius afterwards. 7/10"

With nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, Kale and his friends are in a race for their lives in this electrifying thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf turns in a terrific pulse pending performance, the cast also includes David Morse, Sarah Roemer and Carrie-Anne Moss in this film. I love the cast in this movie beside Shia LaBeouf, here is Carrie-Anne Moss the hot sexy babe from The Matrix who play's Kale's mom awesome. Sarah Roemer as Ashley (Kale's neighbor) is one hot sexy hot chick and really awesome. David Morse is terrific as the villain serial killer. <br/><br/>I love everything about this movie the story about a high school student who loses his dad in a car accident and he attacks his Spanish teacher and he get's 3 month house arrest. When he starts spy's on his neighbors out of boredom he finds a shocking truth about his neighbor Robert Turner (David Morse) that he is am actual serial killer. This movie has also a good soundtracks like are: Louque - Whoa now and Taper Jean Girl by Kings of Leon I like these two soundtracks they are good. <br/><br/>I love the chemistry between Kale and Ashley and I just love this movie to death! On the end of the film was really creepy when Kale found skeletons of the body's. I have enjoy this movie it is really a guilty pleasure of mine I only wish it would be a horror movie that is why I didn't give a 10 but I give this movie B+ 7/10 it is really a good movie I recommended it. <br/><br/>Disturbia is a 2007 American horror thriller film directed by D.

","We saw this at a special preview screening.<br/><br/>This isn't a ripoff of ""Rear Window"" but it does pay tribute to it and to Hitchcock in general. David Morse is a great villain here and provides a great balance to the otherwise teenager-oriented feel of the movie. While not worthy of much critical discussion, it is good for pure entertainment value and has a healthy dose of good, old fashioned suspense.<br/><br/>***** spoiler warning: below is a partial synopsis of the movie; skip past it if you don't want to know anything that happens in the movie *****<br/><br/>Kale (Shia LeBouf) is placed under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher in class. It's his third run-in with the law since his father's death in a car accident a year earlier.<br/><br/>While under house arrest, a new family moves in next door, some neighborhood kids cause him grief knowing that he can't leave the yard and he starts noticing little quirks about his neighbors he'd never seen before. There are news reports of a missing girl and an eye witness account of a car possibly used by the kidnapper.<br/><br/>He shares his voyeuristic discoveries with his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and when they get caught watching the new next door neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) while she's swimming, she comes over. They show her some of their privacy invading observations including the fact that their backyard neighbor Turner (David Morse) drives a car that matches the description of the news report.<br/><br/>The suspense begins to thicken when the teenagers videotape Turner bringing home a woman from a club only to witness her frantically running through the house trying to get out and then everything goes dark in the house.<br/><br/>Turner catches Kale watching him through binoculars. Turner sends the kids a message through Ashley when he catches her following him around as a lookout for Kale and Ronnie as they break into Turner's car in his driveway to steal the garage door opener code so they can get into his house.<br/><br/>***** end of spoiler *****<br/><br/>The rest of the story I'll leave out...suffice to say that things aren't always what they seem.<br/><br/>If you pay close attention, you'll notice little nods to Hitchcock here and there. If you go to the movie for entertainment, you'll not be disappointed, but don't look for something of much substance."

This piece of cinema dog crap is not even a scary movie. The killer really doesn't even come into play until the last 20 minutes of the movie where he just goes on a mêlée rampage with a baseball bat out of the blue, totally pointless.. It's cheesy, it's jokes are stupid, and the killer's house is apparently designed by James Bond. He has a secret room, and then inside that secret room is another secret room that leads into a basement, where beneath the floorboards is another secret room. C'mon, a secret room in a secret room in a secret room, that's stupid! I couldn't care less whether or not the kid died, and to be frank, had the neighbor gone on his rampage in the beginning of the movie, it still would've made the exact same sense, which is ""Hey, let's put a lot of teenagers in a house, and have a crazed psycho try to kill them!"" This is a very original idea, and I think this movie is very ""Oscar"" worthy. I would have rather watched a two hour documentary on the odor of dog crap. This movie sucked."

","When I first saw this movie I regretted spending my money on the ticket. The plot was so predictable, with villains next door getting away with just about every accusation a young boy could throw at him. Shallow characters taken straight from other movies. No new features I have seen in any character of this movie. It was a simple mix of many different other poor productions. And some time later it struck me!!! I have seen this story before! And where else could I see this not other than... The Simpsons. Season 6, Episode 1: Bart of Darkness. Look it up here on IMDb.COM. This episode of The Simpsons features Bart getting his leg broken leg in a cast, getting a telescope from his sister, starting watching people from Springfield using the gift. Sees no other than Ned Flanders - the next door neighbor doing suspicious things... murder is in the air... This episode was inspired by Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock (1954) later remade by Pei Chan in Hou chuang (1955) and yet another time on TV under the very same title Rear Window (1998) (TV) starring Christopher Reeve. Are there no new ideas in the writers heads? Has everything been already written? Why can't I see Alfred Hitchcocks' name when I type Disturbia in IMDb?? When I first saw Disturbia I regretted spending money on the ticket. Now that I discovered it was a cheap ripoff I think it was just another moneymaker by people who do not care about the art of film making and, what is even worse, they don't care about the viewer... they only think about their pocket."

","After the death of his father in a car accident, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) becomes a troublemaker and aggressive teenager. When he punches his Spanish teacher at school, he is sentenced to three months of house-arrest during his vacations. Kale snoops his neighbors with a binoculars and video camera for killing time, and becomes a voyeur of his next door neighbor Ashley Carlson (Sarah Roemer). When Ashley sees Kale and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yo) at the window, he tells out of the blue that their neighbor Robert Turner (David Morse) seems to be a wanted serial killer from Austin, Texas. The trio sneaks around his house, and Kale begins to suspect that Mr. Turner might really be the murderer.<br/><br/>How many times have I seen this story? The masterpiece ""Rear Window"" (1954) is as far as I remember the original story. ""The Bedroom Window"" is a decent thriller; the Christopher Reeve's remake of ""Rear Window""; the cult and funny ""Fright Night"". All these movies tell the story of neighbor spying neighbor, but ""Disturbia"" is too predictable and full of clichés. The car accident in the very beginning is the best part of this film. In the rest, they have changed the ""make-up"", with the excellent David Morse and Carrie-Anne Moss and the gorgeous and sexy Sarah Roemer, but in the end, the story line remains the same. It is better off watching the classic movie of Alfred Hitchcock again than losing time with this overrated, forgettable and flawed flick. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Paranóia"" (""Paranoia"")"

","I don't mind that this takes heavy inspiration from Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" I mind that it's nowhere near as good. This movie has severe story problems and a big tech problem, too, at least in the theater where I saw it.<br/><br/>First, as the trailer clearly shows, the lead is a teenager on house arrest. What it doesn't tell you is that he's being punished for his reaction to being sadistically ostracized by a teach in a foreign language class. He punches the teacher once in the face. I personally would have killed the teacher for what he said.<br/><br/>But I walked out because a boom microphone drops down into view about 20 times in the first 35-40 minutes of this film.<br/><br/>In Flagstaff, AZ, we have only one theater, but that doesn't mean we're stupid.

","This film was utterly average. I had no wish to write a review for the IMDb or anywhere else, as forgettable things should not be dwelt upon, however, I was genuinely surprised to see that Disturbia seemed to be receiving excellent reviews on this site, so felt the balance should be redressed somewhat.<br/><br/>As stated I was puzzled at the glowing reviews - I can only assume that most were written by under eighteens, as anyone over that age should be groaning and squirming in their seats approximately every five minutes or so at how obvious and mundane this allows itself to get. Whether it's the clichéd love element, the goofy but lovable sidekick, the lashings of teen angst, the bad decisions of the characters, the familiar psycho, or, well, too many other aspects to mention, this is never anything other than by the numbers.<br/><br/>I suppose if your a teenager and like Buffy, Dawson's Creek, and Scream this might work great for you.

"CanadianRevolver","1","18","33","11 October 2007"," Worst Movie I've seen in Years
","I hate to rate this movie as high as a 1 but I guess that's as low as it goes. I'll begin with what was good about the movie. The acting was fine, the premise was good and the production was fine. The writing in this film is simply lazy. For example, the police respond within a minute every time the main character goes past the boundary that his ankle bracelet allows, until it would be beneficial for them to arrive quickly. In this case the officer accepts the call (even though he is off duty), but then decides he'll respond when he's good and ready. Let's be realistic, he would either accept the call and respond with some haste, or he would let someone else get the call. Also, we have no idea why a minor would get house arrest for hitting a teacher who made a completely unprofessional and insensitive comment; this again, is lazy writing. There are also dozens of times when the main characters could have called the police on the neighbor (e.g. when he goes into the girls' car), but they don't because they are idiots. If they were really sure of the neighbor's guilt, they could have simply got the girl to call the cops and say that he touched her inappropriately. The ensuing investigation would reveal the dead bodies in his house, the connections to the past murders etc. But then again, this would make too much sense. When the writers should have gotten creative, they coped out and made the characters act as though they were mentally challenged. My final complaint is about the pacing; a bunch of useless slow story in the beginning, followed by pointless fast-paced action scenes. Even in these action scenes, lazy writing prevailed. When the main character is continuously grabbing for the transmitter on the counter, he has it in his hands several times but just ends up dropping it (as though it were covered in oil). This was the worst movie I have seen this year!"
"sg1904","1","31","62","25 April 2007"," Disturbia? I would say,""Annoying""
","I looked forward to seeing this movie especially after reading all the wonderful comments written on this web site. Unfortunately, this may have been the worst movie that I have seen to date. The first three-quarters of the movie was about self-serving, self-absorbed snotty teen-agers which I imagine is the movies biggest draw. The adolescents depicted here would have grown up bruised, if allowed to have grown up at all in my household which made the majority of the movie tedious to watch. David Morse played the ""heavy"" and has a magnificent film presence. I'm sorry to see that his role was so implausible that it rendered him almost useless. If he were the main focus and his character expanded, this movie would be hard to beat. I was on the edge of my seat three times but it was contemplating getting my $4 early show ticket refunded. The camera work smacked of ""The Blair Witch Project"" which was my pick for the worst film ever until now. Please, can the movie companies ever make a suspenseful thriller for grown-ups and forget pandering to an audience that will accept such low standards for entertainment? Number one at the box office? I feel cheated after watching this. At 54 years old, I feel as if I were much too old to get the interactions of teenagers. This movie was slow, went no-where and lacked even the hint of surprise. This movie was so bad, in my opinion, that it inspired me to write my very first movie comment. I apologize to those who love this movie, but to those who have not seen it yet, beware.

What troubles me the most are those stupid plot holes which is laziness on the script writers part. The ending is the worse thing about the movie. The killer disappears for a while, the surfaces again? Why the wait? With so much going on with screaming and the noise of the fight, no other neighbor's notice? When the girl jumps out of the pool, she presumably goes to her parents and calls the police. Where were they? They come so late? The killers house is like the ""house of horrors"". Who can make a place with so many secret walls, floors and compartments? You'd have to have a mansion, not a suburban home to configurate such a place. Would a killer really settle down in the burbs? With his killings, why leave all the windows uncovered for anyone to see? Doesn't anyone think about these things when making a movie? Don't they sit around a table and discuss impausabilities?

","I thought this movie would be good, but the minute I saw the car barrel rolling through the air near the beginning, I knew it would be a Hollywood crap fest. I was right. Why would a serial killer, someone who is obviously being extremely careful to keep his secret, kill people in his house with the lights on, the blinds on his windows up, and right in front of the windows, where all the neighbors can see. Furthermore, why, when he finds out that the neighbor kid is spying on him, continue these behaviors, not to mention then kidnap the kid's mother, pretty much ensuring that the kid gets involved even further? Oh I know, because fools will love it. When I pointed out these glaring flaws to the people I watched it with, they said I was over analyzing the movie, and that I should just enjoy it. I tend to enjoy movies that are believable. For instance, when the girl catches Kale spying on her, and he gives the most canned speech of all time ""You look at the whole world, when I only see you..."", and says something to the extent of ""Even though that's the creepiest thing I've ever heard, I find it romantic, and therefore, find you attractive, even though I just said I think you are creepy."" It's just dumb. Not to mention that entire plot just takes away from the story and is completely unnecessary. After Kale is captured by the serial killer, the man reveals his entire devious plan to him! Honestly, I thought movies got to the point where we didn't have the villains giving monologues anymore. Now there are talks for a sequel. What, does another serial killer happen to move into the same house and Kale starts spying on him too? Ugh. This is just a movie that had potential story-wise, ending up to be a disaster."
"Surecure","3","18","35","10 April 2007"," With a different script, director and cast, this film would have been good...
","If you can't tell by my summary line, there really wasn't much saving this film. I got free passes to see Disturbia and was actually looking forward to it. I'm a huge fan of Rear Window (which this film borrows from liberally, substituting a rabbit for the dog that dug in the killer's garden in Rear Window) and find the whole dramatic content of voyeuristic thrillers to be full of possibilities. Unfortunately, Disturbia is flawed in every regards, from plot lines that are nothing more than a slapping together of ideas, to painful to listen to dialog, to direction that is laughable at best, to both poor performances and great actors poorly utilized. This film has it all.<br/><br/>Right from the word go I had a bad feeling about this movie. Matt Craven is a solid performer, but it appeared from the opening sequence that the director didn't know how to use him in the opening scene. This set the stage for Shia LaBeouf who simply could not carry this film. His performance was, simply put, inconsistent and all over the place. Maybe he gives an accurate depiction of how modern teenagers act (and with access to more techno gadgets than Neo in the Matrix) but it doesn't mean that it is interesting to watch or even good drama. In any good performance there has to be a sense that we are looking at the same character in every scene with subtle nuances that show how the character developed. With LaBeouf's performance, it was as if he was a completely different person every five minutes with no sense of connection to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The dialog went from stale, to boring, to laughably bad to downright insulting of one's intelligence in no time flat. Mix this with a villain -- played by the always excellent David Morse -- who seems to know everybody and show up everywhere and you end up with more of a farce than a serious suspense film. One shot made him look like Michael Myers from Halloween, and by that point they might as well have made this a slasher film because all of the intelligent suspense aspects of the film had already been thrown out the window. And that is very disappointing considering how much respect I have for David Morse as an actor. It was painful for me to watch him have to suffer through the indignities that is this film.<br/><br/>The ending of the film gave the impression that the writers and director had finally given up all hope of making any sense and devolved into a monster on the run project. All reality is thrown out the window as injuries that would kill any normal person become minor inconveniences, law enforcement procedure is tossed aside for happy Hollywood sentiment, and the final two minutes are so laughably bad that one has to wonder both who approved this film and what mafia Don it was that director D.J. Caruso insulted to land this gig.<br/><br/>Perhaps my only lucky break of the night in seeing this was that the projectionist at the theater I was at screwed up the framing half-way through so that the boom mics were present in every shot in the last half of the film. At least that gave the night some enjoyment. However, I would not recommend this film to anybody when there are many more voyeuristic thrillers (did I mention Rear Window) out there that are far better in every regards."

Shia LaBeouf and David Morse exhibited intensity in their roles and were enjoyable to watch. But the script and plot of the movie were so ho-hum and predictable that the wife and I left the theater with frowns on our faces. We were frustrated by the overall direction of the movie.

You like the kid and his friends and can sympathize with his plight. If there is a flaw its that the film could almost be a well made TV movie, there really is no reason this needed to be seen on the big screen (other than the attention a genuinely good thriller would attract).

"oOoBarracuda","8","6","9","14 December 2017"," Reality without the tv
","I first saw Disturbia during its initial theatrical release in 2007. I was 18 at the time Disturbia came out, so D.J. Caruso's thriller rife with subplots including the anguish of coming-of-age and teen romance meant that I was part of the target audience. I enjoyed Disturbia a great deal in the theatre and bought the DVD soon after as one of the last Hollywood Video rental stores closed in my area. After not seeing Disturbia for a few years, I was nervous to revisit it, for fear that it would be one of those films I enjoyed once because it fit a particular time in my life that I wouldn't get much out of after more maturation. I can pleasantly affirm my love for Disturbia is just as strong today as it was when I sat in the theatre the first time I saw it. I suppose it makes sense that I enjoyed it, I'm a massive fan of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. In 2010, the copyright holder of the Cornell Woolrich story that Rear Window was based off of, sued producer Steven Spielberg and his film studio DreamWorks for infringement. The lawsuit was dismissed, as the courts rightly recognized that there is much more to Disturbia than simply a Rear Window rip-off. Though the same voyeuristic protagonist and a mystery exist in both, the existence of one far from hampers the other.<br/><br/>After a summer fishing trip ends with 17-year-old Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) behind the wheel of the vehicle transporting he and his father back home when it crashes killing his father, he feels responsible for his death. Kale's entire demeanor changes after his father's death, understandably so. His violent outbursts and increased aggression have led him to a few run-ins with the law. Just before school lets out for summer, Kale is sleeping through his final classes when he is called upon by his Spanish teacher to dictate his summer plans. Unable to do so, the Spanish teacher becomes upset and implores Kale to assess what his father would think of the situation. Triggered by the implied disappointment his father would feel towards him, Kale unleashes his anger and punches his teacher. Given a lenient sentence of 3-months house arrest, Kale is stuck with his internet and video game subscription canceled, left with nothing to do but gaze at his neighborhood through his window. ""Reality without the tv"", as Kale calls it, is made all the more interesting when a beautiful young girl moves in next door. Determined to get to know her despite his spatial challenges, Kale charms the young girl enough that she begins to spend afternoons with him, giving him a welcome break from his only other visitor, his best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). Kale soon understands that his new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) has a depth and sense of mystery to her that he has not encountered with any of the girls at his school, making Ashley the perfect partner to investigate his standoffish and private neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse). Turner seems to fit the bill of a suspect police have been hunting believed to have killed multiple women. With little else to do but watch the comings and goings of his neighbors all day, Kale appoints himself as the prime investigator tasked to figure out if his neighbor is a cold-blooded killer.<br/><br/>One thing I truly appreciate is when a director shows rather than tells his audience certain aspects of the plot. D.J. Caruso makes a brilliant directorial choice when he shows us the look on Kale's face as he makes his way to his father's side of the vehicle at the opening of the film. Seeing the shock and pain on Kale's face provides much more impact than the makeup and effects required to show a mangled body. The opening moments showing the fishing trip and its aftermath acted as a wonderful introduction to Kale and his personality before his loss and provided wonderful insight to Kale and his father's relationship. Each introduction to the nuances of the neighbors Kale sees from his room was exceptional, and just as uniquely descriptive as the ones in Rear WIndow which the scene brings to mind. The pacing and scares of the thriller side of the film were masterful adeptly creating the mood of intrigue. Shia LaBeouf has one of those yells that turns into a blood-curdling scream a bit too quickly for my liking, and his room was so large it was difficult to believe he couldn't find some new hobby to keep himself busy for the summer, but those complaints do little to detract from my enjoyment of the film. A tightly paced teen drama/mystery/thriller, Disturbia is compelling and a film that always provides a compelling ride with each revisit."

","One thing this movie lacked was creativity and originality. The director should be shot if he thought that this lame excuse for a movie would interest people. Even a child of 7 years old could tell how the movie would pan out. This movie is VERY predictable. The acting is rubbish and the romance is boring. It got to the point where you wish you had a fast forward button since the ""action"" is in the last 20 mins. By the way this 'action' is nothing special. Hitchcock has nothing to worry about with this trash. Whoever wrote the script for this movie must be 'disturbed' to think that it is entertaining. Tedious is a better word because after a while you wish it could just end. Shia LeBeouf is very overrated as an actor. After watching Transformers 2 which was a very average action movie I don't expect much from his movies. To think that Carrie Moss would even consider such a movie as this leads to me to believe that she is desperate for money. The girl who plays the love interest is a poor excuse for an actor and the comic relief is irritating and unnecessary. DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS TRASH - WAIT TILL IT COMES ON TV AND WASTE 90 MINS OF YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","How funny that Caruso, not the singer but the director of this movie, thought he could get away with this. The disturbing things is that critics, for the most part gave him a pass. Riping ""Rear Window"" is a natural ambition for a thoughtless filmmaker but, go<br/><br/>back to the original, please. There are some ingredients that made the classic a classic. John Michael Hayes screenplay for starters. James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter and of course Hitchock himself. Shia LeBoeuf is a mystery to me, a cocky, unbearable presence on the screen. He must have somebody really powerful behind him otherwise how can anyone explain it. Everything is acted and phony. The teachings from Hitchcock have, obviously fallen in deaf ears. And yet, the film did pretty well at the box office. How can it possibly be!? I thought ""Disturbia"" was tedious and irritating. A pointless exercise in futility."

","This is a modern-day teen version of the 1954 classic ""Rear Window."" To show you how far down the tubes Hollywood has gone since then, instead of a grown, mature adult spotting a criminal across the way, we now have a snotty teenager under house arrest for slugging his high school Spanish teacher. And, we have the teen and his horny friend ""Ronald"" (Aaron Yoo) spying mainly on the new teen girl ""Ashley"" (Sarah Roemer) who has moved in across the street. The camera zooms in on her skin as frequently as possible.<br/><br/>In the process, the kid, ""Kale"" (Shia LeBeouf) hears reports on television about a missing girl and description of a vehicle last seen at her last whereabouts. Kale spots that car belong to another neighbor. He tells his buddy and then the girl, after she had come over to visit, and the ""kids"" now take this eavesdropping seriously.<br/><br/>Things get really tense when Kale spots the suspect, ""Mr. Turner"" (David Morse) stab a woman in his living room. It really gets carried away, story-wise, when more and more dramatic things occur and some stupid scenes like Kale and his buddy standing in front of a well-lit window spying. Come on! This script was believable for awhile but really starts to get stupid. I won't say anymore for fear of spoilers.<br/><br/>Frankly, I liked ""Rear Window"" much better, and I am not one of those older folks who always prefers the classics. No, usually the opposite. I also loved LeBeouf in ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" where he plays the great (and nice kid, not like the one here) golfer ""Francis Ouimet."""

"LeonLouisRicci","5","2","2","3 January 2016"," Way Too Cute for This Type of ThingStandard StuffSlightly Overrated
","Director D.J. Caruso isn't a bad Filmmaker but is not Great by any means. He occasionally makes interesting Films like ""The Salton Sea"" (2002) and ""Taking Lives"" (2004). But ""By the Numbers"" most of the time. This is one of those.<br/><br/>No surprises, not much Style, and conspicuously cute, this is a rather tame take on Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" (1954) by way of ""Teen Romantic Angst"". Shia Labeouf is a nervous, hyper-active Actor that has attained Star Status way beyond His ability to transform or ""Act"" like anything more than what He is. One Role is the same turn as another.<br/><br/>Here He is upstaged on every level by David Morse, if not everyone else, who does just what the Script calls for and nothing more. The Buddy Sidekick is annoying most of the time and the pretty ""Girl Next Door"" is pretty smart but the Chemistry between the Teens is nothing short of standard stuff and Clichéd.<br/><br/>The Movie meanders along with one scene melting into the next until commonplace and complacency sets in and all of sudden the Third Act wakes from its comatose state and erupts in a frenzied finale that is all over the place and never settles in a coherent display of what is happening.<br/><br/>The Film is Slightly Overrated and a bland, borderline boring Psychological Thriller that never quite thrills or goes very deep into the Mind of the Killer. Young People who don't have very much Film Going Experience may find it more entertaining than others. But it is just too safe and saccharine for its Own Good and is never intriguing or intense. Just another exercise in Standard Stuff Movie Making."

There was absolutely no suspense in the entire film, then in the end it turns into a slasher film. The cinematographer was horrible: there was a microphone in nearly every scene and at least twenty percent of the shots were cut off in some way.

"jax713","2","9","16","21 August 2007"," Disturbingly careless rip-off of a film classic
","D.J. Caruso's short attention span appears to be better suited for directing TV shows, or maybe commercials, rather than full length feature films. Disturbia, his latest effort, suffers from disjointed plotting, flimsy character development, and bad timing. Suspense, which is what this movie is supposed to be all about, is always interrupted by some unimportant tangent the director feels obliged to show us. As a result, we get little jolts of surprise instead of the throbbing sense of dread that echoes with an audience after a film ends.<br/><br/>As a teen fright film, Disturbia could achieve a respectable 6-out-of-10 score but it would need more blood and guts for a higher rating in that category. As quality entertainment for a mature audience, the movie fails in most ways. The inevitable comparisons to Hitchcock's Rear Window, absurd as they are, automatically raise the bar and show Caruso's creative limitations, lack of imagination, and complete inability to affect more savvy film buffs.<br/><br/>The silly, slurping dazed-and-confoozed Asian buddy, the teasey-cheezy girl next door, the continually absent and oblivious mother, the portrayal of cops as ignorant, and an experienced and treacherous killer who gets had by a teenager are the mundane hallmarks of Caruso's sophomoric re-creation of a film classic. Shame on him."
"JamesMichael32","5","15","30","13 April 2007"," A disturbing remake of a Hitchcock masterpiece
","In Disturbia, Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is placed under house arrest because he got into a fight with his Spanish teacher. It is one of many problems Kale has had at school lately, and a judge orders him to the house arrest, saying ""I just gave you a break Kale, don't test me."" Life hasn't been easy for Kale, while on a fishing trip, he was in a terrible car accident that ended up killing his father, which spiraled the normal teenage boy Kale into his rebellious ways. On his computer, Kale has a screen saver that reads ""LET ME OUT!"" He can't go anywhere or do anything outside of his home, he feels trapped. After a while, I felt trapped as well, trapped into another poorly executed remake and a bad excuse of a film. Disturbia is an obvious remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece Rear Window. There are differences, yes, some minor, for example Disturbia follows a teenage delinquent who has nothing better to do but spy on the neighbors. Rear Window follows a successful photographer with a broken leg who can't do anything, so he passes the time by observing his neighbors. His observing turns to spying once he believes he sees a murder take place.<br/><br/>The minor differences, many like the one I just pointed out, are not the reason why Disturbia fails at what it promises, it is the major differences. Hitchcock was a master filmmaker, he would have been able to tell a story without dialogue and only with reactions to situations if he wanted to, which is called pure cinema. Rear Window is the epitome of Hitchcock's pure cinema, Disturbia differs in telling us what is going on at every moment, simply put, these types of films do not trust audience's enough today as opposed to the '50's. Another major and very upsetting difference is the setting of the film. Rear Window never left the apartment of it's protagonist, which created it's suspense because like the films protagonist, the audience could do nothing about the situation, except try to make people believe that a neighbor is committing a murder. Disturbia, however, takes Kale and the audience out of his room numerous times and into the outside world, the world that Kale is not supposed to enter.<br/><br/>Do film studios really distrust audiences this much? Why do many of these films have to rely on cheap thrills that are seen time and time again, such as the camera creeping up behind the protagonist when he is in a dark corner of the room? Disturbia is a predictable and stale excuse for a thriller. It is troubling when films follow formulas by the letter and do nothing to advance a genre such as thrillers. I would have enjoyed the film much more if Disturbia had been a complete remake of Rear Window, never leaving Kale's room, and us only seeing glimpses of the supposed murderer. There is also a poor excuse for the Grace Kelly character from Rear Window in Ashley (Sara Roemer). I am not saying Roemer is an unattractive young woman, not many can be as attractive as Grace Kelly was, but her character is not given that same depth or meaning as Grace Kelly's Lisa in Rear Window. The Ashley character is a hole filler, we are not given enough time to care for her, because for the first half of the film we only see her from a distance, in her pool, and on the roof of her house reading.<br/><br/>Out of all the negatives in Disturbia, there emerges one slight positive. Shia LaBeouf gives a good performance as Kale. LaBeouf is mainly known from his time on the Disney television series Even Stevens, he's grown up now, and LaBeouf is slowly evolving into a fine young actor, his only problem is that he is not picking good films to star in. He gave a fine performance in Bobby last year, however, that film was simply awful. LaBeouf reminds me of a young Jimmy Stewart, he has the look of a normal teenager that a lot of teens can identify with. Interesting how he is cast in the role Jimmy Stewart had in Rear Window. The problem with LaBeouf's character, however is that he comes off as a peeping tom, constantly spying on Ashley, at one point setting his phone alarm to go off when she is doing yoga. LaBeouf is able to give the character some depth, however, and make watching the character at least a little tolerable.<br/><br/>Overall, Disturbia is simply another throwaway thriller that does not deliver what it promises. There are currently rumors flying that another of Hitchcock's greatest films, The Birds, is in talks of being remade. By my count, that would be the third film of Hitchcock's remade for mainstream theaters, with 1998's Psycho and Disturbia being the first two. Although sometimes I think remakes are a good idea, because hopefully they would get audiences intrigued to see the original, but in the case of Hitchcock's library of films, I have to ask, no, more like beg, that movie studios do not remake any more of Hitchcock's films. His films were perfect when they were made, if anything, draw ideas from them for a new film; please, don't dwindle the great director's finest works into this garbage."
"Paige-Brady","4","12","23","21 April 2007"," Disturbia does not sound scary.....
","OK, first off I kind of guess this movie would not be my favorite because it is just one of those movies. When I first herd about it, I thought to myself 'Disturbia? What the heck is that?' so I read some reviews and I still thought it was not going to be so good, but I went to see it. I really didn't like it because it was too obvious I guess. The character, Robert Turner, was a disappointment to me because I guess everything he did because he didn't hide the 'I'm the killer' look to well. When someone has unkempt hair and mows his lawn every day you think it is odd? Kale was OK, but when he explained to Ashley about him watching her, I almost started laughing out loud because she said it was 'creepy, but sweet.'and then made out with him. Disturbia did have some positives: it was funny in parts with Ron, but I think they should have made Mr. Turner a little shrewder I guess? My final thing is about Ashley; where did she go?! After the scene Kale is arrested the 2nd time, she is gone. Why? I have no clue... Ashley comes back in the end, but what happen to her for that big old gap when Kale is almost getting killed?! Well, I don't care if a lot of people think that this movie was awesome or two-thumbs up, I say it was nothing special, but I guess it got a good rating because others like it."

He is very angry now. He is under a house arrest because he punched the Spanish teacher who mentioned his father in class. He start watching at other people houses because of boredom.

The teen has his friends including the gorgeous girl that just moved in next door help him foil the killers plans. You will know how the movie ends five minutes into it.<br/><br/>There is zero suspense, not very interesting characters, and nothing new to the genre. I generally don't like PG-13 horror movies not because they lack gore but because they are targeted to a different market. However, a movie can build suspense and keep the viewers interest with psychological horror without much shown violence. Unfortunately this movie does feel creepy and has no bite. If the producer wants to use the first hour to build the story then good for him. However, the director needs to build suspense and have some thrills, etc. in the last scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>Dean"

They seem to have had a budget - lots of music, well dressed sets, fairly well known actors, and a big ad campaign. But the result would earn a film student a failing grade just on the production alone.<br/><br/>David Morse was incredible, but the script doesn't let him seem real. The 1st half of the movie was extremely detailed and rich, and then they just wrapped things up quickly and predictably, like they ran out of time. Not really scary or thrilling, but mildly entertaining. This movie is pretty much product and it shows."
"NonnaYobidness","6","25","57","29 March 2007"," There was a boom mic in EVERY SINGLE SHOT
","I have to get that (see title) out of the way up front. I have never seen such an incredible proliferation of visible boom microphones in any other movie. Seriously, there was a microphone visible somewhere at the top of the screen for almost the entire length of the film. At some points in the movie, more than one microphone could be seen at a time. I understand that things slip through the editing process but this was just ridiculous.<br/><br/>The movie itself was not too bad. I was a little put off about twenty minutes into the movie when it suddenly dawned on me that I was basically watching a reworking of Rear Window but who really expects anything original from a movie, these days?. As far as teen idol vehicles go, I think Disturbia was slightly better than most. The beginning of the movie was beautifully shot and paced with a very convincing father-son dynamic. I actually felt the bond between the characters. Shia LaBeouf seems to be a decent actor and Carrie-Anne Moss's mother character was one of the most realistic I've ever seen in this type of movie; she was neither an overbearing troll nor a doormat for her son. Aaron Yoo's Ronnie was great comic relief and the kind of friend a lot of us have had (or have ourselves been to others). All in all, I think the casting was done well and the actors all turned in decent performances, with David Morse's Turner standing out the most.<br/><br/>Unlike the other review I just read, I don't think the pacing in this movie was all that good. There were huge blocks of what I like to call ""nothing"". I guess if you're a seventeen year old male, you'll enjoy the 65% of the movie that is spent watching Kale's new female neighbor through binoculars, but to me it just seemed to slow down the film. There was a little action in the beginning, a huge stretch of watching a girl swim, then a massive rush of violence at the end of the flick. I think Disturbia would benefit from a few less minutes of swimming neighbors and Hostess products towers (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie).<br/><br/>I gave this movie a six because, despite what I said above and the constant presence of boom mics, this movie actually got my heart racing once or twice and the acting was quite good. If you like murder mysteries and/or teen-oriented movies, this one is worth a watch on some Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, there's a microphone in nearly every shot."

"mustafa_er","5","14","29","8 June 2007"," Disturbia disturbs suspense film fans
","Disturbia disturbs suspense film fans Kale a teenager, loses his father in a horrifying accident on the trip back home after fishing together. The accident is one of the greatest car crash scenes ever IMO. Superbly shot. Back to the topic : This accident disturbs Kale -Shia LaBeouf-. This terrible incident has after-effects on Kale even a year later. This is one of the reasons why he loses concentration in his Spanish class and is embarrassed by his teacher, who goads him about his father. Kale gets put on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher in class. This is the moment where the film starts actually. So far so good. I didn't like the rest of it to the end.<br/><br/>He's got a distant relation to his mother, doesn't get on well with her. His only one close friend Ronnie comes by sometimes, plus Kale finds his days at home becoming increasingly boring.Under house arrest, he begins to learn the secrets of everyone surrounding him through the use of binoculars and video cameras. Spying on his neighbors throughout the day and night. And that's it to be honest. Only the finishing minutes are pretty exciting and thrilling. There are only a couple of ""shock"" moments and sudden jumps. Other than this, nothing original, nothing interesting and most of all nothing suspenseful.<br/><br/>I had expected a more exciting, and suspenseful film to tell you the truth. Once he meets the beautiful neighbor girl Ashley -Sarah Roemer- the film takes a u turn. You become a witness of teenage lust fest, which makes you think ""am I in the right film ?"". Like most of the teen movies, there are way too many shots of the ""hot"" girl next door doing Yoga, slow-mo swimming, sun bathing.<br/><br/>David Morse's character was the only good thing to watch in this film. David Morse, who plays the serial killer, as Mr. Turner in the film is excellent IMO.<br/><br/>One of the bad sides is that there are parts you simply find them unrealistic. Like, when Kale claimed that his neighbor Mr. Turner kidnapped his friend Ronnie -Aaron Yoo- , and when the police didn't believe him and brought Kale back home. I wanna know ""why the hell didn't they call Ronnie to check out where he is"" ??? Why not ? Plus, when they get away with the murderer Mr. Turner which happens towards the end of the film, Kale tells his girlfriend to call the cops. However it took ages the police to show up immediately.<br/><br/>In brief, this is a predictable, unrealistic and a fair movie that isn't't very suspenseful at all. I don't know how many of you have seen ""Above Suspicion (1995)"" with Christopher Reeve in it ?? ""Above Suspicion"" is great. I tend to think that Disturbia tried create a great suspenseful film like ""Above Suspicion"" but failed completely. For the guys who haven't seen ""Above Suspicion"" should rent and check this film asap. No no no wait. Don't make haste. To watch ""Above Suspicion"" before Disturbia may spoil the film. I'd suggest you watch Disturbia first and then ""Above Suspicion"". I bet you'll be on my side after checking both films out."

","Shia LaBeouf, the actor who plays the main character in this movie, is terrible. Picture Fred Savage, but a little worse and slightly more annoying and you have Shia LaBeouf. (He was even worse in Transformers, but they had a lot to do with how much michael bay sucks and how bad and stupid that script was) Every praise this movie has received is completely off the mark - the people that praise this movie have no idea what they are talking about - this movie in no way should EVER be compared to Hitchcock. Disturbia is a stupid bad film, with annoying stupid teenage characters that I do not believe and have no reason to act as they do.<br/><br/>LeBeouf's acting is so unbelievable - He does not seem sincerely the 'bad boy' after the death of his father. His best friend (who is the token minority in the film) is highly annoying. Then when the best friend apparently dies the two main chatacters forget all about him and don't care? It always puzzles me when characters do that, it's like: ""Oh our good friend was brutally murdered, and we were almost murdered too, but its the day after and near the end of the movie so lets pretend were not even thinking about that and just kiss each other and feel all well-adjusted and normal despite an unspeakable horrible ordeal"" In short I would expect this for a low-budget B-movie direct to DVD bad movie, but a major studio relese? Please...this was pathetic."

","This movie is disguising itself as a Hitchcock type of movie when in actuality it is nothing more than a teen movie. The main characters are teens, the main occupation (other than spying on neighbors) are thoughts about the opposite sex, and the humor (what little there is of it) is directly towards teens. The story and the events that result from the plot are many times forced and rather unrealistic. The movie was slow to start (I think it was about 45-60 minutes into the film) before the real plot reveals itself. The acting was nothing special.

I'm disappointed to see Shia do this since his career was building positively until now, and Spielberg Exec. Producing it makes me want to cry. The only reason I give it 3 out of ten is because the best friend had some funny parts. 3 out of ten is a gift.

Oh no, the accident...Let's pour our hearts out. Only his lost puppy dog-eyes bail him out of the early scenes where he must play weak. He's stuck on house-arrest, where's his porn collection? Even Mom is totally casual-cool, 'sorry you're a felon...' I grew up in the wrong household. Rest: A by-the-books story that nonetheless pleases when it indulges its cheap, low-rent thriller pulpy origins that are a Foley specialty. Too bad it's hampered by its PG-13 rating, it should have been dirtier. Poor Morse, doomed to always play morally ambiguous creepazoids. (Even Von Trier could not resist.)

","I went to see this because of the advertised, ""Rear Window.""<br/><br/>That film was an amazing experience for me. Hitchcock can be said to have invented the curious camera, the camera that moves and explores as if it were a character. It probes, it withdraws, it discovers. It ""finds"" the story. It only does in some of his films. Actually, for most of his career, he was merely a highly skilled craftsman. But then he developed this idea. With ""Rear Window"" he turned it all upside down. The camera could explore: the world had to be a stage that was composed before and for the camera.<br/><br/>Its frozen noir. That film and ""Touch of Evil"" ended the ordinary noir period. Since then we can only reference it.<br/><br/>Just because it is a kiddie film didn't phase me. These sometimes have the cleverest nuances, the most oblique perspectives.<br/><br/>But oh, not here, not here. There's the slightest nod to ""Rear Window,"" updated via ""Blair Witch"" to have the film within be a genuine film.<br/><br/>What we have instead is one of those irrelevant things about teen remoteness and improbable companionship. Onto that is spliced a modern horror bit, with a cabbage patch Hannibal. And only onto that dog's mess do we have the remnant of the fixed pane.<br/><br/>Odd, because the serial killer notion often finds its way into films with a strong story, and this is embedded as a movie within, often a counter-noir where the killer and his opposite fight for control over fate, the shape of fate.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","Back in 2007, Steven Spielberg pushed for Disturbia to be a vehicle for up-and-comer Shia LaBeouf, the kid he was so impressed with in Holes. He would also later cast the young star in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and no doubt played a part in hiring LaBeouf for the lead in Michael Bay's Transformers franchise. It hasn't quite gone to plan for the once cherub-faced and effortlessly charming actor, but his off-camera antics are perhaps more to blame than his film choices, as well as his frequently bizarre artistic endeavours. Anyway, LaBeouf is the best thing about Disturbia, demonstrating the sort of motor-mouthed confidence and assured screen presence Spielberg no doubt saw in him when he was still a child actor. Still, he cannot save Disturbia from turning into a conveyor belt of clichés and slasher tropes.<br/><br/>Traumatised by his father's death a year earlier, teenager Kale Brecht (LaBeouf) struggles to focus in school. When a classroom incident leaves his Spanish teacher with a swollen face, Kale is sentenced to three months house arrest wearing an ankle monitor that bleeps when he ventures further than 100 yards from his house. After a montage of video games, junk food and Red Bull, Kale's mother Julie (Carrie- Anne Moss) takes away all his television and music privileges. Boredom soon sets in, until he spots his beautiful new neighbour Ashley (Sarah Roemer) taking a dip in the pool. Using his binoculars, he starts to watch his neighbours intently, buoyed on by his comic-relief best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). Ashley soon joins in on their games, as their attention is turned to creepy neighbour Mr. Turner (David Morse), whose car and general behaviour matches that of a serial killer being reported in the local news.<br/><br/>Clearly aiming for Rear Window for the teenage crowd, Disturbia forgets to add that one key Hitchcockian ingredient: suspense. If you have seen the trailer for D.J. Caruso's film, then there's really no need to see the whole thing. A fast-paced beginning that introduces the three perfectly likable teens zips by smoothly, and offers the odd genuine laugh. When the central serial killer story kicks into gear, the action descends into a series of loud bangs and quick edits, so all hope for anything resembling tension quickly flies out of the window. Almost as if film is afraid of offending its young target audience, the moments of 'horror' are frustratingly soft, and it fails to convince that any of its attractive young cast are ever in any real peril. I was left waiting for a twist, or even a moderate surprise, that never came, so I was forced to sit through a plot I had worked out within the first twenty minutes. If this is what passes for suspense nowadays, Hitchcock would turn in his massive grave."

So he gets bored at his house, especially when his mother Julie Brecht (Carrie-Ann Moss) cuts him off from using the television, playing his music and computer games. So to thrill himself, Kale (Shia) decides to spy what his close neighbours are doing and despite the early fun and pleasure he gains from it, it gradually get out of control and is leading him to not only trouble, but danger too.

","I've sat through some pretty horrible films in my lifetime, but I actually had to turn this one off half way through... I couldn't bear it any longer.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's definitely the worst film of 2007 so far... Before I sat down to watch this film I had been mislead to believe that this would be some kind of thriller... In actuality, this film takes the worst elements and clichés of every teen drama ever made and meshes them together into a nice little inoffensive package. Yeah, sure, essentially this film is about a killer who lives next door and an average teen who foils his plans and blah, blah, blah... But, there is nothing remotely interesting about this flick and it's submerged in so much putrid banality that one cannot help but to think ""hey, haven't I seen all of this before in another movie starring Tom Hanks?"" And yet this film is about a hundred times more watered down and it is loaded with the kind of sickening, corny sentimentality that can only be found in the likes of a made for TV Lifetime special. With that said, anyone equating this pile of cinema dung with the flawless classic Rear Window is just an idiot. I had been told that this was a modern day Rear Window but, if anything, it's just a hollow representation of that great film. While Rear Window had you at the edge of your seat this film has you rolling your eyes thinking to yourself ""how come no one I knew in High School acted like the characters on screen? And why must Hollywood always stereotype teenage guys as being sex crazed idiots?"" This is the type of film that represents everything that is wrong with cinema today.<br/><br/>Avoid."

","(My Synopsis) Kale (Shia LaBeouf) was driving back home with his father after a fishing trip, and then all of sudden he is involved in an accident when he crashes into a parked car which results in losing his father. After his father's death, Kale becomes withdrawn and suffers from depression. His rage in the classroom causes him to be sentenced to 3-months of home arrest. An ankle bracelet is put on Kale's leg to keep track of him. He must stay within 100-feet of the house, or a signal is sent to the police that he has left and they arrive in minutes to arrest him. He would then be sent to a real prison to serve his time. Kale is bored with playing video games and watching cable, so he turns his attention to his neighbors. With some surveillance equipment from a friend, Kale begins to spy on all of his neighbor's movements and discovers what everyone is really doing in suburbia. Lucky for him, a beautiful girl named Ashley (Sarah Roemer) has just moved in next door. Since he is not allowed to leave the house and talk to Ashley, he must desire her from afar. With his cabin fever, Kale's imagination might get him into trouble when he begins to believe that his creepy neighbor Turner (David Morse) is a serial killer from Texas.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The story was supposed to be a suspenseful thriller, but for the first hour, it moves at a very slow pace. The movie was probably made for the teenage audience who are not as critical as I am. The writers did a terrible job of writing. They did not get the audience involved in the movie. If we knew for sure if Turner was a serial killer, the audience could feel afraid for our teenagers. But there were just too many holes in the plot, especially at the end. If Turner was such a mastermind serial killer that the Texas police didn't even have a description, he would have never behaved the way the writers wrote the ending. And the worst scene of the movie was when the police were alerted that Kale's alarm had gone off; the cop just ate is sandwich. The movie is not scary, even the last scenes will not scare you. With a different script the movie could have been better; I guess they wanted to keep it a PG-13 movie and not an R rating. (Paramount Pictures, Run time 1:44, Rated PG-13)(3/10)"

","Disturbia starts as teenager Kale (Shia LaBeouf) & his father are driving home & are involved in a car accident in which Kale's father is killed. One year later & Kale is provoked in Spanish class by his teacher (Rene Rivera) & punches him, a Judge sentences Kale to three month house arrest. While at home Kale becomes bored & starts spying on his neighbours, he sees one named Robert Turner (David Morse) act suspiciously & after hearing about missing local girls on the news Kale becomes convinced that his neighbour is a serial killer as Turner owns the exact same type of classic car seen driving away from one crime scene. Kale & his friends continue to spy on Turner but he soon realises that he is being watched & isn't happy about it at all...<br/><br/>Directed by D.J. Caruso I have to say right away that I thought this was total crap & a huge disappointment, Disturbia could have been great & used our obsession with knowing other's business to great effect but all the potential is wasted in a crap film of little merit. The script is an obvious rip-off of Hitchcock's classic Rear Window (1954) & the owners of the original short story that inspired Raer Window sued Universal & SKG for copyright infringement, the basic plot are exactly the same in both as a house bound character who starts spying on his neighbours thinks he has found a murderer. In Disturbia (a combination of the words disturbing & suburbia which is as clever as the film ever gets) the themes & ideas are updated a bit, instead of someone recovering from a broken leg here it's a teen under house arrest & he starts spying on his good looking blonde neighbour & the use of mobile phones, camcorders & computers plants the story in modern times although it is still the same story. There are no surprises at all, the final half an hour makes no sense & I can't believe how predictable it is, where was the suspense & ambiguity? Why is everything so straight forward & why does it all play out exactly as we expect it too? Why not even an attempt at a twist in the story? The films attempts to convey paranoia, suspicion & voyeurism are pathetic, for a thriller there are zero thrills & it doesn't really work as a horror film either as it's pretty tame & simply not dark enough until the final twenty minutes although there's plenty of boring soap opera style teen angst dramatics that I found rather embarrassing to watch with romance, trust, grief & friendship all getting the clichéd American teen treatment. At over 100 minutes it's slow, the assumptions that Kale makes to decide that Turner is a serial killer are ridiculous, why doesn't Turner just close the curtains? Why is he so open about what he does, it's surprising he hasn't been caught before. Once Turner know's he's being spied on why doesn't he get rid of the evidence or just get the hell out of there?<br/><br/>I also really dislike the look & feel of Disturbia, once again very wealthy upper class Americans who never seem to have to work or have any money worries as the big houses & expensive car & possessions are way beyond the average person & it's hard to relate to these people at times. This is not the real world & doesn't come close to depicting it. Disturbia is just full of wealthy Americans who never seem to care about anything meaningful. With a family friendly PG rating there's no real nudity or violence here & it's very tame. Apparently Disturbia was shot in two different cities, although Kale & Turner's homes are meant to be on the same street next door to each other in real life they were actually located in two different cities miles apart. There's a considerable lack of tension as the film is so slow & once Turner is exposed as a killer all logic goes out of the window.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 I can't really see where all that money went really, filmed in California it looks nice enough but forgettable with a total lack of style or imagination. The acting is OK at best, I didn't like anyone here to be honest or their performance.<br/><br/>Disturbia is a film that I hated, I thought it was a boring, predictable & tame Rear Window copy that failed to deliver on it's premise of paranoia & voyeurism in any meaningful way. A slow boring mess of a script with a lack of logic or sense doesn't help either, a not very thrilling thriller."

The far-too-many-repeats Ferris Bueller just managed the trick and makes a decently entertaining film.

"jpschapira","8","4","6","28 August 2007"," A pleasure to watch...Suspense,Thriller
","Unlike, say, ""Smokin Aces"", ""Disturbia"" manages its elements well and it's a pleasure to watch. This is because DJ Caruso is an intelligent, effective guy who delivers. He's not the most inventive director out there but, and this is a compliment, ""Disturbia"" with someone more inventive directing, would have been another movieA worse movie.<br/><br/>However, after some very disturbing (matches with the title) couple of scenes, Kale (Shia LaBeouf) finds himself in the situation of 'house arrest', which is not good for any teenager. The monotony is boring but well managed, with scenes like Kale marking his territory because, if he goes ten meters away from his house, a device he wears goes red and the police come running. Then Ronnie (Aaron Yo) comes along, and they discover Ashley (model turned actress Sarah Roemer), and they sense something wrong about a neighbor (David Morse)And they start watching.<br/><br/>Once this basic premise is established, things start flowing. More than once, the storyline turns repetitive, but we don't mind because ""Disturbia"" doesn't play games. Christopher Landon's story and his script alongside Carl Ellsworth don't take us for fools by surprising us unnecessarily, but they make sure we enjoy the ride. In other words, the film has no twist but justifies its killings and the amount of gore.<br/><br/>This amount of gore, however, is a trick; because the scary thing is in the unexpected images and score (the prolific Geoff Zanelli), not in the visual blood. The movie is PG-13 but it generates more jumps than so many R rated stuff. Again, this is the director; and that's not the only thing he does well (false perception)During one moment, everything is dark and a light is turned on; try to remember a moment like that and tell me if that's shot is not perfect. Also the sense of timeWhen a cop is walking down a hall and the killer is haunting someone, the cameras change several times, but they are both moving; because it is how it is and time in film shouldn't stop.<br/><br/>Another thing that ""Disturbia"" excels at (and that's why it's better than good), which also has to do with false perception, is in not giving you what you want. If you are the kind of person that likes to guess what the next scene is like, ""Disturbia"" will mess with you, because when you're expecting something, it will put a cut to black and you won't have it; but you'll feel like the movie knew you were expecting it.<br/><br/>I can't forget that the work of the cast is a big part of ""Disturbia's"" success. At this point, I still don't know if LaBeouf's talent is for real. But he is convincing, his voice is powerful and I respect him because he always gets to kiss some gorgeous women. Women like Sarah Roemer, who, for our luck, can act. And Aaron Yo is very funny; and Carrie Anne Moss, who plays LaBeouf's mom, is full of grace; and David Morse is one of the creepiest guys in cinema when he wants to...Guess what? In ""Disturbia"" he really wants to."

I'm sure some of you have sat there in your easy chair, watching your dull, typical movies and thought: ""Hmm . . . I kind of wish someone would make a movie where the guy doesn't always get the girl and the killer doesn't always die in the end."" The acting was decent. Some of the movie was very well done, and sadly, better done than most original movies out there. Disturbia understands that there is really a fine line between horror and humor, and movies that take themselves too seriously just end up getting unintentional laughs. All this was great. My only major technical problem was that the killer looked like a reject from the Bozo the Clown show and I absolutely could not take him seriously whatsoever. Also, I was supposed to find the lead girl sexy and tempting, but she was downright average looking at best. So, the casting, minus the lead, was ridicules.<br/><br/>Overall, Disturbia was pointless in every way.

We meet the requisite comic-relief buddy, a token Asian-American slacker. Then there's the vixenish, seductive, beer-commerical-model of a teenage girl who moves in next door. But...the precociously sexual thing only lasts a little bit until she and the boy meet, and now she's more like a regular high school girl.<br/><br/>The supposedly funny parts aren't funny, the scary parts aren't scary, the tension isn't tense, the girl's character is all over the map, the male lead is channeling John Cusack bigtime. Now we're at 59 minutes, and I'm out of here. I recommend the Simpsons episode where Bart breaks his leg and thinks he sees Flanders murder Maude. Much better show than this dreck."

The director tries to build suspense, but again falls flat in that every scene is predictable from other films.<br/><br/>I kept watching this cinematic turd in the hope that it would redeem itself, but that never happened. The actors have no idea how real people respond to real situations, and the director doesn't seem to care if his characters have little to no connection with reality.

It borrows heavily from the better thrillers of yesteryear, most notably Silence of the Lambs and Rear Window. Obviously. Nevertheless, it does have some great elements. Although the story is simple and rather predictable at times, also unbelievable, it's a good enough ride for an hour and a half. The acting from Shia Lebouf and Carrie Anne Moss is the better side of the film along with Lebouf's friend in the film, Ronnie.<br/><br/>I saw it for free. I think it would make for a good summer matinée at the dollar theater. But I wouldn't pay top dollar at an AMC to see it. I felt there were some decent scares, but your typical stuff. The opening scenes were perhaps the best and most shocking. I think it put me in the right mood for the rest of the film. There were also some great comedic moments which lightened up much of the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I was satisfied but I'm not saying it's worthy of awards or major box office receipts.

I bring this up because this movie is basically a remake of ""Rear Window."" It has the same basic premise just brought into the 21st century. And I'm surprised this movie actually got pretty good reviews. Remaking a classic starring the kid from Transformers, sounds like it should have been hated. I really liked this movie, I would say it's probably my favorite PG-13 horror film and one of the best thrillers of the last decade.<br/><br/>For the negative side, it does take a while to get going, the main villain doesn't appear until about 30 minutes in. I don't like the subplot involving the neighborhood kids who torment Kale. When people are fighting the camera begins to get all shaky. And near the end it gets way, way too dark, I can't tell what is going on even when I watch it in pictch darkness.<br/><br/>Now Shia LaBeouf seems to be an actor who gets a lot of hate. Personally I really like him though, he's a good actor and is pretty likable. Sam Witwicky would have been a completely unbearable character had Shia not brought any likability to him. And this movie is his best film in my opinion. I like all the characters, Ronnie is really funny at times, his mom is Kary Ann Mosse, aka Trinity who is always awesome. I really like the atmosphere, the direction make the suspense high with the camera shots, music and lighting. There are some pretty good jump scares, and it does a good job of making you feel trapped in the house with Kale.<br/><br/>Disturbia is a great example of how to do PG-13 horror. It doesn't have much blood, or swearing. It just has atmosphere and suspense, with a few jump scares thrown in."

With the help of his best friend, Ronnie, and his new neighbor, Ashley, they try to solve what really goes on in Mr. Turner's house.

"jaddison383","6","6","13","21 April 2007"," Not exactly disturbing....
","DJ Caruso's Disturbia is a rip-off at heart. It never plays that way, though, which is one of it's saving qualities. However, Hitchcock's Rear Window is definitely the inspiration here. It's a great idea. Unfortunately, this version couldn't quite seem to decide what genre it was.<br/><br/>Shia Lebouf plays the lead guy, Kale. He witnesses his father's death in a car accident, and becomes withdrawn and sullen as a result. This attitude leads him to punch one of his teacher's in the face, which lands him under house arrest. He can only go 100 hundred feet from his house, or the police will be there in seconds. Soon, he finds himself becoming a peeping tom on all his neighbors, including new neighborhood hottie Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and possibly homicidal neighbor Mr. Turner. This is where the movie gets a little confused. For about the first hour and a half, it can't seem to figure out whether it's a horror, comedy, or even possibly a romance. Some of the drama that occurs between Kale and his new girlfriend Ashley is downright stupid. On the other hand, though, when it gets to the horror parts, it does it superbly. The comedy pretty much stays intermixed throughout, which is odd. That's kind of how I would describe the entire movie.<br/><br/>Shia Lebouf does do a fine job of acting. He proves himself better with every movie he's in. Sarah Roemer also actually does an excellent job with her easily over-played part. The always dependable David Morse also is sufficiently terrifying as the killer next door neighbor.<br/><br/>So really, Disturbia is not awful. Most of it's elements are very well played out. There's just a bit too many elements in the mix with this one. The script could use some work. 6/10 stars.<br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for those meddling kids and their stupid dog ... okay, there wasn't a dog in this particular mix of the Scooby-Doo gang, but there should have been. Disturbia, which is being billed by the rabid movie-going public as a teenage remake of Rear Window, owes as much to Hitchcock as they do Hanna-Barbera. <br/><br/>Kale (Shia Labeouf) is your typical 17-year-old high school kid until his life is thrown into a top spin when his Dad is killed in a car accident while the two are returning from a fishing trip. That sort of thing, understandably, changes a kid. So, it is also understandable when Kale punches his Spanish teacher in the face for making inappropriate comments about the aforementioned dead father being disappointed in his son over missing a Spanish assignment. Understandable, not reasonable, the entire incident is ridiculous, but also serves to put Kale under house arrest during the summer before his senior year of high school. Now, when Mom (Carrie-Anne Moss) cuts off the XBox online service, as well as his iTunes, what is a boy to do, but pick up a set of binoculars and begin living a life of voyeurism, watching his neighbors swim in bikinis, do yoga in their bedroom, conduct extra-marital affairs, and kill unsuspecting local women.<br/><br/>First of all, let's remind ourselves that this film is PG-13, and is, therefore, a horror movie for the younger set. It isn't gory, there's little blood, there isn't any real scenes of murder. It does, however, build some decent suspense, and the Scooby gang here is good looking and charming, but I shouldn't see the boom Mic once, let alone 4 times. I understand that this was an early screening, and I hope the problem is fixed prior to the actual release date, because I cannot suspend my disbelief and feel scared by the slow build when I'm staring at a boom Mic.<br/><br/>Moreover, I have an equally hard time believing that our killer can be taken down by three teenage kids, after alluding the police for nearly seven years. Nor can I believe that a killer who has been active for so long would suddenly become so sloppy in dismembering bodies without a shade properly pulled. David Morse is scary enough, and even downright creepy, but at no point do we really feel that he might not be the killer and merely suspected because of a stir crazy boy and his wild imagination. This guy is definitely the killer, but why is he so damn sloppy?<br/><br/>There are a lot of things that I liked about this movie, but they are far outweighed by the things I didn't like. The fun little relationship that develops between Kale and neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) is cute, but it's not enough. And all of the psychological pressures that Kale should be feeling are not only overlooked by the adults in his life, but the filmmakers as well. After foiling a crazed serial killer, this boy should be completely unraveling, not looking for some smoochie time, no matter how hot that neighbor is.<br/><br/>This movie will do well at the box office as long as its intended audience finds their way there. Teenagers that have never seen Rear Window will be looking at some fresh concepts, but let's just hope that their time spent with cartoons helps them see through this drivel and demand more from these types of movies."

But most of the time I found myself stalking some pubescent boy stalking his new hot neighbor chick because she's pretty, and apparently that's all he needs. Admittedly, she IS quite pretty. That might have sweetened the movie for the teenage audience, but to me it just seemed cheap, because Roemer's screen time could have been cut to a tenth without crippling the plot.

"The_Void","8","4","8","16 September 2007"," Does justice to Hitchcock's Rear Window - an excellent modern thriller!
","Like most serious horror fans, I'm not pleased by the way that the genre is being flooded by too many remakes! A modern re-imaging of Alfred Hitchcock's classic 'Rear Window' therefore didn't seem too promising on paper, but director D.J. Caruso has done an excellent job with this film! It takes all the things that made Rear Window a classic, adds in a modern twist and keeps the whole piece just different enough for Disturbia not to feel like a rip-off! Rather than a broken leg, our protagonist this time around is housebound via a modern means. After a family tragedy, Kale finds himself frustrated and angry, and a smart comment from his Spanish teacher ends up with the teacher on the floor and the Kale under house arrest, enforced by an electronic tag that puts an automatic call into the police station if he's more than 100 years away from his house for more than 10 seconds. Bored, he turns to the window, where he discovers sexy new neighbour Ashley...and something more sinister in the form of 'Mr Turner' - the next door neighbour whom Kale comes to believe may be a Texan serial killer...<br/><br/>Disturbia is brought to life by an excellent cast, who all perform excellently in their respective roles. Shia LeBeouf is thoroughly likable in the central role; giving it a nice mix of angsty teenager and curious rogue. Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo fill out the other two young persons' roles nicely, while Carrie-Anne Moss convinces as the mother - and David Morse gives his best performance in years as the villain of the piece! Being more used to seeing him in more gentle roles in films such as The Green Mile, it's surprising to see just how well he fits into the bad guy role. Director D.J. Caruso, who previously made the less than brilliant Taking Lives, does a real good job of providing the thrills with Disturbia. The film works on two levels; on the one hand, it's a teen drama and on the other it's a thriller and these two elements mix brilliantly. At times, the tension is almost unbearable - and it's that which made Rear Window such a blast fifty three years earlier! Overall, this might not be completely original - but it's a great thriller in spite of that fact, and I'm sure it will appeal to most members of the audience. Highly recommended!"
"ajbo","10","6","14","16 April 2007"," Terrifying.
","In a world where technology rules all, ""Disturbia"" fits right on in. Kale is your average seventeen-year-old, who just so happens to have been put under house arrest for assaulting his Spanish teacher. He's distant from his mother, has only one close friend, and finds his days at home becoming increasingly dull. He has a tracking device around his ankle, preventing him from going further than one hundred feet from his house. With little to do (as a result of his mother canceling everything from his iTunes account to his XBox), Kale takes to spying on his neighbors, who lead very different lives from what most might think. Especially Mr. Turner, who Kale suspects, is a serial killer. With the police not believing him and his mother thinking he's just acting out, Kale enlists the help of his best friend Ronnie, and the new girl next door, Ashley, to further prove his suspicions.<br/><br/>I'd been following the progress of this film since I first heard about it some months ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the film ""Rear Window"" and assumed this would be a great take on the same story. People think of ""Disturbia"" as a remake, or a rip-off, when in actuality, it's not. ""Disturbia"" is it's own film, and it's a damn good one at that! Shia LaBeouf will definitely surprise you; clearly, he's grown up since his days on ""Even Stevens"". All around, the acting is great. Sarah Roemer plays Ashley, the hot-to-trot girl, who's just moved in next door to Kale. She, along with Kale's friend Ronnie (hilariously played by Aaron Yoo; honestly, he's the definition of what comic relief should be) help Kale sift through Mr. Turner's life, and discover what he's really hiding. David Morse is excellent here as Mr. Turner, he's hulking, intimidating, and absolutely horrifying; but he doesn't show his ""psychotic side"" until the last parts of the movie. Just watch for the scene in which he runs into the character of Ashley in a parking deck; it'll have you in complete shock.<br/><br/>Granted, I would have liked to have seen a little more of Carrie-Anne Moss' character, but her delivery of Julie (Kale's mother) was excellent. She was caring and sweet, just like a real mother. The film also has it's fair share of scares, with various tension-filled stalk sequences, and action scenes that would put Michael Bay to shame, this film does no wrong. The sets are beautifully put together. It's funny, as Kale's room reminds me of my own room in so many ways.<br/><br/>Is it original? No. Is it a fun film, that will never leave you bored? Yes. With a classic, slow-build, characters you actually care about (I was all for the relationship between Kale and Ashley) and a last act that will have you on the edge of your seat, ""Disturbia"" is definitely a film for fans of the genre to check out."
"JoeKarlosi","5","5","11","6 May 2007"," Disturbia (2007) **
","I was underwhelmed by this highly-touted film. It's yet another thriller about someone who's witnessing from his home what appears to be a neighbor up to no good from his house across the way. I've seen this kind of thing before, in movies like REAR WINDOW, FRIGHT NIGHT, and others. Worse of all with DISTURBIA, the first half (or more like 3/4) played like an '80s teen comedy flick. We have the voyeur being a troubled teenager who's confined to his home on house arrest and gets hot for the cute girl next door, watching her swimming in her bikini through his binoculars when he's not joking around with his typically goofy sidekick friend. We start getting somewhere with the actual plot later on, and though things do pick up considerably, it's too late by then. Just average, although I did like David Morse in the part of the middle aged neighbor. ** out of ****"
"jind","7","5","11","27 April 2007"," teenager on house arrest winds up finding some very creative things to do
","I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a very well done movie from start to finish. The movie itself is actually a remake of the <br/><br/>Hitchcock classic ""rear window"" but it has definitely been modernized but in a fun way.The main character winds up under house arrest with a high tech sensor attached to his leg which literally doesn't allow him to be more than a few more feet from the house without there being serious consequences. The nice part about this movie is that the script is really polished nicely from beginning to end. Once the main character starts off being under house arrest the fun begins. He is told to be very creative with his time, and even though he has his TV and computer games taken away from him he winds up having to use the environment around him to keep himself amused. This is where the well done script kicks into high gear with the other characters being well developed into action, each helping to make the story more interesting. Mainly the different characters help to make up different types of suspense which make it a top notch thriller. Even the ""girl next door"" who turns into his love interest develops in a nice realistic fashion. The best part about this movie is that the script is developed in such a professional manner that it just keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how things are going to turn out. Probably the best part of this movie is that it is totally worth watching, because the director did such a good job and the actors did such a great job. If you don't get a chance to see it in the theatres then do yourself a favor and treat yourself to it on either rental or for purchase, you won't be sorry."

It had a little bit of everything in it, and left us feeling like we got our money's worth of storytelling. We were not strung out from too much action, but we had a good helping of suspense.<br/><br/>The star is young actor Shia LaBeouf who has been in the public eye since he did a Green Light Project with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. We saw him in ""Disturbia"" yesterday, and we grooved on the movie all the way. It was a suspense that kept building until the superior ending. I like Shia, and think he has a great future.<br/><br/>Parents who filter would need to know there was a skinny young teen girl in a bikini and two young teen boys who were forever ogling her from a distance.

"mikevonbach","7","2","3","23 June 2016"," Would Alfredo Hitchcock Approve . Of this Rip off of his 1950's REAR WINDOW?
","The girl friend in this desecration of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is Sarah Roemer whose character is named ""Ashley"", as it should be. She's a knockout ex-model, along the lines of Gwyneth Paltrow but without the magnetism or talent. She has deliciously narrow shoulders and seems to hunch them up and hold them back, as if someone had told her it makes her look slinky and sexy, which it does. What a flawless figure. Yum.<br/><br/>And Shia LaBeouf, of unprepossessing appearance, does surprisingly well in the James Stewart role of the housebound peeper. I'd only seen LaBeouf in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls,"" or whatever that miscarriage was called, and he was a blank.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most compelling performance is given by Viola Davis in the small role of the police officer who puts one of those home- arrest anklets on LaBeouf. She's a marvelous actress.<br/><br/>The writers have taken ""Rear Window"", pumped the story full of adrenalin and various psychedelic substances, and turned it into a comedy thriller about teens. In the original, James Stewart suspected one of his neighbors of murdering his irritating wife. Here, David Morse, older and throatier, is a serial killer who hides rotting bodies all over his house. Of course, no one believes LaBeouf or, after she's convinced, Roemer either. They have an Asian sidekick, Aaron Yoo, who adds comedy and suspense to some scenes.<br/><br/>I won't bother describing the whole plot. Parts of the narrative are idiotic, beneath imagining. A madman is stalking you in your house, carrying a lethal baseball bat, so you escape from him -- after a scene reminiscent of Nicholson's ""Here's JOHNNY"" -- and you run into the murderer's house, searching for your mother, who may or may not be there. The basement of his house turns into a terrifying milieu out of H. P. Lovecraft, with dark sub-basements and pools of decomposing corpses, so the hero can fall into them and scream.<br/><br/>I'd better be careful because I don't want to give away the ending, in which LaBeouf kills the lunatic and saves himself, his mother, his girl friend, and the Oriental gentleman."

","With in the first few minutes... Any movie buff will recognize Disturbia as a rip-off of Rear Window, directed by the Master A. Hitchcock. This is usually a sign the rest of the film will suck. But wait don't leave, I promise it's good. It's geared towards the under 22 crowd, but I'm 50 and I enjoy it even upon 3rd viewing. Here's why good direction that builds suspense. Plus good use of low lighting and darkness. Also the characters are likable and believable. Shia's love interest is well played. And Shia's acting is good, he is our flawed hero.

","Disturbia stars Shia LaBeouf as an incapacitated voyeur who comes to believe there is a murderer in his neighborhood.

The self-pitying Kale wallows in the distractions of iPods, video games and digital cable until his angry mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) cuts him off from all things electrical.<br/><br/>Disturbia then turns into a throwback to typical late 80/90's stalker films where the suspense is brought into over the top suspension of disbelief. Although it works, the predictability lies beneath the finale."

","Overall the film proves to be a successful horror/thriller. The film proves to be successful because of it's jumpy and unexpected nature. But the true aspect of horror in the film begins when Kale, Shia LaBeouf, has nothing better to do then start spying on his neighbors, including Mr. Turner, David Morse, and his new neighbor Ashley, Sarah Roemer. The film can also be seen as the perfect teen horror film not because LaBeouf is so young and handsome in the movie but because of his love interest in his new neighbor Ashley. It's a great film in which has you on the edge of your seat questioning if what happens is in Kale's head or if it is in fact going on. The story itself is easy to follow and great to watch!"

Who wouldn't want Carrie-Anne Moss for a mom?<br/><br/>Arbitrary intro to my review aside, this film is definitely very entertaining and quite solid. It's got nice performances by the lead and the supporting actors. David Morse certainly pulls off the cold and calculating freak next door well. Aaron Yoo and Sarah Roemer do a good job as Shia's friends. This movie also does a nice examination on the subject of voyeurism. Hopefully Hitchcock would be proud.<br/><br/>My complaints to this film, I feel are minor. Such as some clichéd character actions, and a few cheesy lines of dialogue here and there.

","Disturbia is a modern twist on Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" with a gripping storyline, fast-paced direction, and an excellent performance by a fine young actor, Shia Labeouf who plays his lead exceptionally well! The film opens with a touching flashback of father and son on a fishing trip. On the way home, a car accident occurs, and the father is killed. One year later Kale (Labeouf) suddenly lashes out at his Spanish teacher for making a remark about his deceased father.<br/><br/>Sentenced to three months of house arrest, Kale begins to enjoy the life and luxury of video games, cable, and surveying the neighborhood with his video equipment, including the beautiful girl Ashley who moves in next door. Ronnie, another friend of Kale's, visits him. They provide Kale's only connections to most of the outside world. Being under house arrest as his sentence for striking the teacher, Kale must wear a surveillance monitor strapped to his foot at all times. If Kale steps outside the perimeters of his own home, the cops will come to investigate.<br/><br/>His mother cuts off his cable and I-Tunes account and Kale becomes more focused on a new mysterious neighbor Mr, Turner who has moved in next door and always seems a little wired. His mother meets him at the supermarket and Turner has now invaded her life, his girlfriend's, and his good buddy. As Kale begins to investigate Turner, a series of unfortunate circumstances, for which Kale is not at fault, happen to him. Already under house arrest, Kale must try to convince his friends and his Mother that Turner is a vicious serial killer. Kale's Mother is slow to believe that Turner is a bad guy, but the rest of the protagonists become convinced. Is is David Morse's CHILLING portrayal of Mr. Turner and the very convincing performance of Shia Labeouf that keep this film at the hight of dramatic tension! I was very impressed by the sincerity and intensity of Shia's acting ability in this movie! He is only in his early twenties, but all of his scenes are so natural and real that he acts with far more experience than his years would indicate! The low key, but equally intense impact of Mr. Turner, played by David Morse, is truly both dramatic and terrifying!<br/><br/>The movie's conclusion is predictable, but it's both intense and suspenseful in getting to that point. Fine pacing and direction by D.J Caruso maintains viewer interest throughout the film. Disturbia is recommended viewing!"

","Disturbia is a horror thriller about a boy named Kale Brecht(played by Shia LaBeouf) who after being involved in a car crash with his dad and survives but his dad dies, is saddened by his fathers death and finds it hard to focus on things in life such as his education. When he struggles to stay focused in class in High School because of the traumas of his fathers death, Kales teacher asks him questions, asks if he's done his homework, and then says ''what would your father think'', but because he's heartbroken and traumatised by the death of his father, Kale punches the teacher in the face. Kale ends up being put under house arrest which he finds is not comfortable. His mum Julie(played by Carrie-Anne Moss) is concerned about him, but he is disturbed and curious to know what's going on in his neighbourhood and what the neighbours are up to. He does this by using his binoculars day and night to see what's going on and also keeps in touch with his friend Ronnie(played Aaron Yoo) who also comes over to his house. He also loves the look of his beautiful neighbour Ashley(played by Sarah Roemer) who he looks at a few times with his binoculars builds a love with her and she comes over to stay with him. He also starts getting suspicious about one of his neighbours Mr Turner(played by David Morse) who is a violent, malicious and manipulative killer and Ashley and Ronnie also also get suspicious of Mr Turners actions. Kales mum starts to get involved with Mr Turner which Kale doesn't approve and hates not knowing that Mr Turner is a killer. I have only seen Shia LaBeouf in the first three Transformers films but hadn't seen him in any other films but when I saw this film I was amazed and impressed. He really stood out in this film and his acting as an innocent, loving boy having suspicions about a malicious and manipulative killer as a neighbour was brilliant. The film was very tense, dramatic and scary and is an excellent film. This horror thriller had a combination of action, drama animosity, tension, rage, violence and light horror. Disturbia has some great things such as some excellent acting by Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, Carrie-Anne Moss, David Morse, Aaron Yoo, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Matt Craven and Viola Davis."

","I've seen this movie a couple of days ago and it delivered exactly what I wanted to see: a relaxing and fun mystery movie in which some young people do detective business in their neighborhood. Relaxing relates to the first part of the movie while fun describes the whole experience.<br/><br/>In the first half of the movie you get acquainted with main characters and the neighborhood they live in. I really enjoyed it since it set relaxing summer tone. Then there comes the second part where mysterious things start to happen. And that's what's so cool about this movie; it's always fun to see unexpected horrific events taking place in the regular setting, entering into and dwelling in ordinary, not being main occupation and starting point. Horror is thus subsumed in the tone set by the first part and gets its flavor from it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there's a linear progress in terror - it starts benign, builds slowly by adding more elements which raise suspicion and then suddenly bursts. This terror is not characterized by macabre tone or gruesome imagery but rather builds tension and makes things more mysterious until the very end.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very fun movie to watch in the evening by yourself or with friends!<br/><br/>P.S. As I was writing this review, for some reason I just couldn't get another movie out of my head: The Goonies (1985) directed by Steven Spielberg. Then I found out that Spielberg was executive producer of this movie. There are no words that can describe feeling Disturbia creates better then this connection."
"ianenderby","6","1","1","8 May 2018"," One order of thriller please, heavy on the everything else
","I really don't know how I feel about this one. <br/><br/>I mean, on the one hand, it was a pretty typical outing for circa 2007 Shia LaBeouf who, even then at the ""height"" of his career, was turning in performances that were capable though not very compelling. Pair that with a story that doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be, and so overcompensates by being too much of everything: Mystery, teenage ""romantic"" comedy, coming of age tale and genuine thriller/horror. Add in some mediocre acting by many of the supporting players and you get a movie that just doesn't seem to ever really take flight.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are genuine moments, few and far between as they may be, where the movie does accomplish what it sets out to be. Both in terms of it's individual aims (see list above) as well as the over arching feel I believe it is trying achieve by weaving them all together. Amidst the heavy sighs and eye rolls, I found myself more caught up in what was happening to the characters than I expected. Sometimes this suspension of skepticism would last long enough for me to ask myself ""is this actually good?"", right before something overblown or heavy handed would happen to snap me back into the disappointing reality.<br/><br/>So, is this a good movie? Is it a bad movie? I could probably make a case for either position, in fact I kinda just did in the previous two paragraphs, but ultimately I think this one is gonna depend on the mood of the viewer and the atmosphere of the viewing. One day, one person might think it is great and another day another person might hate it.<br/><br/>I guess this isn't really a bold statement since it could easily be applied to just about any movie, but it's what I've got today.<br/><br/>My best recommendation would that anyone who finds the premise of this film interesting should really check out Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece Rear Window. It's everything that Disturbia want's to be and more."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","1","1","25 February 2018"," Disturbia, unfortunately, seems far too outdated.
","This is a tough one to review. On the one side I remember really enjoying this as a smart little teen thriller back in my youth. Re-watching it now, it's far too clichÃ©d and problematic to withstand any real thrills. Do I score this based on the time it was released, or how badly it's dated? We shall see. A grieving and troublesome boy is put under house arrest where he lives his daily routine by spying on his neighbours, a new girl on the block on one side and a potential serial killer on the other. You could class this as a modernised version of Hitchcock's famous 'Rear Window', it does indeed pay homage to this in a few subtle ways. The slow build up of suspense and tension is well crafted, much like 'Rear Window'. The first half is focussed purely on building up the protagonist, the second then descends into thriller territory. Do the two marinate? Not consistently. It does feel like you are watching two different films. A comedic light hearted teen flick then contrasts with a dark suspenseful thriller. I understand why, to show that any neighbourhood no matter how pleasant the exterior seems does indeed hold ominous secrets. In this case, a murdering psychopath. Separately these two halves work really well and are thoroughly enjoyable, although filled with mediocrity. They just don't blend together. Shia LaBeouf actually gives a decent lead performance. David Morse and Carrie-Anne Moss needed way more screen time, although the former was very menacing. Unfortunately, director DJ Caruso was too focussed on filming Sarah Roemer's ass and having fans blow into the actor's faces just to blissfully move their hair in a gentle breeze to care about the technical aspects of the film. The cheap alt-rock soundtrack, the forced romance which amounts to nothing in the final act and lack of character development. The whole film felt mediocre, but still pleasantly enjoyable. It's a weird one this, but I'm in a good mood so will grant it with the higher score. Entertaining but far too many flaws."
"grittenc","9","1","1","13 February 2018"," Great watch
","The first time I watched this movie, I feel like I traveled through countless different vibes. I feel that this movie accomplished a feeling of different moods throughout, but ultimately got the point that it was trying to portray across. This movie, for the most part, was successful in keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout.<br/><br/>This movie starts off with making the audience feel bad for Kale, who has just lost his father in an accident. So, when he punches his teacher due to a comment he made about his father, the audience still feels sympathetic towards Kale. Once Kale is on house arrest, the mood shifts to more comedic occurrences with him and his best friend Ronnie. The absolute boredom that Kale goes through brings out some funny scenes and uplifts the audiences mood at the start of the film.<br/><br/>Then, there is also a great romantic mood in this movie. As Ashley, his next door neighbor, moves in, they start to interact and become romantically involved. This opens up the doors to a separate audience who enjoys romance in films.<br/><br/>Finally, the main objective of the film is to portray itself as a true thriller. I believe this is done extremely well because it slowly builds throughout the course of the movie. At first, Turner is just a neighbor who mows his lawn a couple times a day. However, as the movie progresses more and more suspense builds through Kale trying to figure out if Turner is the serial killer from the news. By the time the movie is in it's last thirty minutes, it is an all out jaw dropping thriller.<br/><br/>One important thing to also mention is the amazing soundtrack to this film. Each song really helps to elevate the current situation Kale is in with being under house arrest. When the song ""Lonely Day"" is played, it really does make you sympathize with how lonely Kale probably is.<br/><br/>There are so many different moods in this film, and that is why I ultimately believe it was successful, and an overall great production. This is still one of my favorite movies to watch to this day, and I will always appreciate the versatility it provided."

One of the most effect shots is when he witnesses his neighbor hack a young girl up and hides her body in the garage, but when he looks it only trash.<br/><br/>What drew me in was the suspense as Kale involves his best friend and a new girl in the witch hunt. As they sneak around the house or follow the killer on the street you always wonder if one of them will be caught or be his next intended victim.<br/><br/>David Morse really impressed me with his stone dead gazes, sinister sneer and the persona of a criminal master mind who's always two steps ahead.<br/><br/>The plot was flawless to a t with many twists and turns that keep you guessing till the end. It was grounded in reality, never dragged and was loads of fun.<br/><br/>What makes a thriller work is the soundtrack that was moody and became an entity unto itself.<br/><br/>This is one remake that I thoughtfully enjoyed."

The suspense make you sit on the edge of the seat. The gorgeous and beautiful Sarah Roemer makes you fall in love with her and you just can't let your eyes off her.

When his mother takes away his TV and his computer, he resorts to spying on the houses surrounding him. Things begin to get frightening when he begins to suspect one of his neighbors is a serial killer. He gets his friends involved with his investigation, and soon the neighbor realizes he's being watched. The movie has a realistic feel of how creepy it would be to have a serial killer living across the street from you and you had no way to prove it. Everything in this movie is done well. The writing, the directing, the way it all pans out. I was actually shocked after the movie ends over how good this movie really was. Overall, it was refreshing to see a well- paced thriller with great suspense, humor, and character development."
"juneebuggy","8","1","1","29 September 2014"," Predictable thriller but still a great ride.
","I enjoyed this more than I expected too. As a thriller it's very predictable, yet it still works, borrowing and updating Rear Window in a clever way. Shia LaBeouf plays a teen sentenced to house arrest who becomes convinced (through boredom) that his neighbor (played by a super creepy David Morse) is a serial killer. He does a great job, the kid can act and I liked his interaction with the entire cast. There are some laughs and a bit of romance with the girl next door and I felt like this showed teens in a realistic way. The opening scene with the car accident is shocking and brutal. It does fall apart a bit in the last 15 minutes but still a great ride. 7/23/14"
"alexandru_calin","7","6","15","30 April 2007"," Best movie i've watched this year!
","Comedy, Action, Horror, you name it. Disturbia contains all of that. From the beginning you are kept in suspense. There's no SF-scenes or some great effects(i'm sick of all that). It's just great action. But there are some things which bothered me, such as the fights between Turner and the kid. The kid wins every time. How can he beat a guy like Turner? And Turner did not killed kid's mother when he had the chance. That's a bit strange. He killed his other victims so easy and quick(for example, the redhead). The actors were great. David Morse is a great actor. And Sarah Roemer...she's hot. Overall: 10/10 I enjoyed seeing this movie."

","first off all anyone who saw transformers should automatically know that shia labeouf cannot act to save his life. he witnessed his father die i don't have a problem with that but how does that fit in with the rest of the movie? he was on house arrest for being a complete idiot which causes him to watch his neighbors a typical cute one that just moved next door and cant act to save her life either. the beginning to the middle of the movie was a complete a joke and the actual killer wasn't even mentioned till damn near the end of the movie. the worst part is that this movie is pg-13 which really made it a joke. this movie is on the same level as that remake of when a stranger calls. i suggest that anyone who hasn't saw this movie yet please don't."
"Chrivhec","9","4","9","28 August 2007"," Definitely one of the best thrillers in film history.
","What a movie! My God! This has got to be the best thriller I've seen in years, and maybe the best thriller ever? Dare I say it? Yes I do: to me, Disturbia is the best thriller there ever was. It totally blew me away! I was actually stunned when the credits appeared on the screen, and the first word I said afterward was ""Wow"". This movie is very impressive, definitely D.J. Caruso's best movie to date.<br/><br/>To make a good thriller, the first thing you need is a good script, a good story. Then you need a good crew which consists of a qualified director and qualified producers to deal with that story. Finally, you have to look for the right cast. Disturbia has a great story, a great crew and a fantastic cast, and those things resulted in a unique film. <br/><br/>The way D.J. Caruso can bring such tension and such excitement into this movie is absolutely amazing. He paid a lot of attention to the structure of the movie, and you can really notice that. The film evolves from an average teen movie into a suspenseful thriller which makes sure you don't blink during the whole second half of the movie. I went to see this movie because I heard it was good, but 'good' doesn't even come close to define this movie, 'incredible' would be more appropriate. <br/><br/>I liked everything about this movie, but when I think about it, the thing that surprised me the most was the cast, especially Shia LaBeouf. He did great! Really, he did a very good job and proves to be a talented young actor. You could really admire him for this role. David Morse's performance is another honorable element on his respectable career, and also Carrie-Anne Moss deserves to be mentioned: she did good, as always. <br/><br/>I recommend everyone to go and see this movie in theaters, you will NOT be disappointed. And although the so called critics say that it's a rip-off of Hitchcock's Rear Window, I can assure you: it's not. Yes, it has some elements that also occur in Rear Window and also in other movies, but Disturbia has got a whole different storyline. I guess some people just can't admit that not only Hitchcock could made great thrillers. Because that's what Disturbia is: one of the best thrillers in film history."
"jarmoszka-sylvia","Null","4","9","15 May 2007"," Too Predictable
","Overall the movie Disturbia was pretty good. The choice of actors was great and the storyline was even better. The only problem that I had with this movie was the fact that it was too predictable. You knew every time what was coming next so you weren't surprised when it happened. There should have been some kind of twist in it. They should have had the killer be someone you wouldn't expect because once you knew, the suspense was gone. It would have been a little more interesting that way. I wouldn't consider this movie a horror movie either but more of a teen love movie. I felt like there was a lot more romance between Kale and Ashley then there was of the actual killing and trying to figure out who the murderer was. If I had to rate this movie I would have to give it a 6 out 10."
"grcfle","1","4","9","9 May 2007"," boring....
","Yes, it is similar to Rear Window...unfortunately, that didn't help it in any way...where Rear Window lacked in constant thrills it made up for it with style and dynamic between it's main characters...there was no dynamic between the characters in Distubia. They were more annoying than anything. And utterly boring...I could have cared less what happened to them. And for what was marketed as a thriller - there was way too much of a cheap storyline revolving around a budding romance and less actual thrills. The only highlight was David Morse, who was fantastic, which is of course no surprise. This movie was certainly made with a target age in mind, and I'd assume that is why it did so well."
"tanis_alberssen","5","4","9","16 April 2007"," I was a bit disappointed in the movie, especially the end.
","I went into the theater expecting ""Disturbia"" to be something miraculous, and it was a plain disappointed in it's plot and grade school depiction of a possible hair-raising situation that could develop in anyone's neighborhood if a freak in on the loose. The main characters spend too much time trying to get into each other's pants when a potentially fantastic movie could be make made from this script. too bad. The premise of having another movie similar to ""open window"" is a great idea, but the producers and actors have big shoes to fill on that one. I am not saying that the acting was crap in this movie because it wasn't, it was just not played right and the two main characters who are to fall for each other don't seem to steam up the screen. Take a look for yourself and see what you think."
"phillipstephenso","9","4","9","15 April 2007"," Serial
","Shia LaBeouf is fascinating as a teenager, who loses his father in an automobile accident after a fishing expedition together. This, of course, disturbs Shia very much. As Shia recovers, he loses concentration in his Spanish class and is embarrassed by his teacher. Shia then lashes out physically and is arrested and taken to juvenile court, which sentences him to three months of house arrest with an ankle bracelet monitor that restricts him to within 100 feet of his house. Shia is banned from using his usual video games and IPOD by his mother. So, Shia becomes bored and begins to spy on his neighbors with binoculars. And, one neighbor becomes suspected by Shia of being a serial killer.<br/><br/>The film does a good job of not only describing a typical teenager confined in his house but also the outward normalcy of David Morse as a serial killer in a suburban setting. Dennis Rader might have been the model for David Morse, who has a habit of binding his victims and then killing them. These separate themes of a bored teenager spying on his neighbors and a serial killer pursuing his gruesome work behind a veil of respectability come together, at the end of the movie, in a thrilling climax.<br/><br/>It is amusing, in this film, to see that, unlike most suburban neighborhoods, the residents of these houses seem to always be at home. And, most of the windows of the houses are wide open to peering eyes. But, for the most part, the film does communicate plausibility and resulting dramatic impact. Shia is a remarkable young actor, who inhabits his role well."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","4","9","15 April 2007"," Not What You Expect
","In the opening scene of the thriller ""Disturbia"", Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) and his father Daniel (Matt Craven) enjoy trout fishing in the mountains, spending some great father-son time. Kale's father is killed in a horrifying accident on the trip back home. A year later Kale punches his Spanish teacher, who goads him about his late father. Being still a minor, Kale is placed under literal house arrest for 3 months shackled with ankle bracelet tracking device. Yes, Kale is doing Martha Stewart time without the privileges. He is imprisoned in ""Disturbia"". His Mom Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) is none too pleased. Julie is also dealing with the tragic loss; however, her compassion and patience are wearing. Director D.J. Caruso is an expert in providing relevant context, setting the rules of the game, and building menace and tension. Shia LaBeouf gives a spirited and captivating performance as Kale. LaBeouf breathes an authenticity in troubled teenager Kale. His Kale harbors a deep seeded guilt, and at the same time is smart, possessing a sense of humor. Caruso and his writers Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth keep this thriller noir fresh set in the tech world of XBox games, picture phones, and wireless access. ""Disturbia"" is understated, and an amazingly executed thriller.<br/><br/>Caruso effectively creates the confines of ""Disturbia"". Kale is on a short leash in his house arrest. If he travels outside tracking bracelet's perimeter, he has 30 seconds to get back or the police are summoned. In his slacker seclusion, Kale becomes a casual voyeur of the neighborhood. One of the objects of his attention is his stunningly beautiful neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer). After all, he is a teenage boy, and Ashley is his age. Joining Kale in his voyeuristic pursuits is his bud Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). In his observations Kale becomes convinced that the mysterious Mr. Taylor (David Morse) is a serial killer. Kale soon enrolls Ashley and Ronnie in this obsession. Or is there some truth in this premise? Director Caruso brilliantly navigates the creepiness line of this apparent voyeurism. In a surprisingly touching scene, Kale comes clean with Ashley (Roemer). He says that when he sees Ashley looking at herself in the mirror he knows it is not out of vanity, but that she is really asking, ""Who am I?"" <br/><br/>""Disturbia"" is smart and populated by smart characters. David Morse brings a quiet visceral menace to Mr. Turner. This also works that Morse is a towering and powerful presence. Sarah Roemer does a star turn as Ashley. Roemer is beautiful and charismatic. She wonderfully leverages her character's intelligence and charm. Carrie-Anne Moss is great, and is so believable as Kale's suffering mother. As Julie, Moss embodies both strength and exasperation. Ultimately, ""Disturbia"" works because of Shia LaBeouf. LaBeouf's Kale comes across as a real teenager just dealing with all that comes along with growing up. At times he is brash, and other times he is vulnerable. LaBeouf also masterfully hints at the strength and character that reside within Kale.<br/><br/>""Disturbia"" is an engrossing thriller, and a surprising hero's tale. D.J. Caruso effectively lays the context for his story and fleshes out his characters. Shia LaBeouf gives a wonderful performance along with the rest of the cast in this smart and taut thriller. Amazingly, ""Disturbia"" is not what you would expect."
"without_eyelids","9","3","6","24 July 2007"," Finally... a horror movie that thinks.
","Very little is implausible in Disturbia if you think about it. Okay, maybe a chick won't fall for a stalker so easily, and maybe it's not likely a visually unobstructed car will be hit by another car going full speed on the highway, and a few other small goofs, but Disturbia packs a lot of thought into what it does and removes the questions from the audience. This is the way horror films should be and exactly the reason why I avoid the genre of horror... because they never stop and think about how ridiculous their situations are. Meanwhile, I'm squirming in my seat, unable to enjoy the ride because I'm thinking to myself... Jesus, this movie is so dumb.<br/><br/>Disturbia isn't like that. Everything that is done is done by believable characters... Shia LeBeouf and the girl are excellent in their roles, as is the Asian friend. Everyone's excellent! Shia's character never falls into an emotionally devastated lull and continually whine or bring up the death of his father, as many trite and unsincere movies are wont to do. Shia sets his friend up to break into his suspicious neighbor's car, which may seem like a stupid scene, until you see that he has a lookout trailing the neighbor at the store. This alleviates the false tension which comes from many movies who simply throw their characters into situations without considering the obvious consequence (If you venture into a dark house, someone's going to pop out and stab you.) What I enjoyed the most? When Shia is in danger, in every scene, the first thing he picks up... is a weapon. AMAZING. More horror films should be like that. When I see horror protagonists carrying around weapons instead of running around locked complexes with their heads chopped off, I will start to care. Shia fights like someone who is trying to survive and win, instead of someone who has given up himself to die and merely wants to make that death as entertaining and gory as possible.<br/><br/>It's just so strong, the performance that the primary cast gives. The mother, a good mix of caring and firmness, the girlfriend, the friend, and not to forget the villain... a neighbor who wears an amicable veneer with a savage rage underneath (at one point he piledrives a female victim into a doorsill, knocking her unconscious).<br/><br/>Another thing of note is how MacGuyverish the movie plays out... as a boy on house arrest, Shia finds the time to rig a transmitter to his video camera and find blueprints of his neighbor's house. A pursuit worthy of someone whose xbox and itunes have been canceled.<br/><br/>One of the best movies this year, and one of the best suspense/thrillers I've ever seen, period. I never thought it'd be this good, but it is."
"pellpell4","7","6","16","23 March 2007"," Didn't use its full potential, but still an entertaining movie
","I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because I like Shia Labeouf. Other than that the movie's basically about a kid going under house arrest because he punched his teacher and has nothing better to do than spy on the neighbors. He then suspects his next-door neighbor of being a murderer and the movie is then him and 2 of his friends trying to find out if he really is a murderer. It was pretty predictable, funny at some parts, its a pg-13 movie so don't expect anything too intense or graphic. As far as the Genre goes I wouldn't really call it a thriller until maybe the last 20 minutes, other than that it was more of an adventure i guess...well, as adventurous as you can get while being under house arrest. Not bad, I recommend renting it, not spending 8 bucks though."
"Se7en14","8","4","10","14 April 2007"," Wanted To Hate This Movie
","I walked into this movie expecting to hate it since I'm not really much of a fan of Shia Labouef he annoys me to the utter end. But instead i walked in and saw a decent Hollywood flick. The story centers around Kale(La Bouef) who is 17 and his father was recently killed in a car crash, leaving Kale to become a rebel and not care for much else. Until his Spanish teacher makes things a lot worse for him tells him something pretty rude about his father making Kale give him one big shiner on his eye.<br/><br/>Kale is sent to court, and the judge understands his position so instead of community service or being put in Jail, Kale is sentenced to house arrest with a little gadget on his foot that if he walks outside a 10 yard line the cops will arrive, and they give him the three strike line after three times of being caught by cops he'll be sentenced back to court for a new punishment. His mom decides to cancel everything his Xbox 360 account , his iTunes the TV everything leaving Kale with only one option spying on the neighbors. So this is where the story falls into a rear window type except this time for teens.<br/><br/>After spying on the girl next door, he hears on the news and in the paper about missing girls and starts suspecting his neighbor Mr, Turner(Morse), he eyes him, watches him and tries, to pin everything on him for him to be a murderer. Without giving to much away, the movie ends pretty predictable, but it's still enjoyable. There's a lot of comedy and a bit of thrills though i wish they had set up for more tense moments with Mr Turner and left the teen thing as a sub plot as it wasn't to important.<br/><br/>Also in my theater there were a lot of boom microphones in the shots, someone at Dreamworks is getting fired most likely, and it's not the first I've heard of them being in there either, and it did take away from the movie a lot, even the crowd laughed when seeing them. All in all it was still enjoyable very good Hollywood movie but i still hate Shia Labouef but i guess i'll have no choice but to watch him in the future as he has a lot of upcoming projects including Transformers and Indiana Jones 4. <br/><br/>All in all it's a movie worth seeing for fun.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ferguson-6","6","6","18","14 April 2007"," Tower of Twinkies
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director DJ Caruso lapses into the same thing here that prevented his ""Two For the Money"" from being better. The interaction between characters, including the exchange of dialogue, just doesn't flow naturally. We never escape the feeling that these are actors reading their lines.<br/><br/>That said, this was a better film than expected. Sure, it is a blatant rip-off of Hitchcock's classic ""Rear Window"". The only things missing are a wheelchair (an electronic ankle monitor instead) and the fabulous wardrobe of Grace Kelly (replaced here by the tight jeans of Sarah Roemer). Of course, Jimmy Stewart's telephoto lens from the original has been given a high-tech face lift utilizing computers and digital movie cameras. Regardless of the changes, the story remains the same. Shia LaBeouf is a teenager under house arrest for slugging a teacher who asked for it. To prevent boredom, LaBeouf ""observes"" his neighbors and stumbles on what appears to be a very bad guy next door played by the eternally (and wrongfully) stereotyped David Morse. LaBeouf manages to draw a couple of others into his web, most notably his beautiful new neighbor (Roemer), who reads on the roof, dips in the pool and yogas in front of her open windows. In other words, a peepers best friend!<br/><br/>Nothing to give away here because there are no real surprises. That is what's missing! How about a twist? Instead, every one in the movie is exactly as first presented to us. Where is the filmmaker sleight-of-hand? Where is the blind side? Those are the things that make a successful thriller. Still, LaBeouf shows some acting potential and could develop into a star if the vehicle is ever just right. Playing his mom here is the terrific Carrie-Anne Moss (""The Matrix""), but she is really given little to do. What I really wish is that someone would cast Mr. Morse in a role where he can really stretch a bit. The guy is a good actor but these days is relegated to playing the strong, silent bad guys. Whatever happened to ""St. Elsewhere""?"
"p_jones92","3","3","7","11 January 2008"," Don't believe the IMDb rating, this isn't scorching or a thriller
","I have to say, I've been liking a lot of Shia LaBeouf's work, and so the opportunity to see him in a leading role was appealing, as he did a good job in Transformers, so I saw this on IMDb, saw the rating it had, and thought it would be a good DVD to rent.<br/><br/>The premise of Disturbia is actually pretty fresh, a kid under house arrest for assaulting a school teacher due to repressed anger about his father's recent death who, with all the spare time on his hands, starts watching his neighbors to get a glimpse of what's happening on the outside world. He soon realizes however, that one of his neighbors late night antics may be more than they seem. <br/><br/>Sounds good as an idea right? I mean I can see a studio exec hearing that and thinking, yeah sounds good, a nice Friday night/date movie. However, as with all good ideas, they only work if they are executed well, and this is just a poor execution of premise and acting talent from beginning to end.<br/><br/>There are so many plot holes and down right stupid conveniences in this movie that it's just annoying. He has a sexy neighbor who moves in next door, whose bedroom just happens to be right opposite his. OK, but how come he can stand right at the window, with binoculars, with all of his lights on, and she can't see him looking at her? How come when he jumps the fence of his neighbors house for the first time to go and help his friend Ronnie, 3 police cars and 6 officers respond to his tag going off within seconds, but when he jumps it later on in the movie to save his mom from getting killed only 1 sole cop turns up, and only after having finished his burger and delaying his response? How come Shia manages to get the blueprints to his neighbors house online? Blueprints to everyone's houses are now available online? How come his murdering neighbor manages to build an entire, huge, 20ft by 20ft medical room in the middle of his house, with white tiled walls, medical operating tables and everything, yet no one seemed to question why a suburban household might need such a room, or why operating theater equipment was being delivered to a house address. Did he manage to build it himself? He could the murdering neighbor split his entire house in half (according to the free blueprints that were found online) and add a huge room and basement and hide it behind a concealed door all by himself? How come his basement is the size of a football field, yet his house isn't? How come his next door neighbor/now girlfriend can send him pictures messages from her phone that seem to go straight to Shia's computer screen? The list goes on and on. <br/><br/>Now sometimes, the conveniences are needed to help drive plot and story, so can be forgiven. But an incessant list of striking conveniences starts to really bug you, and is a sign of poor execution and laziness by both the writer and director. <br/><br/>A prime example of poor execution in the story telling is Carrie-Anne Moss in her role as the mother. She hardly appears in the movie, and when she does it's only to help conveniently move things on, she has no real purpose or character development at all, she pops into a scene to provide a convenient bit of tension or plot point, then disappears for about 30 mins, then suddenly appears again. What does she do, she's never at the house except when a convenient situation is needed. What is she, CIA? A hooker? What on earth does she do that seems to keep her out of the house 24/7? For example, the murdering neighbor, who hasn't been confirmed as a murdering neighbor yet, suddenly appears in Shia's kitchen, having been invited in by his mother (who has also suddenly appeared from nowhere). Clearly there is tension between Shia and the neighbor, who knows Shia has been watching him. Hmmmmm, how can they express that they know what each other is up to when mom is in the room? Oh yes, let's get mom out of the kitchen. How could we do that, what could happen to make her leave????? Oh yeah, she WENT AND LEFT MILK IN THE CAR! How convenient, because what happened was she'd just been shopping see, but the car got a flat tire, so the nice murdering neighbor who happened be there at the time her car got a flat tire helped her fix it, and then drove her all the way home from the grocery store, but then walked straight into her kitchen and left her to carry all the bags of shopping which is why he scared Shia by appearing in his house unannounced. I mean you can imagine them having this conversation on-set because it's just so poorly thought out that it could only have been come up with in a short space of time.<br/><br/>This movie is just mindless, they've put in no thought whatsoever. They have a unique premise, and then spoiled it with every conceivable cliché you could possible make about teenagers falling in love whilst solving a local murder. As long as the women wear skimpy clothes and the guys have cool gadgets, we're golden right? WRONG.<br/><br/>This is pap, I only give it a 3 rating because Shia is watchable, the rest of it is just a joke, about as tense as an episode of Saved by the Bell, but not as funny."
"imhottstuff19","6","3","7","8 August 2007"," WOW this was pretty bad
","This movie, considering its a remake of Rear window, had potential to be good, but it was pretty bad. The first hour of the film shows the main character on house arrest and tries to get across the fact that house arrest is very very boring. We get it, house arrest is boring. There is no reason to focus in on this for that long. Anyway what seems like 4 hours later the main character begins spying on his neighbors to rid himself of boredom (oh boy its exciting now) He comes to the realization that one of his fellow neighbors may be a killer. Well since the first 2/3 of the film focused on house arrest that left no time to focus on what the main plot of the movie supposedly was. So the viewer, after only one stint that may lead one astray, is told the neighbor is the killer. This is then followed by one of the worst filmed scenes in the history of cinema. The director decided it'd be a great idea to film in complete darkness with only a flashlight to provide lighting.....awesome. You can not see anything that is going on in the climax of the film. I don't know about you but I sure love not seeing what is happening at the climax...

Yeah, it was necessary to the plot, otherwise his mom probably would have died.. of course another mainstream, horribly directed disaster that we see too much of today would have just flashed the image across the screen and leave you wondering what it was while you were scared out of your wits at the thing that just jumped out at you.<br/><br/>Where I saw it, yes, people screamed.

It was like foreplay with no sex. The director seemed to just through in a shock once in a while. Then everything that it seemed to be working up to just came and left, the movie was basically over before i even realized it. By no means was the movie a ""spectacular,"" ""edge of the seat,"" ""thrilling,"" ""joy ride."" The last 30 minutes of the film seemed to of possibly almost of been from another movie. The killer doesn't even seriously come into play as a threat until the last 20 minutes when he goes on a hysterical rampage with a baseball bat(which contradicts his previous method of intelligent murders). By the end it seemed to have turned into a slasher movie.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie is extremely predictable where the director just through's in some gore factor like a pool full of bodies to shock the viewers.

I watched it with a friend who is even older than me (been collecting social security for quite a while now) and he also found it suspenseful and compelling (unless he wasn't being honest with me).<br/><br/>This updated ""Rear Window"" felt much more real and less stilted and wooden than the original, although, of course, it is a bit more gruesome, as can be expected from a modern movie.

The Asian kid stole a number of the scenes and the killer was the most unterrifying murderer ever. <br/><br/>No, its not going on my top 100 but I enjoyed it and it passed time painfree till dawn."
"zkonedog","8","2","4","8 March 2017"," When Shia LaBeouf Ruled The Teenage World
","When evaluated as the thriller it is advertised to be, ""Disturbia"" is slightly above average, providing just enough drama/suspense to keep viewers interested. However, add in the incredible acting of Shia LaBeouf, and the film easily jumps up into the ""very solid"" category.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Disturbia"" very loosely follows the premise of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"". In this case, young Kale (LaBeouf) is confined to house arrest after slugging a teacher. While homebound, Kale enlists the help of friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and new-to-town girlfriend Ashley (Sarah Roemer) to spy on the next-door-neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), who they believe to be a serial killer.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the opener, as a ""thriller"" alone this movie is passable. If you are a veteran of the genre you'll likely know what is coming a mile away, but it's watchable. Some may deride the effort as a ""Hitchcock rip-off"", but it should instead be viewed as a ""Hitchcock re-interpretation"" for the younger generation (the ones who have no interest in watching Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly).<br/><br/>The hallmark of the experience, though, is easily the acting of LaBeouf, who (as he so often did during that time period) represents the typical American teenage boy. He struggles with the utter boredom of house arrest, spies on the bikini-clad teenage girl across the yard (and then befriends her in his awkward way), and lets himself get completely swept up in a fantastical plot involving Mr. Turner. These are all things that teenagers can relate to (or even older folks can remember relating to!) and make the movie much more personal to the viewer.<br/><br/>To me, ""Disturbia"" will always represent the peak of LaBeouf's teen flicks (right along with ""Holes"" & ""Transformers""). Every time I watch this movie, I actually find myself enjoying the setup (first 2/3) more than the resolution (1/3), and his interactions with all the characters is the primary reason for that. I can't say it's an all-time classic, but it represents a certain time of life for me that has become cemented by the sands of time. That's why I can always still enjoy this one."
"Avatarman614","8","2","4","19 August 2014"," A brilliant and engaging thriller
","This movie could be seen as a rip off of Alfred Hitchock's film Rear Window, but this film is clever enough to just use the premise of that film as it's springboard changing things here and there to keep it fresh. Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is placed under house arrest after he punches his Spanish teacher. During his house-locked escapades he watches his neighbours including the new obviously has to be attractive girl next door Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and seemingly the nice Mr Turner (David Morse). Kale becomes convinced that Mr Turner is a serial killer and uses the aid of Ashley and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) to help him find out the truth. That is all I'm going to tell you because Disturbia is one of the best thrillers you will ever watch. Director D.J Caruso (Eagle Eye) gives some of the best suspense I have ever seen. This movie is a must watch.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8/10 One of the best thrillers I have seen in years."
"the_only_warrior","4","2","4","8 December 2013"," Very dumb thriller
","I haven't actually seen Rear Window, but I am aware of the premise. This is a similar idea - a teenage boy Kale (played by Shia Laboeuf) just short of 18 is confined under house arrest and suspects his neighbour may be a serial killer.<br/><br/>Firstly, the whole thing shot from the perspective of the teenage boy verges on soft porn the whole time as he spies on his female next-door-neighbour, Ashley. The story is very clumsily delivered and every setpiece is one you've seen before in this type of movie.<br/><br/>The boy's mother is played by Carrie Ann Moss - a very good actress in my opinion who is given absolutely nothing to work with.<br/><br/>But pretty much all the other characters are badly drawn and annoying. The big romantic scene between Kale and Ashley made me cringe and laugh at the same time.<br/><br/>The only positive side is that a lot of it became unintentionally funny - unfortunately not quite funny enough to fall under the ""so bad it's good"" category.<br/><br/>You're better off seeing Rear Window, Psycho or watching episodes of Dexter. In fact, I just remember thinking of the villain, ""Dexter he is not!""."
"akupm","6","2","4","25 November 2013"," Disturbia
","Review: The movie was disappointing because the atmosphere wasn't strong enough especially the suspense and tension. Shia La Beouf performed brilliantly but not as well as Morse because you would forget that he was acting. I didn't like the way the film was directed because it didn't drag a strong ingredient from the original picture (Rare Window) that could capture you. The soundtrack was quite poor and I thought the film was just aimed at teenagers because of it themes and the Western culture. The movie didn't focus strongly on other themes like investigation, the main character's upbringing or deeply how the next door serial Killer's motive or reason on slaying people. Instead the film focused too much on teenagers and how they live their lives in the Western culture. Robert Turner played by Morse portrayed his role in a sinister way but he could of performed a lot better because of his potential. I give the picture a 4/10"
"wlvryn","3","2","4","13 September 2013"," a question more than a review...
","uh, ""chicken or egg?"" time... ie, this movie & ""fright night"" (the original, but mainly the remake) have so many commonalities (apart from ""actual"" vampires) that i'm surprised it gets compared instead to the vintage alfred hitchcock offering ""rear window""... ??? :P<br/><br/>Still, the old saying of ""hollywood has only ever made 7 movies""... (or whatever the number is... eg, i'd personally say ""only 1"", ie, basically it merely keep re-packaging ""the 10 commandments"")<br/><br/>...goes a long way towards explaining THAT bit.<br/><br/>Anyway, not putting the movie down, (some quite intense acting seems to be Shia LaBeouf's forte/penchant, & has saved many a movie i'v seen him in - nearly even ""transformers"" lolz) it's just that i find it somewhat amazing that this movie keeps getting compared to the hitchcock film, whilst it really seems more like a (stripped of the supernatural of course) parallel to ""fright night"" (the remake)."
"Chase_Witherspoon","7","2","4","31 December 2012"," Contemporary Rear Window
","""Rear Window"" for the 21st century with Shia LeBeouf in the Jimmy Stewart role, here instead of being in traction, under house arrest and forced to occupy his time covertly spying on his neighbours. His hot single mother Carrie-Anne Moss strikes up a budding romance with neighbour David Morse, but LeBeouf is convinced he's been piling up the bodies somewhere in his house.<br/><br/>Aaron Yoo has an hilarious role as LeBeouf's sidekick who accompanies him on an ill-fated inspection of Morse's house, while Sarah Roemer plays the Grace Kelly part as an attractive neighbour with whom LeBeouf becomes smitten.<br/><br/>There's a solid shock climax that was a bit of a surprise, something to elevate the film from a PG status to an R in just a few frames. Without spoiling the surprise, it's worth the wait. As far as remakes go, this one is pretty decent, doesn't stray from the core content, while every character counts in an economically well-paced plot that gains momentum toward a rousing finale. If you had to remake a classic film in contemporary style, this is a reasonable blueprint."
"paudie","7","2","4","12 August 2010"," By the number thriller but still worth watching
","There isn't much originality in ""Disturbia"" but it is pretty enjoyable for a by the numbers thriller.<br/><br/>Shia LaBoeuf plays a troubled teen whose father was killed in a road accident when the younger man was driving. He struggles to deal with this and after hitting a teacher at school he is sentenced to house arrest for three months during the summer holidays. If he strays more than a few yards from his house the sensor on his leg will alert the police. He mopes about the house for a while as his mother is out at work but then goes into ""Rear Window"" mode and starts observing what his neighbours are up to. Meanwhile on the news there are reports of a local woman gone missing.<br/><br/>He becomes even more interested in the neighbours when the hottest girl in all of Christendom moves in next door. This gives an excuse for some pretty prurient shots of her undressing and getting in and out of the pool. It's pretty clear that the movie is aimed at viewers the same age as our protagonist.<br/><br/>Predictably the sensor is no barrier to the hot girl becoming friends with him. Obviously she likes bad boys! She joins him in spying on the neighbours and they see the creepy man across the street moving what may be a body. He also drives the type of car mentioned in news reports about the missing woman!! You can see where this is going.<br/><br/>As the kids begin to investigate there are a few decent frights and suspenseful scenes but the ending doesn't hold any real surprises.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is the performances of LaBoeuf and Sara Roemer as the main investigating kids. They have good chemistry and play their bored but cool teenage characters quite well. David Morse is suitably creepy as the neighbour acting suspiciously and Carrie-Anne Moss makes a welcome appearance as LaBoeuf's mother.<br/><br/>An enjoyable thriller to rent on DVD if you fancy some thrills but don't want to test your brain too much."
"chucknorrisfacts","8","2","4","19 June 2010"," Not just a ""Rear Window"" knockoff!
","I am not a fan of remakes. By and large, I don't think they serve a purpose. If I wanted to watch the same movie over and over again I'd watch the original. I don't need to keep paying twelve bucks to see it ""re-imagined"". That being said, I wasn't too impressed when I saw the trailer for ""Disturbia"".<br/><br/>Though not technically a remake, I was all but ready to write it off as a ""Rear Window"" knockoff and, in truth, that's exactly what it is. However, it's a very good ""Rear Window"" knockoff. Now what surprised the hell out of me was when I ended up liking ""Disturbia"" better than the Hitchcock classic.<br/><br/>What made ""Disturbia"" better? Well, I think it comes down to sheer entertainment value. I was more entertained while watching ""Disturbia"" than I was while watching ""Rear Window"". Plain and simple.<br/><br/>I have a respect for classic films but they have an entirely different pacing than today's. ""Rear Window"" is a slow cooker, it takes a long time to build up the suspense but by the time it finally delivers, it's a case of ""too little too late"". ""Disturbia"" manages to keeps its audience entertained throughout and offsets the suspense with some very humorous moments while never losing sight of the type of movie it truly is, a thriller.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I'm not a fan of Shia LaBeouf. In fact, most of the time I can't stand the guy but he's actually pretty good here. So if I can watch this and like it as much as I did without liking the actor who plays the main character then anyone who either likes LaBeouf or is at least indifferent to him should have no problem enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd definitely have no problem telling anyone who hasn't seen this to check it out. For those who have seen it, I'd recommend watching it again. It's good!"

","LOL! A big laugh was what came out of my mouth when I saw the IMDb general users' rate to this movie (7/10), after watching it. How can a ""FAMOUS FIVE"" type of movie like this have such rate? In fact watching this I felt like watching a ""THE FAMOUS FIVE"" episode but with the difference that this one tries to be a real suspense movie! Well, it tries, but of course it fails, because everything looks so pathetic in this film! First, those ""kids"" are too old to play the ""FAMOUS FIVE"" kind of adventures (spying a psycho killer in the neighbourhood! What idea could be more childish and ""FAMOUS FIVE"" type than this??). Second, what kind of psycho killer tries to kill his victims in his home, at night, with the windows open, the lights open, and near the windows??! (I'm still thinking why he didn't come to the window and shout out loud: ""Hey neighbours! I'm killing someone, don't you want to see it??!). Hummm, thinking better I guess I found a kind of psycho killer that could do a thing like that: the psycho killer from a film like ""SCARY MOVIE""!!! Third, everything else looks so clichéd and boring: the predictable ""romance"" between the main characters; the figure of the psycho guy, so stereotyped and close to the figure of a ""bad guy""(!); his house (he also has the clichéd type of house that looks so small outside but it's so biiiiiiig inside and full of slashing rooms!); the pseudo-suspenseful scenes like that one in the basement when the main character was surrounded by floating bodies! Oh, so scary! Oh, so suspenseful! Why didn't anyone told me before it was a teenage movie trying to be a pseudo-suspenseful movie?! I wouldn't have spent two hours of my time with it!"

He becomes obsessed of unraveling the truth and in the end it becomes a matter of life and death.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an average film. It had cheesy moments and it was rather dumb.

The casting isn't amazing and i did get sorta annoyed with Sarah Roemer. Shia LaBeouf is amazing in this movie and i think its maybe his best acting role to date.

"gradyharp","8","2","4","9 August 2007"," High Tech Voyeurism Enhances a Good Thriller
","DISTURBIA is a fine little thriller of a movie. Though some viewers are commenting that it is merely a takeoff on REAR WINDOW and finding it not up to that caliber - and if that bothers potential viewers then be advised, for this viewer it is more a film that addresses our progressive invasion of privacy by high tech instruments, and as such the film makes an important statement. Writers Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth have produced a solid script that manages to capture teenage angst and view of the world and with director D.J. Caruso the story is propelled along with a hold-your-breath pace that makes for a very entertaining and scary movie! Kale (a very fine Shia LaBeouf) had a great relationship with his father (Matt Craven), but in a hideous auto accident Kale witnesses the death of his father, an event that disturbs him so greatly even a year later that he misbehaves in school and eventually is put under house arrest wearing an alarm bracelet on his ankle. Kale's mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) tries to cope with the 'incarcerated' Kale, but tires of his aimless wasting of time and energy. Out of boredom Kale stares out his windows with binoculars, observing the neighbors, not the least of which is an attractive young Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Kale's best friend Ronnie (a very promising Aaron Yoo) is Kale's only contact with the outside world and when the two boys spy on Ashley in her swimming pool, they together find more sophisticated means of voyeurism. And, once Ashley visits Kale the three join in spying on a strange neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), finding him similar to a media-described serial killer. From there the plot thickens and quickens as the threesome made dangerous discoveries and end up in an investigation of scary proportions.<br/><br/>The final fifteen minutes of the film are a bit over-the-top, but the rest of the movie is so well done that the ending can be forgiven. There are some fine cameo roles by Viola Davis as the detective in charge of Kale's house arrest, Jose Pablo Cantillo as officer who is stuck with responding to Kale's multiple infringements of his house arrest, among others. Shia LaBeouf is young in his craft but demonstrates a fine screen presence and a lot of polish: he carries the movie well. This is not a major film (though it did very well at the box office!), but is a surefire entertainment! Grady Harp"

","I've watched this movie on its opening weekend and I must say I loved it , because It's the kind of movie I always enjoy watching .<br/><br/>A teenager thriller with a lot of fun , suspense and even great performances .<br/><br/>A new star was born . Of course I'm talking about Shia LaBeouf , the young star of the year I think...<br/><br/>Shia said he doesn't know how it feels like for a star , but I think that he already knows that because the great success of both Disturbia and Transformers ( 380 million total in the USA box office ) ""transformed"" him in one of the most important actors this year and the new Dreamworks star ( Spielberg is directing him in his new Indiana Jones adventure , another assure success).<br/><br/>I must say too that I hired last weekend ""Bobby"" just because Elijah Wood and Lindsay Lohan are in the movie together ( I'm a huge fan of them) , but what I didn't know was that Shia were part of the cast too.<br/><br/>And I think that Cooper , his character , is the best in the movie(a young student who doesn't want to go to Vietnam and with a friend of his buys drugs to Ashton Kutcher's character ).<br/><br/>Elijah Wood , Lindsay Lohan and now Shia LaBeouf are the best young stars for me!!

","I was pretty excited to watch Disturbia. Actually, I just couldn't wait to watch it... and as I expected the movie ended up to be a great movie, appealing to the eye and very interesting. Shia Labeouf showed once more the great talent he possesses (such a talent that I've seen in many other movies he was in). I've seen a lot of horror movies and thrillers and with Disturbia I really jumped out of my chair! There were quite scary scenes and I really enjoyed it. The soundtrack is fabulous and it mixed perfectly with the scene. The only thing I disagree with is the ending. I think it could have been done in a different way, I mean, all that kissing makes us think that we have been watching a romantic comedy. Well, the movie had (in deed) some really funny scenes: like Ronnie and Kale's embarrassment because of Ashley's presence. I laughed a lot. I really enjoyed watching it and I gotta agree that it is definitely one of the best thrillers I've seen. And one more time I have to congratulate Shia Labeouf because he is on the good way to become one of the best actors ever, and for me he already is one of the best actors - it all because of the natural way that he speaks, the easy way that he makes us laugh and cry. Nice Movie. Big Movie!"
"ElmStreetsLastBrat","8","2","4","11 July 2007"," Very Good & Intense Thriller
","I was lucky enough to have gotten a chance to see this movie tonight at the $1 theater that I always go to on Wednesdays. My sister had wanted to see it because she's a huge fan of Shia LeBeouf and I had wanted to see it because it was a thriller. So were happy to hear that it was playing tonight and I'm so glad I was able to see it in the theater. It was very good. ""Disturbia"" involves a young man named Kale (Shia LeBeouf) who is in a devastating car accident that claims the life of his father. One year later while in class Kale punches out his Spanish teacher for making a negative comment about his father. Because of his actions he is placed on house arrest for three months. To occupy his time Kale uses his binoculars to spy on the neighbors. One night while looking out he sees his neighbor Mr. Turner (played with creepy finesse by David Morse) driving a car similar to the one that a local kidnapper/murderer drives and carrying a big blue bag with what looks like hair and blood all over it. After seeing that Kale is convinced that Mr. Turner is a serial killer. So Kale and his friend Ronnie (played by Aaron Yoo, who was hilarious) and this girl Ashley, who Kale had also been spying on, follow Mr. Turner and his actions and watch him through the binoculars and with a video camera to see if he is in fact a serial killer.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The only downfall it had, to me, was that it took quite a while to get to the suspense. The first half involved Kale getting to know Ashley and showing us how much he hates being on house arrest and finding things to do. But then the second half is when it started picking up and getting suspenseful. I enjoyed the second half better. This involves Mr. Turner finding out what Kale and his friends are up to and Mr. Turner kidnaps Kale's mother. Kale goes to Mr. Turner's house to find his mother and that's when Mr. Turner chases Kale and tries to kill him. That's when Kale finds out Mr. Turner's (many) secrets hidden within his house.<br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf was great as Kale. His eyes have a certain look about them; like when he is worried or scared you believe it. I thought he was an excellent choice for this role. And it was a very adult role for him too. Even though he is an adult, although a young one, this was a very mature role for him, especially with the mild violence that escalated towards the end. He gave a fine performance.<br/><br/>Aaron Yoo gave some comic relief to his role as Kale's friend Ronnie. Although I did think the comedy and some of the jokes were a little out of place for this film since it was a thriller and I felt that there were more laughs than screams, they were still funny and the whole theater was laughing. But it didn't make me like the movie any less. He was great in his role.<br/><br/>But David Morse was the ultimate creepy villain. Although he was a little underused in this film I felt, since we didn't get to see much of him. But every time he was on screen he was deliciously creepy and you just knew something terrible was going to happen when he showed up. And towards the end, he just kept popping up everywhere where you least expected it. He was an excellent choice for this role.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this film Disturbia. Sure, it's not one of the greatest movies ever made but it was definitely worth the time. Shia LeBeouf should star in more films like this. This film really showed off his acting abilities. I liked this film. Any fans of the genre should give it a view. The first half is a little slow, but the second half is much better and the most entertaining. Thanks for reading my review!"

","Watching this movie again last week reminded me of my middle school days. The flip phones, the camcorder, the hairstyle, and the skin tight flared jeans screamed early 2000's.

Every guy in my grade wanted to be him because of the ladies he was paired with.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a decent 7-stars because the plot kept me hooked yet I wasn't keen on Sarah Roemer's acting. I felt that she was quite bland and boring and could easily have done the story without her. Obviously, in those days, one needed a love storyline to balance out the suspense. Another reason I deducted points was the scene *spoiler* where Kale (LaBeouf) was screaming after finding a shocking discovery on his friend's camcorder.

","Shia probably has movies with more depth to them but Disturbia is my favorite because it's just so much fun. 2007 was a great year for me and Disturbia was just one of those movies that stuck with me from that year. Shia then was part of the 'New Hollywood'. Rubbing elbows with titans like Spielberg and in a lot of fun movies with stars like Megan Fox in Transformers. I also liked the second Wall St. Obviously it can never touch the original but Shia had enough charisma to carry the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway Disturbia is a great fun movie. It got a playful feel to it. A teen who after a big tragedy gets into trouble, and is ordered by a judge to stay indoors. Sounds familiar? On a second viewing now during the pandemic the movie has a completely different feel to it. Bored being ' quarantined' he watches what goes on in his neighborhood from his window. His realm being a comfortable, classic American dream suburbia. I actually love the suburbia vibes. It's one of the big charms of the movie.<br/><br/>Kale falls in love with his new neighbor. The beautiful Sarah Roemer who I had a huge crush on when I watched this movie. After this movie I hoped to see more of her but unfortunately she wasn't involved in many projects after this movie. Sarah being drop dead gorgeous and charismatic certainly helped me root for Shia's character to win her heart. I thought this was actually my favorite aspect of the movie. Even though it isn't labeled as a romance movie, romance plays a huge part. And it got one particularly great scene that is very memorable and wonderfully directed by D.J. Caruso.<br/><br/>The suspense in the movie was also great. It's very well paced and keeps you engaged. In between all the antics there's something strange going on. A mystery that must be solved.

Here you have a teen who's extremely relatable for teens, but also very likeable. There's an argument throughout that he's the guy in the wrong for spying out his window, but the film does well in illustrating that he's the good guy to root for.
This makes for a very interesting thriller.

Too much support storylines take away from the core elephant in the room. This could've been much better had they focused more on the mystery at hand."

","Disturbia is a very likeable horror movie which contains Shia LaBeoulf's best ever performance. Its a silly concept, but its original and although full of cliches the suspense is well built. Its a movie I've seen on a few occasions and still provides some solid entertainment. The ending does go back on itself in terms of potent slow build up but in another sense it does reach a dramatic climax which is quite satisfying. Its a tidy, smart and well acted affair which can be enjoyed by a wide audience."

","The girl friend in this desecration of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is Sarah Roemer whose character is named ""Ashley"", as it should be. She's a knockout ex-model, along the lines of Gwyneth Paltrow but without the magnetism or talent. She has deliciously narrow shoulders and seems to hunch them up and hold them back, as if someone had told her it makes her look slinky and sexy, which it does. What a flawless figure. Yum.<br/><br/>And Shia LaBeouf, of unprepossessing appearance, does surprisingly well in the James Stewart role of the housebound peeper. I'd only seen LaBeouf in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls,"" or whatever that miscarriage was called, and he was a blank.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most compelling performance is given by Viola Davis in the small role of the police officer who puts one of those home-arrest anklets on LaBeouf. She's a marvelous actress.<br/><br/>The writers have taken ""Rear Window"", pumped the story full of adrenalin and various psychedelic substances, and turned it into a comedy thriller about teens. In the original, James Stewart suspected one of his neighbors of murdering his irritating wife. Here, David Morse, older and throatier, is a serial killer who hides rotting bodies all over his house. Of course, no one believes LaBeouf or, after she's convinced, Roemer either. They have an Asian sidekick, Aaron Yoo, who adds comedy and suspense to some scenes.<br/><br/>I won't bother describing the whole plot. Parts of the narrative are idiotic, beneath imagining. A madman is stalking you in your house, carrying a lethal baseball bat, so you escape from him -- after a scene reminiscent of Nicholson's ""Here's JOHNNY"" -- and you run into the murderer's house, searching for your mother, who may or may not be there. The basement of his house turns into a terrifying milieu out of H. P. Lovecraft, with dark sub-basements and pools of decomposing corpses, so the hero can fall into them and scream.<br/><br/>I'd better be careful because I don't want to give away the ending, in which LaBeouf kills the lunatic and saves himself, his mother, his girl friend, and the Oriental gentleman.<br/><br/>It's a surprising climax though. Pardon me, but isn't the dead killer supposed to explosively spring back to life? I can't imagine how the writers and directors skipped that cliché. They make up for it by using so many others -- the hand reached in from off screen and touching the hero's shoulder, accompanied by a loud electronic WHAM on the sound track. (Twice.) And the spastic movements of the camera during action scenes, making it almost impossible to grasp what's happening.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it for what it was -- cinematic treif."
"hnt_dnl","9","0","0","7 June 2015"," Suspenseful, entertaining modern take on 'Rear Window'!
","I must be one of the few people on the planet that thinks of Shia LaBeouf as a fine actor! There's something unique, different, and engaging about the way he plays his roles. On the surface, he seems like he's always playing the manic, fast-talking rebellious youth who loves for trouble and danger, but in each of his key roles in the late 00s, I find something different in each characterization he played. The first thing I saw LaBeouf in was the entertaining golf flick 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' in 2005 and he was wonderful in that. And his manic energy was the one of the actual plusses for Michael Bay's otherwise empty-headed 'Transformers' flicks in '07 and '09! He was also persuasive in 'Eagle Eye' in '08. Right in the middle of all of this might be my actual to-date favorite role- performance that LaBeouf has given in this film I'm reviewing DISTURBIA (2007).<br/><br/>'Disturbia' is an interesting, suspenseful, well-done modern take on Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic 'Rear Window'. The protagonist is Kale (superbly played by LaBeouf), a high-schooler who we meet in an endearing opening scene of him fishing with his Dad (played by the always reliable Matt Craven). On their way back home, Kale and his father get into a tragic accident where the father dies and then the plot of the film starts 1 year later with Kale a troubled teen having committed petty crimes acting out after losing his Dad. It's almost summer and during the final week of the school year, Kale attacks his Spanish teacher after being provoked and is put under house arrest for 3 months. <br/><br/>Soon after, we meet Kale's mother Julie (understatedly played by the reliable Carrie Ann Moss), who tries to instill a sense of discipline in Kale, and Kale's best friend Ronnie (engagingly played by scene-stealer Aaron Yoo), who is Kale's ""partner in crime"" throughout the rest of the film. Viola Davis shows up in a nice cameo role as the probation officer assigned to give Kale his ankle bracelet that he must wear all summer, as he's confined to his home. As the days pass, Kale gets bored, but brightens up quickly as one day going through his daily routine of spying on his neighbors through telescope and binoculars, he sees that a couple of new neighbors have come to town. One is the next-door family with a beautiful daughter Ashley (solidly played by the stunning Sarah Roemer, somewhat of a Kate Hudson lookalike if Kate Hudson were actually attractive!). The other is the across-the- street neighbor Mr. Turner (excellently performed by the great veteran David Morse in arguably his creepiest film role). Kale and Ashley develop an attraction/connection as both come from broken homes and bond. <br/><br/>Kale through his spying notices that Turner seems to be a shady figure. One night, Kale witnesses Turner has an argument with one of his dates and then later he and Ashley see him carrying a bloody bag from his house. So the trio Kale, Ashley, Ronnie snoop even more into it and things get out of control fast. <br/><br/>The homage to Rear Window totally works, but mainly because the film takes only the general elements of the protagonist forced to stay at home, the beautiful girlfriend, the wisecracking sidekick, and the suspicious neighbor, but tweaking and twisting it to be more favorable to the modern viewer. 'Rear Window' is actually not among my favorite Hitchcock movies, so I found this take on it a refreshing alternative. The film gives the hero more depth as we sympathize with Kale's losing his Dad. It also is refreshing to see teenage characters like Kale, Ashley, and Ronnie that have believable personalities and resourcefulness that feels organic and not some writer's daydream of what they THINK teenagers are like.<br/><br/>Mainly, though, I loved the performances of LaBeouf, who knows how to carry a film for such a young actor, and Morse, who's got the creepy factor down to perfection. Their protagonist-antagonist dynamic is enjoyable. The film is just about the right length and the plot moves at a brisk pace. An entertaining update of a classic film!"

","Disturbia (2007): Dir: D.J. Caruso / Cast: Shia LaBeouff, David Morse, Sarah Roemer, Carrie-Anne Moss, Aaron Yoo: Exploitation take on that dark area of the brain that conjures up such crap as this. Shia LaBeouff plays a teenager under house arrest after punching a teacher. While gazing through binoculars he believes a neighbour is responsible for a series of murders. Starts out fine until burdened under formula. Director D.J. Caruso does his best making the location fun but this is hardly an improvement for a director famous for Taking Lives. As for the cast, only LaBeouff seems remotely three dimensional. With his house arrest situation he is at least given a decent background. He has fun as he spies on his neighbour and makes observations. On the other hand, David Morse is wasted as a typical slasher film villain who, with his talent, should have been more interesting. Sarah Roemer plays a new neighbour as an intended sex symbol. Her role has all the personality of a box of tampons. Carrie-Anne Moss is also wasted as LaBeouff's mother. Aaron Yoo plays the cardboard role of LsBeouff's best friend and it pretty much ends there with the contribution. For superior viewing see Rear Window, which is far more compelling, or the vampire film Fright Night, which has similar themes and still a better film. Both films are worth the double bill as oppose to viewing this crap once. Score: 4 ½ / 10"
"DomNickson843","Null","0","0","23 April 2015"," mediocre slasher film!
","Spoiler Alert! Two quarters of the movie after Shia beats his teacher up is actually quite boring and just really uninteresting. I mean I don't really care about the character being under house arrest because he's lucky not to be in prison. I also didn't really connect with Shia's character all that much. The only character I really actually liked was Ronnie because I found him funny but occasionally annoying. I didn't really care about the girl because she was a bit random and a typical teenage girl. If I were her I'd think Ronnie was better to be with than Shia who's under house arrest. Anyway, The only other part that really made me like this film was the entire second half of the film where they get more into this Mr. Turner character. I mean after all the movie should of been more about him from the start right? But when he is focused on, you get hooked immediately! Anyway I give it a 5 out of 10 it's way better than I know what you did last summer and a little better than Valentine. Valentine seemed for focused on the creative kills then the actual story line this movie how ever is the direct opposite. The kills in this movie are weak and slasher films should have at least some creative kills, that's why it's a 5 out of 10."

Where I found that the movie really suffers is with the ending. It's a fairly goofy ending that really doesn't try anything new, which is unfortunate. This is a movie that's perfect for teens, or almost teens that want something of a horror thriller because this material will be fresher for them.

"elshikh4","Null","0","0","19 February 2010"," My First Time to Cheer On The Evil Guy !
","It's not the worst movie ever made. It's one of the worst movies ever made. And I have my reasons.<br/><br/>Original: This is Rear Window meets Columbo meets MacGyver meets Mission Impossible meets Poltergeist meets American Beauty meets Dracula (I hoped for Dracula to come soon and get rid of the 3 leads!).<br/><br/>Cleverly acted: (Aaron Yoo) as (Ronnie) was the gayest portrayal for non-gay person in the history of cinema. Let alone how this human was a complete BAD JOKE; from the terrible actor he is, to the worst sidekick he did!<br/><br/>""She's Alive, She's Alive!"": (Sarah Roemer) doesn't have the talent; I can stand the electric chair, but not her again. And she doesn't have the spirit; she oozes silliness all the way. So her appearances were truly hurting my soul. I don't know how anybody in the world may fall for her like that?!<br/><br/>Emotional: The monologue that (Shia LaBeouf) says about the things that he loves about his girl was absolute A-level nonsense from start to finish. Something was deeply wrong in the acting, in the directing, in the writing, or with the 3 of them. For instance, both of the actors don't know how to act or to convince, the directing was extremely low, and the ""How am I?"" line was super provocative!<br/><br/>Suspenseful, Logical and Unpredictable: What a clumsy script. The whole thing was nothing but empty circle that hands in to another. The word ""thriller"" just doesn't apply to most of the events. And the rest has some of the most dumb, unexplained and weak events; aside from full video security system and such an expensive other devices, (Shia LaBeouf) got the blueprints of his neighbor's house before and after the modifications? (maybe he's an underage undercover CIA agent!), his desperately dullard friend loses his cell phone then brings it back just like that? (Maybe he's a magician!), the killer lost it and wanted it to kill them all (how to hide all of this mess?!), (LaBeouf) finds a wig in (David Morse)'s flat, then whispers terrified: ""The girl never left!"", so did (Morse) get to wear a long wig and a woman dress, faking his victim's leaving?? (Well, I couldn't care less!), and finally here's this guy, killing half of the city's women, living in the same city, while having the same suspected, so rare, car, and nobody ever doubted him?? (maybe he's a character in a bad Hollywood movie!). Just forget all of that, and think mainly how this movie made it so impossible for us to guess who the killer was!<br/><br/>Fast-Paced: The shoddy dealing with the lead's flat, the awfulness of the acting, and the ACTORS, the easiness of the story, then the repellent *unbelievable* romantic story within the main story, all of that destroyed the movie's character as a thriller, and created a pure sense of bore. To tell you the truth, for ¾ of the movie, I felt the tedium as a train coming out of the screen to hit me. After the Action Thriller, the Horror Thriller, and the Psychological Thriller, (Disturbia) puts a new kind of thriller indeed; The Boring Thriller!<br/><br/>Thoughtful: Why not to make a better twist at the end? Say, for instance, that these guys were after the wrong neighbor all along. Say, for another, that they'd be all proved wrong at the end; being deluded by their incredibly empty time, paranoid and dull to the extent of imagining a fake tale about their beloved neighbor, where there was no killer in this suburbia at all. That would have been more suitable, or at least less predictable than the idiocy that I watched where the lead kills the killer and wins the girl. By the way, I'm so sure that the audience applauded crazily in the theaters by that moment, not out of being happy that the good won, but because they would finally go home!<br/><br/>Disappointing: I wished all the time that these guys go to jail, be killed,.. etc. but no such luck. I was cheering up the evil guy to finish them, but he was that feeble to get beaten and by the hands of (Shia LaBeouf)!<br/><br/>Any Good?: I won't forgive myself for this, but the best things about this movie were its first 15 minutes, the shot in which the lead and Gwyneth Paltrow's younger unbearable sister jumped from a roof to a swimming pool, and the fact that I didn't watch it in cinema; I know that it could have had small shocks there, with the Dolby sound effects and music. But of course, after experiencing it only on TV, I feel SO LUCKYYYYYYYYYY!<br/><br/>Forever!: (Steven Spielberg) believes in (LaBeouf) as great upcoming star. According to what I watched for him so far, I don't. So why we had to be tortured in the way?!! While (Spielberg), as the executive producer of this trash, loves a line from it that says: ""Operation Stupid is officially over"", sorrowfully a lot of innocent people will run into this movie on TV or else, to suffer watching it again; so the bigger ""Operation Stupid"" won't be officially over. However, and thank God, it is for me!<br/><br/>Finally a Question: Does the lead's friend (Ronnie) die? OK. I think it can be figured out that he really died since they were celebrating at the end!"

","Far more compelling than is to be reasonably expected of such teen-friendly PG13 thrillers. Of course, it lacks the wit and finesse of the original 'Rear Window', but in all honesty, 'Disturbia' really isn't trying to be a remake; it just steals the basic premise. The leads are all excellent  David Morse does his quietly chilling thing and LaBeouf really surprises with a far more complex performance than we've come to expect from such genre fodder. Sarah Roehmer is clearly the weakest link, struggling to bring any level of depth or realism to her character.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Christopher Landon is packed with inexplicable and gaping plot holes  why is Kale's mother, a realtor, never at home at night? Where did all the party goers vanish to? Why did the police never check the VIN number on the neighbor's car? But such holes rarely get in the way of Caruso's expert handling of the mounting tension. As is the way with promising horror/thrillers of late, however, (remember 'Vacancy'?), a solid and suspenseful film morphs into a lazy and generic slasher movie in the final act.<br/><br/>For those with an interest in such things, special note should be made of Tom Southwell, who spent the better part of twenty years as an illustrator on such movies as 'Blade Runner', 'Goonies', and 'Mission: Impossible', and here creates a beautifully detailed Craftsman home that acts as the primary location of the much of the action."

","SPOILERS CONTAINED THEREIN: <br/><br/>I usually avoid teen themed movies like the plague, but seeing how I heard this movie compared to The 'Burbs with Tom Hanks (only not a comedy) I had to at least check it out. It started off great, building the audiences care for Kale and his father, and then abruptly killing his father. Kale becomes a recluse, and attacks his teacher when the man mentions his father, which I believe was a completely justified action given Kale's strong connection with his father and presence when he was dead... The end of the death scene proved forever and all time Shia's acting skill, because when he sees his dad's dead body his expression conveys the fact that he's dead with no need to show the body at all, that takes skill...<br/><br/>Short hand, Kale spies on people, one particularly hot chick is his focus for a while, but later he turns into a sleuth trying to catch a killer Kale is a nonconformist, that fact likely added to my liking the film...<br/><br/>But the biggest factor was the lack of ANY LAME PLOT TWISTS... This movie stuck to some standard conventions that work, sure the movie has plenty wrong with it, but for once I didn't have to worry about whodunnit or if Kale was actually crazy... straight-forward, and that actually added to the suspense...<br/><br/>So one hot chick and a murder mystery later I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the film, it was very effective..."

","This movie was recommended to me by a few friends, so I decided to watch the DVD the other night. I probably had better thought up something else to do because this movie isn't really that good. Contrary to the start of the movie, which is very promising and constructive, the ending lacks all credibility and becomes very predictable. This movie has the potential to become a tense psychological thriller, but it just never gets hold of you, the main characters are too overdone to get familiar with and the camera's bad, really, don't expect many 'shocking' parts, because there aren't any. Watching this movie I never came to a point where I was on the edge of my seat, really anxious to know the true nature of Robert Turner. The answer to that last question is thrown in way to early in my opinion and from that point on, the movie goes on in a rampage that doesn't do it any good. Enjoyable for a night at best. Definitely not worth watching more than once."

"shady402","7","0","0","29 September 2007"," Surprisingly enjoyable...
","This film has received some very mixed reviews but I've just got back from seeing it and enjoyed it. <br/><br/>It has a gripping opening, is full of tension and suspense, has well developed characters that you actually care for and features some action-packed, nail-biting scenes towards the end. I guess the only thing I can fault with this film is how predictable it is as I knew exactly how it would pan out just from watching the trailer and that is exactly what happened. I don't think it's a bad thing at all though as in an age where horror films are full of twists and turns, it's actually refreshing to see a straight-forward yet effective film that delivers.<br/><br/>Some say that it rips off 'Rear Window' but I personally consider it to be a modernisation of Hitchcock's classic. It should not be forgotten that Hitchcock's film was made in 1954 so modern audiences (unless they're avid Hitchcock fans) will be unaware of it. So is it not a good thing that 'Disturbia' has been made as whenever the film is mentioned, 'Rear Window' also gets mentioned so it sheds light on a great film that modern audiences may not have looked up otherwise..? <br/><br/>Overall, 'Disturbia' is a simple yet effective little thriller."
"3xHCCH","6","0","0","13 September 2007"," Thriller Plus Teenage Angst
","The prologue scene before the opening credits really gave me quite a jolt! Turns out that that smashing scene sort of just sets up the personality of the lead character Kale played by Shia LaBeouf. <br/><br/>He socks his Spanish teacher one day and gets put under house arrest. I am the type who might even enjoy this type of confinement. But apparently Kale most definitely isn't. He gets very restless on the very first day since his X-Box and Online activities were curtailed. In addition, he gets sassy with his mom, who gets even by cutting off the plug of his TV. Bereft of things to do, he starts looking out his windows, into the lives of his next-door neighbors. He gets very excited with pretty and tone Ashley, who just so happened to just move in with her family. However, the suspense comes in when he notices very strange goings-on with his other neighbor Mr. Turner. Is he involved with a series of missing women? <br/><br/>As far as the actors, I see Shia as a young John Cusack, with a sad-sack charm about him. I just have to say that this guy is lucky to be able to romance gorgeous Megan Fox in ""Transformers"", and now the beautiful and sexy Sarah Roemer in this movie. I just felt his room was too over-the-top messy. I couldn't be THAT bad! I totally failed to recognize Carrie Anne Moss as Kale's mom! David Morse, on the other hand, is really getting the hang of playing these creepy characters. I certainly have seen him in other movies with characters like Mr. Turner. For the Asian best friend Ronnie, he just had to totally be geeky. What a stereotype! For his credit, actor Aaron Woo did quite well in this obnoxious role.<br/><br/>This is teen angst meets ""Rear Window."" There were really scenes that bring you to the edge of your seats. The scene of Mr. Turner and Ashley in the car is classic creepy. Same with the ""Blair Witch""-style camera work when Ronnie breaks into Mr. Turner's garage and house. Exciting! The angst scenes however did not really sit well with me. I think they are way overblown.<br/><br/>Just OK with me overall. I would not call it a waste of time. Some tense and exciting suspense scenes that make it worthwhile to catch in theaters."

","great film, very tense and at times you don't want to look! very good characters and very well acted. It is really entertaining and is fairly surprising in its intensity towards the end. The way it unashamedly runs the action alongside an old fashioned love story is refreshing, and reminiscent of classic suburban thrillers of the 80s and 90s. The script is also very good and it is not just the fear of the antagonist that creates tension, as the social tension and atmosphere between the two main characters also at times has you cringing. I would recommend going to see this film. It wont change your life but Its great fun, a good ride and will be an hour and a half well spent."
"Vhalor","8","0","0","3 September 2007"," An enjoyable film that could have been better.
","Firstly, Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite movies, however it is important not to compare this to that classic. Remakes are often less impressive than the originals because you know what's coming and because older films relied much more on acting as opposed to present day films which tend to rely on special effects, violence and sex.<br/><br/>That aside, this film was overall a fairly enjoyable film to watch. My one major complaint for this one is that it wrapped up too quickly. By the time we have this guy getting accused of killing people, he's shoving the mother's head into the door and coming to the main character's house and slamming people's heads in with a bat.<br/><br/>I think the film could really have been improved by letting the suspicions and tensions run a little longer. It seemed like we found out that he really was the killer too soon.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I thought this was a fun film to watch mixed with some funny moments. It's worth watching."
"jemps918","8","0","0","27 August 2007"," a hip homage to Rear Window
","Disturbia is an updated, teen version of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller Rear Window.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf (Transformers, I Robot) is Kale, who is placed under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher for a barbed comment about his father, whom Kale lost in an accident. His mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss, The Matrix, Memento) is frustrated, trying to find out how to keep her rebellious son at bay. Moss is underutilized but her subtle, loaded acting is effective (I've associated her so much as Trinity in The Matrix that I keep expecting her to morph into something other than the hapless housewife she plays).<br/><br/>Good thing Kale's best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) can be relied on for comic relief and indulges Kale's voyeuristic exploits (no iPod, no TV, no PC; what's a boy to do?).<br/><br/>Their fave neighbor to spy on is new girl-next-door Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Perpetually bored and longing for some summer action, she teams up with the boys as they play stakeout in Kale's room, trying to get to the bottom of what Kale insists is murder by Kale's neighbor Mr. Turner (played chillingly by David Morse).<br/><br/>The dialogue is painfully earnest and realistic despite the outrageous situation. The members of the cast are likable and turned in strong performances (especially LaBeouf). Disturbia works because it involves its audience and is refreshingly sincere in its delivery. It unravels like a hip homage to Rear Window and doesn't try too hard to be liked, despite being mainstream in execution."
"patrickvivalo","6","0","0","27 August 2007"," too predictable.......
","First things first, Disturbia was not one of the must intense thriller's of the decade. No doubt Shia LeBouf is on his way to stardom, but even he couldn't save this movies predictable plot. My problem with this movie is almost like every other modern day ""thriller/horror"" movie. It took way too long to get good, I understand character development as well as having a general plot. But damn, was this a love story with a crazy murderer for a neighbor or was this supposed to keep me on the edge of my seat for the whole hour & a half? I was hoping for a twist, a turn or something shocking. After discovering that his neighbor moved from Texas & the murderer on the news was from Texas, Shia becomes obsessed with watching this guys every move. You spend the whole time wondering if this suspicious creepy neighbor is in fact the murderer from the news & wow it is! The last 20 minutes was cool but the previous hour was not worth siting through just to get to that point. Again, not taking away from Shia's acting, but dude if you want to be taken as a serious actor & be the next big thing you should pick your scripts a bit better."

","Disturbia is an interesting film, most definitely based, as others have commented, on the very superior Hitchcock film, Rear Window, which is highly recommended.<br/><br/>What distinguishes this film from other remakes is an excellent lead performance by LaBeouf (as Kale) and good support from the generally excellent David Morse as the villain (written as Mr. Turner in the script) as well as Aaron Yoo, in the 'best friend' comic relief role. Unfortunately, Carrie Ann Moss is underused. The movie is ruined by the last section. Rather than the apparently methodical and reasoned rationale for his character that we have viewed so far, Turner (Morse's character) becomes reckless and openly homicidal, going after a cop, and the entire set of neighbors (without any thought given to the ramifications of these acts  for example, that there would be a police incident report, with the same self officer involved, listing his name and address on the report). This same section is ruined by the overly elaborate secret room, within a secret room, with a basement literally flooded with dead bodies (as if Turner has been carting them around from all his previous crime scenes). It particularly is annoying because the bodies in the water scene look very intact, which would apparently diminish the need for the surgical room (other than the fact that all of this probably provides the audience with a good fright). All of this exposition and character development is highly reckless and not in character with the way Turner is represented, both in his earlier crime spree, where he apparently eluded the authorities undetected, and with the way Morse portrayed Turner at the hardware store, with Kale's mother at the grocery store, and with the earlier police incident and the deer.<br/><br/>Finally, no explanation is given for either the cause or the actual two instances of priors that lead to the slugging of the Spanish teacher to be a third. In fact, the only real need for this in the script is to justify the entire set-up: the death of the father leads to the punch = house arrest, because of the two unexplained priors. Kale is otherwise a very normal, albeit bright and perhaps unchallenged teenager, not some gang member or somehow economically disadvantaged youth who-must-steal, or misunderstood young man who-must-fight. As with Turner's ability early on to be at the wrong place at the right time (in the world's largest parking garage to a very small looking hardware store and at the grocery store to meet Kale's mother), these plot points exist because the screen writers couldn't find a way to otherwise explain something needed to move the story forward.<br/><br/>This is a very polished, largely well-acted and well made movie, that might have gotten a higher rating with more imagination and plotting in the script, as well as some direction to take into account these elements and attempt to minimize them."

","Philip Wagner editor of the literary magazine ICONOCLAST quotes Ezra Pound for the proposition that literature should say something new and different.

Change the reason for remaining indoors from a broken leg to house arrest, add a cute girl in a skimpy swim suit and make the murderer a psychotic mass murderer who does not particularly hide his victim's bodies but rather keeps them for trophies and there you have disturbia.<br/><br/>David Morse of St Elsewhere fame departs his usual good guy image to play Mr. Turner, the superficially but persuasively reasonable neighbor. Morse's performance was eloquent by comparison to the flat and tinny lead.<br/><br/>Jose Pablo Cantillo plays the cameo role of a minor character Officer Gutierrez with great skill and bearing.<br/><br/>The performance of Jose Pablo Cantillo and David Morse saved the film from a lower rating."

","This movie could not have come at a better time, with summer just around the corner and all. I have to say, the previews do not do it justice.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is Kale, a teenager living a normal life in the 'burbs until something happens that pretty much changes everything for him. Eventually placed under house arrest, Kale's only real way to pass the time is watching his neighbors through his bedroom windows. But two neighbors peek his interest more than any other: a beautiful girl (terrific performance from Sarah Roemer) who has just moved in next door, and another neighbor...a man (David Morse) who Kale thinks may be a killer. Aaron Yoo also stars as Kale's friend, Ronnie, and his acting is memorable.<br/><br/>Disturbia superbly captures the essence of teenage life during summertime: boredom, teenage hormones, curiosity, adventure, making new friends, and of course, the obligatory summer romance that is expected. It is like two different movies rolled into one. I like the first half better, but it is still awesome on the whole. There are few contrivances, and they are easy to shrug off. LaBeouf is clearly the star here, and he shines. Director DJ Caruso (The Salton Sea) got it right. This is the best ""teen summer movie"" I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>See the movie."

","There have been inevitable comparisons to Hitchcock's Rear Window, and there are those who call Disturbia a rip off of the Hitchcock classic.

If I were to compare the two, I think Rear Window is a masterpiece, but I liked this very much and feel that it may perhaps appeal more to some.<br/><br/>I do think though Disturbia does have a slow start with not a lot standing out really. However when it gets going, it does get very suspenseful and the rest up to the exciting finale is an entertaining mix of suspense, thrills, mystery and comedy. The story may have its predictable twists and turns and the odd crack but overall it is entertaining and slow start aside well-structured and slickly paced.<br/><br/>Visually Disturbia is stylish, with some nice shots and lighting which add to the atmosphere and great sets and location shooting, the direction is taut and the dialogue is on the whole witty. The acting is fine, Shia LaBoeuf and Sara Roehmmer are likable in the lead roles and show a good chemistry. Carrie Ann-Moss is also good, though I would have liked to have seen more of her, but David Morse in a shy, quiet yet altogether sinister performance is the one who steals the show.<br/><br/>Overall, a stylish and well done film and worth the watch. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

You're not a voyeur if you look through your window and it is possible that you'll find some strange things about your neighbors; things you don't notice every day. 2) Director D.J. Caruso managed to make a good movie on direction part. His camera angels are solid and the use of normal camera that is given to the characters is great, but it's not very original. 3) Acting of Shia LaBeouf is absolutely for praise. Shia confirmed that he could turn out to be a good actor. 4) ""Disturbia"" is not a bad movie but since I watched so many very similar movies this one will not leave any tail as great thriller in my memory. But this is movie that you can easily watch and it isn't good but it also is not that bad. And one thing; this is not horror thriller, because there is nothing scary in it. If you were afraid, you are either juvenile or person who can easily be scared.<br/><br/>Bad sides: 1) The whole movie reminds me on few other movies like ""Rear Window"" and especially ""The Shining"". Why must the villain in this movie try to enter through the doors like Jack Nicholson? 2) After solid beginning this movie starts to sink when we realize that there is killer involved here. All the scenes from the moment Julie Brecht enters the house of Robert Turner are a bit stupid to me. Let me tell you why. We are presented with normal characters here and also they are very human; they do what normal people do in every situation. But do you have a killer next door? 3) The ending. I don't like it. Ronnie is hit with metal baseball bat and he is OK. Kale managed to beat a man who killed at least 10 people and of course our main characters lived happily ever after.

","I expected better of Disturbia - in fact, the title, a clever portmanteau of disturb and suburbia, consciously evokes a Richard Linklater production, or perhaps a cool and edgy movie with pseudo-indie credentials. But this is mainstream Hollywood we're talking about and will they ever learn? There are so many things wrong with this film, it's difficult to start. <br/><br/>The protagonist Kale is a deeply unsympathetic character, and any empathy the audience might have with him is thrown out of the window when he punches a Spanish teacher and shows little remorse. So why bother? How can we identify with a spoilt WASP brat? In addition, his mother played by Carrie Ann Moss is cruelly wasted in this film as his his nubile co-star, Sarah Roemer,who just doesn't get enough to do, except drool, pout and swim in her pool. But hey. that's enough to satisfy the film's target audience - teenage boys. The token Asian friend is just that - there to foil Kale's grip on the film and become the predictable, zany and clichéd character expected.<br/><br/>The acting is also incredibly awful with the exception of David Morse as the baddie who is genuinely scary and disturbing in his understated lines. Shia LaBeouf (wtf is that name?) enjoys hamming it up as Kale but it becomes tireseome after 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Mood-wise, Disturbia cannot decide what it is. It wants to be new Hollywood cool but is too Hollywood to make that leap. What starts as a genuinely disturbing film about voyeurism soon falls apart and becomes a so-so Hollywood Horror theme park ride. There are plenty of shocks and jumps but precious little else in the final; 20 minutes. The comic elements also sit uneasily with the rest of the film's dark nature.<br/><br/>The end was just a cop-out and that's the biggest pity. When you pander to test audiences and demographics this is what you get. A film that is more about marketing than film itself."

While David Morse brought some adult weight and the last fifteen minutes of the movie were suspenseful, I was disappointed, to say the least. Shia was so riveting in The Greatest Game Ever Played, but here, he was upstaged by Aaron Yoo who played his best friend. Shia seemed a supreme unlikeable geek, not a cool teen acting out because of emotional trauma. There is no chemistry between him and Sarah Roemer and her role is unnecessary, as Morse, Yoo and Carrie-Ann Moss create the tension. Although I'm not a suspense lover, the edge-of-your-seat scenes near the end were very well done, and Shia showed what I expected of him--but it was too short and too far into the movie to bring up my vote."

","Other viewers may disagree, but Disturbia is a wonderful teen thriller that, more often than not, borrows the basis of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (with elements of The Silence of the Lambs) and expands on it.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is Kale, a young high-schooler on house arrest, after popping his Spanish teacher, who made a rude remark about the teen's late father.<br/><br/>Definitely not handling the ankle-bracelet-thingie as gracefully as Martha Stewart did, Kale comically begins to go stir-crazy in the confines of his house.<br/><br/>When new neighbors move in next door, Kale becomes interested in the lovely young Ashley, nicely portrayed by Sarah Roemer.<br/><br/>Kale begins to watch her every move (from the lonely confines of his house) and also begins to take in the abnormal-normal routines of his neighborhood (hence the title).<br/><br/>Aaron Yoo wonderfully plays Kale's computer geek buddy Ronnie with a wonderful ease and naturalness; seeing him and LaBeouf work off each other is a treat (and doesn't feel one bit phony). Soon, the two of them have Ashley in Kale's upstairs lair, observing the neighbors.<br/><br/>And it's not long when one character really starts their suspicions: the subtly creepy Mr. Turner, played with ease by David Morse (Brutal in The Green Mile) Mr. Morse's turn gives oomph! to this snake-in-the-grass, and it's this addition that makes the similarities to Rear Window kick in.<br/><br/>Of more, I cannot say, except that Kale has a few run-ins with the police (the ankle-bracelet works!) and unwittingly plays into the villain's hands when his emotions get the better of him, before the conclusion of this enjoyable film.<br/><br/>I'll definitely be buying this one on DVD when it is finally released."

","I saw it last night, and as far as these sorts of movies go it wasn't bad. It was quite sweet and funny in parts and had a few moments that weren't completely obvious and clichéd. Of course then there was the rest of it. The acting was good, but the one thing i could NOT get past was the boom in the top of the frame! It's basically a main star at the beginning of the film, then it makes a comeback toward the end! How hard is it to find some footage where you can't see the boom in the shot? it was ridiculous and quite put me off. It was like i was watching an amateur film! Re-shoot or re-edit. And fire the boom operator!"

","Going into this movie I figured it was just the same stuff Hollywood puts out nowadays with mediocre acting and shallow plot lines. Although obviously this movie is a lot like Rear Window I don't think thats a bad thing. The acting was great, especially by David Morse. His performance was great. Most movies I have seen him in, like The Green Mile, his character was much different but he tackled this role and really had me believing he was a serial killer. The rest of the cast was a surprise as well, when I think Shia LaBeouf, I think Even Stevens. He played a great role though, and I enjoyed the witty comments. It was great. Nice Movie."

","I admit it whole-heartedly, I am a Shia LaBouff fan and really expected a lot out of this film because I knew he was cast in it. But I was surprised at the depth and drama this film involved. It's true, this was mainly a teen flick of a more sophisticated kind, but it was honestly a drama until the last forty-five minutes.<br/><br/>What surprised me most was the honesty this film portrayed of the characters. Shia, of course, was the noble leader in that case but the usual elements of a teen thriller (sex, drugs, and guns) were all but nonexistent. The honesty of how hurt Shia was about his father's death, the honesty of how he truly despised his lack of control, and the honesty of the fact that he watched this girl from his window, although that truth isn't confessed immediately, was amazing.<br/><br/>There's a deeper level here that many teen films try to include but really lack because they try to pack every spare reel of film with blood and gore. Not to say this film was lacking thrills by any means. By the time I left the theater I had laughed, cried, screamed, jumped, closed my eyes ten times and felt my knuckles go white with anger. You will be physically and mentally exhausted and somehow all the elements of every genre in film today merge together in an unexpected breath of fresh air."

However, this movie turned out to be a pretty good movie. So its not the BEST thriller you'll ever see, but it kept me entertained for the ENTIRE 100-something minutes. I didn't look at my phone once! The beginning of the movie surprised me, there's a back-story to this movie that ACTUALLY makes sense. The beginning is a bit long, but the story line folds out nicely. I laughed so hard, I didn't think it would be so funny, but it was. My only issue with the movie was the last 10-15 minutes. EVERYTHING happened in the last 15 minutes of the movie, talk about senses overload. But overall, it was a sad, somewhat scary, FUNNY, and cute ( yes, all at the same time ) If you decide to see it, do it with an open mind."

","Disturbia is a must see movie for people older than 13 but younger than 90 because some parts get very intense and we would not want a heart-attack to result. Anyway, Shia LaBeuf is amazing in this film and the neighbor also does a superb job of playing his role. Disturbia is a great film because it has its suspense, its romance, and it has comedy thrown in there as well. It is a very good movie to see in theaters because it is a thriller, so the big screen is always a plus. Its definitely a movie worth seeing, the actors are great and the plot is very well done. All in all its very well done and you will not find yourself at all bored during any point in this movie if anything you will be peeing your pants because it gets scary. Disturbia is a more realistic scary kind of movie, not like other horror or thriller films where it ends up not being scary at all because its just so ridiculous and unbelievable. Also, the music soundtrack for this film makes the movie 10x better. GO SEE DISTURBIA"

","Disturbia was a successful thriller, in that it had jolts. The plot was paint by numbers obvious - about everything you expect to have happen does- but the presentation got you jumping out of your seat. No gore, which disappointed my teen age son, who expected more of a horror movie than a conventional thriller.<br/><br/>The romantic subplot was distracting, but Sarah Roemer, a twentysomething ex model playing the teen hottie was ornamental, and it filled in the spaces between jolts. Personally, I thought Carrie Ann Moss as the Mom was hotter than Roemer.<br/><br/>Shia Lebeouf has enough charm to remain sympathetic as the hero despite being under house arrest. His twinkle in the eye makes the comic relief sparkle. He is a bit less convincing in the romantic lead side of things, and thus I have reservations about him being the next Tom Hanks, let alone the next Cary Grant. But being the next Jimmy Stewart would be just fine."

","I'm not really a fan of horrors/thrillers, although there have been a few which caught my eye, and I believe this is one of the better movies I've seen of the genre. However, the mystery aspect is what i do enjoy. There are many positive aspects but I shall only mention a few. The acting was great, everyone seemed real to me, and actors like these should be recognized more. I enjoyed David Morse's presence in other movies as a dark and menacing character, which was experienced during this movie. The teenagers of the movie acted in a modern sense, which I applaud because most movies are five or more years behind modern culture, losing the effect with the audience. The storyline was great, for a moment you thought Mr. Turner would burn but wouldn't which kept you questioning how it would end. The ending was very tense, especially when my friend scared the s!@# out of me, it was humorous when everyone around me is saying ""what the hell is wrong with him!"". There were no inconsistencies in the story and I enjoyed how there were happy times throughout a good portion with the film, it didn't leave me thinking the world is full of serial killers or full of deformed creatures hiding out in the hills. In my belief it was real, besides the fact that not everyone is a neighbor to a serial killer, but some people are and makes you think ...<br/><br/>Love the film, acting was great and the tension it puts on the mind was enjoyable (but not at the time).<br/><br/>More movies of this genre should make sure they follow a similar style ... but please don't copy the whole plot like other films do, which shall remain unnamed for civil law purposes."

"aharmas","9","2","6","13 April 2007"," An Exciting and Disturbing Ride
","""Disturbia"" does pay homage to ""Rear Window"", its must likely source of inspiration, though the setting has been transferred to suburbia, and our young protagonist is certainly a bit restricted in his mobility. What this film offers is a lot more fun and jolts, as the dynamics among the young people have a lighter tone. Technology, is efficiently integrated into the storyline, and it also showcases some quite remarkable editing.<br/><br/>This film will most likely be embraced by many different populations, from the teenagers who have followed the career of Shia LeBoef, pretty good this time out, as the bored teenager who discovers the thrill of studying his neighbors. There are also those people who like a good story, peppered with enough thrills and a very disturbing villain. ""Rear Window"" gave us very little insight into the murderer's backstory. He remained distant. Morse's villain is reckless and sickening. A few people in the audience cringed as he approached our hero's girlfriend to let her know that he was a bit upset these young people had crossed the line.<br/><br/>""Disturbia"" is a bit refreshing since it leaves behind the obvious gore and makes you wonder about what is really going on. Unlike a few pictures that dish out unnecessary gore, this film explores the psychology of the hunter and its prey. It is also a treat that teenagers actually in engage in real conversations, as they explore and debate the consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>In short, get ready to have a fun time at the movies again, as D.I. Caruso has given us some thrilling entertainment."
"kingofmyhead","8","2","6","13 April 2007"," Well,
","I actually enjoyed it. I went with friends and was in a large, sold-out theater, which added to the experience.<br/><br/>This is the first thriller/horror movie I've seen in recent years that I actually sat through. The plot, although fairly predictable, was more than enough to entertain. The story sets itself up very nicely, and continues throughout. There are multiple moments that made me jump a little bit, and the main sequence definitely managed to get my heart racing. Also, I felt that the actors, particularly the younger ones, did a very good job. A problem with horror movies I tend to have is over-acting, but, in this realistic plot, the characters tended to react as such.<br/><br/>There were a few points to bring it down, however. The plot and a few of the ""get-you-to-jump"" moments were altogether too predictable (although this is admittedly hard to avoid, as you're expecting to jump. It's a suspense movie).<br/><br/>In conclusion, it really was a good, thrilling experience. There were enough unexpected turns in order to maintain the experience. I especially recommend this film to teens, as most in the theater were very pleased with the experience."

","I first saw Disturbia during its initial theatrical release in 2007. I was 18 at the time Disturbia came out, so D.J. Caruso's thriller rife with subplots including the anguish of coming-of-age and teen romance meant that I was part of the target audience. I enjoyed Disturbia a great deal in the theatre and bought the DVD soon after as one of the last Hollywood Video rental stores closed in my area. After not seeing Disturbia for a few years, I was nervous to revisit it, for fear that it would be one of those films I enjoyed once because it fit a particular time in my life that I wouldn't get much out of after more maturation. I can pleasantly affirm my love for Disturbia is just as strong today as it was when I sat in the theatre the first time I saw it. I suppose it makes sense that I enjoyed it, I'm a massive fan of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. In 2010, the copyright holder of the Cornell Woolrich story that Rear Window was based off of, sued producer Steven Spielberg and his film studio DreamWorks for infringement. The lawsuit was dismissed, as the courts rightly recognized that there is much more to Disturbia than simply a Rear Window rip-off. Though the same voyeuristic protagonist and a mystery exist in both, the existence of one far from hampers the other."

","PROS: Horrors number one goal is to keep you at the edge of your seat, to keep you uneasy, to keep you white knuckled. This movie did all that and then some. I can't even capture in words how intense this film is. Cinema is meant to put people into another realm and make them feel the emotion that the realm should be giving you. With DISTURBIA I was put into this dark and brutal place and I was scared with every scene. I am a thrill seeker, which is why I like horror movies, but this movie is much more than a thrill. This is an experience that you can't unlive. The movie just built and built until you got to the end. The resolution was the perfect dilution to a very intense climax. I liked that the film built up and built up until it exploded and then you were given just the right amount of time to cool down and process the awesomeness that you just watched.<br/><br/>CONS: I wish there was more gore.

I watched some other movies he has directed, also very good movies. Also, I watched ""Rear Window"", which is 1954 movie, and I can say, Disturbia is way more better."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","2","25 June 2016"," Superficially enjoyable, even if it does copy Rear Window
","DISTURBIA is a big generic Hollywood film that tells a story that's already been told in cinema. This time around, REAR WINDOW is the film that's being ripped off, except the story is reinvented for the teenage crowd with a young leading characters, lots of teen stuff going on (romance, parties, chicks in bikinis, mobile phones, etc.) and a villain straight out of a horror movie who gradually becomes more involved in the actual plot as the story carries on. For the most part this is a slick and efficient example of film making, a film with a fast pace that keeps you watching. Sure, it's full of clichés and unbelievable situations, and a plot full of holes when you think about it too much, but that's pretty much par for the course in modern Hollywood productions.<br/><br/>There's something about Shia LaBeouf I just don't like. I hated his character in TRANSFORMERS, and the way he's portrayed by Spielberg as some kind of golden boy. He's a little better in DISTURBIA, even if I couldn't bring myself to actually ""like"" him. One interesting thing is that the script portrays his character as a real voyeur, getting his kicks watching his sexy female neighbour undress every night. However, LaBeouf isn't condemned for this behaviour, it's just presented as the normboys will be boys, and all that. The whole sub-plot involving the killer neighbour seems fairly extraneous to the main story of the romance, and there isn't a great deal of spying going on.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because there's a brilliant and underrated actor playing the bad guy: David Morse. Morse is equally at home playing both good guys and bad, and he fills his character here with a real sense of menace. He needs more screen time and more roles. The rest of the cast list, including an almost unrecognisable Carrie-Ann Moss, just don't cut it, although I will admit that Sarah Roemer is cute. In any case, things play out well enough, and there's not really anything to dislike. Things end in one of those 20-minute hero vs. villain finales, full of jump scenes, death, rotting bodies, and a villain who just won't stay dead. I would have preferred a little more wit with the script, but this movie manages to get by without that. I enjoyed it, even if I don't want to see it again."

","While driving home from a fishing trip, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) gets into a car accident which kills his father. One year later, a despondent Kale punches his Spanish teacher and gets 3 months under house arrest. His mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) takes away his video games. His best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) is in Hawaii. With nothing to do, he starts spying on his sexy neighbor Ashley Carlson (Sarah Roemer). By the time Ronnie is back, Kale has mapped out his entire neighborhood. He notices suspicious things at Robert Turner (David Morse) next door. There are news reports of missing girls. Ronnie and Ashley join him in the stakeout.<br/><br/>I love the 'Rear Window' vibe which is one of my favorite movies. It's a different route to the same place. Shia has an easy charm about him. Aaron is a great slacker friend. Sarah Roemer has a friendly sexiness. The trio has good chemistry together. David Morse is creepy as hell and the scene in the car with Roemer is hair raising. The ending runs on a little too long. I would have prefer not to spend more time in Turner's underground dungeon. It feels heavy handed from a slasher movie which is different from the rest of the movie. If it stays in the Brecht house, there would have been a tight high intensity ending."
"TheGangstaFish","8","1","2","7 June 2013"," Memorable and gripping, but suffers from inherent romance.
","Given my typical disdain to horror movies in general, I was little dissuaded to view the film with my family when, upon gathering minimal research on it, I was informed that it was a ""slasher"" production. However, when watching the trailer intrigued me enough to drop my former protestations (the biggest pull-factor was Shia Labeouf, whom I had gained a liking toward from his performance in Transformers), I found that two hours later it was a good decision on my part.<br/><br/>Kale, a teenager who's become a recluse after witnessing the death of his father, has come to a climactic run with the law when he punches a teacher who strikes a nerve by unsympathetically referencing the deceased parent. From there, little about the movie warrants a genuinely considerable complaint; everything from the acting to the pacing to the sets were brilliantly executed. The characters, even the gawdy love interest, were fun and memorable, particularly Kale himself, and the movie was well-casted with actors that sure knew how to portray their characters. Mr. Turner, per example, was a perfectly creepy villain to be suspected.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, the audience sympathizes and experiences similar ebbs and flows along with the characters when their investigation evolves from fun game to dangerous business. Building gradual suspense with slow (but still entertaining) build-up, the suspense and curiosity towards the endurance of the characters in this perverse situation is pent up to allow a very well presented atmosphere.<br/><br/>Likewise, the horror of the film succeeds without the overwhelming amounts of gorn and/or scary CGI monsters. <br/><br/>That's not to say, however, that the movie still doesn't suffer from flaws, one of which is particularly critical and warrants a score below ten stars. With an allegedly young target audience, the movie's quality is deterred by a romantic subplot that feels very out of place and is, in this situation, simple unneeded. While the romance isn't pushed to the point that it's overly ridiculous, its presence nonetheless is distracting and adds little to any of the characters or the plot itself. Inasmuch, there are painfully obvious indicators that any of the teenage lust in the film is present solely for marketing purposes only and act as more as a segue between otherwise awesome pacing.<br/><br/>It's not too much to completely render the film free of its quality, nonetheless. With great plot progression, acting, dialog, settings, characters, and choosing to showcase the horror genre with psychology over visuals, I would recommend this movie to anybody."
"StevePulaski","8","1","2","25 February 2012"," It's like the darkness is the light
","Here's a teen thriller that isn't fueled by raging teenager hormones and doesn't act on impulse during tense situations. Well, most of the time. Disturbia is a crafty and intense thriller that may not pack in the originality of other films of the same genre, but has enough to effectively sustain its runtime and its ideas. Although not perfectly executed, it finds little shortcuts around some clichés, but still offers essentially the same things you'd get in a regular 2000's decade horror film.<br/><br/>This is a treat for Shia LaBeouf and his fans as well. Finally we can see him in a film with coherency, plot, and characterization. He finally shows his acting talents that do not involve running away from metal giants and screaming at them with full power. He is more controlled, and more developed in Disturbia, leaving much to be desired. He plays Kale, who was just in a car accident that killed his father, and has been placed on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher. He's been throughout a lot, and is the typical teenager that likes music, TV, and girls, so we can still see he isn't a bad kid, but a victim of somewhat uncontrollable circumstances.<br/><br/>In a random act of boredom, he starts spying on his neighbors which include deviant little kids, a gorgeous young woman (Roemer), a cheating couple, and a mysterious elder, played wonderfully by David Morse. He becomes more acquainted with the young woman, whose name is Ashley, and they begin spying on the elderly man, who they believe might match a killer who has been kidnapping women across town.<br/><br/>LaBeouf and Roemer strike up a believable chemistry, and the film isn't too much sex, too much cartoony violence, or too much blood. It's all well managed. The film takes about an hour before it kicks itself into high gear, so these characters are left to develop at an efficient rate. The result works favorably, and when hell starts breaking loose, we feel even more sorry for the characters because we know them well. They're not faceless caricatures.<br/><br/>As some could pick up from the plot, this is a modern retelling of Hitchcock's classic Rear Window, now updated with computers, cell phones, and cameras. I'm not for remakes, but I am somewhat for reimaginings and updated versions of films from decades past. As long as they're made with suspense, characters, coherency, and enjoyment. Here, there's respect for Hitchcock's original story, but there are also touches of the film's own personal take on the story. Because of these alterations, the films can't be dubbed as a remake, but a reimagining.<br/><br/>Disturbia is a fine blend of terror, voyeurism, and suspense with good looking teen actors who are bound to do well in the future. Once LaBeouf ceases with the Transformers films, and Aaron Yoo wanders out of remake hell I can see both of them doing films of all different genres. Hopefully they'll put the binoculars away next time and go out and play.<br/><br/>Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yoo, David Morse. Directed by: D.J. Caruso."

I first watched this by recommendation of my cousin who said it was not to spine chilling, freaky or terrifying yet it turned out to be more freaky than 'The Blair Witch Project' and left me as paranoid as ever. I thought I was past the time of shouting out in fear whilst watching films but as shown I will reveal a slight spoiler but when Kale's friend intrudes into the killers house to retrieve his mobile phone he ends up going missing. A while later in the film Kale receives a text message from his friend telling him to look at his TV screen the minute he turns around and sees him dead on the screen but after he moves towards his cupboard and sees his friend dead but then... he jumps up at Kale screaming and I copied Kale in a split second jumping back and shouting at the top of my voice... watch it if you are ready for a psychological freaking out."

","It is a very good film, I would say, but, however, there are two points that I would like to focus on. <br/><br/>1) This is very similar to rear window, as highlighted in the FAQ section of this film, and also contains similarities to other films of that typical genre. <br/><br/>2) The intense realism is kept up throughout the entire film, with an elderly man feeling watched, then the thrilling and intense conclusion where ""Ashley"", or Sarah Roemer comes to save ""Kale"", or Shia LaBeouf from ""Mr Turner"", or David Morse. In scenes mentioned, which appear before those mentioned above, such as the fight scene in the kitchen, ""Kale"" is trying to unplug the device to alert the police, which is later highlighted by ""Mr Turner"" as being the boy who cried wolf, as he begins to frame him. ""Ashley"", of course then shouts up the stairs and shouts up the stairs, ""Kale?"" several times, and ""Mr Turner"" is distracted, and then the escape scene begins, with ""Kale"" hitting ""Mr Turner"" and then, after a lot of dramatic music from the trusty on hand, live orchestra, they manage to shut the door and lock it, and then ""Kale"" begins saying, ""We've got to find a way to cross the line."" This is good, as for our viewing pleasure, they've now got to deal with the psychopath, run out the window into the pool, all to trigger the alarm on his ankle tag. However, cast your minds back to the beginning of the film, unless they aren't already shredded by the incompetence of the police forces nearby, who refuse to listen to ""Kale"", and the women in a sort of ""fake floor"" setting, where their bodies are all twisted, mangled and rotting (scary! -.-) the woman said, ""...It's tamper proof.."" This, by definition means that it can't be tampered with so that you can get away, and run off, therefore, if you were to take it off, or try to break it, etc, this would trigger the omnipotent ""red light"", which obviously would mean that the police would be called early, they would arrest, if not attack ""Mr Turner"", and they would search ""Mr Turner's"" house, and find his Mom and the dead bodies, happily ever after, story ends, affectionate kissing scene at the end, sorted.<br/><br/>On a penultimate note, if you consider ""tamper proof"" to mean that it can't be broken, and if broken, nothing will happen, then the entire film you've just watched is just pointless, as he could have just taken off the ankle bracelet, no-one would ever have known about ""Mr Turner"" and his dead bodies, and he would have gone somewhere else, being a repeat of the scenario in Austin, Texas. This obviously, to the normal person will seem stupid that I would even write this, I really don't want to wake up tomorrow with loads of e-mails from lots of people who have copied and pasted Dictionary.com with the definition of ""Tamperproof"" on, so if anyone does this, they will receive an email reply from me saying what is currently displayed in this Paragraph here.<br/><br/>Finally, this is from me speaking as a film-goer, not a critic, the reason for my mark is that I have watched horror movies, and I intend to watch many more, and DISTURBIA was a very good film, a decent length, without being a long horror film, which I'm sure you'll all agree is very annoying, with scares becoming lacking, and just generally boring. There are exceptions, of course, such as the Shining (debatably a horror) and just some obvious others. It isn't a really short horror either, as a movie-goer, it's the moment that hits you, the ""Oh god, it's near the end..."" moment, after about an hour, which I did not feel until about ten minutes from the end, with ""Kale"" in the chair with gaffer tape around his mouth. That is the reason I've given this an 8 out of 10, due to good acting (except in parts), and a general tension, created by our helpful orchestra, and it being let off, when necessary. This was a very good film, which I would recommend to anyone.<br/><br/>My real location? Somewhere Back in Time."

","This is one of those films that I really didn't know too much about before hitting the 'Play' button. I had a vague idea from the write-up, but didn't expect what turned up on the screen. What I got was effectively an updated version of Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954). It did have some good aspects to it, but over all I found it quite disappointing. I will explain why after this brief summary.<br/><br/>Kale, a high school teenager has had a hard time of it since his father died a year ago. It all comes to a head one day when he punches his Spanish teacher in class. He is sentenced to three months' house arrest. He has to wear an ankle bracelet and if he wanders too far from the house an alert is sent to the police and they will respond immediately. Finding himself home alone most of the time, Kale gets bored and begins to watch the comings and goings of his neighbours. A new family moves in next door and he immediately takes an interest in the daughter, Ashley. His friend Ronnie comes around and they hang out together. They hear a report of a serial killer who may be in the area and Kale's suspicions turn to another of his neighbours, Mr. Turner. He fits the bill perfectly, but how to prove it? Ashley and Ronnie help him, but Turner is getting suspicious and has taken an interest in Kale's mother, Julie. Is Mr. Turner really a serial killer, if so, can they prove it before Kale's mom becomes the next victim? No clues here, this bracelet around my ankle will go off.<br/><br/>I thought the plot was OK, but I guess I'm not really the target audience as the focus is very much on the younger members of the cast. Unfortunately Shia LaBeouf was in the leading role of Kale. He really has zero charisma and has very little screen presence (IMO); consequently, I found this one a little hard to watch. Sarah Roemer played Ashley, she did a decent enough job, but appeared to be there mostly as eye-candy. Carrie-Anne Moss played Julie and I was surprised to see her in such a small part she deserves better (IMO). For me, the star turn was David Morse as Mr. Turner, very intimidating but also very charming when needed. Finally, Aaron Yoo was Ronnie, the clown of the piece if you like.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, I found this film quite disappointing and I think the problem was that I found it very hard to sympathise with any of the characters, particularly Kale. The script seemed to lack any originality and so the whole film suffered as a consequence. It wasn't all bad though, it did have its tense moments and these where handled very well. Over all though, I found it pretty unsatisfying Not recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 5.4/10"

","I haven't seen ""Rear Window"" but I think this movie works just fine without being called a remake. I appreciated the pacing of story and how we didn't learn everything at once. Although it could be argued that this neighborhood has way too many people who don't go to work, it does make for a good story. Also makes you wonder what you might discover if you had a bird eye's view and all day to study your neighborhood.<br/><br/>The setup was a little forced, but sufficient enough. The real fun begins when our ""hero"" gets his Xbox and iTunes accounts deactivated and he's forced to fill his house arrest boredom by spying on the neighborhood. Luckily for him a cute girl moves in next door and another neighbor seems suspiciously like a serial killer in the news.<br/><br/>There were a number of good plot twists and the traditional ""bad guy tells good lies in front of the cops"" moments. It's also fun when the cute girl decides to check-in on her voyeuristic neighbor. I think it drags a bit in reaching its final conclusion, but not enough to ruin anything.<br/><br/>If you like a little bit of scare from time to time but aren't a big fan of gore (maybe a little?) then you'll enjoy this movie!"
"BA_Harrison","7","1","2","5 September 2010"," A surprisingly taut, well crafted horror/thriller.
","When troubled teen Kale (Shia LaBeouf) takes a pop at his Spanish teacher, he is sentenced to three months house arrest, with an electronic tag around his ankle to prevent him from straying too far from home. His X-Box and iTunes privileges revoked by his milf-ilicious mother (Carrie-Anne Moss, who I wouldn't mind being shacked up with for three months), Kale indulges in a spot of voyeurism, which proves to be far more interesting than any video game: the man in the house opposite is having an affair with his maid; sexy new girl-next-door Ashley (Sarah Roemer) spends much of her time relaxing in the pool; and it appears as though creepy neighbour Mr. Turner (David Morse) has been busy abducting and hacking up local women. Enlisting the help of best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and, of course, Ashley, Kale attempts to prove that the man next door is the cold-blooded psycho he believes him to be.<br/><br/>A contemporary PG-13 (or Cert 15 here in the UK) take on Hitchcock's classic Rear Window cursed with a silly title and Shia LaBeouf in the central role: sounds like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it? Thankfully, Disturbia's director D.J. Caruso steers well clear of the expected trappings that blight many a modern youth-orientated horror/thriller (extremely obnoxious characters, MTV style gimmicky visuals, OTT gore) and opts instead for good-old fashioned suspense and edge of your seat thrills. Caruso successfully creates a palpable sense of tension, which he somehow sustains even when occasionally pushing the limits of believability, and his cast all give commendable performances, the younger performers actually making their characters fairly likable and the more experienced thesps providing solid support (Morse in particular gives a very memorable turn as the sinister Mr. Turner).<br/><br/>The film builds inexorably to a well executed and nail-biting finale deep inside the bowels of the murderer's house, where some nasty surprises await intrepid young Kale (extra points awarded for the inclusion of a water logged pit full of mouldy corpses!)."
"imdbbl","Null","1","2","12 January 2010"," Tense and entertaining
","Disturbia stars LaBeouf as the troubled Kale, who is confined to his home under house arrest after he punches out his Spanish teacher in the middle of class. Kale's array of available diversions dwindle considerably after his mom (Carrie Ann Moss) shuts off his X-Box and his i-Tunes, and he turns to voyeurism instead, carefully noting the daily activities of his neighbors. These include the swimming schedule of the hot girl who just moved in next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), whom he ogles with his best friend, the class clown, Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). When Ashley unexpectedly shows up and wants to know what the boys are doing behind their binoculars, they concoct a story about their neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse), and their suspicions that he is the serial killer currently on the loose... Disturbia seems to be a modern take on Hitchcock's 'Rear Window which I haven't seen but I plan to, because this little thriller was very enjoyable. The story is pretty straightforward and somewhat predictable, and truth be told, it could use a twist or two but, thanks to a good direction, the atmosphere is always very tense and suspenseful and keeps the viewer engaged and on the edge of the seat. Shia LaBeouf delivered a very effective and charismatic performance as Kale and this was one of the films that helped him become the star he is today. In the end, Disturbia is nothing groundbreaking, but it's a nicely done thriller and an entertaining film.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","I didn't get the chance to read what was this movie about when I decided to watch it, it had an okay rating here so I ended up watching it. Like most people say, it had lots of similar things about Rear Window. Kale (Shia LaBeouf)was house arrested so he had to stay inside his house, quite similar how James Stewart (Rear Window) had to stay inside his apartment because of an injury so out of boredom started spying on neighbors through their window. Then the scene where Ashley (Sarah Roemer) was stretching in her room reminded me of the the ballerina in Rear Window, I really don't wanna type everything I've noticed.<br/><br/>Now please don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie.

","if you watch this movie you cannot stop comparing it with rear window...both the movies are similar in many ways...protagonist stranded in a room(in this case a house),a parallel love affair,a helpful friend,dangerous murderer,killing of pets etc.etc...but the modernization done is very very clever and well done!!...though it would be grossly unfair to say that it is a complete rip off of rear window...this movie has its own moments..the love story is very well put in the backdrop of suspense ...even when Kale is peeping through his window to see Ashley in her swimsuits a considerable amount of suspense is created (though it is of a much lighter ton)....Shia Lebouf acting was really good as the exciting ' good for nothing turned hero' young man !!... Other than this i think the movie lacked in many aspects..or rather to be rightly put the movie could have been better in numerous ways..example. ..the suspicion of murder also shouldn't have been given away before the last moment..the revelation of the fact that the suspected murderer is actually the murderer much before the end of the story dilutes the story and eases the suspense considerably...then there is the ending ..which could have been much much better ...the whereabouts and the origins of the murderer has been completely skipped...<br/><br/>otherwise this movie is a very decent one..a mix of humor ,suspense and of course love...this has an appeal for all kinds of audiences..of all age groups..."
"Quebec_Dragon","6","1","2","17 August 2009"," Do NOT watch the trailer before watching the movie
","Because it's a case of the trailer basically telling you the whole plot which is very bad especially in the case of a thriller. In case you didn't know, this is a remake with modern technological trappings (cell phone, hand-held camera, computer, etc) of an old 1954 Hitchcock thriller called Rear Window. I haven't seen the original so cannot compare. I found Disturbia to be a good little teen movie/suspense thriller, little in terms of scope and surprises. Yes for me, it was a bit predictable even though I didn't watch the trailer. The concept of the guy under house arrest spying on his neighbours to pass the time and potentially discovering something disturbing is somewhat interesting but didn't feel fully exploited. The first third of the movie is fun and is more like a teen movie about a boy being grounded all summer. It grounds the characters and the restricted setting.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is very good playing an average ordinary joe as he usually is. The second third of the movie starts being more suspenseful as clues point towards one of the neighbours being a potential serial killer unless it's just the teen being paranoid (the french title of the film is Paranoiak btw). The third act I cannot speak about too much, unless to say the trailer reveals way too much. For a suspense, I cannot say I was ever truly afraid although I was surprised a couple of times. I fear Disturbia might have been slightly overrated because it was a surprise commercial success. Box office gross is unfortunately too often associated with movie quality. I did like Disturbia but I was underwhelmed. I would say it's worth a rental but not a purchase because I doubt you'd find it disturbing or intriguing enough to watch twice.<br/><br/>Rating: 6 out of 10"
"Irie212","3","1","2","27 July 2009"," The only person this movie could horrify is Hitchcock.
","The first half of ""Disturbia"" shapes up to be an obvious homage to ""Rear Window,"" so I got sucked in. I had to fasten my seat belt for the second half, though; it plummets mercilessly into schlock, approaching the level of ""I Know Who Killed Me,"" the Lindsay Lohan bottom- dweller that deserved even more than its record-setting eight Razzies.<br/><br/>Fellow time-killing IMDb.com critics have pointed out the plot inconsistencies, so I won't. I endorse praise of LaBeouf's and Morse's performances, and heartily add Aaron Yoo to the list. And I would thank the filmmakers for lighting the many night scenes so badly that I was spared from seeing much of the action.<br/><br/>That's almost it for praise, though. The turning point toward Razzie-world occurs with the first lines delivered by the talent- free Sarah Roemer (cf. bare-breasted Phoebe Cates and masturbating Judge Reinhold in ""Fast Times..."" for real swimming girl/peeping tom footage). But let's not blame a flicker-in-the-pan like Roemer when the ""Disturbia"" authors, Landon and Ellsworth, are the real perps. The first half shows such promise that one or both obviously have talent, which makes me wonder how this movie went so wrong. Somebody (the director?) trashed an initially engaging homage to Hitchcock, which the writers had enlivened with some crisp and funny dialogue, mostly delivered by LaBeouf's Kale (who names their kid after a crop in the cabbage family?) and his sidekick, Ronnie, played by the gifted Mr. Woo.<br/><br/>It was one of Ronnie's lines, inf act, that summed up the movie for me when the credits finally rolled: ""Operation Stupid is officially over!"""

","This was a good movie in the Rear Window theme. I certainly didn't regret seeing it, and I guarantee you won't either. I enjoyed it. Shia LeBeouf plays a teenager whose father is killed in a car accident in a well-played-out opening scene. In the next scene, Shia pops his Spanish teacher when the teacher makes a comment about what the father would think of it and, because he is still a minor, Shia winds up under three months house arrest. One of the police officers is the teacher's cousin and enjoys torturing him with this. There are news stories about a serial killer, and when David Morse moves next door, Shia begins to suspect that this might be him. A gorgeous teenaged girl also moves in to the other house next door, and they start spying on him along with Shia's best friend, and they also frustrate Shia's mother and spy on neighbors as well and receive torture from the pesky kids, including the ""flaming poop bag"" trick. Boy, do they get revenge. I enjoyed watching this movie. It was very suspenseful. You will like it too. The suspense never lets up.

","Disturbia a clever different type of horror. Yes it doesn't have no gore or too much violence, because it's not meant for that, so if your looking for that type of movie you better avoid Disturbia.

It's highly enjoyable film to watch with your friend's or a great thriller for your movie night. No it's not perfect it does lack some quality's in certain areas, like it take's a while before you really get into the movie, before you really get interested, Caruso should of bought the thrills in a bit quicker. But do not let that put you off, because when the movie does get interesting it really get's going and just get's more thrilling by the moment. But above all...The acting. Acting was pretty much flawless i can't think of someone else who could play Kale in a better way then Shia. LaBeouf again show's his talent and i think the success of the movie is because of him, i probably wouldn't be so interested in the movie if he was not on the cast.

The young cast is engaging, the violence and gore are minimal, and the language inoffensive.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little slow in places but, more often, ""Disturbia"" is entertaining and reasonably suspenseful.

","Disturbia is undoubtedly the best thriller to come out since the first Saw movie. It borrows against old thriller classics, such as Rear Window, but where Rear Window gets boring, Disturbia is still chilling. In Rear Window the man has a broken leg, which gets boring after a while. Disturbia provides a fresh twist because the guy in it can still move, but he is under house arrest. This provides excitement. Also Disturbia does not really start being scary until about halfway into the movie. It gives time for character development, which gives the story more content and a more solid plot line. Disturbia is a great movie and I would definitely recommend any movie lover to go see it."

","I had to think about ""Disturbia"" for quite a long time before writing this review. It's yet another one where I was fooled into liking it for its duration but, looking back on it now, it wasn't really all that satisfying.<br/><br/>I remember thinking half an hour into it that it wasn't very good. The opening fishing trip bored me rigid, then the accident was as contrived as possible, and then I sat perplexed as to what happened to Shia LaBoeuf's facial scarring which should have resulted from that accident. He's not the handsomest of young actors anyway so I suppose if he'd had the massive cheek scar that his character sustained earlier on, it would have made him even less appealing to look at. I also didn't care about his Spanish class, his lack of acting ability when he went ""berserk"" and punched the teacher, and I certainly didn't care about his house arrest or his lack of domestic skills. 30 minutes of all this characterisation was making me ready to switch the film off in disgust.<br/><br/>Then things started to pick up. No, I'm not talking just about the presence of Sarah Roemer who was probably the most beautiful creature I've ever seen. All of a sudden, I just got sucked into this rip-off of ""Rear Window"" and started to play along. I'm not sure if I was enjoying it or whether I was being duped by the director into thinking that I was watching something cleverer than it was. I started seeing parallels between this and ""Brainscan"" and then I started to wonder if Shia LeBoeuf would look like Russell Crowe when he was older... and that was it, I was well and truly being sucked into caring about the characters and whether they would manage to foil David Morse's evil plans to insulate his cavity walls with red-headed girls.<br/><br/>Amidst more product placement for Red Bull and Ipods than I've ever seen before, the plot wasn't too bad at all. It couldn't be, it's been done to death a million times before. Once all the finger pointing started, all of a sudden I was thinking of ""Fright Night"" and then images of Max with Sam's mother in ""The Lost Boys"" started to fill my mind. Could this film be any more derivative? Could it be any less original? The teenager who nobody believes who has a killer next door is a story as old as the hills.<br/><br/>David Morse was probably the least credible person to play the bad guy. I suppose that was why he cast because he just doesn't look as if he has it in him to do anybody any harm. I just didn't find his trying to be menacing very convincing.<br/><br/>I also still don't believe that Shia LeBoeuf would ever get a girl who looked like Sarah Roemer in real life nor did I totally understand what he did to the video camera to make it transmit a fuzzy signal back to his computer. I'll try breaking some of my expensive electronics later to see if I can replicate it. Maybe not. There were just too many things that didn't add up for me to shake this feeling that I was being fooled into believing what all reason was telling me to reject.<br/><br/>And so when the ever so exciting yet totally predictable finale occurred complete with music pumping away to stimulate what little grey matter was still active in my brain, I could no longer struggle against it any more and actually started to care if Carrie-Anne Moss got rescued or not.<br/><br/>Yup, it got me hook, line and sinker... a bit like the fish at the start of this 105 minute adventure into Stupidland. I'm not giving it more than 3 out of 10. In fact, I'm giving it 3 out of 10 just for Sarah Roemer. I might have given it 8 out of 10 if I hadn't thought about it. That makes me feel dirty inside."

","Disturbia topped the US box office for three weeks and although that is not a marker for the quality of a film I was excited when the UK release finally arrived.<br/><br/>After the death of his father in a car crash Kale (Shia LaBeouf) goes from the happy suburban kid with no worries to a withdrawn, hoodie wearing emo and after failing a Spanish test he punches his teacher and is sentenced to three months house arrest, wherein he fills his time by spying on the neighbours; from a man having an affair, to the cute blond swimming in a very skimpy bikini.<br/><br/>Kale, along with his friend Ronnie and the bikini girl Ashley begin to spy on the standard creepy neighbour with murderous tendencies and so the chase begins between the practically unstoppable killer and pretty teens.<br/><br/>It takes Disturbia a while to get going, with a few false starts and cheap scares but once chase starts it does become engrossing to watch, and thankfully the film doesn't head down the oh so fashionable but extremely un-entertaining ""gorno"" route.<br/><br/>All the cast are fine - especially the comic sidekick Ronnie, who has more lives than a cat.<br/><br/>David Morse, who plays Mr Turner, is very creepy and is very believable as a Hollywood Killer.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf, with his natural charm and likability continues to make a name for himself as a upcoming star and has the ability to carry a film on his own. In Hollywood action films there is usually a scene where the main character, for example, Will Smith stands in a tight tee-shirt and cocks his gun as he prepares for the final battle, and in Disturbia we have the nerdy, but strangely cute Shia LaBeouf cocking a pair of garden shears. It was just a short scene but I thought it was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Overall Disturbia isn't exactly ground breaking and there are no surprises as to how the film ends but it is fun to watch so I would give it a 8/10. It loses a point for the bikini scenes (how many times a week does that girl go swimming? And more importantly where the hell did she disappear to during the final showdown?) and also loses a point for all the product placement i.e. Apple and Xbox should have been credited as co-stars.<br/><br/>Overall Disturbia is nothing new - but then again I suppose If it isn't broke don't fix it."

","Alright, Hollywood has been upsetting me with these cheap movies with the same story lines and horrible actors for the past ten years. Every now and then there has been a good thriller/horror (ex. Seven, Silence of Lambs, Red Dragon), but for the most part every movie is the same as the last, and quite frankly i'm tired of it. It's like beating your head against the wall, and then doing it again and again. Truly it is all pointless, but as I was watching Disturbia I began to realize their may still be hope in Hollywood. As I watched the previews for the first time I realized that I recognized most of the actors, and liked them, the storyline looked decent, and I was hoping that this movie may just give me a good scare, and oh...how it did. When the movie started off in the beginning I liked the nice twist on Shia's character and I new this would later lead to something although I did not know what. He becomes messed up, hits his teacher blah, blah, blah, and then all of the sudden after the spying had begun the movie started getting intense. I enjoyed the ending and the scaring was just right for me. The actors were good, the storyline was excellent, and the movie surpassed my expectations. Please watch this movie if you just want to have a good amount of scare."

","One year after the death of his father in a car accident (of which he feels a little responsible), Kale is found prisoned at his house for three months after he hits his Spanish teacher. A GPS around ankle, he cannot move away from his place without the police coming in the second. His mother being with work and having cut out XBox Live, iTunes and TV, Kale finds a great occupation in the espionage of his neighbors. After discovering that one neighbor cheats his wife, that some 7 years old kids listen to porn films without their mother knowing it and that another neighbor is really too cute in bikini in her swimming pool, he also finishes by suspecting a man of the neighborhood of being a dangerous serial killer. With the assistance of the beautiful and sexy side neighbor and his weird and Asian best friend, he will try to prove his theories. Is Mr. Turner really a criminal or is it Kyle who ended up imagining too many things by being locked up at his place since too much time?<br/><br/>OK, I also had an impression of déjà vu by reading the synopsis, but my 3 favorites clerks at the video club all said to me that it was really excellent, then I took the chance, comforting myself with the opportunity that in the worst case, if the movie was awful, I would just look at Shia Labeouf on fast forward mode And I did not need the fast forward move finally, I could look at Shia on normal speed, because Disturbia is really a very good film. A very well done suspense, a story, yes, a little foreseeable if you wanna guess it too much, but if you take it the relax way and that you let the final punch come to you instead of looking for it, that really is diverting. It is also a little ""teen movie"" which I did not hate. But attention! it is nevertheless not as bad as stupid scary movies like House of wax or whatever! I swear it's not! The 3 main actors are really great (Shia Labeouf ""Kale"", Sarah Roemer ""Ashley"" and Aaron Yoo ""Ronnie""). Cheers to the music, really nice!

"nabor7","8","1","2","13 August 2007"," Good Thriller
","A lot of people have compared this to a poor version of Rear Window. I fail to see the comparison. The premise of being confined to his house and ultimately spying on his neighbors is as far as it goes. Notwithstanding his fathers death, his house arrest was the culmination of the run in with his Spanish teacher and from previous troubles. The stage is set as a typical restless teen who one by one has his sources of entertainment either cancelled or has his access blocked, turning to anything that can put off the boredom. I thought the scenes of his transformation from a rebel to being resigned to his fate were realistic. I watched it twice in one weekend and likened the characters to myself and my best friend when I was a teen. It's like the boy who cried wolf once too often. When you're that age you aren't taken seriously, especially if you have been prone to trouble, so you take matters into your own hands not thinking of the consequences. I thought the cast was superb, with David Morse turning in his usual excellent work. Carrie-Anne Moss played the part of a mother who has to balance earning a living and concern over her son and his problems perfectly. This is an excellent movie with no strings attached."

Caruso and female co-star Sarah Roemer who seem to be enjoying themselves- even though it got old real quick when the director kept pointing out over and over where each scene was shot and how a yard scene from Pasadena was cut with a soundstage shot several times.The movie itself is better than most of the modern Hollywood suspense flicks-carried by the leading man and ready made to sell some DVDs and get rented for folks looking for the latest suspenseful flick.Worth a rental.

","I took my 76 year old mother to see this since it was PG13 and my teens had already said it was good and not scary. I am glad she didn't freak out. There were plenty of good jump out of your seat moments. Some were surprises in how they made you jump even when you were expecting something to happen. For me it was otherwise pretty typical. I didn't buy the relationship aspects of the film.(Except the father/son relationship.) The characters-even sadly David Morse's-were underdeveloped. While I can't say anyone did a bad job at all something was lacking. Morse usually plays creepy way creepier than that. I had the feeling he was being held back asked to play a bland murderer. I thought Shai LeBeouf did a very good job, but the characters didn't seem connected to each other at all. The comedic portions were more fully developed-Aaron Yoo was hilarious! I will have to watch for him. I couldn't find motivation for the behaviors of any of the characters except the mom whenever her son would tick her off. Why was the serial killer a killer and why did he have the specific proclivities he had? They spent a lot of time setting up his ""work room"" and we look at it, but don't know why the items we see are present. There were also some plot issues that seem contrived and convenient--the deer. While the emotional tone was there enough for suspense and lust everything else occurred in an emotional vacuum."
"Jerique","9","1","2","6 May 2007"," Disturbia is shockingly great!
","Disturbia revolves around Kale (Shia LaBeouf; Holes, Even Stevens) who's put on house arrest for assaulting his teacher. The reasoning for assaulting his teacher was for the opening scene to the movie, where his father suffers a tragic death.<br/><br/>After being put on house arrest, Kale looks to his neighborhood for entertainment. He begins spying on his new 'hot' neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and eventually begins to date her. When they begin dating it starts out as a joke to spy on Mr. Turner (David Morse; The Negotiator. The Green Mile) - who Kale, Ashley and Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) all believe he's a serial killer.<br/><br/>As time goes on, Kale cries wolf twice and the cops don't believe him. His mom (Carrie-Anne Moss; The Matrix) can't stop blaming Kale and no one will believe him. When Ronnie accidentally leaves his phone in Turner's car, their lives turn for the worst and go into a spiral nightmare for which none of them were prepared for.<br/><br/>I expected this movie to be freaking scary much like Dead Silence and once again, I wasn't scared in the least bit. If anything, the majority of this movie is centered around the romance of Kale and Ashley, and with a cover of suspense you'd walk out thinking you just saw a horror, but you didn't. The trailers also tricked you to thinking it would be scary and a horror film.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was shockingly great and there's a reason it was number one in its debut. The best performance was Shia, and it's noticed because he gets the most screen time. If he was a nominee for the ""Best Breakthrough Performance of the Year"" I'd vote for him.<br/><br/>If you wanted to see this movie, but were waiting for a review, then go see it, because my review is: ""great movie, shouldn't be missed."""

It was had it's suspense, thrills, and even brief chills. A good movie will carry you and keep you on a roller coaster ride to a final destination...no pun intended. Disturbia does take you on the ride. There were a few lagging moments and few scenes in the climatic ending that left you wondering why a certain co-star seems to vanish from the film until the very end. I kept thinking where did _______ go? Overall, it is entertaining and truly a lot of fun. So if you are going to spend the money to see a movie this is a sure bet. If you are really don't like movies with teen main characters, go see 300 or Grindhouse. All I kept thinking is why didn't I have such a hot neighbor as Sarah Roemer when I was growing up. She is truly easy on the eyes."

","WOW! I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. As a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf my initial intention was to see the movie for his acting so i didn't expect much from the movie itself. I was completely wrong to think so little of the movie itself, aside from Shia this movie is killer! I started paying much attention to the movie so then Shia's performance was just apart of the movie (whom i thought played the role to perfection). All the characters complemented each other showing the intensity of the movie. I knew the movie was a thriller and all but this movie kept me at the edge of my seat ready to see what would happen next. I even actually was startled a couple of times!<br/><br/>The movie had a great beginning, it really got the movie started. At the beginning Kales' (Shia) dad was killed in a car crash that involved him to. He seemed to be the perfect teenager. So i had no clue as to why he got house arrest. Well it was a shocker to me, i could not believe what he had done (i won't tell that part to those who haven't seen it yet, bu it was killer)!<br/><br/>So this movie is a must see the acting is amazing and the whole story was put together beautifully, you could follow the story without getting confused. So i strongly recommend this movie, it is a must see!"

","Disturbia was very suspenseful and intense, but also added great comedic moments, which I think was a great mix. In Disturbia, you never know whats going to happen and all the cast were amazing. Not one bad performance. Disturbia is unique because compared to some recent PG-13 horror flicks, this one is very suspenseful and has an excellent story. All the characters have their own personality and are likable, so you do care about them and their fate. There are some jumpy scenes, but the tension mostly comes from suspense and not knowing whats gonna happen next. Is Disturbia going to be called one of the most scariest films ever? No. But will it entertain you and give you a good time? Yes. When I say, entertaining and a good time, I don't mean a terrible movie but with good gore, and cheesy popcorn scenes that are only mean't to be viewed with a group of friends. When I say entertaining and a good time, I mean that Disturbia has great suspense, is very intense, likable characters, and a bone chilling plot. Disturbia does not need to be a bad movie, to be a good movie. Disturbia may be similar to Rear Window but do not ruin your experience by comparing them and calling this a rip off. You will like this movie if you go and expect a movie of its own. Like I said, Disturbia is a great movie. Go and see it and have a good time."

I'm not saying the movie was a masterpiece or anything like that, but if you take it for what it is; a suspense thriller meant to attract a certain demographic of movie watcher, you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>The young starring cast did surprisingly well in their roles and were comedic at all the right times. I especially liked Carrie-Ann Moss in her role and thought she was very believable outside her matrix outfit. The music in the movie was appropriate and the scenes kept you on the edge of your seat.

","I first saw Disturbia 2 years ago when i was quite young. Ever since it has been one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>The film has Shia LaBeouf playing a teenager named Kale Brecht. He is put under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher because he made a comment about his deceased father. So, to pass the time, he teams up with his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo)and begins spying on the neighbours. Eventually he becomes convinced that his next door neighbour (David Morse) is a serial killer.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific. Shia LaBeouf plays Kale flawlessly, adding both comedy and suspense. Aaron Yoo adds a hilarious comic aspect to the film, while David Morse is genuinely terrifying. Those who have seen him in other films will know so.<br/><br/>The directing from DJ Caruso was also spot on. The tense moments were genuinely scary without having to be violent, and the film itself was well paced, adding a mix of comedy and horror.<br/><br/>In short, the film as a whole is very well executed. It may not be the most respected film, but it is the perfect film to watch on entertainment value."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","1","3","19 September 2009"," confession: I liked the movie. I liked it a lot more than I thought I was going to...and a lot more than it probably deserves
","I have a confession to make. It's almost like a plea of guilty to a criminal charge. I recently saw the Shia LaBeouf movie ""Disturbia"", which was a big hit among the teenage audience of 2007, and my 'crime' is that, much to my surprise and to my delight, I liked the movie. I liked it a lot more than I thought I was going to and frankly, a lot more than it probably deserves keeping in mind that this is a more than obvious rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller ""Rear Window."" So close are the two movies in plot (not story) that the producers of ""Disturbia"" actually now face a lawsuit for not obtaining the proper copyright permissions that would have allowed their film to be released without raising a legal bout.<br/><br/>As for me, I was surprised. No, it's not as good as ""Rear Window"". Not even close. It's standard, it's predictable, it's packed with clichés with almost all of its primal moments owed to the movie it is borrowing from, but in the end, I found myself moderately entertained from a movie I was rather sure I was going to find distasteful since it is a rip-off of one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>""Disturbia"" is basically ""Rear Window"" converted for a teenage audience. Instead of a photographer crippled and confined to apartment by a broken leg, Shia LaBeouf stars an adolescent under house arrest for assault. After his mother severs the plug to his television, LaBeouf finds himself with little else to do but set up binoculars and video cameras at his windows and spy on his neighbors, including the new girl next door (Sarah Roemer) who likes to undress in front of an open window and a strange old man (David Morse) who he's convinced is a serial killer.<br/><br/>If you thought James Stewart's actions in ""Rear Window"" were a little unethical and perhaps a little creepy, wait till you get a load of LaBeouf in this movie. Actually, though, LaBeouf is what really this movie has to boast about and what the movie owes for its success. Shia LaBeouf, one of the more competent young actors of this generation, is very good in this movie. He brings a lot of charisma and enthusiasm to his role to make a surprisingly likable character out of who otherwise seems an obnoxious little punk in need of a lesson.<br/><br/>Like in ""Rear Window"", ""Disturbia"" sets up the plot and the characters for the first half of the movie, introduces the mystery about midpoint, and saves the third act for the majority of thrills and shocking moments. And although I was not 'scared out of my shoes' as a lot of my peers said I would be, I will admit there were some moments that had the hair of my arms raising and this made up for some moments that were otherwise quite dull and ponderous. The only thrill I had a problem with was the climax, which I felt was just cliché and out of place and didn't seem to correspond very well with the resolution.<br/><br/>Now what does not work in ""Disturbia""? Well, apart from LaBeouf, there aren't any really interesting characters. Whereas James Stewart had a great supporting cast in ""Rear Window"", LaBeouf only has standard stick figures to call his allies. Sarah Roemer is a beautiful and surprisingly good young actress, but her character does not have much of a personality. Aaron Yoo, also competent, is just playing the typical dweeb's best friend here. And David Morse is not all that frightening of a villain as we can predict every single thing he's going to do next. And because of these weaker supporting characters, the middle of ""Disturbia"" lags a little.<br/><br/>In the end, I was delighted to admit that I was not bored to tears with ""Disturbia"" as I was afraid I was going to be. It does have its weaker points and moments and it's no classic like the film it's obviously mimicking, but it is a moderately competent thriller however clichéd and standard it may be."

","DISTURBIA is a youth-oriented version of Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW. We have already had two youth-oriented versions of REAR WINDOW, namely FRIGHT NIGHT and MIMIC 3. But so be it. A good plot never wears thin. Shia L. plays a kid under house arrest with little to keep him occupied. So he starts spying on his neighbors, one of whom, played by David Morse of CONTACT and HACK fame, may be a serial killer. At least, Shia's character thinks so. He enlists the aid of a pretty newcomer to the neighborhood (Sarah Roehmer) and one of his school buddies (Aaron Yu) to try and trip the guy up. Morse is appropriately sinister and menacing. Shia does his best with a role that largely confines him to one room. This PG-13 film has its moments, and will best appeal to a young crowd. Adults, beware."

","Shia's got that everyman thing about him and good comedic timing and all that. This movie's alright in terms of delivering some modest entertainment without being nearly as retarded as most movies of its genre typically are. The Asian side-kick guy was pretty funny but other than that I thought the acting was not that good. The girl next door was a pretty shallow character and the performance just felt very obvious, for lack of me thinking of a better way of putting it. David Morse was okay but his character was terribly clichéd and he couldn't shake that. Carrie-Ann Moss didn't do anything but was fine otherwise. Shia, of course, is cool. As always.<br/><br/>The story has its moments. Or ideas. Not original but good. Enough to draw you in just the tiniest bit. A good sign when you root for the good guys if only a little. Music forgettable but effective enough and without being awful or distracting (which be rare these days).<br/><br/>I get frustrated that I didn't notice more while watching the movie but it just isn't challenging or meant to be.

Ther is also a wide array of great actors in the movie ranging from Aaron Yoo, David Morse, Matt Craven and also the wonderful Carrie-Ann Moss. Just the actors in the movie make it more appealing.

","This isn't a bad movie.<br/><br/>It's not a quick movie to get your juices flowing - the first half to two-thirds deals with the set-up at a fairly leisurely pace - but the climax sets a high level of tension of the ""killer in the house"" variety.<br/><br/>Shia LeBoeuf as the youngster under house arrest does very well in portraying the decent lad adversely affected by his father's death: he does less well in giving us the kid who is paranoid about the next door neighbour - we never really feel the conflict between his genuine concerns and the appearance of paranoia to others.<br/><br/>David Morse is able to portray downright evil as easily as he plays sympathetic second-string leads, and he does so here.<br/><br/>Sarah Roemer makes a confident and attractive young lead in only her third film.<br/><br/>And the house arrest scenario is a good updating alternative to the original Rear Window."

"horse_lover53","9","1","3","2 December 2008"," Distubria Movie Review
","Disturbia (2007)<br/><br/>How would you feel if you were almost positive that a wanted serial killer was living across the street in what you thought was your quiet and peaceful neighborhood? Unfortunately, for the protagonist, Kale Brecht (Shia LeBeouf) in the thrilling movie Disturbia (2007), these thoughts turn out to be the real thing. Why would the 17 year old teen even begin to even suspect such a thing? After losing his father in a tragic car accident, Kale's anger from such a loss seemed to cause him to lose control and punch his Spanish teacher in the face, therefore, sentencing him to house arrest. Because of this, Kale finds himself that the only way to keep himself occupied during the day (since being restricted from the TV and video games), is to spy on the neighbors around him through his binoculars. It is because of this, does Kale begin to question the safety of his own self and integrity of others around him. The viewer is able to get the sense of how the protagonist gradually develops along with the other main characters. We get a sense of Kale's background in the beginning of the movie when he was in the accident as well as how and why he was sentenced to house arrest. The other main character named Ashley Carlson (Sarah Roemer), who is introduced later on, is developed through the protagonist's interest in spying on her through the window of his own house. With this development of character, a conflict is soon arises. Even though the basis of this movie is suspense, there are many cases of irony also, such as when Kale tries breaking into the suspected killer, Mr. Turner's (David Morse), house with a wireless webcam. Although the effects for the movie are really good, this would be highly unlikely in a real life situation since the film tricks the viewer of sight and sound by combining technology, and ingenuity. A second ironic instance that occurs more towards the end of the movie is when Kale proves to the cops and to this own mother that Mr. Turner really was an actual criminal, when, in the beginning, no one was a believer. What makes this movie special are the unique effects on set and each character's special way of acting. The two most significant examples that play an important role are props and the variety of sets for the movie. The different sets are vital for any type of movie because it helps develop the different background areas in each scene. In Disturbia, the main props that are used throughout are Kale's binoculars, cell phones, and web cameras. Windows are also essential due to the fact that characters use them to look in and out at each other. Without these windows, the movie couldn't even be made. Also, without Kale's binoculars spying out the windows, he wouldn't have noticed the suspicious activity happening in his neighborhood. As for hair and makeup, it should be obvious to the viewer that the movie takes place in the twenty-first century. The setting is in your basic, normal neighborhood and the style clothes are like any average teenager of today. It's significant because it helps us realize that this movie is made to seem like it is happening in our time and helps us relate to it better.<br/><br/>Although lighting might not be that noticeable or that important in a film, it is crucial in Disturbia. The uniqueness in the way the director (D.J. Caruso) uses the light to create a certain mood is incredible. For example, during the scenes where Kale is spying on Mr. Turner's suspicious activity, the lighting is very dim, and at times, we are unable to clearly see the protagonist himself. The way the camera moves and the numerous different angles are really beneficial factors that help give you an idea that Disturbia is more than just one genre, but is instead, a thriller, drama, and mystery combined.<br/><br/>Disturbia is a brilliant movie for anyone who likes the feeling of suspense and anticipation. Even though the general rating from IMDb is 7.1 out of 10 stars, I would rate it a 9 out of 10. Disturbia is not only a film that leaves you on the edge of your seat, but it is a thriller that draws you into big screen itself. The stimulating action scenes, fast camera work, and the admirable roles each actor and actress play give this movie an extra special something that captivates everyone in the audience."
"krreiss","10","1","3","1 December 2008"," Thriller
","What would you do if you believed your next-door neighbor was a serial killer? Disturbia (2007) takes this question to an intense new level. After being put on house arrest for the entire three months of summer, 17-year-old Kale Brecht (Shia LeBeouf) has resorted to spying on his neighbors to pass the time. This is all very entertaining at first, but when reports of missing girls appear on the news, Kale begins to suspect his next-door neighbor is the serial killer. Kale has no hard evidence, and the only people who believe him are his two friends. Not being able to leave his house without setting off an alarm, Kale and his friends must feverishly work to find the proof they need in a race for time against a cold blooded killer. <br/><br/>This action-packed thriller will have you gripping the edge of your seat, as well as laughing at the comedic personalities of Kale and his friends. The characters alter the mood of the movie by adding a surprising comic relief in key parts, making this movie as much of a romantic comedy as it is a horror film. But don't be fooled, the terrifying sequence of events, enhanced by a key selection of music and sound will keep you on your toes and constantly guessing. The director, D.J. Caruso, gives the audience a unique perspective into Kales' thoughts by means of his camera and his binoculars, which he is cleverly using to spy on his neighbor. The camera adds symbolic meaning by allowing the viewer to see the situation through Kales' eyes. Along with the entertaining character personalities, the setting really does a lot to draw the viewer in. Low lighting enhances the disturbing mood, and paired with a mixture of close up shots, this really shows the fear within the characters. Medium shots are also used, especially during the scene where Kale decides to break into his neighbors house in search of his friend who goes missing, to allow for the possibility of surprise to jump out from around every corner: this movie will leave the viewer in a constant state of suspense. Set in the suburbs, this movie really makes you wonder; ""Could there be a killer living next to me?"" making this film a nail-biting horror must see.<br/><br/>I would give this movie five stars, for the captivating performance of the lead actors, as well as the action packed, mind gripping plot. D.J. Caruso did an amazing job at updating the classic Rear Window. By adding a few modern elements such as cameras, an updated plot, and a talented cast of young actors; Disturbia has set new standards for the chilling ""serial killer neighbor"" movie. Anyone who is in need of a suspenseful, action packed, yet witty movie, look no farther. Disturbia will have you jumping out of your seat. Just remember ""Every killer lives next to someone."""

","There are too many forced elements in this movie. No killer would leave windows open. In fact, it seems that every window in this movie is open, which is apparently just to make sure that the boy could see everything. Okie, if he could see, undoubtedly others could too then why a serial killer had to be found out by a kid who was home arrested & got nothing to do other than looking into his house? And I think people need exercising, really, because even a young & tall police couldn't stand a strike from the nearly-dead old man! Overall it's still a good movie, despite forced elements. It made me laughed some times too."

","Disturbia disturbed me...a lot. The plot is just simply great. A teenage guy played by rising Hollywood star Shia LaBeouf is under house arrest and out of boredom, spies on his neighbors through his binoculars and video camera. What he didn't expect is that his next-door neighbor Mr. Turner, played by David Morse, is actually a serial killer on the loose. After witnessing a murder, he goes all out to bring down Mr. Turner. But teenage aggression can only go so far.<br/><br/>Superb acting by Shia. Although, I have only seen him once before Disturbia, The Greatest Game Ever Played, he has improved a lot. I can't wait to see him in Indy 4. Support cast was great too, Carrie-Ann Moss, David Morse and that funny Chinese guy. I swear I almost wet my pants when Kale saw Ronnie dead inside his closet and I was like, oh my god, how did Mr. Turner get inside his house? And then we find out that he was just playing possum. That f**. The ending sequence left me breathless, with Shia trying to be an Alpha Male carrying his bat and storming Mr. Turner's house. Damn, that's what you call bravery.<br/><br/>A 8/10 for an awesome thriller."
"matjusm","8","1","3","26 October 2008"," Modern day Hitchcock
","Vertigo meets the 21st century. <br/><br/>In what is essentially a remake of Hitchcock's classic, a high school teenager (Shia LeBeouf) is sentenced to house arrest and has a tracking device placed on him, thereby making him unable to leave his home. After a while he starts spying on his neighbors, most notably a pretty young girl who moved in next door. But all is not well in suburbia as one of the neighbors is up to some pretty strange things. With the help of a classmate and his new found love interest, LeBeouf sets off to discover what is really going on. <br/><br/>As I have mentioned before, this is Vertigo in the 21st century- a man unable to leave his house thinks one of his neighbors is a murderer and then with the help of his friends, starts playing detective. Although casting someone like LeBeouf in the lead and including the whole teenage angle might make this seem like another run on the mill teen slasher, this is not it. The youth element is treated very effectively in the sense that it is there but it is not overplayed and is in fact kept to a relative minimum. There is some humor but the main focus is instead on the story and this is where the film's strength lies.<br/><br/>LeBeouf, despite his youth, is an excellent actor and I look forward to seeing him in more films. He manages to find that excellent balance between providing some comedic relief while at the same time still staying serious. DJ Caruso does a pretty good job of directing this film. There is of course quite a bit of modern style camera shaking and fast cutting (when compared to Hitchcock's version) but fortunately this too is kept in check and isn't overdone like it is in so many other films. <br/><br/>A nice film to keep you thrilled for an evening."

They couldn't have picked a better cast for this movie, with each member performing their role much more than adequately. David Morse and Shia Lebeouf are perfect. David Morse's character is chilling and conniving to no end. He reminds me very much of Tom Noonans character in ""Manhunter"" and even looks somewhat like him!

","The first half of this movie is really good because the lead actor, Shia LaBeouf, is really interesting to watch. You simply want to see what his character will do next. However, the second half of the movie brings in weak characters and an obvious plot. The quality of the movie drops off a bit.<br/><br/>Basically, the film is about a teenager who spies on his neighbors using binoculars. It's his way of passing time since he's serving a 3 month jail sentence at home. Initially, his primary target is an attractive girl next door. However, he soon begins to suspect that his other neighbor may be linked to a missing persons case in the news.<br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf puts in a great performance as the teenager under house-arrest. His mannerisms and dialog make his character interesting to watch. Unfortunately, when other characters enter into the foreground, they detract from the quality of the movie. The attractive girl neighbor is not quite believable - she's a little too over the top. And the suspicious neighbor is a little too obvious.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, it's pretty average by today's standards. The movie doesn't quite deliver things you can't already guess ... and for a movie like this, that's not ideal.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an above-average movie with a mix of good and bad elements, this is OK to watch.

"steve-575","5","1","3","27 November 2007"," Decent but very predictable
","When I saw the positive reviews for this movie, I thought this would be a very fresh and suspenseful thriller. However, I was disappointed to realize that it was very unoriginal and predictable. It was still watchable and had some good points but I can't really give it more than an average rating.<br/><br/>First of all, there wasn't really anything original about the plot. I've seen it on countless movies, sitcoms and drama series. It goes like this. New neighbor moves in. Main character decides to spy on the new neighbor and sees something suspicious. Main character continues to spy and sees a pattern of behavior that makes the neighbor look like a murderer. Main character becomes obsessed with finding out the truth about the neighbor. The only thing that was really different here was that the boy in this case was on house arrest and he had several high tech gadgets at hand that he could use to spy.<br/><br/>Secondly, there was really nothing surprising about any of the plot twists either. Maybe it was me, but right away I knew exactly that it would go something like this. Main character does more detective work that continues to support his theory of the murderous neighbor. Neighbor catches on to the fact that he is being spied upon and has interactions with friends and family members of the main character, seemingly putting them in danger. Main character tries to alert these friends and family members as well as police to the suspicious neighbor. They don't believe him given his past behavior. Neighbor seems clean in their eyes. Boy cries wolf one too many times.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the acting was very good. Shia LaBeouf was excellent as Kale Brecht, a well-meaning but troubled teen who was burdened by the death of his father. David Morse once again played the role of dark, emotionally disturbed psychopath to perfection. It seems like every time they are casting a part like that in a movie, David Morse is on speed dial. Sarah Roemer, while very charming as girl next door, Ashley Carlson, seemed nothing more than eye candy in the whole scheme of things. The subplot about the romance between her and Kale did not seem necessary to the plot.<br/><br/>It's not that ""Disturbia"" is a bad movie, it was just a somewhat disappointing movie. Had I watched it with lower expectations, I may have felt better about it. I would still recommend it since I've heard many other people say that they did enjoy it."

The writing is also than most thriller with a teenage cast because they all interact with each other very well and the adult actors also have a GREAT chemistry with the younger actors. The execution is AMLOST FLAWLESS because there is very little continuity errors. The editing is also FANTASTIC because the transition between Kale's house and Ashley's house is EXCELLENT because Kale's house and Ashley's house were NOT next door to each other, Kale's house was shot at one location and Ashley's house was shout a completely different location and the continuity between them is SEAMLESS. I LOVED this movie so much that I made a music video called Disturbia Moment on http://www.youtube.com/kardallastx because I thought Disturbed would go perfect with this song."
"padiyark","5","1","3","24 September 2007"," Overrated
","Rear Window meets teeny-bopper flick. That's basically how to describe this film. SPOILERS........this movie could have worked on a paranoia level (a la American ""Dark Water"") and kept along that track. However, while the first half starts out pretty decent and looks like it will lead to paranoid schizo thoughts, it segue-ways into a teen love story, and then just drops into a stupid, PG-13'esque slasher mode, with no common sense whatsoever. Many lapses in story telling (e.g. where's Mom through half the story) coupled with a stereotypical ending should have made this a direct-to-DVD flick instead. Only saving grace may be Shaia LeBeouf, who is charismatic, and has potential to go places. Otherwise, pure fluff."
"McQualude","5","1","3","22 September 2007"," Cliché and formulaic thriller
","Kale was a very unlikeable main character who basically becomes a delinquent after his dad is killed in a car wreck. I've read excuses about how it's tough when a parent dies, well not to put too fine a point on it but everyone's parents die and this movie takes place a year later. There is no excuse for Kale's behavior. We get a glimpse of why Kale might be acting out so flagrantly as his mother only shows up when he gets in trouble. But suddenly Kale goes from rebellious knothead to first rate guy when a nice piece of tail moves in next door and Kale gets to spend his time ogling her tail (and so do we) as she does aerobics, swims and reads. The piece of tail, played by Sarah Roemer, inevitably falls for Kale, the badboy next door. We can only presume she likes being watched. Eventually Kale begins to believe his other neighbor is a serial killer and you can, and will, guess where it goes from there.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf plays the same character as in Transformers. Sarah Roemer plays the same character as Megan Fox in Transformers. David Morse plays as David Morse. Carrie Ann Moss sleepwalks through her minor role."
"dakidd00","3","1","3","5 September 2007"," I can't believe this is considered a ""good"" thriller these days.
","I heard good things about this movie, and I just can't believe it... Hitchcock must be rolling in his grave. First of all, there was almost no suspense or even setup for the matter. The movie had 1 ""suspenseful"" scene which was when the friend was being seen on video in the neighbors house.<br/><br/>First of all, the father dying angle was pointless. It was nothing more than an excuse to get him under house arrest and it's basically never touched on again, and never used for character or plot development.<br/><br/>The characters are flat and predictable and nothing at all comes from his surveillance of people's routines. Ashley reacts calmly when she is trapped in her own car with someone she's pretty convinced is a murderer. I see a lot more bikini scenes (thank goodness) in her future, because her acting has a long way to go. Then this guy is hiding rotting corpses in his house, and he's comfortable enough to let the cops search his house because well, the bodies are in a grated vent.... how could he ever be found out we wonder?? The WHOLE movie was like listening to the National Anthem at a baseball game. EVERYONE knows what's coming, everyone sings along, everyone knows how it ends and you go through the paces. There are no other possible suspects, there is no internal doubt or strife, there are almost no naysayers (maybe the cops, but not even really, they even find it plausible) and there is no conflict. Hell even, The Burbs had more suspense than this movie.<br/><br/>It's one savor was Lebouf's performance. He turned a character with no meat at all into something believable, and most importantly likable. He kept them movie moving along, and I do think he's going to have a great career. Hopefully he'll end up looking back on Disturbia as one of his worst movies."
"jone6543","6","1","3","27 August 2007"," Could have been better...
","The beginning: The fishing dialog was so unnecessary to me. It added time to the film that was not needed. I have seen it twice and still cannot tell you what they were talking about - just a waste. I realize they were setting up the relationship between the father & son, but they could have done that in a shorter amount of time in the car before the wreck.<br/><br/>The middle: I think the touches of humor through-out this part of the film were nice. I think it focused too much on the romance and made us wait too long for the thrills. A friend of mine said ""If we hadn't been watching it with you, I would have turned it off. It was dragging out too long."" <br/><br/>The climax: When the actual thriller part of the movie started going, it was pretty good. I think it was well done. The comedic touches with the friend were great.<br/><br/>The ending: As expected...<br/><br/>Overall, entertaining but long. They could have shortened it by about 20 minutes without taking away from the film. Actually, that would have improved the film."
"lancersrulenojoke","10","1","3","17 August 2007"," Best Movie Ever
","I absolutely loved this movie. In My Opinion, I Think Its The Best Movie Ever. This movie is an exciting thriller. The Thing that makes this movie so good is that it has a mix of quite a few genres. drama, comedy, horror, and suspense. Shia LaBeouf Stars in this movie about a guy named Kale whose father dies in a car crash. Kale beats up his teacher for making a snobby remark about his father, forcing him to be on house arrest. His mom removes all sources of possible entertainment. So he starts watching his neighbors. He grows a fondness for one of his cute neighbors, Ashley. Later on, he would find out that his neighbor, Mr. Turner could possibly be a murderer."
"buzzbruin","4","1","3","13 August 2007"," It falls apart
","I saw this flick on net flix. I rented it primarily because of Shia Leboeuf. It started out interestingly as a thriller, starting slowly and developing some tension following the Rear Window routine, gradually letting the audience in on various secrets. David Morse was good as a suspect, affable but menacing. It also, in the first two thirds of the movie avoided gore blood, etc. I like the characters except for SLs friend who I think was grossly over the top and way too fey. The girl lead was intriguing, but not fleshed out enough as a person. THEN at the last one-third of the movie it fell completely apart degenerating into an obvious slasher--just awful. I say don't see this movie,unlike Fracture it just isn't interesting enough to waste your time on."

","I've seen a lot of movies in my short time of being on earth (18-years) and I must say this movie is excellent. I had high expectations when saying I was going to watch this movie, and I must say that those expectations were def. head on. I thought this movie was amazing, I loved the way everything fell together at the end, and the whole plot of the movie. Although, in the beginning of the movie the plot wasn't too great, and I was thinking to myself, this is similar to phone booth, one place, this is hardly going to be a good movie. Next thing you know, it crept up on me, and I started really getting into it. Towards the end, the movie really had me on the edge of my seat, and I was really biting me nails. (no lie) In my opinion, it was one of the best movies I've watched. <br/><br/>Also, if you are into the pretty type, Kate was amazingly gorgeous if I do say so myself. <br/><br/>Anyone who is thinking about watching this movie, don't think... just do it. It's well worth the $5.00 dollar rental fee, or however much your local Blockbuster charges. Anyone who doesn't have the money to rent this movie... I feel bad for you, dig in your pockets, and break your piggy banks, this is a must watch movie."
"vsilly25","Null","1","3","26 June 2007"," Best teen scare movie in a while
","This film is aimed right at my demographic (16 year old) so I thought it was great. I went in a group of 5 on opening night in a theater packed with teens just like me. I was skeptical due to the genre and Shia Leobouf, who i didn't like in Holes. The movie starts right away and keeps you in right to the end. This movie relies on suspense and the suspense sticks around until the awesome climax of the last 20 minutes of the movie. In a theater of jumpy teenagers, the last 20 minutes caused everyone to scream at every little shock, which were genuine, not cheesy. This movie didn't rely on gore, which is good because i'm not good with gore. Although there were a few clichés (the thunder & lightning at the climax, Why don't people call the cops BEFORE going into a persons house) the rest of the movie overcame them and it isn't surprising that this movie was a hit at the box office. I liked it so much that i got my sister to see it again with me so i could prove how good it was. 9/10"
"marcl97","8","1","3","28 May 2007"," A Thriller with a Sense of Humour
","I saw ""Disturbia"" last night. It was obvious that up and coming actor Shia LaBeouf did a great acting job. He was perfectly cast and I think it's safe to say that most people root for him throughout the movie.<br/><br/>After thinking a bit more today, I realized that the movie is really more clever than I had originally thought. Pulling off a thriller that's part comedy, part horror show, and part teenager romance is no easy task. Overall, the pieces fit well in this fast, energetic film.<br/><br/>Getting back to the leading man -- Shia LaBeouf. He's only about 20 but has already built up quite an impressive resume. He's made appearances in movies including the recent films ""Bobby"" and ""I, Robot"" plus episodes of some of the best TV shows such as ""ER"" and ""The X Files."" Now he's front and center. He does not have typical movie star looks. He does not look like he spends half his day working out with a personal trainer. He's all substance and with ""Disturbia,"" proves that he belongs in the driver's seat."

It starts great, lots of suspense and a very believable storyline. After the halfway point however this entire movie turns into one cliché after another which is very frustrating.<br/><br/>It seems that the entire second half was just a rush to the finish with no regard for the viewer.

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","8","1","3","27 April 2007"," An entertaining movie experience all around...thrilling, funny, and sweet
","Disturbia was a big surprise for me, as I went in with low expectations because of the lead actor, Shia LaBeouf. I really underestimated his ability to be a leading actor in a thriller, as he more than carries the film with his character, Kale.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around rough around the edges teenager Kale, who is under house arrest following a mishap at school, which resulted from a life changing event. Being stuck inside all day, Kale gets bored easily, and soon finds entertainment in watching his neighbors: a bunch of young pranksters, an adulterous spouse, a man who keeps to himself (David Morse), and his newest neighbor, a beautiful girl named Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Like any teenage boy, Kale soon focuses his attention on her, and after the two finally meet, they realize that one of the neighbors may be hiding a deadly secret: he's a serial killer.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is really well done considering the fact that this is aimed at teenagers, and sometimes the acting falls in these kind of films. Shia LaBeouf does a great job of developing a likable character that the audience really identifies with. He balances the comedy and drama very well, as the film does have some laugh out loud funny moments. You'll be rooting for Kale the whole time, even though he's not the most perfect person in the world. Sarah Roemer also provides a unique character that may seem stereotypical at first, but becomes a lot more as Ashley and Kale interact. She is likable, and it's not just because she's drop dead gorgeous. David Morse delivers as always a chilling and mysterious performance that stands above the rest. He is one of the better villainous actors around, and this film only strengthens that claim. You'll never know where he's going to go next, which adds a lot to the suspense. The director, DJ Caruso, could have taken the character in a lot of directions, but I'm glad that Morse's character is how he is. It would have been very easy to make him the classic villain who is scary, yet we know what he is capable of. Due to the mystery provided by Caruso, Morse, and writer Carl Ellsworth, we get the most mysterious villain in a long time. Carrie Anne Moss also adds some nice moments as Kale's mother. I would have liked to see more of her character and how she deals with the personal tragedy in the beginning of the film, but I understand it because the film is about Kale.<br/><br/>Ellsworth also penned 2005's Red Eye, which Disturbia is eerily similar to. Both films have a villain who doesn't reveal his intentions at first. Both films have leading characters who have just endured personal tragedies. The main setting of both films is in one place (Red Eye was an airplane, Disturbia was Kale's house). The climaxes are similar as the lead character runs to another place to save someone they love. I almost lost faith in DJ Caruso after Two For the Money, but he did a great job with Disturbia, providing a great movie experience that you should watch in a group. Sit back, and relax as this film takes you through the funny, the scary, the thrilling, the heartbreaking, and the heartwarming emotions that make movies great. Due to some scary scenes and violent content, Disturbia isn't appropriate for those under age 12 or 13.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"
"Robert_duder","8","1","3","26 April 2007"," Disturbia does what it promises and makes for a terrific thriller
","From the opening scenes to the death defying close Disturbia is the further thing from your run of the mill teen suspense flick. This is the type of thriller anyone would enjoy going to the movies to see. A strong cast, a well paced story, terrific character developments and enough jumps and shocking suspense to keep you riveted to your seat. Within the first five minutes of the film I promise your mouth will hang open and you jump out of your seat from the terrifying beginning that sets the emotional pace for the rest of the film. Director D.J. Caruso, who is mostly known for his Television work does something really remarkable with this script and creates an impending sense of doom and suspicion that so many critics and fans are comparing to Hitchcock's Rear Window. That's not a bad thing to be compared to, Rear Window is considered by many to be the best suspense film ever made. None of the film makers have claimed this to be a remake or based on but nonetheless the comparison is there and it doesn't mean the film isn't worth seeing. On the contrary Disturbia is perhaps one of the best movies out there right now to see on the big screen and is sure to be a smash.<br/><br/>Up and coming star Shia LaBeouf who has a big year ahead of him with Transformers and has been on my radar ever since Holes and The Greatest Game Ever Played grows up a little and plays troubled teenager Kale, who gets himself into trouble when he punches a teacher. In hopes of rehabilitating young Kale the judge sentences him to three months of house arrest using an electronic ankle bracelet that disables Kale's ability to leave any where further than his own yard. That pretty much establishes the tone. LaBeouf is easy to watch on screen, has a commanding screen presence for such a young actor and is very versatile and down to earth. I think any teenager could relate to him and an adult can enjoy his performance thoroughly. Aaron Yoo is kind of the stereotypical best friend, the over zealous, comedian who is almost destined to die at the hands of the killer. But Yoo does a good job and makes you care about his character and is an important part of the chemistry between the main characters. Yoo and LeBeouf have good chemistry opposite each other. Relative newcomer Sarah Roemer makes her starring debut as the eye candy and love interest in the film, Ashley. Right from her first scene they are shooting her waist down from behind and putting her in bikini's and wet clothes and making sure the teenage boys in the audience aren't going anywhere. Granted Roemer is a beautiful girl but fortunately for her and us she shows more depth once she becomes a bigger player in the plot. Roemer and LaBeouf are downright hot together and have a terrific romance and actually adds a whole new element to the story despite the rather creepy way they meet (Kale spying on her from his window.) She also turns in a strong female performance. Carrie-Anne Moss takes a bit of back seat as Kale's frustrated mother. Her role is small but she does well when she's on screen. And finally but certainly not least, one of my favorite character actors Mr. David Morse who has stunned and shocked in so many great performances from TV's House to The Crossing Guard to Bait...he always makes a great bad guy, while still remaining so calm and almost likable. Morse once again brings that to Disturbia as the next door neighbor that Kale begins to get suspicions of. Half of Morse's performance is in his eyes, his body language and his voice. It's just enthralling and hypnotic and you want to like the guy but you easily believe he's a cold blooded killer. He is the perfect adversary to LaBeouf's hero.<br/><br/>I don't think there is anyone who can't find something incredibly watchable and enjoyable about Disturbia. The beauty of it is it's layers because it's so much more than just about the neighbor who might be a serial killer. As LaBeouf mentions in one scene ""Welcome to Disturbia"" because Disturbia is more than just that aspect. It's the man across the road having the affair on his wife with the maid, it's the new people next door fighting all the time, it's himself being confined to his room and spying on everyone...that's Disturbia. This film is brilliant and a terrific action thriller. Definitely check this one out for a good time at the movies or later on DVD release!! 8.5/10"
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","6","1","4","19 August 2008"," Interesting, but it takes the (very) easy way out.
","An intriguing premise is a must for any good thriller. Whatever bizarre set of rules or restrictions the film can set on it's protagonist, as long as they aren't outright ridiculous, can propel him/her/them on a wild ride. ""Disturbia"" starts like that with a great opening act that sets up an interesting situation: a housebound high schooler is convinced that his neighbor is a serial killer. He is on probation and on house arrest so he gets his friend and another neighbor to help him investigate. Obviously this is virtually a remake on the Hitchcock classic ""Rear Window,"" but the fresh setting and reworked scenario make way for some great suspense as doubts about characters and situations are teasingly probed along the way.<br/><br/>However, this clever and tense setup leads to a tense, but highly dull overdone conclusion. Thus, the set up is reworked, but the end is all the same, but with more violence than Hitchcock ever showed. All doubts are simply erased and the characters and situations suddenly become black and white. It's a shame that a film goes through obvious and noble attempts at showing something new, but then reverts back to the same old cliché for the end. It would have been better the other way around with a clichéd start and an unexpected and unpredictable ending. That way there would have been a good pay-off. But this is just taking the easy way out and that's a shame. --- 6/10<br/><br/>BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence"

","Disturbia was released only last year and I consider it a full-on classic, it is on my best films rack along with classics like Big Fish, Amelie, Lord of the Rings & The Godfather.<br/><br/>Usually I never really feel like commenting on a movie on it's IMDb board. But I have to release my thoughts on this film. It entertains from start to finish, scaring the light out of me. I am a wimp when it comes to horror movies. Usually I don't see the point in scaring yourself. But usually I never see a film quite like DISTURBIA. I was NOT looking forward to seeing this movie, but I went because a friend wanted to, she hated it. I loved it.<br/><br/>A rather depressed teenager who is quite misfitted & lonely a year after witnessing his Dad's death starts spying on his neighbours noticing an incredibly attractive new girl next door & a serial killer kidnapper as well. Him, his male friend & the new girl all become close friends & attempt to solve the murder man's mystery while his mother becomes the kidnappers target.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Rear Window, I hear this rips off it. MY OPINION: If it truly does, why care? There are remakes & take-offs everywhere & it's bringing a great olden day tale to a new generation.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeaouf is greatly fitted for the lead role, his acting is great & he really makes you believe. All the characters have little hooks & characteristics that make them really enjoyable. Good characters = Great movie.<br/><br/>The storyline is great because it leaves big enough room for the serial killer storyline without ignoring the characters personal lives, feelings, back rounds & different story lines all together. Sure the end is expected, but not unpleasantly so.<br/><br/>It has just the right amount of gore, without making you feel sick but still enough for some 'squeams'. I love the movie because it's scary without being graphic, leaves you creeped out, suspensed, thrilled & yet has very little violence.<br/><br/>The start was not really fitting to the whole undertone of the movie & the songs chosen for scenes don't really fit. So I let it out, there are 2 flaws for an otherwise perfect (in my opinion) movie.<br/><br/>It manages to be a creepy psychological horror while still maintaining it's teen dramedy. For anyone who likes films with dream sequences, girls next door, surprise attacks, serial killers, depressed kids, teens solving mysteries & widows this is a must!"

","""Disturbia"" is about a teenager named Kale (Shia LaBeouf), who has grown depressed after his father died in a horrible car crash. The withdrawn teenager finds himself in more trouble, much to the dismay of his mother (Carrie-Anne Moss), and ends up put on house arrest for the entire summer - three months locked away in his homelike a prisoner. He begins watching the outside world through binoculars, and forms a relationship with a girl who just moved into the neighborhood, Ashley (Sarah Roemer). But his spying of the local residents uncovers something he wasn't expecting - he sees Mr. Turner (David Morse), a shy, older man, under strange circumstances - women showing up at his house, blood splattering over the windows, screams, and other bizarre things that lead Kale, Ashley, and his friend Ronnie to believe that Mr. Turner is a serial killer. The three begin to stalk the man for more clues, but soon find themselves in more danger than they bargained for.<br/><br/>Okay, okay, I wasn't thinking this film was going to be very good. I mean, PG-13 horror/thrillers generally are pretty poor (filled with tiresome ""jump"" scares and awful CGI computer effects), so I wasn't expecting much out of this, but I had heard some good things so I decided I had to rent it. And, much to my surprise, I was completely blown away at how good it turned out to be! Quite obviously a modern-day homage to Hitchock's film ""Rear Window"", which boasts a very similar premise, ""Disturbia"" is one heck of a thriller. In terms of storyline, we've seen this idea done before - person witnesses murder next-door from their upstairs window. DePalma's ""Sisters"" and Hitchock's ""Rear Window"" are a couple of films that come to mind for the use of this idea, but it's done in a refreshing manner here for modern audiences, and what can I say - it was great! Not much happens within the first forty-five minutes or so of the movie, we only get the general idea of our villain, but we get to know the characters first and there is some comedy thrown in. The second half, however, is pretty intense and things get darker as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Suspense runs rampant in this movie, and I was surprised at how often I found myself on the edge of my seat, chewing on my fingernails. The scene between Ashely and Mr. Turner in the car, and the final twenty minutes or so are both excellent examples of some genuine suspense. The scripting is solid and the possible areas where you'd think a plot hole may be hidden are filled, which was also a big surprise. While there are a couple of good jumps, the movie also shies away from the over-abundance of jump scares found in this type of film (and genre, in particular) these days, and there aren't too many clichés, either. The scariness is mostly found in the suspense and the imagery. The characters in this movie are also smart, another thing rarely found in most horror flicks. They know when they are in danger, they use the right weapons, and they don't make stupid moves, so it adds to their credibility and makes you care about them more. The modern ideas in the film are also fun to watch (electronic voyeurism, video cameras, etc.), and are a nice spin on this recycled story. It's not a gory movie either, so those expecting some sort of splatter flick will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf plays our lead character, Kale, the troubled teenager with a serial killer for a neighbor, quite well. He's believable playing his type of character, and looks and acts like most teenagers do. Plus, despite his troubles, he's likable. The talented Carrie-Anne Moss plays his mother well, balancing authority and friendliness, and Sarah Roemer plays Kale's friendly and witty love interest. David Morse is downright scary as Mr. Turner. His expressions, mannerisms, and overall demeanor gives the audience that feeling that something isn't quite right, but it also keeps you guessing and makes things hard to pin down. All these things in the movie lead up to it's well-played (but a little bit far-fetched) finale. The film's conclusion on the romance factor did make things seem a little corny, but I couldn't let it interfere because I really enjoyed the rest of it.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Disturbia"" was a huge surprise for me. It's a PG-13 horror movie that delivers some excellent suspense and some great entertainment. It's a recycled, teenage version of a story that we have seen before, but it contains enough originality and suspense to keep things fresh. If you're a fan of thrillers or horror movies, this is a PG-13 one that is very much worth watching, don't let the rating put you off. I was so surprised at how good it was that I could hardly believe it. I really enjoyed this, and this was a big surprise to me, personally. 9/10."

","Everyone has a day when they sit around the house because there's nothing to do, even if it's a nice day. Very few have a day when they cannot leave because of a reason by the law. For Kale (Shia LeBeouf), that's how it's going to be for the next three months.<br/><br/>This is the setting of Disturbia, the new teenage thriller that looks like most every other movie with a PG-13 rating, but surprisingly, almost sets itself into an R rating by putting all the suspense and fear that many feel should be experienced throughout the movie by placing in the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows Kale, a troubled teenager who gets put under house arrest for 3 months following an incident at school. How Kale lives during most of his Summer is mostly boredom. His Xbox 360, Ipod and Cable have been disabled by his mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) who has declared that house arrest is exactly what it's going to be. Now that Kale has no entertainment, he turns to a pair of Binoculars and finds the outside world is something that does not get observed so much as we live it.<br/><br/>He recognizes little lives in the neighbors that are different, people who are not the same than how they act, and the girl next door (Sarah Roemer) who happens to like Kale and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). The movie really starts to heat up when Kale believes his neighbor(David Morse) is a killer. The evidence is right there. Or is it? What if this is the actions of a bored kid during house arrest? Could his eyes being deceiving him, or could he be actually on to something? Now, surprisingly, this is actually a very good movie about the idea of how much one pays attention to the outside world, something very few of us actually do in real life. Not surprisingly, the movie takes awhile to actually get into what we are experiencing later in the story as the thriller part, but it's all good, since unlike most thrillers, the characters are explained in mere seconds, and nothing develops on them, just the fact that many of them have dimensions flatter than cardboard. I also enjoyed the performance of David Morse, whose creepy Mr. Turner provides a lot of suspense, and his looks and role are quite intimidating. So intimidating because of how cool he acts, and how vile he can become in this film.<br/><br/>For the parts that I felt were a bit unnecessary was the character Ronnie, who really serves no purpose to the plot. He comes off annoying, and until the last 25 or 30 minutes, does he actually have any involvement with the plot at all. I also dislike the judgment that is brought down on Carrie-Anne Moss for her role in this movie. Apparently, three Matrix films later, everyone wants her to be shooting bad guys and defying reality while sporting leather. Don't worry, she's a very good actress, and don't think because she's done the Matrix movies that she cannot act well, because her performance is top notch.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie delivers enough thrills and ""on the edge of your seat"" moments during the second half of the film, despite the movie taking awhile through character development to get there. The suspense is nail biting, and the finale is quite rewarding. There are a few flaws in the characters and moments, but none that should be taken into close enough consideration to declare this a movie that needs to be missed.<br/><br/>8/10"
"pinkchi","5","1","4","7 May 2007"," A darker, teenage Home Alone
","With the gadgets and set-up it is reminiscent of the popular movie Home Alone, except that there's also the clichéd storyline of ""I think my neighbour is a psycho-killer"". Nothing new, acting is decent enough for a movie of this quality and you have to suspend your beliefs when watching this movie. Not impressive, although not one of the worst movies, you have to lower your expectations when watching this movie as there are substantial plot holes and half of the movie is focused on your boy-girl relationship. Even the action sequence is not thrilling enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Perhaps this will be more popular among the younger teenagers or Shia's fans."

The movie had a good beginning, and you never knew when the scary parts were coming! That's what made the movie so great. The story of the movie was creepy, and thrilling, and they chose the right actors for the parts too. There were never any boring parts, and the story just kept on moving. Movie like that are always better. The actor who played the killer was perfect for the part, and after the movie you couldn't get his face out of your head!

","I haven't heard of this director before now. I think he is someone that other directors will have to watch closely. He is good at seeing the obvious as it pertains to human nature. That is a good skill to have in the movie biz. I don't know where he picked his cast from, Wow! he had some babes working their magic. The body parts didn't sit well with me at first, It kinda shocked me to see that on the screen. I thought about it, just part of the scene. You know, It is a thriller. If people don't like it, they don't have to watch it. I will just have to buy it on DVD. I think it will be a good date movie. She will jump in my lap.<br/><br/>HMMM.........I think most men would like to have their dates in their lap.<br/><br/>Back to the movie, that mustang was cool! It's good to have classic cars in movies. It brings me back to when I was younger. What would be totally cool, if the directors would cast me in some new movie. I would work cheap and be that good at it. That's what I've done my whole life. That is the reason people hate me. I don't care if they do, if they don't want to know someone who will actually look after them, I say, you know. I look after people because it's the right thing to do.

This was my favorite movie so far this year next to 300. It was so cool had David Morse just some how knew that they were on to him and that he had a torture chamber and a room for keeping all his tools for just cutting up his women that he kills and how the cop that was in charge of watching him was the cousin of the teacher that he hit.

"fertilecelluloid","7","1","4","23 April 2007"," Nothing original, but a solid, efficient thriller with a few authentic shocks
","""Disturbia"", a contemporary reworking of ""Rear Window"", is nothing original or unpredictable, but it is well written, skilfully directed, and intelligently cast. Kale (Shia LeBeouf) has been electronically confined to his home for the holidays after punching out his teacher. Bored and listless, he begins spying on Ashley (Sara Roemer), the hottie next door, and Mr. Turner (David Morse), the killer next door. When Turner realizes that Kale is on to him, he acts to prevent the boy from exposing his murderous ways to the police. As usual, Morse is creepy and convincing. Le Beouf makes his character real and, to his credit, doesn't come across as too obnoxious or smug. Roemer is a tasty teenage treat and adds plenty of PG-13 spice to the proceedings. Director DJ Caruso does a good job of keeping the action sequences clear and clutter-free. For a PG-13 film, it is quite brutal, but there is no lingering gore. The score by Geoff Zanelli is really very effective and adds an uneasy mood and tone. You won't find anything groundbreaking here, but there are a few nice surprises and one or two authentic shocks."
"boothstr96","9","1","4","23 April 2007"," Superb film. Caruso will be Recognized
","Though most probably won't notice this, this film really showed the reality of human nature as well as the scaryness of it. The acting was so realistic towards the situations i actually was scared for each of them. What i mean is, when the Asian dude has to get the code for the garage, you can see how freaked out he gets and that is what people really would do. Most actors act like we never would. And the characters only ""go after the creepy noises"" (which we all hate in movies) when they need to save someone. Caruso really thought about all the angles of it well. Also when the new neighbor has a party and he sees her talking to other guys. We see him get jealous and we all know that really happens in life. The story is ""slow"" getting into the main plot that we have seen in the trailer but it is amusing and still keeps you intrigued. They also throw in some good humor that keeps us amused. Overall this was a really great film and i recommend every one go watch it."

Once you knew there was something not right in ""Disturbia"", you could see the ending coming, but it didn't fail to get the theater crowd involved. David Morse at his most wicked (great job).

I came out with a new favorite movie. It wasn't only a scary movie but a scary movie with romance in it. Disturbia is a movie with something in it for both guys and girls. The relationship between Kale and Ashley is amazing. When they finally get together at Ashley's party after Kale plays his music, it is like i had a sigh of relief. Anyway, the action in the movie is just as amazing as the romance. None of it is over exaggerated and keeps you on your toes. I believe this is an amazing movie and i would recommend seeing it."

"ChiefGoreMongral","5","1","4","19 April 2007"," Gore Mongral's Movie Review: Disturbia
","Howdy Folks!! Im back again with a short and sweet review for the Film Disturbia take a look!!! Disturbia is the tale of a young boy who after his father passes away has a bought with getting into trouble with the law. He is put on house arrest and after finding complete and total boredom being stuck in his house he resorts to becoming a peeping tom. Unfortunately he finds out a little more than he bargains for as his next door neighbor may very well be a killer.<br/><br/>I do not want to waste a lot of time on a review for such a mediocre title as this was. It has its moments but they are too far in between all the teenage humor made famous by the supposed horror/thrillers of the 90's. This more or less plays out the same way as all the 90's and PG-13 ""Hip"" and ""Cool"" bannered flicks work, queue the corny humor with the token comic relief character, throw in relatively bloodless kill scenes (very little in that department by the way) and way to much focus on the boy meets girl story and you pretty much have the idea of what your in for.<br/><br/>Fans of 90's and PG-13 ""Horror-Lite"" movies will probably enjoy themselves more than I did however it is what it is and saying that I give Disturbia 5/10 Average Teeny Bopper Horror/Thriller-Lite material here. A Rear Window style story dumbed down for the current generation is what you get here. Not totally as bad as most films of its kind but definitely not worth the price of admission, for fans of this kind of film only. All hardcore Horror and Hitchcockian Thriller fans can bypass this at the door."
"gregsrants","6","1","4","15 April 2007"," Rear Window meets the 'burbs
","The opening tragedy in Disturbia hit me like a head-on crash (wink wink nod nod). When the film opens with Kale (Shia LaBeouf) and father Daniel (Matt Craven) fly fishing in a remote river, I settled in for a slow start to what will eventually end up being a Rear Window-ish type thriller as advertised in the television spots. So there I was, nestled in my chair, comfortable, with my fingers interlocked with my date expecting a slow start to the introduction of our main characters.<br/><br/>Then it happens, and whammo  an expected heart thump that threw my hand back into my lap so that the Misses could put her hands over her eyes. Welcome to Disturbia, the new film by D.J Caruso (no, not David) who is better known around these parts for his television series direction than his big screen efforts.<br/><br/>Disturbia is an ode to Hitchcock's Rear Window (whether it wants to garnish the comparison or not) that is taunt, fun and exciting even if it offers us nothing new.<br/><br/>The premise is set when Kale pops his Spanish teacher after a comment is made about his father. This results in Kale being put under house arrest for three months that includes an ankle bracelet that alerts the local authorities if he strays further than 100 feet away from the monitoring system.<br/><br/>House arrest is something that most high school brats would welcome with open X-Boxes. Between the cable television, the porn and the constant parade of video games being thrown into the big screen television, it is a dream come true for the underachiever.<br/><br/>But when party pooper 'mom' steps up to the plate and hits a triple off the right field fence by cutting the cable to the television and cutting the internet options, Kale passes time by watching the neighbors and coming up with interpretations based on his observations (think Tom Hanks in the 'burbs without the humor).<br/><br/>At first, it is just simple suburbia type behavior. People going to work, possible affairs occurring in their absences. Kale's new interest is in watching new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) as she takes dips in the pool, dresses and undresses in the bedroom and suntans on the roof of her home. Kale has so much fun in his adolescent perversion that he soon has friend Roonie (Aaron Yoo  think Harold of Harold & Kumar without the humor) coming over to partake in the perversion peeking.<br/><br/>As expected, Ashley catches the two horn dogs spying and soon she is re-enacting a scene from The Girl Next Door (without the humor) by coming over after a swim and confronting the two homeboys. Welcoming herself into the house and up to Kale's room, Ashley appreciates the snooping on the unsuspecting neighborhood and soon adds fuel to the rumor fires  especially in regards to neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse, acting like David Morse without the humor).<br/><br/>It would seem that Mr. Turners actions are just a tad bit suspicious and recent news about the disappearances of a young female leads the three peepers to connect dots that may or may not be relevant.<br/><br/>These suspicions lead Kale, Roonie and Ashley into full Magnum P.I. mode where they follow Mr. Turner, break into his house and investigate a la Cody Banks (with more humor).<br/><br/>Is Mr. Turner a killer or is he just a strange old man that fits the clues for convenience? Well, without revealing more than the trailers already suggest, Kale and the Gang (like Kool & the Gang only cooler) fight time, the law and even an aggressively irate Turner in an attempt to solve the crime and put an end to his possible reign of terror.<br/><br/>Disturbia is one of those movies that has been stripped from countless other films from both the thriller/suspense and the teenage coming of age type genres yet still works on many levels as it maintains a taunt schedule and still keeps the thrills and humor coming at a pace quicker than a Johnny Cochrane defense.<br/><br/>By the time we get to the action packed ending we are engrossed in the mystery ourselves and we duck with every swing of a bat and swish of a blade. When Mr. Turner goes off, we root for the good guys and luckily we are paid back in our investment with characters that seem smart enough to make the right moves (i.e. running from the bad guy instead of towards him) in an attempt to ultimately survive the night. Even the underused Carrie-Anne Moss acts like a mother would and should if put into the circumstances that eventually will put her in peril.<br/><br/>The ending of Disturbia is interesting if not a bit of a stretch in comparison to the rest of the film, but hell, if a guy is going be accused of killing women I will be damned if we don't get an ending that concludes in a dark and dank basement.<br/><br/>None of the above makes Disturbia a classic, but it does rank up there with Red Eye of last year as a film that delivers the goods even if the goods are pre-packaged.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"
"ags123","3","1","5","21 September 2008"," ""Rear Window"" for a new generation.
","As pointed out many times in other reviews, this is a teenage remake of ""Rear Window."" ""Juvenile"" might indeed be an apt description for it. Hitchcock's masterpiece succeeds in implicating the audience in the dire consequences of voyeurism. It also leaves doubt about whether a murder occurred until the end. That complex psychology is missing from ""Disturbia,"" replaced with teenage angst and slasher-movie violence. In a simplistic coda and a tip of the hat to the original, ""Disturbia"" leaves us by resolving another neighbor's dilemma  in this case, reporting the children across the street for watching pornography. Sad, how society, movies and movie audiences have changed."

Things start to get weird, when guests would enter Robert Turner's house and not come back out. Kale and his friends Ronnie and Ashley Carlson start to grow more and more interested in what is actually happening within the house of Robert Turner.<br/><br/>I never got around to watching this when it was originally shown on the cinema. I heard only good things about this film, and after viewing 'Transformers' i became a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf, so this was one film which i really wanted to see. I was not disappointed. Let me get it out the way first. Shia LaBeouf was as fantastic and natural as he always is. All the other stars were great, especially Aaron Yoo and David Morse. The film proves that you don't need blood and gore to make a decent horror. Although the horror doesn't start till the first hour has gone, it builds a lot on the suspense, and really keeps you on the edge of your seat.

","Disturbia, maybe a teen thriller, maybe a insight on an over shadowed life. Shia LaBeouf, maybe the cutest guy on earth, maybe a bloody good actor. Disturbia was a little creepy, a little sneaky and a little funny. And as for the cast, a little intimidating. It was a very lonely film at the start, but it warmed up to a film that is typically teenager aimed. Kale (Shia LaBeouf), a lonely kid who lost his father at maybe his own expense, gets home detention after punching his teacher out (lovely i know) finds 'constructive' things to do, one of them being spying on your neighbours. From kids watching age restricted programmes, affairs while wives go to tennis to a killer who suddenly turns up in your house with your mother. But of course, you can't spy on this killer on your own, or get evidence when your sentenced to your home or else. There has to be a girl involved, namingly Ashley (Sarah Roemer) who spends most of her time on the roof of her house than actually in her house, more time in a pool than on her roof and more time with Kale trying to catch the killer than she does in the pool (arent i just clever). The whole movie is carried by the excellent performances of Shia, Sarah and David and a bit of thrilling nail biters. It was really awesome in the sense that it's almost a remake of a Hitchcock classic. To end it, a must see!"
"dbnjr","7","1","5","9 August 2007"," Pretty Strong Film
","This movie was overall very good. The only issue I have is the fact that it takes 45 minutes to build the characters Kale and Ashley, and to a lesser extent, Ronnie. I came in expecting to be jump right into the thriller it was being advertised as fairly soon into the movie. It did not do that. I also feel that it is ridiculous that so many largely quality films have to have a romantic conflict/interest in them. This movie would have lost nothing if it had removed the Kale-Ashley soap opera. However, the last 45 minutes or so was very good. Not so much scary, but definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart pounding."

Anyway the lead female role ""love interest"" was horribly skinny, the type of skinny that makes you wonder if they had to put makeup on her scarred knuckles between takes, the type of skinny that gives young girls horrible body complexes-though she was not a horrible casting choice. The ""asian guy"" best friend character was a little disappointingly portrayed. Bad acting, a token kooky characterthe character was cool but contrived.<br/><br/>All in all though, the collective cast, special effects and phenomenal soundtrack made for a not so regrettable movie.

The older actors like David Morse, played their roles well also.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Shia and Sarah was great and the movie was far more comedic than I would have expected.<br/><br/>So all in all, I saw this four times at the movies and I wouldn't ask for my money back for a second.

"powderizedbookworm","7","1","5","21 April 2007"," The Best Hitchcock Film Not Directed by Alfred Hitchcock
","I went to see this film with very low expectations, not thinking that it could even compare to the brilliant ""Rear Window"" that it is, for all intents and purposes, a remake of. I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Not claiming to be a remake in the title and credits gave the filmmakers creative license to change the plot and characters while keeping the premise essentially the same. This results in a picture that is not so much a shot for shot remake (a la Gus van Zant's ""Psycho""), but ""Rear Window"" as it could have been had Alfred Hitchcock chosen to set the film in suburbia. It is fun for fans of ""Rear Window"" to catch all the homages to the original. The movie oozes suspense, and is very Hitchcock in its style of creating tension. There are some quibbles however, some dialogue and plot points were not believable, and the movie relied too heavily ""jump"" scenes. On the whole, though a good movie, not a great one like ""Rear Window,"" ""Disturbia"" comes highly recommended even for (especially for) fans of Alfred Hitchcock and ""Rear Window"".<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","I absolutely love that fact that little Louis Stevens from Even Stevens is in a mature movie like this, as opposed to his children's show. He did such a better job acting in this movie than I expected. My first thought was that he wouldn't do a good job being in a thriller because he was so juvenile in Even Stevens. But he pulled it off WELL.<br/><br/>The story was done so well, they used not a lot of gore, but just enough.There was so much action in it too. I think this movie, and Dead Silence, are the greatest horror/thrillers in a LONG time. I saw the messengers thinking it would be awesome too, and it wasn't really. <br/><br/>There is so much action in this movie, I never got bored. Sly sense of humour, no really laugh out loud funny parts, but at least it has a sense of humour.

This movie was intense at some times, and very suddle at others. It was mysterious, and it was also a sweet romance. It was one of the best movies that I have ever seen.

"baumer","7","1","5","20 April 2007"," Shia LeBeouf has arrived!
","Here we are in the middle of April, traditionally a dumping ground by studios as they try to make a little extra money before May and the summer bullies suck up all the dollars. Usually the films that come out last a few weeks and then hope for a nice bump once they hit the DVD market. This is Dreamworks foray into the April sweepstakes as they wait just a few more weeks for Shrek the Third to gobble up every single dollar available. Usually April films are weak entries, and while Disturbia is not going to be remembered as one of the greats, it certainly cannot be said that this is a studio dump. Quality wise, cast wise and direction wise, this is a well done thriller with two very attractive leads gracing our screens.<br/><br/>Disturbia is an homage to the Hitchcock film Rear Window, but done for the 14-25 year old age group. Shia LaBouf plays Kale, an angry teenager who has recently lost his dad in a car accident and his anger boils over one day when his Spanish teacher asks him what his dad would think of his insubordination? Kale understandably punches him in the mouth which results in his 90 days of house arrest. His mother, played by Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss), has also cut him off from his X-Box and even cut his TV chord so he is literally left out of the loop. His internet subscription is still good and he has begun to voyeuristic-ally spy on all of his neighbours. He learns of the adultery that goes on across the street, how often people mow the lawn and other small things to alleviate the tedium of his nonexistent life.<br/><br/>And then she moves in. The ""she"" in this case is the hot girl next door. Her name is Ashley, and played by neophyte Sarah Roemer, she about the hottest thing to hit the screen since Elisha Cuthbert in The Girl Next Door. She swims, she sunbathes and she just looks hot in every pose, every stance and everything she does. Soon, his infatuation gets him caught and she shows up at his door, soaking wet, like The Girl Next Door. From here they develop a friendship that soon escalates into a romance. And soon, they are staking out the quiet and strange neighbour, Mr. Turner, played very well by David Morse. The kids think he might be responsible for the disappearances of some local girls and all the signs point to him.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is the young actors. Besides LaBouf and Roemer, you have Aaron Yoo, who plays Kale's best friend, Ronnie. He is the comic relief for the film as his antics, while somewhat questionable at times, also keeps th audience laughing most of the time. And there is a real chemistry between all three of them. The suspense in the film builds nicely as we watch as some more girls disappear and all the signs point to Turner. The problem is, like Hitchcock's Rear Window, no one believes him, especially since he is under house arrest. His credibility is non existent.<br/><br/>Where the film lacks is in the probability and believability department. I just don't buy the fact that all of this could be happening in suburbia America and no one else would notice that the guy is killing people across the street. There are so many signs pointing to Turner being the killer and even when one of the boys goes missing, no one believes him. In real life, not movie life, the cops would at least search the house for a missing kid. Mothers wouldn't dismiss their son's claims that the man across the street is really the boogie man. Even if your son is under house arrest, his complaints would at least be investigated. Also, the killer is a man who has been killing for what seems to be years, and now all of a sudden starts killing his neighbours? I don't buy that either. This is a meticulous man who has planned everything out flawlessly and now he decides that the best thing to do is kill 4 people who live across the street from him. That wouldn't draw attention to you at all? That complaint aside, Disturbia works because it is suspenseful enough, it has likable characters and the direction by D.J. Caruso is very sharp, quick and he creates a palpable tension. This will never be a classic, but it is a very passable entry into the pg-13 horror genre.<br/><br/>7/10"
"gswanson17","5","1","5","19 April 2007"," Sets itself apart, but no lasting appeal.
","The analogy that I have decided appropriate for a film such as this to a classic such as Rear Window (1954) would be the comparison of a fast food meal to that of an elongated meal in a comfortable restaurant. While the same purpose essentially remains, the difference lies in the subtle nuances, attention to detail, and the lingering feeling of the plot. Disturbia plays out like a candy barinitially sweet and satisfying, but inevitably does not have a lasting impact.<br/><br/>I'll start with the positives first. Disturbia has a lot going for it for several reasons. One, it has separated itself far enough from Rear Window, to keep it fresh and inventive enough while still being held under the wide scope of Hitchcock's original film. Second, its incorporation of technology as a primary tool used by the characters is important because it ties the film in with the generation it has been targeted to. The use of computers, cell phone cameras, and various musical devices all create an excitement in the viewer which propels the story on a very linear path. Another interesting, but much more subtle modern twist to the story is the persistence of Hale (Shia LaBeouf) to having a relationship with Ashley (Sarah Roemer). In Rear Window and in the 1950's in general, there was a much more obvious push for a woman to find a man to pursue. As a teen film and as far as society goes, this trend has pretty much reversed, and it was very interesting to see the noticeable foundations of LB Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) and Lisa (Grace Kelly) shine through.<br/><br/>The negatives, unfortunately far outweigh the positives. First, the film settles for cheap explanations and diversions to continue the story without interruption. For example, Hale (Shia LaBeouf) never has a second encounter with the judge even though he violates his terms purposely. The filmmakers have sacrificed reality to drive the narrative, which constrains the viewer to the inconsistencies rather than the impending terror. Second, and in my opinion, the most important factor is the absence of the inner workings of the other neighbors. What was most enjoyed in Rear Window was the seeming irrelevance of the lives of the neighbors. While Disturbia makes it quite clear when and where the conflict will arise, it doesn't let the audience lower their guard or become distracted with others' petty problems as such in Rear Window. The third lies on the character of Mr. Turner (David Morse), who becomes too involved with Hale and his mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) too early in the film. He quickly loses his edge because the audience now has put a personality to a face. In Rear Window, when Mr. Thorwold slowly moves his head to peer into the room of LB Jeffries for the first time, at nearly the end of the film, there is an immediate terror that runs up the audience's spine. They have not met this character and they have no idea of his intentions or what he has done. To the audience, he is an enigma.<br/><br/>It's easy to see that Disturbia has problems that far outweigh its positives; however this is not to say that it's not a fun movie. This is a film that brings back the complete essence of going out to the theater. The popcorn, the screaming pre-teens, and of course the lightning-paced plot all contribute and throw back to the feeling of a night out. While not nearly up to par with Hitchcock's classic, Disturbia definitely sets itself far enough apart from the film to tread in new territory and appeal to a completely different audience."

But I was glad to find out that it had more suspension in it then When A Stranger Calls. It kept my adrenaline going throughout the movie. Shia portrayed Kale's character wonderful! I had always thought of him as the class clown since watching him in Even Stevens and was like oh he can't do drama and I was very pleased to find out that he is an amazing actor! I was glad to see Sarah in this movie because she was a new face to me and I thought she was a wonderful actress and I am looking forward to many more projects she will do in the future!"

","Disturbia had such a steady paced plot and an extremely interesting one, too. Shia LaBeouf did a great job in this thriller. The movie was perfectly made because even though it was extremely thrilling and unmistakably heart- stopping, it didn't become too serious. The best friend of the main character made the flow of the movie smooth and added a much needed break from the never- ending scares in the film. The sneaky insertions of hilarity in the film were very refreshing as viewer. Anyone who enjoys a good scare or likes to watch a teen romance form in the middle of spying on a killer should go see this movie. This movie has become my favorite movie of all time and I plan to see it at least ten thousand more times."

","Dear readers & fellow film buffs, MY summary is correct.<br/><br/>In 1954 The great Alfred Hitchcock took Cornell Woolrich's short story & had it written as a film to fit its stars, James Stewart, Grace Kelly,Thelma Ritter & Raymond Burr as the Killer. I never though his version was as good as the original short story. MY IMDb rating was only a 7.<br/><br/>You can see my rating above for this delight, it may not be as suspenseful as Hitch's version,BUT the sets, costumes, makeup & the camera angles are nowhere as phony as the 1954 version. (that is the way they made movies back then--every hair & make up just perfect at all times, all clothes brand new looking.)<br/><br/>Thankfully now-a-days there is more realism in costumes, make up etc., by being more realistic in the set ups & the naturalness of the performers, we can accept much easier, the unbelievability of the plot & story & sit back & enjoy our selves, in the same manner I did when I first read the short suspenseful story,<br/><br/>D.J.Carson directed Carl Ellsworths story & screenplay of Woolrich's.gem of a short story.<br/><br/>Instead of James Stewarts broken leg, we have hapless teen-ager SHIA LA BEOUF in his first starring adult role.

He is bored , upset (for very good reasons).I will not tell you, it is an upsetting reason. &because of this, you are on his side rooting for him all the way. Personally I would have no objection if it went as far as an Oscar Nomintion HE IS THAT GOOD>. Sarah Rohmer is is enjoyable as his possible future girl friend. Carrie-Anne Moss is excellent as his mother. Aaron Yoo is a delight as his buddy. & David MORSE is perfect as the villain, he is every bit as spooky & nasty as Raymond Burr was in Rear Window.<br/><br/>If there are faults in DISTURBIA I overlooked them & I feel you will as well..<br/><br/>There are few gross scenes so film is not for the small fry. <br/><br/>RATINGS **** (out of 4) 97 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10(<br/><br/>My rating on Rear Window was only *** 82 points & IMDb 7"

Of course it was no surprise that I was disappointed when it was over, but you know you have seen a good movie when you are still thinking about it constantly for the next fews days after seeing it. The music was top notch, awesome songs, great soundtrack. Shia LaBeouf really showed how he has grown and matured into and adult actor. He did a fantastic job. The most amazing thing about his acting....his character is always in his eyes in the movie. When you look into his eyes on the close up shots, you believe he is not an actor but the character.

We've needed a jumpy scary movie just to let us rest awhile from the gore fest that we've had the past couple of years. This movie made me laugh like nothing else, but made me jump.

Although it could've been better, I still liked the film for being clever and humorous. Carl Ellsworth wrote this film, who also wrote Red Eye. I would have to say that Red Eye was slightly better.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf's acting is very good in the film. He's realistic playing the techno-savvy teenager who falls in love with the sexy Ashley, played by Sarah Roemer. Carrie-Anne Moss also gives a good performance playing the naive mother and Aaron Yoo as the comedic friend, providing the laughs for the film. I also like to say David Morse's acting was very creepy. He plays a realistic sinister man in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Some people might go in here, getting restless for the film beginning too slow. I didn't mind that the real action happened close to the last half hour of the film. The first hour of the film gives a set up as the teen being a voyeur which makes you feel for the character and makes the film much more thrilling rather than beginning the action right away.<br/><br/>This film is very well done, great score and cinematography, and has its own suspenseful and thrilling scenes.

"samseescinema","7","1","7","16 April 2007"," A Competent Re-Working of the Rear Window Story for the Modern Generation
","Disturbia reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>Talking to Dylan McDermott about The Messengers a couple months ago, the topic of remakes was brought up. I asked if people would write his film off as an Asian knock-off of Hitchcock's The Birds. He said, maybe cynically, in response: ""Unfortunately, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't remember The Birds. Nobody cares. The trouble with making movies is that every ten years it's a whole new generation. It's all about getting the teenagers in the theatre. The thirteen year old girl rules this world."" And so now we have Disturbia, a PG-13 remake-in-spirit of Hitchcock's Rear Window. But before we all turn the page and look for a better movie to see, allow me to clarify any misconception. The target demographic may still be the thirteen year old girl, but Disturbia is a competent re-working of Rear Window for the modern generation. Jimmy Stewart had only binoculars and a telescopic lens to perform his long-range detective work. Shia LaBeouf has a cell phone, an iPod, a digital camcorder, live video feeds, and the internet on his side. Technology is this generation's Cultural Revolution and it's shifted the way we are sensitive to those around us. Disturbia is hyper-aware of this development and employs it smartly towards a story that is valid and justified in its re-telling. <br/><br/>Sentenced to three months of house arrest for the summer between his Junior and Senior year at High School, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) is bored out his noggin. His mother's discontinued his Itunes account, cancelled his Xbox Live subscription and sliced the wire powering his bedroom television. The punishment arises out of Kale's raging outbreak at school that rounded out the third in a three strike penal system. Charges were pressed and Kale got slapped with an ankle bracelet that has the cops skidding up to his driveway any time he leaves the 100-foot radius surrounding his home. The only thing distracting him is the perpetually swimming next-door neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer), just moved-in from the city. Kale schedules his day around her swimming and yoga cycles, microwaving a bowl of popcorn and lounging in a chair with his good friend the binoculars to his eyes. She catches him one day and mutual teenaged horniness welds a friendship spent trading binos spying on the neighbors. Soon they notice some striking correlations between Mr. Turner (David Morse) across the street and the unidentified stalker lifting women from the city. Wild conspiracies are formed and soon they've launched an impromptu control center in Kale's house, playing detectives with modern technology filling their holsters. <br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf, the young actor steadily separating himself from his Disney Channel origins, joins Justin Chatwin (The Invisible), Adam Brody (In the Land of Women), and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (The Lookout) in a gaggle of promising young male actors with medium-sized movies releasing this month. He finishes a close second to the moody-faced, brilliant Gordon-Levitt, but nevertheless turns in a compelling argument for casting directors to place him in more leading roles for the future. The rest of the characters are also cast exceptionally well, particularly Kale's parents played by Matt Craven and an underused Carrie-Anne Moss. <br/><br/>Director DJ Caruso took on the ambitious, potentially pretentious project apparently without any intention of mimicking Mr. Hitchcock. His style is sometimes inspired, but mostly mainstream. The opening father-son fishing sequence is expectedly touching, lit warmly and with a pleasant orchestral score purring along with the river. The script, penned by Christopher Landon and Red Eye veteran Carl Ellsworth, pulls most of the weight cinematically. Much of our belief in Kale's character hinges on the realism of his pain over the death of his father. One scene is taken to build the connection between father and son (the fishing scene, incidentally), and another scene to kill the father off. Landon and Ellsworth ace the fishing scene with the kind of easy dialogue that's organic enough to not set us off to the father's impending doom. Finishing the one-two punch, Mr. Caruso plays his singular card of directorial pizazz and scares the hell out of us with a cruel scene of vehicular misfortune. <br/><br/>The rest of the film finds Mr. Caruso leaning heavily on the screenplay which switches rapidly between Kale and Ashley's romance and the terror across the neighborhood. The romance, though charming at times, is stilted with glib dialogue for Ashley. The writing pair apparently weren't too popular with the ladies in high school and understand them only well enough to make Ashley into an unrealistically seductive vixen. She isn't as human as the other characters, crippling the romantic segments significantly. And as in Red Eye, just as the tension mounts to a level of satisfying discomfort, the story unravels into an extended climax of action-film vapidity. <br/><br/>But Disturbia works aside from all the moving parts of its strange device as a spiritual Rear Window remake. The film finds the colorful nature of a teenaged summer spent trapped in suburbia. The obsessions and the romances are mutually desperate and, in the same way, intensely gratifying. What you find holed away in a tract-home existence at seventeen, whether it's a murderer or a first love, is something, anything to hold on to. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"

","You won't hear much about the influence of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 Rear Window on Disturbia possibly because anything remotely nostalgic or educational will alienate a young audience. Too bad, because S.J. Caruso does much better with Hitch than Gus Van Sant did with his 1998 remake of Psycho.<br/><br/>Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a stay-at-home teen with an ankle bracelet monitor for clocking his Spanish teacher. Ashley (Sarah Roemer) is the new neighbor, looking good in a swimsuit at her pool. What's a housebound boy to do for three months but spy on her and his other neighbors with his binoculars? Enter Hitch's Jimmy Stewart in a wheelchair looking out into his apartment complex. Both are hypnotized by their voyeurism, both sexual and criminal, as they try to figure out if a suspicious neighbor is a murderer.<br/><br/>However, while Hitch relies on crisp dialogue between Stewart, Thelma Ritter, and Grace Kelly, Caruso relies too much on flashy camera shots and predictable dialogue to create a classic makeover. Moreover, Hitch's sub-theme about marriage is almost as intriguing as the major topic about the active versus passive life. Disturbia is mostly about what is seen rather than suggested.<br/><br/>But Disturbia is fun: David Morse as Turner, a suspicious neighbor, is charming and menacinghe'll never be out of work playing this character. LaBeouf is credible as an older, wiser teen still trying to make sense of a life that lost his father too soon. What happens to them all can be predicted if you know Rear Window; if you don't, predict anyway because the plot twists, scary false starts, and incredulous authorities have been played hundreds of times since Alfred Hitchcock so handily turned out his classic over 50 years ago.<br/><br/>Be a guiltless voyeur againsee Disturbia."

","DJ Caruso has made one or two big films, but here he is back in 2007 making an early contact with a still-youthful but certainly competent Shia LaBeouf playing a kid disturbed into violence and anti-social tendences and general wasting by the death of his father in a car accident. A measure of sympathy from the Judge over the misdemeanours perpetrated by Kale (yes he is named after cabbage, for some reason) leads to a situation in which he is tagged and left under house arrest.<br/><br/>It's fun to see how he tries to adjust to this, but the more-fastidious viewer is going to suffer greatly from the mess and chaos into which his premises descend rapidly. It all looks rather like lightish teen fare at this point, and all the more so as a family with a daughter more or less Kale's age moves in next door. She's Ashley (played by an extremely lovely Sarah Roemer), and there's many a guilty film-watcher out here who might sympathise just a little with the anyway-awkward-and-now-housebound, bored-out-of-his-skull Kale, for finding it impossible to leave the binoculars alone under such circumstances!<br/><br/>As we know, voyeurs always see something they don't want to in the end, and this movie is no exception. But it's one heck of a vicariously-enjoyed, wish-fulfilling twist in the meantime when Ashley does not write Kale off as a perverted loser when she finally meets him, but rather flirts just a little, and even joins in with the spying on the neighbours engaged in by Kale and his friend Ronnie (well done by Aaron Yoo). Implausible as it may be, this plot twist is GLORIOUS, and the chemistry and then love that blooms between the unlikely pair will be a delight for many a viewer in a kind of sighing ""if only"" sort of way.<br/><br/>The fact that one of the neighbours is doing something really nasty comes as no real surprise here, and the tension ratchets up in more or less predictable fashion; but it lurches into quite-satisfying if grisly surrealism when we finally get to see (albeit only impressionistically) the house conversions that Mr Turner (played by David Morse) has carried out to better allow for his sick psychopathic interests. At that point, an ordinary house seems to have corridors and basements that go on for miles, including an unexplained pool of water existing below it all!<br/><br/>Mostly, this film under Caruso knows how to mix its laughs, thrills, lighter and darker sides, so it's no surprise that some comparisons with Hitchcock have been made. Nothing too terrible gets seen, yet the atmosphere is certainly disturbing, as the title suggests. Of course, in the end ""Disturbia"" is nothing too special, but certainly not a waste of time either, and it's quite clear why it made itself a reasonable profit on a relatively modest outlay as on the whole it's well enough done."

Who does he think he is? And he goes on to say how special she is which is obviously meant to appeal to insecure girls who may be watching the film. ""I read books too! I'm not like those *other* silly girls who read 'teen magazine'!"" Has he honestly never seen a girl read a book before? <br/><br/>""You're looking at the world, I'm looking at you."" Most of the time in the moments he's watching her, he's doing it in a sexual way. Like when she's doing yoga and he says ""you started without me huh?"" That's weird, she's not a television show show. He's so entitled. This speech is the first time he mentions that he thinks she may be interesting as a person. <br/><br/>I think this film underestimates how many males would rather see a well-developed character than Miss Boobs-on-a-stick. It's okay to have hot girls in movies, but give them something to do other than get the male lead erect. The director obviously told her to strut everywhere she walked and everything is so forced in her performance that it makes me angry that such a beautiful actress didn't get anything else to work with.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film otherwise, there were a lot of holes in the story, but for horror films and thrillers I am able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy it anyway. But the romance had nothing to do with the scary part, so why would I care anyway? Like I said, it really ruined the movie for me."

","Whilse ""Disturbia"" is a rather predictable movie, it still makes for some good old wholesome entertainment.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straight forward; a young man named Kale confined to his house in house arrest for punching a teacher. With nothing but time on his hands, Kale starts observing the surrounding neighborhood through the lenses of a camera and binoculars. When events starts to pile up that sound surprisingly like a murder case on TV, Kale finds himself in deep as the secrets of the neighborhood is revealed.<br/><br/>What makes the movie work is the acting. I can't really claim to be much fan of Shia LaBeouf, but he did a great job in this movie.

Caruso wanted to rely on works badly. The teen movie aspect, particularly present during the first hour, is superfluous and doesn't match particularly well the thriller part which actually deserved more development and most importantly a lot sooner in the movie in order to create a real build-up of tension. In fact, the plot starts to unfold too late and therefore the twists flow together a bit roughly and too fast. Moreover, the transitions aren't particularly smooth and you go from a light and cliché scene to tense and thriller one in just an instant which is a bit awkward.<br/><br/>It is frustrating because there was much better to do with these elements.

I personally don't like to see him in every blockbuster it seems like these days, but I thought Shia LaBeouf did an excellent job in this movie. He proved that he could be serious at times but also be a hilarious teenager. It had many high tension moments but there were also many comical scenes. I enjoyed the many comical scenes that was present during the movie. It had a lot of surprises that came out of no where. This was a great thriller, it kept me on the edge of my sit during the high intense scene. The section of the age group turned out to be a great picked.

","I do like what they tried to do with the story and the focus on Kale's character, but I think they could have tightened a bit further by losing some of his exposition and making Turner's a little more honed in (so when the inevitability of the predictable moments begin, there is more to him than the plainly obvious things). This is a movie with a very small cast of speaking roles, and they easily could have shifted things around and reworked certain moments in the film to be a lot more synthetic than others. As said previously, I was actually kind of surprised with how much better the film was than I ever would have assumed, so these gripes could have only made the film all the better than it already is.<br/><br/>LaBeouf does very well as the main character. He has a certain likability about him that makes us genuinely invested in what his character feels and does throughout the film, and he never once loses it. He makes the character very believable, and lends him a certain aura of authenticity. This is a character that LaBeouf could actually be like in real life, and it shows in how easy it seems for him to be acting within the role (and how he is not straining so hard like he does in Transfomers).<br/><br/>Morse, as always, does very well in his role. I do not want to spoil his most meaty scenes, but suffice to say, he is very kind and terrifyingly frightening all at once. He easily switches from emotion to emotion like someone is flicking a light switch, and much like LaBeouf, makes the role believable and real.<br/><br/>Roemer, Moss and Aaron Yoo as Kale's friend Ronnie all put in worthwhile performances that only further complement the work done by LaBeouf and Morse. Each (especially Moss) could have done with a little bit more exposition though.<br/><br/>As much as I hate to say it, I was rather impressed with Disturbia. It is an effective thriller with a few problems, but is otherwise quite a worthwhile watch."
"blanche-2","8","0","1","5 November 2011"," updated version of Rear Window for the young crowd
","Strictly speaking, this isn't a remake of Hitchcock's fabulous Rear Window; rather, it takes the same basic idea and runs with it. In Disturbia, a young man, Kale, (Shia LaBeouf) under house arrest for punching out his Spanish teacher, is bored out of his mind and starts spying on his neighbors. He becomes convinced that one of them (David Morse) is a murderer.<br/><br/>Where Hitchcock depended on building suspense, Disturbia uses action for both humor and thriller elements. Kale figures out just how far he can go before his ankle device goes from green to red, meaning the police show up, and this becomes important to the story. His friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) does Kale's leg work (i.e., breaking and entering and rifling through the neighbor's car). Kale also makes use of a webcam.<br/><br/>The love interest here is the pretty Sarah Roemer, another neighbor Kale spied on.<br/><br/>Disturbia has some very exciting scenes and some fun ones, and because it's based on a solid story, it holds interest. The young characters are familiar and likable to anyone who deals with teens, and the acting is very natural. As the suspected neighbor, David Morse, who used to play good guys, makes a very effective sinister neighbor.<br/><br/>I really liked this film and I highly recommend it. It wasn't made for my age bracket but nonetheless, I found it very entertaining and well done. Don't make the mistake of comparing it with Hitchcock. There was only one Hitchcock, and this is very different."

"Eristoven","Null","0","1","9 August 2011"," Turner's character misunderstood.
","Major Spoilers. Please do not read if you HAVE NOT seen the movie.<br/><br/>Without wishing to sound patronising, I think a lot of the reviews posted about this movie have almost pointed out something that isn't actually true. Creating a problem where there isn't one.<br/><br/>To quote a few other reviews; ""The murderer will suddenly and stupidly (after years of calculated planning of all his murders) start attacking all of his neighbours."" ""why would someone who was so calculated and precise just start sloppily and obviously killing neighbour's?"" Surely that part of the movie shows just how deranged and surreal the character of Mr.Turner truly is. How do you know that he has been an incredibly intelligent serial killer for years, there is no clue as to how long his killing spree has lasted, the news reports within the movie on TV are incredibly recent. Granted the movie does allude to a slightly smarter than average man with the numerous vehicles he uses, his ability to tell when he's being followed and his seemingly natural friendly persona, but he also makes a lot of noise, hides the bodies within his own home, leaves the personnel effects of his victims lying around and openly implies from an early point in the movie that he knows the kids are watching him. Hardly a Hannibal Lecter level of intelligence.<br/><br/>Why is he killing?. The film makes absolutely no reference to identity fraud or Turner making a profit from his crimes, perhaps his character is actually meant to appear as though he kills for sport. Maybe this is a man that enjoyed hunting animals, I.e the Rabbits that he traps and the Deer that he kills, and simply grew bored and moved onto bigger prey, humans. The way I saw his character was when he does turn savage towards the end of the movie and attack/kills without thought, he is overcome with his animalistic urges and is simply gorging himself on something that he only usually experiences in small doses. One of the major examples of this is the fact that he does not instantly dispatch Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) but binds her in the basement for him to deal with later. It's a source of entertainment for him.<br/><br/>The writers/producers didn't have him turn psycho during the films climax because they ran out of time/ideas, it was because that's exactly what Turner's character was meant to do.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was a fantastic portrayal of what a modern day thriller should entail. Clever writing, mood, suspense, tension and drama. Seen it twice now and still amazed at how the directors managed to create a very real sense of horror without resorting to mindless violence/gore."

","A pretentious twist on Hitchcock's classic Rear Window but adapted for teens. Although entertaining and funny at times, the movie is simplistic, predictable from the beginning, and without the right amount of mood and the proper tempo to make it believable as a suspense/horror film.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf plays convincingly Kale Brecht, a 17 year old high school junior who is in home-detention after a few mishaps at school and, out of boredom, starts spying his neighbors, especially the middle-aged suspicious neighbor Robert Turner, played by David Morse and Ashley, and his hot neighbor, played by Sarah Roemer, who also becomes his love obsession and friend in spying. Aaron Yoo is Ronnie (Kale's crazy best friend). Among the adults, Carrie-Anne Moss well Kale's mother Julie.

"olafreinhardweyer-1","5","0","1","28 December 2010"," Quiete the opposite of 'To Much To Soon'
","First of all this movie must be defended from resembling Hitchcocks ""Rear Window"" to much. Seriously, can a main character no longer spy on his neighbors and find a killer among them? Ah, but then you didn't like Arlington Road too and certainly had no taste for Fright Night either. Those comparisons are worthless. A movie must be judged on it own grounds.<br/><br/>And unfortunately i can give only 5 stars. The first 45 minutes of this film left me rather bored. It should have been kept more tight and simple. A short example. Our young hero downloads itunes and plays the xbox. Another scene shows him not getting access to these accounts on the internet. In a later scene he is on the telephone with his friend who is obviously surrounded by some beautiful girls. Yet another scene has the hero realizing and complaining to his mother that she cancelled the accounts mentioned above - and mom cuts the electric cable of his television. Now imagine this: Boys plays Xbos and downloads itunes while on the telephone with his friend, suddenly his accounts go down, in contrast he hears his friends fun with the girls ""showing"" (audio) up - ""hold it"" says our hero ""Mom, did you kill me accounts?"" - she did - Hero snaps back, goes back on the phone, mom blahs something of disrespect, mom cuts electric cable, boyfriends hangs up prematurely. Mom smiles, son looks lost - end of scene. Condensed in this manner it would not only have cost the production less money, it would have also made for a more dynamic experience which would have told us something: Our hero is literally cut off from the outside and all things fun ... until the new neighbor girl shows up.<br/><br/>Another problem of the story is the death of our heroes father. It has no psychological effect on him whatsoever. It's a mere device to let him hit his teacher. It's a lost opportunity too. A father could have stood for protection now lost. A father cold have meant oppression now free from. Both oppression and the need of protection could have been easily linked with the theme of a serial killer story.<br/><br/>Also i would have wished for more screen time of the killer and our hero. It's not my responsibility to come up with even more ideas but there could have been more going on as a cat and mouse play than we've seen. After, all this isn't Rear Window, and killer, hero and heroine are meeting face to face far earlier than only at the end."
"coconuts-r-cool","9","0","1","24 November 2010"," Very good use of tension levels, keeps you guessing, Annoying characters, but PRETTY DAMN CREEPY.
","I just watched Disturbia and I thought it was quite different from what I expected. Though I picked it thinking it would be a good film, from what I read on the back, I found that it was a lot better than what I thought.<br/><br/>One thing that I don't like is that it is very similar (the story is pretty much exactly the same, save the minor details) to Hitchcock's 'Rear Window', and I didn't find anything about this on the case of the DVD.... that gives me the impression that it's just a bit of a rip of... so it kinda annoys me that it was a successful rip off, because rip offs annoy me. >.< Though if it is accredited to Hitchcock, by all means ignore this criticism and watch it knowing it's a great re-make. :D <br/><br/>Also some of the timing towards the end could be a bit crazy and unbelievable, but it does add some crazy-fast atmosphere and builds tension. The only other major thing I can really criticise is that two of the main characters (Kale and Ashley) are fairly annoying... but you can live with them, I'm sure they're fairly agreeable people. And besides, Ronnie's awesomeness makes up for it.<br/><br/>It keeps you guessing from start to end, and is constantly making the audience question if Mr. Turner actually is a murderer. I found that the use of tension levels was outstanding, as it is very rare to find a good thriller film like this that can pull off a bit off humour (that is actually quite funny) while still maintaining its scary disposition. It is not another one of those irritating films that has a complete high tension atmosphere all the way through, that is completely dense and emotionally tiring, although afterwards you will need at least a few minutes to catch your breath. <br/><br/>A conventional misunderstood kid in a world of dark mystery and of course the occasional (or in his case frequent) peek at the sexy neighbour. It is surprising how well this character is suited for the plot line... It's rather brilliant<br/><br/>Gold star for you."

What Lies Beneath wasn't as convincing (apart from the horror scenario, which worked quite well), this is a modern teenage version.<br/><br/>First of all, any teacher who would file charges against a traumatized student after provoking him is a disgrace to the educational system, but hey, it's the premise of the house arrest, apparently the writer couldn't come up with a more plausible reason.<br/><br/>I can let that pass, though it irks.<br/><br/>What I cannot let pass is that he cannot fix the power cable of his TV - okay, I thought, he's technically challenged - strange, but it happens - BUT, as it later turns out, he's a tech geek who can tweak surveillance systems etc....major flaw there. Another construed premise for the neighborhood spying he does out of boredom...<br/><br/>The girl moving in next door is a bad actress, I won't even bother to look up her name. Shia LaBeouf is a very good actor, with subtleness and skill, maybe that even makes her disabilities more apparent. Her role wasn't the best thought through, either, but hey, this was never a film aimed for Oscars...<br/><br/>So, I was entertained, the pace was good, the love interest, the good buddy, the people of the neighborhood, the bad guy.<br/><br/>Everything predictable, but there were some scary and suspenseful moments.<br/><br/>What botched the movie was the change of pace at the end - suddenly it slows down, everything is happening in slow motion, and I'm sitting there saying Get on with it!! You're looking for your mother, why aren't you running and screaming? <br/><br/>I won't mention everything predictable because it WAS almost everything - as I said, that does not make the movie a bad movie, it's a new take on the subject, with good actors (save one...see above), but a flawed script and bad choice of pace at the end.

Or is he just stalking an innocent man leading a quiet life, and his suspicions just a figment of his unstimulated imagination.<br/><br/>Comments: Almost a step by step and complete remake of the classic Hitchcock, just adapted to a more modern suburban area and with younger kids in the lead parts. Because of that it got a little twist, or sub-story, of itself of two young kids flirting with each other.<br/><br/>Despite being a remake, hence the story is known beforehand and quite predictable, it still gets that feeling of suspense and almost paranoia that the original does. Part of that must be credited to the actors. The suspense is perhaps most due to Mr. Turner, played by David Morse, maybe one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood. He has that uncanny ability to act all normal, almost too polite, but with a piercing look just freeze you.<br/><br/>Shia LeBouf I once had serious doubts about, but he has proved to be a reliable actor many times now, and delivers a solid performance here too. He has had a few productive years now and showed that he can handle many different genres well.<br/><br/>The movies best surprise was the female lead Sarah Roemer. With both looks and talent I'm a little surprised that I haven't seen her before somewhere, but that seems to be changing. And well deserved too, she handled herself very well against her more known co-actors.<br/><br/>In all it was a good thriller. But since it got no surprises it never took off to any real heights.

He's good enough to carry a movie despite his early goofball beginnings with his Disney channel comedy, ""Even Stevens.(which I have to admit I liked) This movie is similar to other peeping tom movies where they see something they shouldn't but this one's a little more complex. Shia's character is on house arrest by punching his teacher after he made a comment about his recently deceased father. After his mom pulls the plug on his xbox, Itunes, and TV he runs out of things to do and starts spying on his neighbors. At first he just entices his hormones by watching a teasing neighbor girl, but then gets interested in a neighbor who appears to be doing questionable things.(like possibly killing a woman he brought home?) He ties his suspicions in with a killer he read about in the newspaper and starts believing this is him. Sarah Roemer is very flirtacious as Shea's lust, I mean love, interest and he also has an Asian friend to do some of his dirty work for him. This group of teens are fun to watch and you never really know if their inklings are true until near the end. Then, of course, you get the good old chase with the main psycho character at the end. Despite the movie's similarities to other movies of this type the movie is fresh and exciting to watch mainly because of the new talent and they play out their characters well.

Sarah Roemer is easy eye candy for the young males in the audience and handles herself well enough, but aside from Le Beouf the other big star of the movie is David Morse, another old pro, pretty much like Le Beouf, who relishes the role he is given as the mysterious neighbour who keeps himself to himself but is there a reason why? <br/><br/>The director does a dynamite job of controlling the pace and the music moves the mood splendidly without you really noticing its there.

","They blended the two types of genre's well.<br/><br/>People could argue that a ""confused movie"" often does badly because it can't decide what exactly it wants to be. I do believe however, Disturbia did wonderfully.<br/><br/>It felt the first half of the movie was a mixture of comedy and drama. I seriously was wondering ""when the hell does the murderer come in?"" But all was fine. My friend and I were literally ""rofling"" (Rolling On the Floor Laughing), or in our chairs watching the silly antics of Kale's (japanese?) friend, Ronnie, with his Spanish (or whatever the hell it was) and general cameraman goofs. Watching Kale deal with his house arrest seemed very realistic. If I was under the same situation... I, too, would go straight to my Xbox or Internet.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes, slightly mentioned in the last paragraph was Kale's tour of his spying because it has some of the best lines.<br/><br/>""Damn!"" (When Ronnie sees the husband and... maid? making out) <br/><br/>""...You built the Twinkie Tower? Isn't that in like, the Stalker Handbook?""<br/><br/>""Not a stalker, it's a side effect of chronic boredom!"" <br/><br/>""I love your neighborhood..."" (When seeing the girl next door swimming).<br/><br/>Those, and more, along with the friend's hand-motions to grab the binoculars was absolutely histarical.<br/><br/>I felt they gave an absolute personality to each of the characters (The Villain himself was kind of stale, but he did fine).<br/><br/>But all good critics have to nitpick. What I didn't like was all the open-ness of Kale's neighborhood. The cheating Husband (I think, I was very confused here, I wasn't sure who was who and this particular scene went quickly), the stripping teenager and the Villain himself, do not close their blinds or curtain their windows. Yes, the villain has some paper over the window for easier disposal of ""splash"" damage, but still. Any good physcho-recluse man would board his windows up or something. Hell, he did install secret rooms and undergrounds to the place. This next complaint is actually kind of minor. I enjoyed the movie enough as it was, but the actual ""horror"" was very short-lived. I loved the garage-infiltration because that was really intense, along with the hardware-store spy-age. (Real word? You decide). And the final complaint being, the very end. Kale killed the damn guy but he's just kissing his girl soon after. He. Killed. A. Guy. You don't just walk away from that mentally unscathed like Kale and his friends. There was VERY little wrap up. Little to none.<br/><br/>But Ronnie's line ""I'm putting this on you-tube"" and their reaction was just brilliant.<br/><br/>I loved the movie."

","""Disturbia"", or should I say ""Disturb in Suburbia"", directed by D.J. Caruso and influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", is a very tense thriller, that despite the fact it doesn't bring anything new to the genre, thanks to its mysterious atmosphere and genuine comedy, it succeeds in every aspect.<br/><br/>Under the tag-line ""Every killer lives next door to someone"", we go to the movies on a Friday night, we pick a seat, start eating our popcorn and prepare ourselves to enjoy a horror/suspense movie. It's been 30 minutes since it started and we don't see the 'horror' part coming. We feel like if we're watching a remake of ""The Girl Next Door"", which is acceptable for the 'average audience' but suspense fans start to wonder ""Will the scares ever start?"". After a romantic comedy set-up, D.J. Caruso brings us some of the bad color when we see some blood stains on a window, with some screaming of a woman in the background. Is in that moment when we get that breaking point we've all been waiting for.<br/><br/>With some effective jump-out-of-your-seat scares, a typical cat and mouse game between protagonist-antagonist and a soundtrack that give you chills, in the hand of Geoff Zanelli, lead 'Disturbia' to an excellent climax that is followed by a predictable ending, appreciating the fact that it's not ruined by a 'surprise twist' we've seen lately in psychological thrillers that most of the time are not well-executed. This makes 'Disturbia' a film that appeals to all audiences, no matter how old you are.<br/><br/>Taking away the fact that we feel like we're watching a chick flick in the first act, its third one compensates everything else, leaving everyone satisfied, from horror-suspense fans to those who don't need to watch liters of blood on a screen to feel fear. With an excellent performance from Shia LaBeouf as the typical suburban teen and a nice mixture of genres hard to put together, turn 'Disturbia' in 105 minutes of suspense, drama, comedy and mystery that everyone will enjoy, mostly if it is accompanied by a tower of Twinkies..."
"patricklewallen","7","0","1","30 June 2008"," Predictable, but well executed
","Yes, I did enjoy the movie. BUT, let's just say the bad stuff up front to get it over with so we can focus on why I gave this movie such a strong rating. The Bad: First off, the story line is predictable - plus, it has strong resemblance to a classic horror movie which will remain unnamed to avoid any spoiler. Second, the last fourth of the movie threw all creativity to the wind (which, contrary to many others' beliefs, is perfectly fine with me - It compensates for this by including intense action and energy during this time). The killer, who has spent countless years planning and perfectly executing his murders, seemingly snaps?... Not likely. Fortunately, it works anyway. The Good: The movie was entertaining. So often, I hear people speaking of how terrible a script was, but they still enjoyed the movie. Where is the problem? Why do we see movies? We seek entertainment! This movie will give that quality. Second, the acting, while occasionally dependent on powerful camera angles, computer tricks, is good. The characters are likable, and the acting choices are justified. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good, clean thriller. It is rated PG-13, so there is no fear of unnecessary nudity or desperate attempts to obtain shock value through vulgarity in language or gore. It's a clean, well depicted thriller. Overall rating - B/B+"

The representations of female characters was insulting to all women everywhere. The women in this film were either, mother: to be humoured and ignored. The hot next door neighbour: an sex object. Or, finally, just faceless rotting corpses stuffed inside his neighbours basement.<br/><br/>The film begins with a fairly solid opening (there's nothing quite like a uber-violent car crash to draw in the audience, lazy but effective) However it seems the only reason for the car crash was to give the leading character motivation for punching his teacher.<br/><br/>The comparisons with Rear Window are obvious and i am sure the makers of this film made no attempt to claim any originality of this idea, but surely they could of added something interesting to this concept rather than treading a well worn a predicable path to the inevitable conclusion."

A tight script and suspenseful storyline help very much, plus the fact that these are not the ""jock and bimbo"" teen types, a line in the film that serves this purpose well. It's been a long time since I've seen films with teens who are normal and nice people, relatively so, interact with adults in reasonable fashion.

Unfortunately, the writers, editors, and movie-makers take the path well traveled or in this case VERY well traveled. They have a combustive type prologue setting up what could've been a great character fall-from-grace or look at house arrest or 'you-fill-in-the-blank', but no....

"jemmytee","4","0","1","29 March 2008"," Shia saves the day...barely.
","""Disturbia"" is built around a clever idea -- let's update Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant ""Rear Window"" to modern day, center it around a troubled teen-aged boy and place it in a nice upscale neighborhood where the veneer of life is perfect but the reality is venal and vile. And the way the premise is set up IS clever. While driving home from a fantastic fishing trip with his dad, Kale Brecht has an accident that kills his father. Feeling responsible for it, he crashes into anger and withdrawal and winds up threatened with jail. To show his leniency, the judge instead sentences Kale to house arrest, to be monitored by an ankle bracelet he cannot remove and that sounds an alarm if he goes more than 100 feet from its relay system. To top it off, his mother cancels his electronic distractions -- video games, web servers, even cuts the cord to his TV -- so all he has to keep himself occupied is spying on his neighbors, one of whom is a beautiful new girl who loves to swim in a string bikini (any teen boy's fantasy)...and another of whom he slowly comes to believe is a serial killer from Texas (cliched but cool). Great set-up with lots of potential, right?<br/><br/>Too bad a ""clever idea"" doesn't always translate into a good movie. Of course, if would help if the script by Christopher B. Landon and Carl Ellsworth wasn't lazy (hero in trouble? let's have somebody show up to cause a distraction and save him) and didn't have holes in the plot so big the QE2 could sail through them (how does a kid with no internet privileges get hold of the original blueprints for a house?). Or if it actually had some basis in reality (the entire ending borders on the ludicrous and raises questions that cannot be answered). It would also help if D J Caruso had at least some semblance of style or ability to frame a sequence so it made sense instead of just ""pointing and shooting and sometimes moving at the same time and let's make it work in editing"" (which was nearly flawless -- the editing, I mean).<br/><br/>In fact, the one true saving grace in this all-too-typical-train-wreck-of-a-modern-thriller is Shia LaBeouf. He gives Kale a depth and humanity that is not earned by how he is written. He's the only reason I give this movie ANY stars. The one other actor who comes close to achieving this is Carrie-Anne Moss, as his mother, and that's in spite of her character being little more than a cypher. Aaron Yoo and Sarah Roemer do what they can with their one-note characters, and David Morse tries...he really tries...to keep from seeming too obvious -- but none of them can overcome the stupid writing (Syd Field 101, anyone?) and ham-fisted directing.<br/><br/>To top all this off -- not once, anywhere in the film or credits, is any acknowledgment made of Hitchcock's masterful filming of or John Michael Hayes' brilliant script for ""Rear Window."" To say that's poor manners is to be kind; to me, it only adds to my sense that today's ""filmmakers"" are so busy being lost in their own cleverness they're ignoring the fact that they have yet to achieve even one-percent of the ability of the filmmakers of the past...and refusing to acknowledge that they could learn wonders from them if they'd just stop and think and pay attention to reality. But that's the problem with failed movies like ""Disturbia"" -- the guys who made it DO think they know what's going on. And that, in and of itself, really is disturbing."

Yes the serial killer in the film had racked up over a score of victims all across the country but for some strange reason try as he could he couldn't as much as even draw blood much less kill, with the exception of an unfortunate policeman, the persons that he's really after in the film.<br/><br/>The only person killed, besides the cop as his killer, on screen in the movie is its star young Kale's, Shia LaBeouf, dad Mr. Brecht, Matt Craven, in a spectacular car crash early in the film. Kale is very sensitive as well as guilty, he was in the car with his dad when the accident happened, over his fathers death. It's a year later that Kale gets a bit disturbed when his Spanish teacher Senor Gutierrez, Rene Rivera, told the disruptive student what his father would think of his actions if her were alive today. Kale not having an answer to Gutierrez's question lands a stiff right to his head, giving Gutierrez a king size shiner, and ends up with three months house arrest.<br/><br/>The movie goes on with Kale stuck at home, with an electronic ankle brace, and having nothing to do but spy on his neighbors with his binoculars and state-of-the-art electronic spying equipment. Doing the usual crazy antics that you would expect from a teenager, without a cause, like Kale he gets his fellow Spanish class student Korean/American Ronnie, Aaron Yoo, to help him out. Ronnie goes outside the 100 foot perimeter, set by the court for Kale, checking things, with a video/DVD camera, out for him in what's going on, with the cute and sexy chicks, in the neighborhood<br/><br/>Everything is just groovy for Kale and Ronnie who later get to become friendly with Kale's new next door neighbor Ashley, Sarah Roemer. It's Ashley who the two horny teenagers had been spying on for days as she undressed in her bedroom, with the sades up, and went for daily dips, wearing an microscopic bikini, in her parents swimming pool. It's when Kale notices his other new next door neighbor Mr. Turnner, David Morse, acting a bit funny with the fact that a local young woman was just kidnapped the day before that he decides to play detective.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT***Throwing away all the good times he was having in spying on his neighbors, mostly scantly clad and shapely teenage girls, up until then Kale begins to stalk, together with Ronnie and Ashley, poor Mr. Turner day and night making his up until them serene and quite life a living hell. Kale is out to see if Mr.Turner is in fact someone you wouldn't want to leave alone with the kids wife or even family pet. Mr. Turner, wanting very much to be a good neighbor, for his part tries to be as friendly as he can be with the suspicious Kale and friends. The mild mannered and soft-spoken Mr. Turner goes so far as helping Kale's mom Mrs. Julie Brecht, Carrie-Ann Moss, with her groceries and even fixes her cars flat tire.<br/><br/>Almost getting himself arrested by the police for breaking into Mr. Turners house Kale, whom the kind and understanding Mr. Turner refused to press charges against, is warned by the police and his guidance counselor that the next time he screws up they'll put him away in the lock-up, with hardened criminals, for a year. Still refusing to give up on his almost around the clock persecution of the very, who's nerves by now has reached their breaking point, kind and understanding Mr. Turner Kale gets exactly what he wants but not how he thought he would get it; A face to face confrontation with a psycho serial murderer. Kale by crying wolf for so long in accusing the lovable and Teddy Bear-like Mr. Turner of being a serial killer has no one believe, as if they did before, him now when a real live and blood-thirsty serial killer came on the scene.<br/><br/>You never get the feeling that ""Disturbia"" is what it tries so hard to be in its scaring the hell out of you. Everything about it, in trying to be a horror film, is so out of focus that it comes across as a Three Stooges comedy short with almost nobody, despite all the suffering their put through, really getting hurt. The teenagers, Kale & friend, act like those playful and party going youths and teenagers in 1960's Frankie Avalon & Annette Funicello beach party movies. They don't for a moment give you the impression that their being stalked and attacked, with the intent of being murdered, by a serial psycho killer at all! <br/><br/>P.S In fact Kale's ordeal in being involved with a serial psycho killer, whom in the end he does in, doesn't at all impressed the police or even his schools probation officer!

","When first catching the trailer of this film, I was not expecting much but a thrilling stakeout. To my surprise, watching the movie actually turned out to be the one of the best things I recently spent my money on (of course its a rental). Seeing that it was Shia LaBeouf, I didn't set my hopes to high, because whenever I see him I get flash backs of his character Louis on the previous Disney show of ""Even Stevens."" However, his role as Kale turned out to be a great step away from his childhood role. I would even say that LaBeouf was truly convincing in this role as a teenager torn between losing his father and dealing with the concept of house arrest. Like most thriller movies, this one started with a simple concept, a teenage boy who loses his father and has a hard time coping without him. When he lashes out, Kale (LaBeouf) receives house arrest. After things starts getting boring, he becomes close friends with a pair of binoculars and begins noticing his neighbors around him. The plot thickens when Sarah moves in next door and goofy best pal Ronnie decides to spend some time at Kale's house. All seems normal until strange things begins happening next door. David Morse plays the brilliant Mr. Turner and actually delivers a bone chilling character. At one moment he can be Mr. Roger's brother, but at the next, he reveals the true concept of sinister. The chemistry between Morse and LaBeouf brings out a film that would keep you on your toes while, wanting to see what would happen next. In addition to suspensive moments, this movie also has comedic surprises that stops this film from being boring to downright amusing. The teenage romance is predictable, but what separates this movie from other movies is there is not a huge display of affection. Though this movie may seem predictable, it will actually keep you guessing the whole time. With its concept of comedy, suspense, and of course romance, this film delivers great chemistry and a new sense of ""Disturbia."""

Is Hollywood so bankrupt? See it if you want. It is, after all, your time and money. It's just that ""Disturbia"" proves the old adage that there is nothing new under the sun.

","Disturbia (2007) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>An updated version of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window has a troubled teen (Shia LaBeouf) put on house arrest and with nothing else to do he starts watching his neighbors when he think he sees one (David Morse) kill a woman. I don't think there's anyway to deny that this film was largely influenced by the Hitchcock movie and that includes the movies overall structure. As with the original movie, the director here takes his time building up to the suspense. The murder doesn't happen until the halfway point and the suspense really doesn't start until the final twenty minutes. The first part of the movie lets us get to know the characters and while it does go on a tad bit too long it pays off in the end. The character stuff also tends to be on the dumb teenager side but once the suspense gets going the film is a home run. LaBeouf and Sarah Roemer are good in their roles but it's Morse who really steals the film. I've always felt he was one of the most underrated and underseen character actors out there so it was nice that this film was a hit and allowed people to see him."

","At first, when I discovered that the movie was being made, the elitist gene kicked in. It annoyed me that another classic film (Rear Window) was being given a 'teen flick' make-over, and I refused to entertain the possibility that Disturbia would be anything short of an asinine, tensionless attempt at a thriller; however, my preconceptions were soon crippled.<br/><br/>While I was watching Disturbia I found myself thinking: 'This movie has no right be this good!' I realise this sounds ridiculous, every film should be judged on its own merits, but this is based on a classic Hitchcock film. Don't get me wrong, the Hitchcockian tension is missing; though there is a nice air of mild tension brought about through generic action, rather than the subtle style and meaningful camera shots of Rear Window. Shia Lebeouf and David Morse (especially) help bring about suspense through strong performances; Morse is at his best, giving a particularly unsettling performance.<br/><br/>Disturbia's lighting, camera-work and cinematography also lend nicely to the film's caliginous atmosphere; creating uneasiness through shadows and a sense of unknown. The camera-work is especially tense when shot through the hand held camera, drawing the audience into the action, in essence putting them where the characters are.<br/><br/>The film also moves along at an interesting pace, always keeping the attention and not letting the audience drift off to think about something else. Even when the teenagers are watching Morse's character the story still remains interesting and captivating.<br/><br/>Obviously the ending of the film is a typical Hollywood one. The change from tense atmospheric film-making to fast paced action does take something away from the overall feel of the film, although it is not without its good points; the action is enthralling and there is still a slight sense of the tension (through lighting an camera-work) that came before it.<br/><br/>All in all, Disturbia offers a lot more than one may first think. The atmospheric tension and the strong performances alone are enough to warrant watching the film. If the idea of a Rear Window remake is putting you off watching this film, it shouldn't. Disturbia differs enough from Rear Window to stop a constant comparison, but contains enough of the basic plot line to allow the film a decent story.<br/><br/>Not a must see, but definitely not a waste of time. A solid, highly enjoyable thriller."

","DJ Caruso's teen riff on Hitch's voyeuristic classic Rear Window (with enough changes to avoid having to buy the rights) is better than most movies aimed at this market group, but succeeds more in reminding you how good the 50s version was than in establishing any reputation of worth for itself.<br/><br/>Shia LeBouef takes on the Jimmy Stewart role but this time, just to show how much times have changed, he's disabled not by a broken leg but by one of those surveillance devices strapped to his leg after he 'pops' his Spanish teacher. Bored to distraction by his incarceration at home, Kale (LaBeouf) takes to spying on the neighbours  especially sexy new girl next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer). That's right  our hero is a peeping tom with anger management issues. The other neighbour to grab his attention is sinister bachelor Robert Turner (David Morse) who seems to fit the description of a serial killer of young redheads that seems to be perpetually broadcast on TV. Teaming up with hot young Ashley who, we later surmise, considers the news that he has covertly been ogling her body the 'sweetest thing she's ever heard'  and best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), Kale tries to get the evidence he needs to put Turner away.<br/><br/>After a terrific opening car smash that sees Kale lose his father, the film takes it's time to get going, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as it gives us a chance to get to know our hero a little better. Trouble is, there isn't really that much to get to know: Kale is a typically grumpy teen with more activity going on in his pants than his head. LeBeouf, 21 when this was made, plays the part well as does Roemer, his partner in crime. Only Yoo comes across as laboured, in the best friend role whose fate is so 'unexpected' that these days it's becoming as much of a stereotype as the narrative convention it tries to avoid..<br/><br/>All in all, this is an adequate time-filler, if nothing more. It avoids the brain-jangling MTV style of editing and resists for the most part the temptation to pepper the plot with cheap shocks. While it tries to add a little depth to its characters, too often it is done in a half-hearted manner (for example, the perceived friction in the Carlson household is hinted at but never expanded upon). The film could also have benefited from more attention being placed upon the psychological aspects of the cat-and-mouse game played by Turner and Kale once the former knows the latter is onto him.<br/><br/>The plot holes and character inconsistencies are mostly confined to the final couple of reels, during which the whole thing threatens to fall apart completely (Turner's typical suburban house is the size of a castle inside, complete with dungeon and tiled-wall abattoir) but, as with many films like this, this set-up seems to be considered more important than the pay-off..."
"DonFishies","7","0","1","19 February 2008"," Problems aside, the film is an effective and solid thriller
","Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a troubled teen, and seems to not be learning any lessons. A provoked assault leads him to court, where he is sentenced to house arrest for three months, and is fitted with an ankle monitor ensuring he is not going anywhere. He slowly begins to grow bored, and eventually, begins to spy on his neighbours. While he begins to take a liking to Ashley (Sarah Roemer), the new girl next door, he begins to suspect another neighbour, Robert Turner (David Morse), may be a serial killer.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer, I immediately equated Disturbia together with Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (and all of the classic imitations and parodies that have come with it since its debut well over fifty years ago. And while it does follow some very familiar ground in its premise, Disturbia actually turned out to be much more than a simple re-imagining for the teenage crowd in the 2000's.<br/><br/>For one, Disturbia is more thrilling than you could imagine. Yes, it is highly predictable (although the opening ten minutes, if you know very little about the film, may come as a surprise), but that does not stop it from keeping you on alert for almost the entirety of the last third of the film. It does a lot of building up to certain moments, and when they hit, they hit rapidly and do not stop coming. It is suspenseful right to its core, and does not feel like it is trying too hard to be like so many other teenage thrillers. It is not particularly scary in most respects however (unless you are a bit too easily jumpy), but for what it sets out to accomplish, it does a very good job.<br/><br/>What may prove to be bothersome is the fact that the film takes a bit too long to build towards the actual spying Kale does after he begins to suspect Turner as a killer. He is not introduced as any character of importance until well into the film, and after he is, it takes another little while before he really begins to do anything for it. Instead, we have to endure through Kale slowly losing his sanity (and never once really using the Internet, despite it and the living room cable TV being the only thing his mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) does not seem to take away) and almost stalking Ashley. I realize that they want to flesh out Kale as much as they can, but there is only so much that can be done before the film becomes overly tedious with its fleshing out. The creepy voyeur aspect to the film is a little weird to accept at times, but its merit as a social satire is quite intriguing nonetheless. And when Morse finally gets to chew up some screen time, the film does not want to let him, and almost forces him to continue to stay in the background.<br/><br/>And speaking of Moss's character, what purpose does she serve in any of this? She has a point in the ending, and she serves a point to take away Kale's X-Box Live and iTunes accounts (at least the product placement does not get nearly as bad as in Transformers), but does not do much else. Her character has basically no motivations, and when she gets a little bit of the emotional material in the film, you do not know whether it is worth feeling for her or just wishing they completely cut her out of the film entirely. Much the same goes for the annoying Jose Pablo Cantillo playing Officer Gutierrez, the police officer who always seems to be on hand if Kale steps out of his proximity zone. He gives the film a few laughs, but is pretty much useless in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>I do like what they tried to do with the story and the focus on Kale's character, but I think they could have tightened a bit further by losing some of his exposition and making Turner's a little more honed in (so when the inevitability of the predictable moments begin, there is more to him than the plainly obvious things). This is a movie with a very small cast of speaking roles, and they easily could have shifted things around and reworked certain moments in the film to be a lot more synthetic than others. As said previously, I was actually kind of surprised with how much better the film was than I ever would have assumed, so these gripes could have only made the film all the better than it already is.<br/><br/>LaBeouf does very well as the main character. He has a certain likability about him that makes us genuinely invested in what his character feels and does throughout the film, and he never once loses it. He makes the character very believable, and lends him a certain aura of authenticity. This is a character that LaBeouf could actually be like in real life, and it shows in how easy it seems for him to be acting within the role (and how he is not straining so hard like he does in Transfomers).<br/><br/>Morse, as always, does very well in his role. I do not want to spoil his most meaty scenes, but suffice to say, he is very kind and terrifyingly frightening all at once. He easily switches from emotion to emotion like someone is flicking a lightswitch, and much like LaBeouf, makes the role believable and real.<br/><br/>Roemer, Moss and Aaron Yoo as Kale's friend Ronnie all put in worthwhile performances that only further complement the work done by LaBeouf and Morse. Each (especially Moss) could have done with a little bit more exposition though.<br/><br/>As much as I hate to say it, I was rather impressed with Disturbia. It is an effective thriller with a few problems, but is otherwise quite a worthwhile watch.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

","Kyle is under house arrest, so he spies on his neighbors to pass the time. He suspects that one of his neighbors is a killer. <br/><br/>This took about an hour of setting up the situation before the action started. There was about 15 minutes of genuine suspense, when the kids were following Mr. Turner at the hardware store. A lot of the action at the climax was lit very poorly, and I couldn't tell what was happening. Thankfully, I was able to guess, because this movie stole ideas from at least two other good movies. <br/><br/>I can imagine the writers and producers sitting around a conference table, thinking, ""We should remake ""Rear Window"", but we should change enough of it so people won't think it's a remake"". So they changed the Jimmy Stewart character from a photographer to a teenager. Then they changed the reason he couldn't leave his house -- Jimmy Stewart broke his leg, this kid was under house arrest. The Grace Kelly character was already Jimmy's girlfriend, but in this nonsense our hero meets the girl and she falls in love with him! Only in the movies, folks.<br/><br/>But then the writers must have thought, ""Raymond Burr was creepy in ""Rear Window"", but we should update this film to have the villain more like a villain from ""Silence of the Lambs""."" The house they gave the villain had all these secret passages, and what looked like an operating room, and a pit filled with water so the bad guy can dump the bodies. How big was this house, anyway? How could he fit an operating room in it? This house is in the suburbs, yet it just kept going and going and going. <br/><br/>Disturbia is a silly trifle of a film, not worth your time, and certainly not worth mine."

"jboothmillard","6","0","5","25 January 2008"," Disturbia
","I had heard about this film, and that it was a reincarnation of the Rear Window format for the teenage generation, and I knew I had to see it. Basically Kale Brecht (Transformers' Shia LaBeouf) lost his father Daniel (Matt Craven) in a car crash, and one year he is trouble maker, and when his Spanish teacher talks badly about his Dad, Kale punches him. As punishment he is put under house arrest, and during his vacation time, he is tagged by the police with a water and damage (alarm will go if he attempts to break it) proof system, he has to stay in set perimeters, or else. With not much to do, because his iPod and television are pretty much out of access because of his Mum, Julie (The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss), and not able to go outside, he can only chat to his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). Then though he occupies himself by spying on his neighbourhood of Disturbia (a play on the word ""suburbia"", and translated from Russian is ""paranoia""). First he is infatuated by new neighbour and soon to be love interest Ashley Carlson (a fit Sarah Roemer), but then it moves to very suspicious neighbour Robert Turner (David Morse). Kale has heard a lot of news about murders of girls, and he is convinced that Turner is the man responsible, and as more evidence comes about that makes his suspicions more believable, he is determined to reveal the truth, even with his house arrest stopping him. Also starring Jose Pablo Cantillo as Officer Gutierrez and Viola Davis as Detective Parker. It is a good mix of a good teen movie, and a pretty gripping thriller, in fact, just as much as Rear Window, you don't know if Kale's suspicions are right or wrong at times, till of course you see the blood and bodies pop up, and both the villain and hero get what they deserve. Good!"
"Film-Intel","7","0","3","21 January 2008"," Strong middle, shame about beginning and end!
","As teen movies go Disturbia certainly manages to reach new heights based on its dubious concept which can only be described as Alfred Hitchcock meets council estate chic.<br/><br/>The elaborate opening car crash sets the tone for jumps a-plenty as Shia LaBeouf's angst-ridden teen Kale gets over his Dad's death the only way modern day teens can; by punching his teacher. His comeuppance is a summer holiday spent under house arrest with only last years must have fashion accessory (an electronic tag) for company. Never fear however as soon there is plenty to entertain him in the guise of fit-and-she-knows it Ashley (Sarah Roemer), comedy companion Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and is he/isn't he murderer Robert Turner (David Morse).<br/><br/>The drama of Disturbia's opening, however, only serves to highlight its uselessness in terms of what it contributes to the whole piece. Obviously it's designed to ensure we feel sympathetic to Kale but by the time the film reaches the hour mark you'll be so far towards the edge of your seat that you'll have forgotten why it is he can't leave the house and spy on Turner anyway. The films conclusion is similarly pointless as director D. J. Caruso sacrifices all sense of tension and dread for a messy miss-match of genres and ideas which never leave us in any doubt about each respective character's fate.<br/><br/>Disturbia's opening can be ignored but it is its end which spoils a fantastic middle section where Caruso shows real talent to increase the tension through clever suggestion rather than overt horror shtick. LaBeouf similarly turns his angst-ridden Kale into a sympathetic character whose frustration draws the audience in to a point where you really don't mind when he treads on thin ice spying on a near-naked Ashley in her bedroom and subsequently her pool.<br/><br/>Occasionally Disturbia is too-ready to revert to simple scare tactics (jumping cats, hands on shoulders, etc.) but there is enough crafted tension here to keep you confined to your seat without the need for a smartly crafted ankle bracelet."
"bandw","6","0","2","15 January 2008"," ""Rear Window"" for the iPod generation
","This story of a young man confined to the property boundaries of his house and taking to spying on his neighbors and suspecting one of them of foul play has obvious similarities with the Hitchock classic ""Rear Window."" However, this movie reminded me more of ""WarGames"" than ""Rear Window,"" with Shia LaBeouf taking the role of Matthew Broderick and Sarah Roemer taking the role of Ally Sheedy. All four of those young actors are likable and attractive and the two males are hip to the technology of the time, which is a major element in both movies. But, whereas the future of the world hangs in the balance in ""WarGames"" and questions are raised about our dependence on our machines and their vulnerabilities, what we finally get in ""Disturbia"" is simply an overly-long and unbelievable cat and mouse game played between the bad guy and LaBeouf.<br/><br/>All of this is unfortunate since the first half of this movie is quite well done. The auto accident at the beginning is exceedingly realistic and unexpected and was for me the most disturbing thing in the film. <br/><br/>LaBeouf is presented as such a stereotypical upper-middle-class, tech-savvy adolescent that I wish there had been just one thing about him that did not conform to that image. For example, given how closely he was following the SUV ahead of him before the accident I think a case could have been made that he was responsible for his father's death and this potential aspect of his psychology was never examined. Having been confined to stay within the lot lines of his house and having had his mom disconnect his Xbox and TV, what was he doing for all those hours alone in his room when he was not spying on his neighbors? I wanted this guy to have some definable personality beyond being a likable young man.<br/><br/>It's odd that people who have things to hide don't seem to value curtains.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie, it just falters in its last act."
"jamhorner","8","0","3","23 December 2007"," From Suburbia to Disturbia
","Disturbia was a great film; in fact, I will go further to say that it is one of the best renditions of Rear Window that I have ever seen. It fits well with Freeway. This film is about a teen that is under home arrest, meets a hot neighbor girl and suspects that his other neighbor is a vicious killer after ""observing"" various people on his block with binoculars. This film was, in my mind, one of the best satires dealing with modern technology. However, there were other things that made this film worth seeing, the excellent PG-13 horror and suspense, the performances, the setting and the modernism of the film. I will be honest and say that when it came out I had not intension of seeing because I thought it was a rip of Rear Window and when I finally did see it, I was left in a state of borderline awe. This movie does what Freeway did to Little Red Riding Hood, with respects to the inspiration.<br/><br/>To start off, the acting in the movie was pretty good. Shia LaBeouf is really distinguishing himself as a younger actor, with the exception of Transformers, but in this film, his emotional feeling and nervousness is amazing. There were points where he did seem believable and you felt for this character. David Morse, who plays the accused, gives a fine, charismatic feel to the movie. He is very quite and at points sensitive, but at the same time mysterious. Unlike some of his other films, it's not his best, but it is very good nonetheless. There were also great performances by Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yoo and Carrie-Ann Moss. I will go further to say that Matt Craven was pretty good for this secondary role.<br/><br/>The set design was very well made and satirical. The seemingly perfect neighborhood, almost straight out of a 1950's Norman Rockwell painting with hot girls, child porno watchers and a possible killer. Satire anybody? I love the fact that they play on the whole ""suburbia"" concept, kind of like Desperate Housewives or Poltergeist did. I enjoyed the fact that this story is limited to only the house and its surrounding house, giving the viewer the same perspective as the main character, with the exception of the supermarket and the school. The modernism of this movie is very well constructed and parodied. Case in point; the elaborate use of communicating with you friend across the street via cell, well at the same time communicated with your other friend in a shopping store who is also using the camera phone to send digital pictures to the main computer. Among this one, there are many others like it. I love the fact that they parody the overwhelming use of technology by teens.<br/><br/>Now the horror. For a PG-13, there were some great suspense sequences, particularly the whole invading the killer's house sequence, and there were also some great ""hidden"" murders. Like Alfred Hitchcock, you don't see the brutal killings take place, but you are giving a sneak peek of it and based off of that, you imagination must do the rest. I love that. The scene that I'm talking about involves a clear plastic tarp and a window. I enjoyed the suspense sequences and as I said before, the one that I especially enjoyed was when Ronnie goes into Turner's house and you can't see anything because it's seen through a small camera. The binoculars are scanning the house and you don't see anything and it's just really, really good. That movie effectively kept me on the edge using binoculars and a camera.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not call this movie a horror or a slasher flick, what it is, is a hardcore thriller, just like Hitchcock does. I think this film had some very great stylized action and suspense sequences and killing scenes, it had some great performances and once again, a great parody on suburbia and technology. That was the highlight basically. This movie was a great PG-13 thriller and highly recommended for those who enjoy films of this palette, as well as horror aficionados. Those who enjoy Shia LaBeouf or David Morse would enjoy this film, but essentially if you enjoy movies, this is a great movie to pass the time or if your looking for a mild scare. I certainly enjoyed it and I would probably watch it again, I really would."

Aaron Yoo may have a ""friend sidekick"" career to look forward too. As far as the acting by Shia LeBeouf (Kale) I thought it was great, considering what he had to work with, you cant blame him for the person who wrote the script, but I can see him being offered some pretty good roles in the future. As far as the girlfriend, I wasn't impressed. I wish the movie had a little more of I don't know, something to it. It was very predictable.

"JWJanneck","3","0","2","22 September 2007"," Teenage pulp version of Rear Window.
","For some reason, Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is not listed in the ""movie connections"", which seems more than odd, given the fairly obvious parallels in the plots---even the Netflix sleeve identifies it as a ""modern retelling"" of RW. Respinning a tight masterpiece such as Hitchcock's original is a tall order, and even the best could be excused to not live quite up to it.<br/><br/>Alas, the best weren't involved in this dud, and ""not living quite up"" to the Hitch's standards really doesn't quite say it.<br/><br/>It starts with the ""tightness"" of the script and the setting. RW is claustrophobic, we get to see the world from the confined perspective of the protagonist, hardly ever leave the small room, see the rest of the world only from the titular window. By contrast, Disturbia starts in the great outdoors by establishing some father/son relation (only to crush it seconds later), and we roam the house and the neighborhood with that annoying kid and his useless friends. as for the script, where RW tells one story, this modern teenager turd throws in all kinds of target-audience compatible subplots and side stories, none of which contribute much to the main thrust.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT.<br/><br/>Then there are the characters---where RW had the socialite and the roaming photographer, Disturbia has a bunch of lame-brained teenagers. The protagonist's main problem is his need of a good parental spanking to aid his attitude adjustment. The next door hottie inexplicably falls for that numb nuts, and his friend is a completely useless and utterly unfunny individual. It's quite impossible to really care for these characters, and if the killer would not have murdered other people, you'd most likely side with him if he only makes these people go away.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILER.<br/><br/>But the worst, the WORST, part of this movie are the actors. All three teenage actors aren't great, but in ascending order of acting incompetence we have, at 3, Roemer, who is pretty but essentially not much else (and even on the pretty scale she is no Grace Kelly). LaBeouf, who is apparently groomed to be a modern version of the young John Cusack, comes in at 2---Cusack could act better even if he were drunk and in a coma. Whoever had the idea of giving this guy a leading role in a major production? At 1, though, the unrivaled Razzie champion of this movie, Aaron Yoo, who is the worst actor I have seen on screen in a while (and that includes Bill Pullman in Independence Day, as per a recent review). Boy, was he bad. There is not one appearance on the screen that does not make you cringe. He is a bad actor even if he just needs to stand around and do nothing. I kept hoping that he might get killed quickly, although now I am sure he would have been a bad act even as a corpse.<br/><br/>In summary, it's an ill-conceived approach to retelling/remaking/ripping off one of the best suspense pieces of all time, written by someone who could have written American Pie (but instead wrote Buffy, Xena, Tarzan, and Animorphs), and acted by incompetents (nods to Moss and Morse, who did what they could---better luck next time with picking a script, folks).<br/><br/>There must be something better that one can do with one's time. Watch Rear Window again, for instance.<br/><br/>""When General Motors has to go to the bathroom ten times a day, the whole country's ready to let go."""

","I'm kind in forgetting Disturbia isn't original because it's just another drawback in a list of bad things this soulless, predictable, poorly directed film has going for it.<br/><br/>Is it unfair of me to mention Rear Window - Alfred Hitchcock's (the maestro of suspense) perfect thriller about a man who believes his neighbor killed somebody - the film Disturbia tries to update for the 21st Century, mobile phone-using, Ipod-listening, internet-using audience that craves, believe it of not, American Pie turned into a Silence of The Lambs meets The 'Burbs. I'd say it isn't unfair because the filmmakers should have watched Rear Window over and over and over again to find out just exactly how to make a thriller work.<br/><br/>The film itself is poor from execution right through the actors to the script. It takes 40 minutes for anything to happen and then the finale is rushed and predictable. The other problem is how the themes of loss and the protagonist's psychological struggle after his father's death is an afterthought to the house arrest set-up and his infatuation with the beautiful neighbor.<br/><br/>It's all just badly judged and makes the much better remake of The Hills Have Eyes, The Saw sequels, and Wrong Turn look like bona fide modern day classics.<br/><br/>My advice: watch for free, or don't watch at all."

","These days, when it comes to making horror or thriller movies it seems for the most part you have to go for bloody violence almost from the first minute to the last. Recently however, some movies have tried to buck this trend. Vacancy did it quite well, building suspense until the action kicked in. And Disturbia does it too.<br/><br/>Cale is given house arrest over the summer, for punching one of his teachers. Fitted with an electronic tag to stop him going too far from the house, he soon gets bored, and begins spying on his neighbours, including Ashley, whose parents have moved in next door, and a Mr. Turner. A combination of news reports over a missing woman, coupled with what appears to be suspicious behaviour from Mr. Turner makes Cale think that Turner may be involved with the missing woman....<br/><br/>Although it doesn't say it anywhere, this movie is a modern take on Hitchcock's Rear Window. However this doesn't detract from the fact that for most of it's running time, Disturbia is very entertaining.<br/><br/>It starts slowly, giving the characters time to develop, until the main plot kicks in. D.J. Curuso keeps the story moving at a pace, and builds up the tension as Cale tries to find out if Turner is up to no good. He also adds some nice humour into the movie too. The actors are all good. David Morse is suitably mysterious as Turner. Carrie Anne Moss, does well as Cale' mother. Sarah Roemer as Ashley is good, although her joining Cale in watching the neighbours, without getting creeped out by the possibility that he's been watching her is one of several plot holes unresolved. However, like Transformers, the success of this movie is down to Shia Lebeouf. He's fast becoming one of Hollywood's best young actors, and his performance is the best thing in the movie.<br/><br/>However what lets the movie down is the end. I won't reveal details, but up till the last 20 minutes or so this movie was high on tension and suspense. However, by the end it has sadly descended into horror clichés. This is a shame as up till this point it was very impressive.<br/><br/>Still the movie deserves credit for not going down the gore and violence route, and trying for suspense. I just wish they could have avoided the clichés at the end.<br/><br/>It turns a great fun movie, into only a good one."

It seems that every filmmaker today likes to use that technique which should have been restricted to the likes of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.<br/><br/>The last twenty-five minutes are well staged and exciting, building up to the suspenseful climax.

","Rising star-of-the-moment Shia LaBeouf plays Kale, a teenager who receives the ultimate grounding  house arrest with a security bracelet on his ankle. He can't leave his house or the immediate surroundings. Bored and depressed (he's also recovering from the shock of his father's death), he slouches around the house until he finds a hobby  spying on his neighbours with his telescope. When he begins to witness shady goings-on in neighbour David Morse's house across the street, he suspects he may have stumbled onto a murder mystery. With the help of his best friend and the cute girl-next-door, Kale sets out in search of answers.<br/><br/>Disturbia has been billed a ""Hitchcockian thriller"". Sure, there are shades of Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, Rear Window  but that's only because this teen thriller is a barely-disguised rip-off (the studio would no doubt say ""homage"") of that film. Director D.J. Caruso is no Hitchcock. He mishandles many scenes, relying on cheap scare tactics and rushing scene transitions so that any chance of lingering suspense never reaches a pay-off. The pacing is effective for the first half of the film, but things get increasingly fumbled as it wears on. The overall shift in pace from slow build-up to the finale's blundering version of a PG-rated horror (dark shadows, darker basements, slasher-lite non-deaths) particularly jars.<br/><br/>The script does have some witty, knowing lines (""That's 30 gigs of my life,"" Kale says at one point of his iPod) and a general up-to-the-minute overview of modern teen culture (Xbox Live and iTunes are LaBeouf's fellow housebound pals till his mother cuts them both off). But otherwise the script is weak and riddled with holes. The characterisation is thin. David Morses's villain is never properly sketched out  his reasons, motives, etc. Perhaps this was an attempt to make him seem creepier by virtue of being an enigma, but it doesn't work. The cast does their best. LaBeouf equips himself quite well and David Morse as the villain is the most effective, all hard stares and cold eyes, in a reasonably creepy role. And yes, that is The Matrix's Carrie Anne Moss as Kale's mother.<br/><br/>The film will please many with its quick pace, overall trendiness, snappy soundtrack, and hip cast. But beneath the surface gloss, this thriller has little suspense, few surprises, and no genuine scares. Ultimately, Disturbia's title is edgier than the film itself."

It tracks the life of a troubled teen, Kale (LeBeouf), under house arrest after losing the handle on his emotions following losing his father in a road accident.<br/><br/>Having gorged on enough peanut butter while confined within four walls, Kale begins a voyeuristic pursuit at his neighbours who include the quiet and sinister Mr. Turner (David Morse) and the bikini clad, sun bathing new neighbour Ashley (Sarah Roemer) who spends more time reading Nabokov's 'Lolita' on the roof of her house than inside it. The evil Mr. Turner who catches Kale's fantasy as he begins drawing parallels between Mr. Turner and the man reported to have butchered 6 girls across the 'suburbia'.<br/><br/>Regrettably for a thriller one gets a whiff of the ending before the movie ends and only Morse's presence and D. J. Caruso's direction save it from being a collection of average thrill sequences. The movie looks like a lot of YouTube stuff was thrown in at a classic Hitchcock thriller. Unfortunately, they do not mix well."
"EUyeshima","4","0","2","6 September 2007"," Teen-Oriented Voyeuristic Tale Unravels Hitchcock's Inspiration in Favor of Cheap Scares
","First things first, the only similarity this 2007 movie has with Alfred Hitchcock's classic voyeuristic thriller, 1954's Rear Window, is the basic concept of a temporarily immobile protagonist who sees highly suspicious activity from a distance only to find he may be endangered by what he may have witnessed. Other than the central plot device, the comparison falls apart since director D.J. Caruso (The Salton Sea) seems intent on making a teen-oriented thrill ride driven by angst and hormones. The focal point is teenaged Kale Brecht who has to spend his summer under police surveillance through a motion-detection ankle bracelet. The laborious set-up for this situation takes a good half-hour, though this is likely the best part of the film as it begins with a car crash visceral in impact and impressive in technical execution.<br/><br/>Reeling from the tragic results of the accident, Kale punches his Spanish teacher in the face, for which the bracelet is his punishment. Increasingly bored and incorrigible, he has his electronic toys taken away by his exasperated mother, leaving him nothing to do but watch his neighbors with binoculars. Two figures new to the neighborhood come into focus - Ashley, a comely neighbor who becomes Kale's object of pubescent desire, and Mr. Turner, a taciturn bachelor whose suspicious behavior peaks Kale's interest and imagination. What happens next is unfortunately predictable and downright lazy, as screenwriters Carl Ellsworth and Christopher B. Landon eschew much of the psychological elements of the supposedly tense situation in favor of overly familiar, crowd-pleasing scare tactics.<br/><br/>The violent, drawn-out finale is beyond absurd and further saddled by the restrictions of the film's PG-13 rating. In a role almost identical to the one he plays in Transformers, Shia LaBeouf brings energy and at times surprising gravity to Kale though not enough to compensate for the script's shortcomings. Sarah Roemer, looking like a cross between Kate Hudson and Jessica Biel, plays Ashley as a stock Lolita figure at least until she is called on conveniently to become resourceful. Even though he has the funniest lines, Aaron Yoo's role as goofball best pal Ronnie is poorly conceived to fit the plot machinations, and bereft of her Matrix coolness factor, Carrie-Anne Moss seems ill-used as Kale's put-upon mother. With his soft voice and unshakable manner, David Morse looks like he is having a good time playing Turner, but the character's revelations toward the end unravel any momentum of fear he was able to muster before."

","By reading the DVD case, I derived that ""Disturbia"" was basically the same thing as Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"": a confined person suspects that a neighbor may be a killer (""The Simpsons"" even had an episode like that many years ago). Watching it, I saw that it is basically the same concept - a ripoff, I guess - but with some modern conveniences thrown in.<br/><br/>The plot goes like this: young Kale Brecht (Shia LeBoeuf) and his father are out fishing, when the father gets killed in a car wreck. A year later, Kale is still distraught over the incident. When a Spanish teacher badmouths him in front of the whole class, Kale punches the guy, resulting in three months house arrest. With nothing to do, Kale begins spying on the neighbors, in particular on hot girl Ashley (Sarah Roemer) who just moved in next door. But through this, he starts to suspect this another neighbor (David Morse) may be up to something.<br/><br/>This isn't really intended as a horror movie; more of a suspense thriller. The absence of gore makes it slightly more interesting than the average entry in this genre. The main strength is how they set it up so that you're not sure which character really is doing what, and each character gets to make his/her point about things. No, this movie's not a masterpiece by any stretch; it doesn't even begin to reach ""Rear Window"" in terms of quality. But if you're looking for a better-than-usual suspense thriller, this is one that I would recommend. Also starring Carrie-Anne Moss (of ""The Matrix"") and Aaron Yoo."

","Although there is much to enjoy as far as shocking and jolting Narrative twists and turns that the director of DISTURBIA takes us on, it is ultimately a bit trivial in a bigger scheme of things. I understand that it was a project that got shelved and put into production after a long wait. The edginess of it all does OK with its updating of REAR WINDOW (the Hitchcock thriller about a crippled voyeuristic photographer in a stuffy NYC apartment.) DISTURBIA (2007) came out this spring around Easter/Spring Vacation in the close vicinity of a real-life drama that received publicity in the St. Louis area where a stalker-pedophile was trying to ""warehouse"" teenage boys and the seemingly ""normal neighbor"" was foiled in his last kidnap only by an observant fellow student on a school bus who reported to police the relevant clue about the make and color of car that was being driven to crate the victim to his ""lair"". There are comedic moments but also some gross-out ones that apparently enthralled a wide teen audience this spring ahead of the crowds awaiting SPIDER-MAN 3 in May. Due to the viciousness of certain actions of this film's villain I would rank it not as a PG limiting it to 13-year-olds but to 16-year-olds and older. That might also prove a bit of a severe lesson about driving while distracted by cell phone well above the speed limit. A much better film for those of the plus-14 age ranges is the UK musical-reality based feature film taking place in Dublin streets, a music store, a recording studio, and low-rent quarters titled ONCE (currently in theatres Summer 2007). After its R-rated language of the first moments, viewers must admire ONCE for its long-enduring and hummable soundtrack - display of musical virtuoso on the pop music end of things. I evaluate DISTURBIA at the level of 7 while I highly regard the suspense classic REAR WINDOW (1954) as a 10 here at Internet Movie Database."

The main saving grace in this movie is the actors, Shia LaBeouf and David Morse.<br/><br/>Shia's Kale is likable, well acted and is interesting to watch. Shia's movie star charm is what really carries this film. The humour and chemistry he has with each of his co-star is really felt through the TV screen, from his sexual attraction to Ashley, to his guilt/love for his Mother, the intense and mistrust of Mr Turner etc. Teeny-bopper moment: can I just say that the first kissing scene with Shia and Sarah is soo hot. Shia looks to be one fantastic kisser. It's one of the hottest screen kissers I have seen in ages which could have something to do with the tongue action (which is unusual to see in movies today, generally its open mouth, no tongue). <br/><br/>David Morse's Mr Tuner has a freaky calmness to him. He doesn't say a lot in the movie but he conveys so much with a look or a movement. This man is a brilliant actor.<br/><br/>Aaron Yoo is fine as the comic relief but I found Shia's character funnier, but that could just be my sense of humour. <br/><br/>Sarah Roemer Ashley is dull and probably unnecessary.

If only that committee who's responsible for labeling the genre of this movie labeled it as a teen thriller then I probably would have taken a raincheck on watching it. Whenever thrillers premiere there is that expectation from the audience to cling them onto their seats as tightly as possible, now before I go on this movie does succeed in getting the audience into the movie, which is one of the basic elements of a horror film or thriller. However, that crush on that new neighbor while he was on house arrest and their budding relationship I felt was completely unnecessary. It sorta took the flavor away from the film. A better ending to that story would be incorporating the girl into the final part of the script where the next door killer ties the new girlfriend up and not the mom. And then you'd have you're classic Robin Hood style ending where Kale saves his girlfriend from the wretched serial killer, they share a long kiss and they live happily ever after. That definitely would be a better ending to an average film. Perhaps killing off some of the characters towards the end would have drained everyone horrifically and could have paved the way properly for a sequel, like the Ring."

But where the stroke of intelligence comes in is when his mother takes away all of his technological advances that would make the three months whiz by - no i-tunes, no Apple access, no online games to communicate outside with others, NO TV!!!!...etc. Instead he has to find something else to monopolize his house arrest time and he does - regular life outside of the windows of his house..and he finds interesting neighborhood tales. But he stumbles on one that is downright horrifying. With his new 'hottie' female neighbor and his faithful best friend, they piece together what they see and what they investigate to find that their horror is real.<br/><br/>Again, very nicely done for the late teen/early adult audience with enough thrills to keep you interested - and a fine homage to ""rear window"" completely updated and plausible. Sir Alfred would indeed smile at this film."

","This film is about a young man discovering various disturbing things about his neighbours, while being put under house arrest.<br/><br/>This thriller really works. The plot is captivating and suspenseful that will keep you on the edge of the seat. The build up to the climax is excellent, as little secrets (such as extramarital affairs) get revealed, and gradually the secrets become bigger. The suspense is well maintained for over 30 minutes at the end of the film. The name ""Kale"" sounds so much like ""kill"", and there are many times that I thought Ashley said ""kill"" instead of ""Kale"". By the way, ""kale"" is a type of Chinese vegetables. I find this film very suspenseful, and I would definitely recommend it!"

","Wow! I am pretty impressed with the movie, and this is not the type that will try to shock you all time like some horror thriller movies. It will slowly scare you at some scenes and I am not prepared to be scared at the scenes but suddenly it gave me the shock. After one scene that shocked me, I knew I would have to be prepared to be scared by other scenes. But for a thriller movie, I won't want to say that this is a horror movie, it had done a pretty good job.<br/><br/>The story is about Kale and his father go fishing and on their way back to home, they meet with an accident which Kale's father gets smashed up by a zooming car. Then we see Kale in school, punching the Spanish teacher after the teacher mentions Kale's father. Then in the next scene, Kale is confined in home, not able to walk out of his house. His X-box line is cancelled and his mother cut off the line of his T.V in his room. He got nothing to do but to spy on his neighbours and met a hot girl. From there, he suspects that his neighbour is a murderer. He try to uncover him.<br/><br/>Overall, it turns out to be a good thriller flick. But it could have been better, it is spitted into two parts, the first forty-five minutes is about the spying on his neighbours and the last hour is about the uncovering of the suspected neighbour.<br/><br/>The DVD contains special features, it contains four deleted scenes which are boring, mostly extended. The usual making of the movie, bloopers, outtakes, music videos, trailers, quiz and audio Commentary. Worth to catch it on DVD."

The actors were all first rate... Shia did a pretty good job, the chemistry between him and Aaron was great, and there was great chemistry between him and the beautiful Sarah. David Morse gave a first rate performance as the ""killer?""... ;) This movie has everything... comedy, romance, and lots of good suspense. I see some people are comparing this film to ""Rear window"", and some to ""Fright Night""...it has elements of ""Rear Window""... but unless you've not seen Fright Night, you will not miss the scene by scene comparisons between the two movies. And now spoilers follow... First there's the cast of kids... the serious main teen who sees something amiss in his neighbor's house and his comedic side kick and love interest... all present in Fright Night. When Shia sees the neighbor ""killing"" someone and looks up to see him staring back at him... Fright Night... seeing the neighbor carrying a ""bag"" outside at the night of the stakeout... I thought to myself.. OK, this is Fright Night... I bet the next day the ""killer"" will come over and start cosying up to his mom... bingo! The differences are that there's no vampires, the action in this film is limited to the two houses, whereas Fright Night had more characters and more movement... Anyways, all three movies, Fright Night, Rear Window, and Disturbia were great films. It's often the case that remakes of good films disappoint, but Disturbia delivers. I'm just disappointed the script writers and director did not pay homage to the movies that this is clearly based on... at least they didn't in the special feature ""making of"" that I watched in the DVD, perhaps they did elsewhere."

","Kale (Shia Lebouf) is a teen struggling to cope with the death of his father as well as the typical struggles of school and social life. After hitting his Spanish teacher during class, Kale is sentenced to three months house arrest with the threat of facing a year in juvenile dentition should he screw up one more time. In order to ensure his cooperation with the sentence, he is given a monitoring device wrapped around his ankle which, as it turns out in Disturbia, is a major factor for what happens next.<br/><br/>During his weeks of house arrest, Kale begins to notice something strange with one neighbor in particular. Mr. Turner (David Morse), begins showing signs that he may have something to do wit the recent deaths of local women. Kale, who has taken up the hobby of voyeurism in order to pass the time, convinces himself more and more that Mr. Turner is hiding something and thus turns his now hobby into an obsession of proving what he believes to be true.<br/><br/>However, Kale's spying on the neighbors does bring one benefit. Ashley (Sarah Roemer), has recently moved next door to Kale who enjoys her many swimming times and yoga practices through his binocular lens. In real life this would lead to more trouble but in Disturbia Kale gains a new friend who, along with his best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), becomes convinced that Mr. Turner is indeed a murderer and that they can prove it. Ashley is the typical hard to get love interest that all socially inept guys dream of while Ronnie is the standard side kick friend who is good for laughs but not really worth more beyond that. The characters may not be deep but for Disturbia they work. <br/><br/>The question of course is how they can prove it and this is where Distrubia falls. A seemingly random and pointless attack on Kale's mother Julie (Carrie-Ann Moss) after she attempts to explain her son's behavior after an apparent break in attempt at his house, later leads to Mr. Turner confronting Kale, Ashley, and Ronnie. The attack makes no sense because if Mr. Turner had simply let Julie leave without attacking her then there would have been nothing Kale or the others could have done about him. Kale was facing criminal charges and without him Ashley and Ronnie would have stayed far away from Turner. The climax is forced and can't escape the feeling that it is rushed without any real reason except to end the movie with a substantial conclusion.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much when I started watching Disturba and eventually found myself entertained as the movie continued. Unfortunately, Disturbia like so many other thrillers finds that it can only end with a stereotypical confrontation that leaves much to be desired. Disturbia is entertaining but falls short in its most crucial moments is thus forgettable in the long run. <br/><br/>6/10"

To my surprise it wasn't! I watch shows like Ebert & Roper, read online reviews, newspaper reviews and all of the critics agreed, that this is a great film. One of the main complaints was that it looked too much like Alfred Hitchcock's:Rear Window. However, it seemed very original in it's own way,I liked the film and think that it is one of the best this year. I also must say, Shia LeBeouf gives an amazing performance; he has matured from his days on Even Stevens. I loved his performances this year in Disturbia and Transformers, he proves that he can be comical, but very serious at the same time. He reminds me of a young Tom Hanks.

The tension was well placed and the acting was well done. I did however feel that there were moments in the film that didn't match the pattern/movement of the film, like the love scene for example. This took us right away from the tense plot and the nail biting moments and spat us into a teen romance and before we had chance to get used to this twist in movie style then we were thrown back into the thick of the action. This is my only downside to the movie though.

"andydreamseeker","6","0","3","1 August 2007"," Movie Review: Disturbia
","For a movie titled ""Disturbia"", it is not really disturbing, or should I say it is disturbingly undisturbed. When the tagline reads, ""Every killer lives next door to someone"", I am thinking toward a film that is suspenseful and thrilling.<br/><br/>So is Disturbia the movie starring Shia Labeouf a movie of such? It is disturbingly not, at least for the most part.<br/><br/>Kale (Shia Labeouf) is a typical teenager in a growing up phase. He is carefree, fun loving and shows a keen interest in the opposite sex, but all that is about to change. That change came when he loses his father in a car accident one vacation.<br/><br/>All that enthusiastic energy is depleted and things got worse when he lands himself 3 months of house arrest for punching his Spanish teacher.<br/><br/>What can a teenager do when he cannot even leave his house? He spends all his time playing video games and watching loads of entertainment on television of course. Great you'll think but only until his mum (Carrie-Anne Moss) decides that enough is enough because Kale is neglecting everything else. She cancels his Xbox, iTune and best of all cut off the wire to the television when Kale snaps at her sensitivity.<br/><br/>The boy will have to look for other things for entertainment and so he invents his own reality channel; he spies on his neighbours. One of whom is a hot and sexy girl, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), who has just moved in next door while the other is boring Robert Turner (David Morse) who mows his lawn twice a day. The focus of the movie will revolve around Kale's interest in the two, one with sexual curiosity and the other with suspicious animosity.<br/><br/>Kale suspects Mr. Turner to be a serial killer when a report hits the news that the suspect drives a blue Ford Mustang similar to that of his neighbour. With the help of best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and along with love interest Ashley, the trio will attempt to uncover the mystery behind Robert Turner.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is rather slow to begin with. I find myself questioning what kind of a movie am I really watching. Is this a comedy or a thriller? Director D. J. Caruso probably wanted it to be both. It felt like a swing most of the time, teasing with the possibility of suspense and thrill then suddenly shifting the momentum to comedic exposition. Disturbing, very disturbing.<br/><br/>The thing behind the suspicious Mr. Turner lacked depth. Many questions were left unanswered. It appears that the storywriters, Carl Ellsworth and Christopher B. Landon are more interested in making the romance work between Kale and Ashley rather than having the ""who really is Mr. Turner?"" work out. At least there was a climatic scene at the end to save it even if I thought it as being too convenient a plot to drop the curtains with. The murderer just messed up.<br/><br/>So ""Every killer lives next door to someone""?<br/><br/>Try ""Every hot girl lives next door to someone"". That sounds more like it."
"arthurmauk","6","0","3","30 July 2007"," A pretty strong thriller
","Refreshing to see such a film that's capable of building up suspense at the right moments without taking itself too seriously. Impressive stuff considering there's no blood and gore and it's all for a PG-13 audience. The 'thriller' part of the film is almost forgotten at times since you're just having so much fun with the characters and the teen drama aspect of it. The actors all played their parts pretty well, none of them were glaringly out-of-place. Shia LaBeouf is shaping out to be quite a solid male lead, but Aaron Yoo was probably the MVP here with a hilarious turn as Ronnie. Sarah Roemer may not be Elisha, but she's still hot and teasing enough to keep you both intrigued and frustrated at the same time. I didn't think much of David Morse's acting  he was just quiet whilst lacking the intimidating intelligence exhibited by, say, Sir Anthony Hopkins. Some of the events were not entirely believable, and required a few deus ex machinas to move things along, but that's to be expected from a thriller where the protagonist is not a professional. The soundtrack is your typical teen-angsty stuff, perfect when you're feeling sorry for yourself. There's probably some deep philosophical subtext on the lack of privacy in the modern world if you dig around long enough, but really, what's the point? Overall, a pretty strong thriller."

This movie entertains and creates enough tension so I'd recommend it as one both teens and adults can enjoy.<br/><br/>Though it shares a basic premise with Hitchcock's Rear Window, the main character is confined to his home where he voyeuristic-ally passes time, it does not mimic otherwise. It is not, or is it intended, to be a re-make, loosely or otherwise.<br/><br/>The acting is solid all the way around. The storyline, a bit slow, sets up and builds tension that works itself to a climatic ending. However, it's the ending that prevents me from giving this film but a 6. The predictably overdone and quickly carried out ending seems to fall just a little flat for this viewer. Still, a quiet respectable stab at the genre"

","I thought this was a much better movie than I expected it to be. The only problems I had with it were: The over-the-top product placement. It seems like every shot in the first half hour or so had some sort of blatant product placement. This was way overdone. The only other criticism I had, and this is much more important, is that nothing was presented subtly. Every clue, for the viewer, was put out there in a very obvious manner. From the early news reports of the missing woman to the killer buying shovels and other tools. As I said earlier, Hitchcock was a master of putting things in your mind without you realizing it. Maybe the director dies not give enough credit to his audience.<br/><br/>The final comment I have is on the last time we see officer Gutierrez. He would not be in his patrol car alone, nor would the banter between him and the dispatcher be allowed. That would have been taped and could be used against either one. Also, I think that he would never have approached the house without back-up."
"DICK STEEL","7","0","2","22 July 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Disturbia
","Disturbia played it smart in its release locally, by having pushed back its release date until almost every cinema goer had seen Michael Bay's Transformers, and become acquainted with the latest Hollywood ""It"" kid, Shia LaBeou, otherwise also better known as ""the Transformers boy"". <br/><br/>Being an uncredited remake of Hitchcock's classic Rear Window, Disturbia has our boy hero playing Kale, who's put on house arrest for having knocked the lights out of his teacher. So his home and front yard becomes his playground, but when mom (Carrie-Anne Moss, would you believe that?) cut off his XBox and ITunes subscription, he turns to voyeurism to beat the blues and occupy time. In a scene in Transformers, LaBeou had to look for something at home. Now he turns to looking for entertainment in other people's home. And that included spying on the hot chick new neighbour Ashley (Sarah Roemer), while keeping an eye on a possible serial killer staying next door, Mr Turner (David Morse).<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the trailer plays out almost the entire plot of the movie, and therefore you're pretty sure of what you're gonna get from it. The first half played on the teenage drama romance bit, with Kale figuring out how to woo the most attractive girl on the block, with the handicap of not being able to meet her in proper circumstances outside his home. But the movie banked heavily on Shia LaBeouf's boyish charisma, and that probably payed off loads. He's a lucky chap, as Sarah Roemer makes it two in a row (the other being Megan Fox) where his character gets up close and personal with hot chicks.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie turned the spotlight a bit on the mystery on hand to solve, and while it isn't naturally original, I'd say it still managed to pull off an above average thriller, thanks to David Morse's ability to send some chills with his build, and two-faced acting, being perturbed by his privacy being invaded (hey, serial killers need time alone to do their stuff), and yet wanting to be perceived as a gentle giant. Morse's one of the understated character actors today, and while his role is nothing groundbreaking, it still served its purpose.<br/><br/>Don't expect too much from this movie, and you might find it an enjoyable breeze. Just keep a look out for LaBeouf's name to marquee bigger projects in the near future, starting with the new Indiana Jones movie."

","I liked this film, I would've given it an 8 instead of a 7 had it not been for the tone of the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>The first 51% of the movie spends so much unnecessary time focusing on the theme of ""angst-ridden, misunderstood teen meets the attractive, slightly eccentric, rebellious girl, who is seemingly part of the 'normal' crowd, yet is introspective and ordinary enough to understand and befriend that teen, who she becomes romantically interested in, afterall, what other outcome could there possibly be when two people like this meet each other."" Does that sound like the beginning to a suspense/thriller, or a melodrama like Garden State or The United States of Leland? <br/><br/>On top of that, they made the first half of the movie a comedy. There's nothing wrong with any of these elements, but they didn't belong here. They should've used all that time to build suspense and intrigue, instead they put so much time into painting a very very detailed picture of his life (which is usually a good thing), and his relationship with the girl. What was the payoff in that? She played ZERO role in the finals acts of the film. See what I mean about wasted screen time? By the time they started focusing more on the key aspects (the neighbor), half the movie was over."
"donttouchit","Null","0","2","26 June 2007"," This is the way to do a remake
","First, let me say I do not think Disturbia was the best thing since sliced bread. Don't get me wrong, I think it is a well rounded thriller. But, I think this is the proper way to remake a film. <br/><br/>I am so tired of seeing classics being revamped and thrown together haphazardly and have the same title (the Fog, the Hitcher, Psycho, etc...) as the unforgettable original, for the hope of name recognition sealing the box office for them. This film had an obvious influence in Rear Window, but they made it their own at the same time. This is a pretty basic plot, and anyone who thinks that this is a ripoff of Rear Window, well your right, but you know what... so was Rear Window itself. <br/><br/>Rear Window was based on a story by the great pulp storyteller Cornell Woolrich, and this story was first adapted into a film in 1949 in The Window (a pretty good film noir in it's own right) a good 13 years before Hitchcock made the unforgettable Rear Window. <br/><br/>Every filmmaker is a thief, the good ones embrace it . Even one of the most original voices in film history: Stanley Kubrick is admittedly guilty of being influenced. Kubrick told Jack Nicholson on the set of the Shining (thirty years ago) ""Every shot has already been done. Our job is to do it a little bit better.""<br/><br/>This film had an influence and made its own film from it. In my opinion, a far more admirable feat than a blatant ripoff remake like so many that have been dumped in our theaters the last five years. Although Woolrich deserve some kind of credit that he did not get. <br/><br/>This is the way to do it. Make it your own."

"zardoz-13","8","0","2","21 June 2007"," Worthwhile Suspenseful Saga
","Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studios have done a skillful job of updating the classic 1954 Alfred Hitchcock thriller ""Rear Window"" as a white-knuckled exercise in paranoia about three teenagers in jeopardy pitted against an intelligent but ruthless serial killer. Although this tense but entertaining new thriller with Shia LaBeouf, David Morse, and Carrie-Anne Moss does not cite the Hitchcock movie as its inspiration, anybody who has seen ""Rear Window"" will know from watching the previews for ""Disturbia"" (*** out of ****) that it recycles the predicament in the 1954 original with style and savvy. Basically, ""Rear Window"" dealt with an injured photographer confined to a wheel chair. The photographer, played by James Stewart, had nothing better to do during his recovery than stare out of his apartment window at his neighbors. Eventually, the shutterbug hero suspects that one of the tenants has killed a woman and carved her body up into little pieces. While ""Two for the Money"" director D.J. Caruso and scenarists Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth have created a wholly different set of circumstances, ""Disturbia"" is essentially still ""Rear Window,"" but with teenagers and the 21st century surveillance technology at their disposal that the original lacked. <br/><br/>""Disturbia"" opens serenely enough outdoors with Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf of ""Constantine"") and his father Daniel (Matt Craven of ""Jacob's Ladder"") up to their knees in a stream fishing for their dinner. Daniel uses this opportunity to bond with his son, but Kale is too embarrassed to confide in his father. Kale and Daniel are heading back home on the highway when they encounter a reckless driver careening across the road. Daniel dies in a horrendous accident, and Kale never really recovers from the traumatic ordeal. About a year later, Kale's Spanish teacher gives him a hard time in class, and our irate protagonist decks him with a right cross. A sympathetic judge sentences Kale to three months of house arrest. The authorities explain that the monitoring devise strapped to Kale's ankle will trigger its alarm if the youth strays beyond the confines of his parents' house. Initially, Kale has a difficult time adjusting to his captivity. Two kids across the street leave a flaming bag of fecal matter on Kale's front porch, and our hero stomps out the fire and then pursues the culprits. In the process, the alarm on his ankle monitor goes off and the cops arrest him. This occurs while Kale's new neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer of ""The Grudge 2""), is watching. Later, Kale and she become friends after she catches him spying on her with binoculars as she swims in her parents' pool in a bikini. After he learns about a serial killer in Los Angeles, Kale begins to notice that one of his neighbors, Mr. Turner (David Morse of ""The Rock""), behaves in a suspicious manner. Kale enlists his high school buddy Ronnie (Aaron Yoo of ""Things That Go Bump in the Night"") to do his legwork. Ronnie sneaks over Kale's fence into Turner's garage and finds what he believes is a corpse. Turner shows up suddenly, and Ronnie scrambles to hide from Turner in Turner's house. Kale ignores the ankle monitor and breaks into Turner's house to save Ronnie, but the police arrive in time to arrest him again. <br/><br/>The best thing about ""Disturbia"" is David Morse's stone cold killer who seems to know what these nosy teenagers are up to every step of the way. Turner maintains his cool until the finale when all havoc breaks loose. Shia LaBeouf, who looks more and more like this generation's answer to John Cusack, makes a resourceful but sympathetic character. Like the wheel chair bound James Stewart in ""Rear Window,"" LaBeouf's hero cannot step out of bounds without the police showing up at the drop of a hat to bust him. As his shapely but skinny next-door neighbor Ashley, Sarah Roemer basically recreates the role that Grace Kelly played in the original. Inexplicably, however, Ashley vanishes from the action in the last quarter hour and Kale's mom has to intercede for him. Meanwhile, Aaron Yoo provides the necessary comic relief. Poor Carrie-Anne Moss has been reduced to playing the thankless role of Kale's mother. You may remember that Moss portrayed the gravity-defying heroine in ""The Matrix"" trilogy that could charge full-tilt up walls and blast the daylights out of the badguys.<br/><br/>Altogether, ""Disturbia"" qualifies as a worthwhile suspenseful saga with enough surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat. Indeed, the audience that Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studio is appealing to with this gripping thriller probably haven't seen ""Rear Window"" so they won't appreciate the efforts that Caruso and his writers have taken to pay homage to the Hitchcock film."

The story never gets boring and even when you know that something worse is going to happen the tension never lets down! I think this can be credited to very likable characters! With special mention of Shia LaBeouf! He really carries the movie! From the start you will be on his side and never doubt him! David Morse does a good job in convincing that he is a creep!

","Any movie with Shia LeBeouf is subject to some squirming. Let's face it, he helped the Evil Empire (Disney for the uninitiated) grow thanks to his successful show Even Stevens. But as Shia has gotten away from Disney, his range continues to get better. Granted, Disturbia and Transformers are not Shakespeare, but it is far better than farcical garbage like The Greatest Game Ever Played.<br/><br/>Anyway, Shia plays Kale, a pretty chippy kid who slugs his teacher after due to a crack the creep makes about his dead father (which he had a hand in). first of all, I will say this: the teacher deserves it, even if Kale was being an idiot and a jackass. Anyway, this puts Kale under house arrest and he has to spend all day with his hot mom Carrie-Ann Moss. Of course, this all leads into the eventual ""Rear Window"" plot line that was pushed in the trailers, but it is still pretty satisfying. <br/><br/>Kale's paranoia is pretty interesting to see, considering he seems to have no qualms about jumping the gun. This leads to one of my eventual pet peeves about this film. Why in the world would this guy get any chick? Here's the formula: being a peeping tom and ruining a girl's party will get you some head. Nice equation there guys.<br/><br/>I have always liked David Morse, and his creepy, swarmy antagonist certainly brought some cool moments within the film. Its good to see him playing a bad guy again, which suits him so well because of his charm and rugged good looks. Either way, a spot on choice for the bad guy.<br/><br/>Other than that, there was really nothing that stood out about this film. I give it a seven for the effort and making a film that didn't utterly bore me to death while throwing in a little humor to boot. Good stuff for a midnight-type showing."

As soon as you think you know what's going to happen next you would be surprised. What I liked about it is that it wasn't like other movies it actually keeps you thinking just like it said it would. I think that this movie was horror mixed with comedy. I was scared at times but then I laughed. I would love for there to be a second movie to it because I know that it would sell good and that I would definitely go see it.

","""Disturbia"" is ""Rear Window"" with gadgets - lots and lots of gadgets. Forget the high-powered binoculars that Jimmy Stewart had to rely upon in that earlier film to fulfill his voyeuristic tendencies; that's strictly old school stuff compared to the PCs, cell phones, camcorders and various other technological marvels the hero of ""Disturbia"" uses for his spying and sleuthing. Thus, what is a bane for modern-day paranoiacs is clearly a boon for neighborhood Peeping Toms.<br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf is Kale, a suburban teen placed under house arrest for punching out his Spanish teacher after the latter makes a cutting remark about Kale's recently deceased father one day in class. Literally stuck at home with nothing to do, Kale begins to wile away the hours spying on his various neighbors, including, naturally, a young blonde hottie who has conveniently moved in right next door to the horny prisoner. Kale also begins to suspect that the man down the street, who spends most of his free time benignly mowing his lawn, may, in fact, be a serial killer who lures beautiful women into his home and violently dispatches them. Soon, Kale, his best friend from school, Ronnie, and the blonde cutie, named (what else?) Ashley, are crime-solving with the best of them, uncovering clues and closing in on the suspect even as they become aware that they might not be quite as invisible to their intended target as they originally thought they were.<br/><br/>Despite its tendency to wander off into Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew-level melodramatics at times, ""Disturbia"" is a generally tidy little thriller, refreshingly simple and straightforward in a time when such films tends to be just a little too clever and a little too convoluted for their own good (the screenplay is blessedly devoid of those ""surprise"" turnabout plot twists that are practically de rigeur in modern movie thrillers). There are plenty of holes and inconsistencies in the storyline, as is perhaps to be expected, but co-writers Christopher B. Landon and Carl Ellsworth, and director D. J. Caruso keep us from fixating too much on them with the skill of their film-making. The climactic scenes are wickedly suspenseful, even if just about every shot feels derived from some previous film (""The Silence of the Lambs,"" ""The Shining,"" ""Poltergeist,"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" seem to be the primary sources here).<br/><br/>The key factor in ""Disturbia""'s success lies in LaBeouf's star-making performance in the lead role. This talented and charismatic young actor has a slightly befuddled, puppy dog expression that gives the character the vulnerability he needs to make his heroics convincing. He is nicely complemented by Aaron Yoo and Sarah Roemer as his partners in crime-detection, and by David Morse (the dad in ""Contact"") as the killer next door."

","Disturbia is about Kale, a kid whose father passed away a year ago in a car accident. When asked one too many questions by his Spanish teacher, he punches him and gets put on house arrest (No, he doesn't break his leg.) Of course, chaos ensues when he begins to believe his neighbor is a murderer, so he stakes out trying to find out. Overall it's an OK movie. There's really nothing special about it, and at times, it can get overly corny. Though I liked Shia Labeuf, he's really not much of an actor. He acts like himself, or like a mad himself, but he never get any emotion across to me. The actress playing his love interest was OK, and the guy playing his friend was also OK, but again, nothing special. The movie itself was just a shell of the Hitchcock classic Rear Window. Rear Window is a much better film, but if you want to check this mediocre film out go ahead.<br/><br/>My rating: ** out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for violence and language"

","I have seen this movie three times. First, I saw the movie ""Rear Window"" that was made for TV starring Christopher Reeves. Second, I saw the Hitchcock version of ""Rear Window"". Finally, I saw ""Disturbia"" the other night. I must say that I thought the last, the best of the lot. It pains me to say this, as Hitchcock is one of the most creative and ingenious directors the film industry has ever seen, a veritable master of the macabre. Also, the Hitchcock version billed two fine Hollywood actors of the time. Nevertheless, the new movie has a lot more suspense and terror aboutit. It kept me on the edge of my seat, which the other two versionsfailed to do. (The TV version is almost unwatchable)Shia Lobeuf hasdeveloped into a fine actor since his days on Even Stevens. It must bekept in mind that the movie is what it is. It is a teenage suspensethriller. Still, it is one of the finest examples of the genre. Iappreciate movies with adolescent protagonists and think that it is movies such as this one that demonstrates the adult interest in such films."

The acting is actually quite good and the story doesn't treat it's audience like absolute idiots like many of the other film do.<br/><br/>It would be hard to recommend this as anything else but a rental, but it's worth checking out, if only to see that there is still some hope for the PG-13 trend.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, the acting is what makes the film stand out from it's brothers and sisters. Strong performances are given by the whole cast, which add a bit of freshness to the tired and tested substance of the plot.<br/><br/>I'd actually call this a a teen Rear Window of sorts.

","How to watch this movie? Step1: Get someone to pay your way. Step2: After the first 10 minutes take a nap for 60. Step3: Continue watching the movie.<br/><br/>Friends, I don't want to disturb ya, but you know how movies generally start out innocuously until about 15 to 20 minutes into it (more or less) then something happens and the ball starts to roll, so to speak? Well this movie got the ball rolling early within 10 minutes or so then dropped it for about 60 wherein NOTHING WAS HAPPENING except some childish voyeurism, pranks, and teenage crush.<br/><br/>I had no idea this movie was going to be a take on a famous Alfred Hitchcock movie wherein an incapacitated individual, due to boredom, spends much of his time looking out his window with a binoculars; watching the world go by -without him. In this movie a teenager gets confined to house arrest and has to wear an ankle monitor for decking his Spanish teacher. He's young, has a lot of energy, and wants to do stuff but his limited to the proximity of his house. So when not playing video games and talking to his smart/idiot friend (I'm not sure which) on his cell phone, he's looking through his binoculars and sizing up his neighborhood as if for the first time. Shortly, a new girl moves in next door and she becomes the chief object of his voyeurism for a while until they become friends and there is silly jealousy and infatuation on his part. Friends, I have basically outlined an hour of this movie.<br/><br/>This movie almost seemed like 3 movies. The first part: promising, the second part: aimless and boring, and the third part: tense and suspenseful.So the problem I had with this movie is that there was nothing suspenseful or interesting going on for a large chunk of it. I'm giving this movie 4 stars for wasting about 60 minutes of my time. Interestingly, I see that many other IMDb commentators have an opposite view and have generously rolled out the stars. Obviously we see the world with different eyes. I can only comment on WHAT I SAW or DID NOT SEE, as the case may be. Love, Boloxxxi."
"eras-1","6","0","3","28 April 2007"," my thoughts on it...
","I'm still not 100% sure what I think about it. At the moment I'd say it's a good popcorn movie (read: you don't need to pay attention). It has the whole happy beginning, turn of events, rather short climax, happy go lucky ending outline that you'd expect. The friend is my hero. Shia LaBeouf did an okay job. And poor David Morse-clearly type-casted. There were parts obviously drawn from 'Rear Window' and 'The 'Burbs'. (Overall plot from 'Rear Window' and the whole humorous no idea what they're doing snooping from 'The 'Burbs'.) There was actually a lot of it that made me laugh (even the parts that I think were supposed to be serious) Although in several scenes I think they were trying too hard. There were a few parts that I think were supposed to be twists that I saw coming so it's either too predictable or I've seen too many movies. Not sure which... Okay. Final decision time. I'd say might as well see it-it's decent entertainment. But you won't be missing out if you wait until it's on DVD."
"guyfromjerzee","7","0","2","22 April 2007"," An amusing guilty pleasure.....Just don't think too much about it
","I'm just going to lay everything out on the table. ""Disturbia"" is not original, nor is it very intelligent. The film contains plenty of clichés, and I'm sure any film scholar would have a field day pointing them out. But what can I say? I was entertained the whole way through. Whether I was laughing with the film or at the film, I was entertained. I wish I can give away the movie's copious clichés without spoiling it, but I can't. So if you're eager to check out the film, please don't read ahead. Cliché #1: Why is it that in movies, whenever a character is in extreme horror...their friends feel the need to toy with them? If I were these people, I'd get a new set of friends. In one scene, the main character Kale (Shia LeBuff, or however the hell you spell his name) asks his friend to invade his neighbor's (David Morse) house and bring a video camera with him to record any evidence of him hiding any corpses. From what Kale sees on camera, it appears that his friend has been captured by the neighbor and possibly killed, and the camera suddenly shuts off. We later find out that the friend is hiding in Kale's closet, and that it was all a joke. If my friend did something like that, I'd kill him myself! Only in the friggin' movies. Cliché # 2: In another scene, the neighbor comes into contact with Kale's love interest, who was stalking him in a hardware store. The filmmakers make it look like he's going to kill her, but does he? Of course not. We don't need to eliminate any characters who are substantial to the plot. Aside from those two clichés, there are plenty of false alarms and moments where the villain miraculously comes back to life. Of course there's plenty of scenes where the villain comes into contact with cops or Kale's parents, where the villain proves he's the nicest guy and they all fall for it. The film is predictable. There are very few surprises. In the film's pivotal scene, Morse appears to be killing someone and blood splatters all over his window. I knew right away that it would be found out later on that he was cutting up an animal. And I was absolutely right! I haven't seen Shia Lebuff in many movies, but judging from this movie he's not exactly an actor I'm dying to see in many future projects. Maybe it's just me. He has a certain smugness to him that I find slightly irritating. The female lead in the film is very sexy, and might be the reason why I enjoyed it overall...lol. So from a heterosexual man's perspective, let's just say you probably will keep your eyes open throughout the film....even if you're not terribly interested. And when does David Morse ever fail to play a magnificent villain? Even Carrie-Ann Moss steals the show in the few scenes she's in. It also makes me think, I might admire her more if I didn't always have to see her play dopey sci-fi characters. OK, if you read my review you probably find no reason to see the film. I don't blame you. Like I said, it's a guilty pleasure. It has every cliché in the book, but it makes a decent popcorn flick. I'm not saying the film will go down in history. God forbid it does."
"Chris Knipp","7","0","4","18 April 2007"," A little run for your money
","D.J. Caruso can draw you in, as he did with the phantasmagorical Salton Sea and the initially engaging police procedural, Taking Lives. Disturbia's premise is derivative -- it's a teenager version of Hitchcock's Rear Window -- but manages to seem fresh. The movie is set up with more detail about character than is usual with formulas for the genre. The paradox is that when you compare it with Hitchcock's more genteel world all that was necessary in the earlier film is a little dialogue, not a fishing scene or a violent car crash. The contrast shows how crude and brutal Hollywood movies are now, how much they have to labor to achieve their effects. Jimmy Stewart had a broken leg. We have to see Shia LaBeouf doing poorly in Spanish class, being pushed by the teacher, and then socking him and getting sentenced afterwards to house arrest.<br/><br/>This is good in a way. We've never seen a teenager confined to home for 90 days with an ankle sensor before. You can feel his frustration, his gorging on junk food, his trashing his room. And then the binoculars come out and he starts visually stalking the neighbors and finds a babe and a creep out there. It's fun to watch Kale (LaBoeuf) and his pal Ronnie (Aaron Yoo), who's a comic, skittish, loose canon kid, get excited watching Ashley (Sarah Roemer), the shapely new girl next door. Indeed Ashley is a dishy jailbait blend of Gwyneth Paltrow and Uma Thurman. It's cool how Ashley just walks into Kale's house one day and almost starts smooching with Kale right away, and Kale sneaks up behind her and smells her hair. All this updates the trapped detective genre with a vengeance and makes Rear Window look tame. But Hitchcock's movie develops a mystery through visual clues effectively because of Stewart's suave inertia. LaBoeuf is all over the place, and then when we get to the menace (because it's menace rather than mystery that comes), the movie hits us over the head with it, bombards us with loud ""scary"" booming music. By this time all that's been going on, straining to hold our attention above the sound of crunching popcorn, though its inventiveness has charm, also gets in the way of the suspense (which needs to be more obsessive and focused than this) and leaves you at the end sort of wondering if the bad guy really existed.<br/><br/>But we must give Caruso credit for both originality and pop instincts. Shia LaBoeuf may soon be the flavor of the month. He is without the complexity of a Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the pop sex appeal of a Justin Timberlake, or, to reach a bit, without a hint of the charisma of a River Phoenix, but as twenty-something movie ""teenagers"" go, he's got different, and for a mainstream filmmaker like Caruso, good, stuff. He's slightly humorous, yet angry and impulsive (he's a loose canon too, obviously; that must be why he and Ronnie are pals). What's distinctive about him is he's neutral without being uninteresting. LaBoeuf is a sort of twenty-something ""teenage"" Everyman.<br/><br/>What makes you realize you're in a formula picture is that loud music, with the booms and the little sound effects. Once it kicks in you're stuck with it for the duration, and it drums up stock scare responses so powerfully you're ready to jump at every shadow or moving object. Caruso has done a lot of television. Salton Sea's craziness was interesting till it meandered too long; it did have the virtue of being completely weird and pointless. Taking Lives, with a miscast Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke, still seemed intriguing and original for a while. This time with Disturbia Caruso carries you through to the end quite nicely if you don't expect too much.<br/><br/>The visual style here, the tech fun of cell phone camera hooked up to TV monitors with text messages saying ""look at your TV"" -- even the old ploy of hooking up loudspeakers out the window to disturb neighbors' pool party guests (surprisingly, with Minnie Ripperton) is engaging and up-to-date. But the use of grainy images to scare us because we don't know what they are backfires because the menace remains so vague it's just generic. You're beginning to find the whole movie becoming a blur. Throughout Disturbia -- a good name, that -- hinting at the seedy underbelly of the middle class and the confined teenager's frustration -- its virtues gradually turn into partial weaknesses. In the end it's just a little entertainment. It makes you care about its young hero a little, amuses you a little, scares you a little. Then it's over and you're back with a teenager who's exonerated himself, but still isn't really going anywhere, and an ending that's been completely rushed. There's no sense, as in Rear Window, of a tricky, threatening villain tracked down and stopped, or of getting to the bottom of a mystery that had come to intrigue us.<br/><br/>Still, nice work by nearly all the actors, and a great role for rising star LaBeouf, who might turn out to be interesting as well as typical if he gets some good roles."

","Alright... so the freakiest thing about this movie to start off with was that my friends and I weren't expecting a gore serial-killer flick... we were expecting a comedy.<br/><br/>But after the shock factor of unexpectation (not a word, I realize) wore off, there was the suspense of Mr. Turner behind every door, waiting with that bat. The anxiety never let off; I'm certain this movie gave me an ulcer.<br/><br/>And when you're watching the beginnings of a romance scene and they break into the freaky mystery killing stuff, it sends one's brain into a rewire-trip. Again it has to do with expecting one thing and getting another. The twists and turns were well done, I thought.<br/><br/>It was my opinion that Disturbia avoided most of the horror movie clinches that many do... like the stupid stuff some have of the main character not grabbing an obvious weapon when on the way to check out if the killer is really dead. No, Shia kept those shears with him throughout that scene, though the way he jounced that rickety board in the shaft was really intelligent, as well as the way he stuffed himself into that vent to check it out while inside the killer's house.<br/><br/>The acting was outstanding as well, all of the cast putting just the right amount of emotion into their roles without going overboard (though, I don't think it might be possible to get over-dramatic in those situations).<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent horror-romance-slight comedy (Ronnie rocks that last bit all by himself, I think)and one that will stay with me but won't give me nightmares."
