"lnery","10","143","193","4 April 2011"," Location, location, location. It's Rio!
","""Oh, how wish I was back in my cage, with my mirror, and my little bell""<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg should be forever grateful that the Oscar-nominated ""The Social Network"" was released before Rio. That's because his voice as Blu, the macaw, is so distinctive and perfect, that in my mind he will always be Blu. And if Rio had been released months ago, audiences worldwide would think that Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, missed his cage, mirror and little bell. <br/><br/>Now, for the movie itself<br/><br/>Location, location, location. Because what's Rio, the movie, without (pulsating, colorful, exuberant, romantic) Rio, the city? The story is delightful, though predictable. The characters are cardboard, even if 3D and feathery. But ""predictable"" and ""cardboard"" are the worst adjectives I could possibly link to Rio. The Rio deal, is that I laughed all the way through it, like everybody else in the theater.<br/><br/>Blu, the last male of his kind, is the happiest macaw, out there in a snowy town with Linda, his nerdy owner. Jewel, the last female of her kind, lives in Brazil, and is the saddest macaw, imprisoned in a cage and fighting for her freedom. She's a free-spirited soul, with the world at her feet. Blu has lived a sheltered life, can't fly, and loves every minute of it. What happens when they meet? Anyone above the age of 7 can guess how it ends (age 5 if he's seen the trailer). But there's so much delight from the first minute to the last, that you don't want it to end.<br/><br/>I was one of the lucky few to watch the premiere of Rio in Rio, and at this point I can hardly wait to see it again. A Brazilian, Carlos Saldanha, directed the movie, and it shows. The details of the city are all there, but so is the big picture (you know, everything that really matters, along with wide panoramas of Rio by night, of a crowded beach, of a sunset in the cable cars of Santa Teresa).<br/><br/>Lots of AMAZING aerial views in the action scenes. The main characters are birds, thus flying should be expected. Many of those places showed in the movie can be visited by tourists.<br/><br/>Rio doesn't have the depth of stories such as Toy Story or Up. It is a simpler plot. It is, however, pure fun from start to finish, and visually stunning. Location, location, location. As a native of Rio, I could recognize most places, and was stunned with how realistic were the slums, and how the geography of the city, especially the mountains, could be so painstakingly reproduced. <br/><br/>The movie is not a musical, but it comes close to it. There's funk, bossa nova, a few clichés of Brazilian music and even samba sang in English (still conflicted about it!). <br/><br/>There is also the portrayal of animal trafficking, a centuries-old problem in Brazil, and the subplot of a boy who lives on the streets and must resort to petty crime, which adds up to a much-needed social commentary.<br/><br/>By all means, don't miss this movie!"
"LazySod","7","6","6","1 August 2011"," Two birds of a feather
","The story starts as a number of birds is caught in the middle of the Brazilian rain forest. One of them is a blue parrot, and as it turns out, a very special one. Years later the wheels of fate have taken him into the loving hands of a woman that treats him very well, maybe a little too well. Fate is again turning on him and his presence is needed in Rio.<br/><br/>And that's where this very colourful animation film really starts rolling. He quickly meets a number of friends and a necessary number of enemies and the rest of the story unfolds at a pleasantly quick pace.<br/><br/>Animation wise this one is nice, but not more than nice. The colour scheme is just great, spot on for the type of film, but action wise it's too much of a kids film - there's too little fun stuff hidden under the surface to keep the adults happy.<br/><br/>Story wise it's a little too rich on clichés and the easy turns and tangles. It's not bad but it's not great. All in all, it works great on the children, and works OK on their parents/guardians.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 feathers in a ruffle"
"alex_serious","7","6","6","1 May 2011"," Went to Rio and loved it.
","And BAM! Suddenly, singing and dancing. Rio explodes into life in the opening scene and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. An easy going adventure with fun and random musical numbers and breath-taking scenery.<br/><br/>However, it isn't all sun and sand. Jesse Eisenberg and his character ""Blu"" will annoy you from start to finish as will the slobbering dog.<br/><br/>But these are very easy to dismiss, as Eisenberg is in no way a bad actor, nor are any of the other cast members for that matter. The fact is, that there isn't much to say about this movie because it is really good, not a master piece, but really good.<br/><br/>So take you and your baby to Rio because you will both enjoy it. Unless you are a pessimist.<br/><br/>7/10 stars or 3.5/5 stars"
"LBWood","7","6","6","25 April 2011"," Predictable but well done
","We saw this in 2D, on a digital projection system. While the movie is an hour and 36 minutes, it felt longer to me. I guess it's because there was nothing new about this, it was all pretty predictable. I even dozed off for a few minutes part way through. <br/><br/>Now, on the positive side, the movie's colors are rich and vibrant. The animation quality is simply amazing; some of the wide scenic shots looked almost real. The music is a lot of fun and there are some good laughs, especially in the latter half of the film. My 10-year old son was glued to the screen; even asked us when it was over which was our favorite scene(s). Overall, it's a good film. I'd say take the kids and go have some fun."
"drakula2005","8","95","143","10 April 2011"," Rio-an epic, lovable, beautiful and visually stunning animation
","Not many animations like Rio come around these days.When i first saw the trailer and the team behind this very anticipated animation, the Ice Age team, i knew it will be very enjoyable and fun to watch.Seeing a TV spot right now, i remember that it was all those things, but much more as well.The quality of the animation was unique-only two or three movies can still compete with this and those are Tangled, Up and How to Train Your Dragon.But still, there was so much going on in Rio, the birds, the colors, the non-stopping stream of movement, lights, music and songs, around the carnival in Rio or in the opening and closing scenes with the singing and dancing of the birds in the forests around the city.So much was going on and with such quality, that no animation has matched.And those epic proportions of the animation are its strongest qualities.Something one can't see every day.<br/><br/>The character development was very good, beginning with a little background of the macaw bird Blu's life, with his owner Linda in Minnesota.Maybe, the other macaw, Jewel, was a little underdeveloped as a character, but with positive reviews coming, there might be a sequel coming on the way as well.Then, Jewel's background might be better developed.<br/><br/>With an animation of such proportions, some box office power along with a few Oscar noms will surely be along the way and the fact that it takes place in Rio alone, will act as an audience magnet, given that Rio's one of the most popular and non-stopping cities in the world.This magical feeling stays all along the movie.You just can't forget you're in Rio.<br/><br/>Rio is as well another example of an animation, worth the time and money of both young and grown-ups.That's what catches the eye.20-th Century Fox has made a great animation and with the possible box-office power of the movie, a sequel might as well be on the works.<br/><br/>So, a great animation, very epic and visually stunning, Rio will keep everyone mesmerized and captivated long after the end, and personally for me is one of the best, if not the bast animation i've seen.<br/><br/>I definitely hope for a sequel and i'll definitely see it again, at the movies.<br/><br/>10/10 for this stunning, colorful, heartwarming and breathtaking experience, named Rio!<br/><br/>P.S.The one thing i thought was missing, was Bellini's Samba De Janeiro- this song can make the mood of every crowd in the world :)"
"arthurwitulski","5","40","59","29 May 2011"," Nice Artwork, but mediocre characterization
","After reading a good review of this movie I talked my wife into going to see it, as I love animation. I wanted to see the artwork and I thought the Brazilian music would be a plus. Well, the first three minutes fulfilled my expectations, but it was downhill from there. The artwork is indeed good in most scenes and breathtaking in one or two. However, the difference between this and a Pixar film is in the story telling and characterization. Whereas an adult can easily watch a film like ""Toy Story 3"" or ""Up"" multiple times, in ""Rio,"" the characters really never develop enough depth for you to suspend your disbelief. Tulio's bird imitation are meant to be comic, but instead are ridiculous. Linda is the shy introvert girl from Minnesota who predictably asserts herself when the going gets rough. I never understood why two of the major characters in Rio are not Brazilian, but instead talk like two Home Boys from the Bronx. Well, you get the idea. There is one character that succeeds admirably, and that is the villain, an evil bird named Nigel. But all told, this film is fine for kids, but I would not recommend it for adults."
"freemantle_uk","8","44","66","8 April 2011"," Bird Love and Nerd Love
","The Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro is serving as the setting for two films being released this April: one being a full on action film, Fast and Furious 5, the other being a family animated adventure. Rio is that film and shows that the Fox subsidiary Blue Sky Studios is growing from strength to strength.<br/><br/>Blu the Spix's Macaw's (Jesse Eisenberg) early life is tragic, having fledging from his nest too early and been kidnapped by poachers. Luckily he was adopted by a loving owner, Linda (Leslie Mann) as a little girl. 15 years later Linda owns a bookstore in the snowy landscape of Minnesota and Blu becoming a very nerdy bird. A Brazilian ornithologist, Túlio (Rodrigo Santoro) finds Linda and tells her that Blu is the last male of his species and takes them to Rio de Janeiro so the bird could breed. But Blu does not hit it off with Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and matters get worst when poachers take the birds and chain them together. When their escape Blu and Jewel they try and reunite with Linda whilst avoiding being captured by the poachers and their insane cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement).<br/><br/>Rio is a pure formula picture and there are many elements have been in other films, such as Blu being taken from the wild as a chick, the animosity between Blu and Jewel and we all know where it is going to lead, the story of Nigel having a tragic past and being rejected, etc, etc. But formula does not have to be bad and when done right it can easily lead to an enjoyable film for all the family. Director Carlos Saldanda certainly made a fast paced adventure with a great amount of velvet colour. There is a more old-fashion feel to it, like Disney films and its copycats in the 90s. Pop-culture references are toned down and there are a few musical numbers which is rare in CGI animated features. The animation itself has a similar look to Pixar's particular the human characters, though Túlio looks very similar to the main character in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. The animation of the parrots climbing is particularly well done and true to live to anyone who has ever own one.<br/><br/>Much of the humour of the film is kid friendly slapstick as is expected from this type of film and it is done very well. There is enough for parents and adults audiences to keep them entertaining. My personal favourites were the double act Kipo (Robin Thicke) and Marcel (Carlos Ponce) who were the dumb henchmen for the poacher and outsmarted by a cockatoo. They have some of the best lines in the film. But the two characters Pedro the Red-crested Cardinal (will.i.am) and Nico the yellow canary (Jamie Fox) were annoying and pretty stereotypical.<br/><br/>Eisenberg gives a typical nerdy performance as his character is book-smart, but not adventurous at all, preferring to be safe with his owner. Compared to Hathaway she is a feisty, strong female character who wants to explore and distrusts humans. Both learn from each other, for Blu that there is a wider world and for Jewel that not all humans are bad. Clement was funny as he parodies British actors playing psychopathic villains in action films. Though I do question why ornithologists did not question why they had an injured cockatoo considering the species is native to Australia and New Guinea (but this is a minor issue). As well as the bird love in the film there is also some nerd love.<br/><br/>A respectable 7.5/10."
"spacespidy","8","38","57","11 April 2011"," Adventures of Bird Blu!
","It's story of how love compels to break comfort zone and discover our new self. Visually stunning Rio is brilliant stroke of writers to add magic to adventures and love tale of endangered bird ""Blu"". Story wouldn't have been same with Samba, carnival, beaches, mountain views, Tram buses if it was not Rio.<br/><br/>The whole story revolves around Tamed Blu and wild Jewel. Jesse Eisenber and Anne Hathaway did their best voice acting. Apart from Blu and Jewel there are plenty of characters which build story effectively and added plenty of rib tickling moments.<br/><br/>Even though story is simple and very much predictable with obvious ending, still story survives to tell a tale of love despite differences. Brilliant animation in 3d will take you on Journey of adventure and fun! <br/><br/>A must watch for its animation!"
"Rectangular_businessman","7","12","16","17 March 2012"," Not great, but watchable
","""Rio"" it's a decent animated film for the whole family. It was directed by Carlos Saldanha (Who also co-directed the ""Robots"" and ""Ice Age"") Despite the immense amount of clichés and stereotypes that this movie had (Remember that episode from The Simpsons, ""Blame it on Lisa""?) I enjoyed it: The animation is cute and colorful; personally I liked way more the designs of the birds than the designs of the human beings that just seem quite bland and generic. The same goes for their personalities: The birds were the most interesting (and funnier) characters from this movie, while all the humans (Including the main villain) were just boring, one-dimensional characters that were easily forgettable at best.<br/><br/>The voice acting from ""Rio"" was pretty good, and even when some of the jokes seem forced (Or borrowed from previous CGI films) the overall movie feels okay, being watchable from beginning to end. And also, it was much better than the ""Ice Age"" sequels."
"TourettesPersonal","8","39","64","7 April 2011"," Colors and Flying
","The main plot of ""Rio"", an endangered bird doesn't know how to fly. It sounds a bit predictable and this plot was already used by many movies. But the core of this film is showing the beautiful place of Rio De Janeiro. The filmmaking was great. Colorful visuals, often hilarious, and decent directing.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with the voice acting. The main cast, Jesse Eisenber and Anne Hathaway are like the bird versions of them. Jemaine Clement really made his character evil. The rest of the cast, Will.i.am, Jamie Foxx and George Lopez adds more fun to the movie. I just wish Tracy Morgan's character Luiz had more scenes.<br/><br/>The visuals are colorful and very spectacular. It really shows how beautiful Rio De Janeiro is. The flying sequence is indeed breathtaking even if it's in 2D. The problem of the movie is it's not so compelling. The ending seems rushed. We will all know what's gonna happened to this flightless bird. Although the movie has a big heart. The movie is often funny of course.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fun experience. ""Rio"" is not like Pixar but it's still enjoyable for the whole family. After watching all of those awful recent blockbusters, I think ""Rio"" is the best movie I've seen this year so far. It could be the studio's best movie yet."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","72","126","8 April 2011"," My favourite movie of the year so far
","That in mind, there is more of 2011 I have yet to see, hence the so far bit, but I absolutely loved this movie after seeing it when it came out today. From the trailers and advertising it looked like a bright, breezy and entertaining animation, and in my mind it was much more than that. And I genuinely mean it when I say it is my favourite of the year so far, even surpassing the outstanding(if somewhat misunderstood) Rango.<br/><br/>What I loved most about Rio was its energy. Rio for me has more energy than any of the Ice Age(from the same team) movies, and its energy is truly infectious at that. Two reasons especially make it so. One is the writing, I wasn't expecting the writing to be this sharp, funny and witty, looking at some of the previous work the writer has penned, while the jokes are plentiful and come by thick and fast. The other is the soundtrack. It has a huge amount of authentic Brazilian flavour and just ripples with zest. I loved the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout, and further fun is to be had in the Busby Berkeley-style beginning and the truly spectacular Carnaeval finale.<br/><br/>The story isn't perhaps original, nor did it need to be, but it is fast-paced, with many entertaining scenes and is very rarely predictable. There is also the obligatory life lessons here which are seamlessly blended without feeling shoe-horned in or preachy. I loved the characters too. Blu is very endearing, and voiced brilliantly by The Social Network's Jesse Eisenberg. Jewel is a lovely love interest, and her chemistry with Blu is ceaselessly entertaining and cute. Anne Hathaway previously voiced Haru on the English dub of The Cat Returns. She did a fine job on that, but in Rio she is even better, more understated and less shrill. I equally loved the villainous cockatoo Nigel(who avoids being a caricature and the like and voiced phenomonally by Jermaine Clement) and the constantly drooling bull-dog.<br/><br/>Other than the above components, what also made Rio was its animation, which is simply stupendous. I haven't seen an animated movie in a long while(and I am a huge fan of animation) where the colours in particular are so rich and warm. The characters are also beautifully modelled especially the titular character Blu, and this includes the secondary characters as well, and the sceneries and backgrounds are breathtaking with such a refreshing richness and warmth. In conclusion, a wonderful animated film and my favourite of the year so far. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

"gregeichelberger","5","19","31","16 April 2011"," Colorful and energetic, but ultimately lacking in heart
","Director Carlos Saldanha and the other creative minds behind the ""Ice Age"" franchise, have come up with a vibrant new animal centric CGI effort featuring the colorful birds of Brazil. And even the annoying vocalizations of Tracy Morgan and Will i. am do not detract from the fun - too much.<br/><br/>""Rio,"" written by Saldanha and Don Rhymer, tells the tale of a dispossessed blue Mackaw, Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg, ""Zombieland,"" ""The Social Network"") captured in Rio de Janeiro transported to the states and found by a little girl, Linda, in Minnesota. She grows up and Blu, used to the domesticated life, is perfectly content until Brazilian ornithologist Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) arrives to inform her that Blu is the last male of his species.<br/><br/>Guilt-ridden, Linda agrees to accompany Tulio back to Rio to mate her pet to the last female, Jewel (Anne Hathaway, ""Love and Other Drugs""). Of course, complications arise when an unscrupulous exotic bird smuggler and his evil cockatoo henchman, Nigel (Jermaine Clement), capture the feathered pair. Like any number of films like this, the mismatched human duo must now unite to save their animal counterparts.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, other supporting characters line up on both sides. Giving aid and comfort to Blu and Jewel include a toucan, Rafael (George Lopez), a canary, Nico (Jamie Foxx), a fat pigeon rapper (Will i.am) and a misplaced bulldog (Tracy Morgan). Joining up with the smuggler is a gaggle of fierce but inept monkeys.<br/><br/>Despite the assistance, the two heroes are ultimately left to save themselves. Flightless and pampered, Blu must also prove himself a worthy companion to the bold and confident Jewel, something that does not come easily.<br/><br/>The artists behind this movie certainly create a wild and brilliant eye-pleasing adventure. The rhythms and hues of this South American escapade are wonderful to behold and the tunes are fairly enjoyable, from Lionel Ritchie to Jamie Foxx to an irritating rap by Will i.am.<br/><br/>The problem is the story. We've seen this domesticated animal returns to their primitive roots premise before in ""Madagascar,"" ""The Wild"" and, most recently, ""Rango."" Blu also plays the same old spoiled nerd fish-out-of-water character who somehow learns a lifetime of instinct and savvy in a few minutes in an attempt to capture the unattainable female of the species.<br/><br/>The pacing is frenetic and the human characters take a backseat the the the feathery and furry stars of the picture. That' fine, though, because Linda and Tulio are fairly non-descript, anyhow.<br/><br/>Smaller children will most likely get a big kick from the vast and sparkling colors - especially the Carnival finale. Older kids and adults may chuckle at a few situations, but overall may find the going a bit tedious, particularly when the obligatory bird-brained moral life lessons hit like a splat on the windshield of a freshly washed automobile."
"moviexclusive","9","47","87","5 April 2011"," Bursting with infectious energy and verve from music to colour to spectacle, this is one heck of a party you'd be a cuckoo to miss!
","The makers of ""Ice Age"" have decided to take a vacation from the cold and literally venture into warmer- much warmer- territory. Indeed, after three consecutive outings through sub-zero temperatures, director Carlos Saldanha has set his sights on the tropical city of Rio de Janeiro- also the second largest city of Brazil- where summer temperatures often hit a sizzling 40 °C. And what a wondrous source of inspiration this sojourn has been for the Brazilian-born Saldanha, whose ""Rio"" bursts forth from the screen with unparalleled colour, imagination and sheer energy. <br/><br/>Saldanha wants you to know that he is in Rio to have a party, so right from the beginning, all manner of feathered creatures of different sizes, colours and species welcome a new dawn in the lush tropical rainforest with a boisterous acrobatic sequence, set to the infectious beat of the legendary Sergio Mendes (who serves as executive music producer here). Among the greenery is the birthplace of our protagonist, Blu (Jesse Eisenberg), an exotic blue macaw who is subsequently taken out of his nest and domesticated by a local bookshop owner Linda (Leslie Mann) in the snowy Minnesota town of Moose Lake. <br/><br/>A visiting ornithologist from Rio, Tulio, offers a quick and convenient excuse for Blu to return to his native land- the last male of his species, he is needed to mate with a feisty female called Jewel (Anne Hathaway) for the continuity of his kind. Jewel, on the other hand, is only intent on escaping her captivity, but things get complicated when she and Blu are abducted from Tulio's lab by smugglers and chained to each other. By sheer luck and some ingenuity, they manage to escape, and spend the rest of the time trying to cut themselves free from each other, while evading capture by the bad guys and their evil cockatoo Nigel (Flight of the Conchords' Jermaine Clement). <br/><br/>Staying true to formula, Blu and Jewel will bicker like the typical mismatched couple at the beginning, only to fall in love with each other by the end. Predictable though the journey may be, veteran screenwriter Don Rhymer makes the journey a pure delight every step of the way with great supporting characters, witty lines and hilarious scenarios. Not often do we find all three in equal measure within a movie, but ""Rio"" is a perfect example of the laugh-out-loud hilarity that ensues when these three elements come together so beautifully.<br/><br/>A tram ride up the slopes of Rio is turned into a matchmaking opportunity by Blu and Jewel's three travel companions- a Toucan named Rafael (George Lopez) and two wisecracking birds Pedro and Nico (will.i.am and Jamie Foxx)- as Rafael dispenses love advice to Blu while Pedro strums across the wires of a tram like a guitar and Nico croons a romantic tune. ""Tell her you have beautiful eyes!"" Rafael whispers to Blu, to which Blu turns to Jewel and says ""Did you know that I have beautiful eyes?""<br/><br/>Rhymer also saves some of the best lines of the movie for Nigel. An uproarious song-and-dance item where he gets to introduce the depth of his villainy to his audience sees him prancing pompously around caged birds cowering in their cages singing lines like ""like an abandoned school, I have no principal"". And when recruiting a bunch of thieving monkeys as his henchmen to search for Blu and Jewel, Nigel warns them in a dead-serious tone, ""no more monkey business"". <br/><br/>Of course, these lines are only as good as the voice cast delivering them, and thankfully then, the cast Saldanha has assembled here is outstanding. Eisenberg oozes apprehension and trepidation with every line as the cowardly dork, Hathaway packs gusto as the spunky foil against Eisenberg, will.i.am and Foxx have perfect comic timing playing off each other's lines, and Clement chews up his great one-liners with menacing glee (you may be keen to know that he also co-wrote the song ""Pretty Bird"" above). Their chemistry is palpable from start to finish, and their exchanges throughout the film are nothing less than spirited and lively. <br/><br/>But a lot of the energy in ""Rio"" is visual, courtesy of Saldanha's eye for detail and aptitude for action. The animation of each one of the characters, lead or supporting or even extra, is exceptional, their respective characteristics distinctive and inspired. The colours- unlike the duller, wintry landscapes of ""Ice Age""- are dazzling and vibrant. And most of all, the action sequences best appreciated in 3D- a flight over Rio with a panoramic view of Guanbara Bay, a narrow escape over the rooftops of the favelas, and the climactic finale through the crowds at the city's annual Carnivale festival- explode with vigour and verve reminiscent of that in the city's signature samba music, whose Latin rhythms add generously to the film's oomph. <br/><br/>That oomph is simply part of the party that Saldanha invites you to be part of from beginning to end, and ""Rio"" has every bit of the infectious sounds of the drumbeats, the colours of the sequins, feathers and headdresses, and the energy of the performers in the city's most famous annual party festival. Yes, for those of us who probably can't afford to take that Singapore Airlines flight down to Brazil, this is the closest you'll get to soak in the sights and sounds of that lively city. The best part of it all? It's a party the whole family will enjoy."
"Theothervip","Null","17","28","8 April 2011"," Nothing new, but look at that breathtaking scenery. Wow!
","Rating: *** out of 4. <br/><br/>I usually don't like movies like RIO, mainly because they always end up being rehashes of previous movies; unless your talking Pixar, there's very little to no new things in animated movies nowadays other than their exquisite looks. So when I saw a special advanced screening of RIO a few days ago, my expectations were low, enough for me to expect that the film will fail. But hey, what a surprise! It's pretty good actually. So RIO ain't a new masterpiece-it's not at all much different with any Dreamworks or Blue Sky Animation effort that comes out every given year- but it was fun. The kids at the screening had a ball with it, but I can also hear older teenagers and adult audiences chuckling along with them. And I'm up there with them. <br/><br/>The story isn't something you haven't heard before. Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a rare Blue Macaw raised in Minnesota by the bookish Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann). But being the last male of his species, Blu is requested to leave his Minnesota homeland and shipped to his real birthplace, in Rio de Janeiro, where a female of the same species is being kept in captivity. Blu doesn't warm up easily to the impetuous Jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway), and certainly a rare bird such as her being kept in captivity like that doesn't help. It also doesn't help that Jewel wants to escape and Blu, being a total ""housebird"" and all, can't fly. <br/><br/>But what it lacks in a fresh new idea it more than makes up for in lively execution. This movie is just amazing to look at, boasting one of the most gorgeous looks of any animated movie since some of the Pixar films and the occasionally bizarre but lavish-looking BEE MOVIE. It may even be more beautiful since this is exactly what it wants to be and not much else. Director Carlos Saldanha, who helmed two ICE AGE sequels, and the rest of the crew have done just that. The eye-popping visuals are the moneymaker and one of the few films to come out once and a while that is worth paying extra money to see on 3D. Once again, the 3D ain't something groundbreaking, but it's exactly what comes to mind when thinking of 3D; the visuals are pristine and dynamic, with flying scenes that are just breathtaking to watch. I could almost feel the wind as a glider glides past the Christ the Redeemer statue. Rio itself looks gorgeous, from the ""Carnival"" parades to the look of it during the nighttime scenes are just beautiful. If nothing else, it's a virtual tour of a beautiful portrait painted by Saldanha and his animators. The voice cast ain't bad either. Eisenberg is hilarious, and granted he'll be doing these kind of work sometime soon. The real standout is Jemaine Clement (from FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS), who lends an irresistible bad guy charm as a cockatoo named Nigel. Hathaway, George Lopez, will.I.am and Jamie Foxx all fulfill their roles perfectly. <br/><br/>RIO ain't much new, but at least I enjoyed it for what it is. And I wouldn't mind going back to it during its official release and wallow in the dazzling scenery again. Here's a movie meant to be done (and seen) on 3D."
"Gordon-11","Null","41","77","21 May 2011"," There is something missing in Rio
","This film is about a blue macaw who is brought to Rio de Janeiro for mating. Things go wrong when some bandits steal the birds for the black market.<br/><br/>""Rio"" is set in the exotic Brazil, amidst the world famous carnival. However, the film does not capture the same uplifting spirit. The plot is tiring and boring, with little to arouse or maintain viewers' interests. There is only enough excitement for young kids, but little for adults to enjoy. Sure, the visuals are very good, with great colours and smooth animation. The aerial scenes of Rio de Janeiro is breathtaking, but the visuals alone are not enough to make ""Rio"" a success. There is something missing in ""Rio"", and I got bored by it."

","Wow, this was such a disappointment, I felt really bad having convinced my partner to go to see it. The great part that earns the 4 stars is the animation of animals (not humans) Yes, they are cute, well drawn and animated, and all that jazz. But, yes, there is a huge BUT here, the plot, the dialog, the human ""love"" story... Well, they all fail to inspire any kind of emotion or imagination. On top of badly written, slow dialog, which is not helped much by the necessary comic elements, you have really badly written songs! Something like: ""I fly like a bird, oh wait, I AM a bird."" Wow, really really? What's interesting, though, is that the ""camera"" lingers a few seconds after the characters leave the scene on the favela, the human built trash-tin-dumpster living spaces crammed on top of each other, full of homeless, street-smart kids like the one meet in the film... It lingers, as if to almost say something, as if it will finally add something to all this taking place in Rio, and the economic necessity that some people might have in stealing rare animals, but it doesn't. Nor does the film shy of piling up many stereotypes, you know, all Brazilians care about is partying, and they fail at doing their jobs mostly because they just want to party, watch soccer, wear Carnival costumes and dance in the streets, no wait, even at home all the time. Naturally, the police are useless, the professor is useless, the animal smugglers are useless. Right? At times the stereotypes are a bit uncomfortable, because it is not clear why they are there. They are mostly used as stale plot devices, otherwise nothing would be believable, even in the cartoon-suspended-reality kind of believable. The only character worthy of any praise, in terms of vision and execution, is Nigel, the villain bird. The rest? I have already forgotten everything about them! The laughter sometimes was louder than the joke merited, mainly because people and children expected to be laughing. When it is hard to find something good to laugh at, you laugh hard at the lame jokes even harder. Note for parents: Children in the audience seemed to enjoy the film much more than the adults."
"jurandyrsf","7","8","12","3 May 2011"," Beautiful but Stereotyped
","I'd rate this movie a 10, but the prejudice it displays prevents me to do so.<br/><br/>There is a recent trend in the movie business to tell stories about Rio de Janeiro's slums. Such is the case of the last Hulk movie, a good part of which was set in the Rocinha slum.<br/><br/>Not everything in Rio de Janeiro is a slum. There are slums everywhere, as there are high, middle and low class, non-slum neighborhoods.<br/><br/>And not all bad things in Rio happens within slums. Bad and good people live in and out of slums. So ""Rio"" displays double prejudice, about Rio de Janeiro city as a whole - it's much more than slums - and about the slum's inhabitants - bad people exist inside and outside the slums.<br/><br/>Of course, no movie about Rio could forget Carnaval and football. That's OK. I'd just add that Carnaval doesn't happen only in the Sambodromo or in the slums.<br/><br/>As for the rest: (a) The story is pure fantasy, where animals think and act as humans in disguise. But this is what fables are for: conveying human messages in a playful way. (b) Rio de Janeiro is pretty accurate geographically, except for the remote, jungle airport from which the bad guys take off to take the stolen, hero birds away, as there is no such airport anywhere near this city.<br/><br/>Please, film-makers: when you consider making a movie about Rio, try to provide a balanced instead of a prejudiced, biased view of my worldly famous ""Wonder City""."
"leo-noboru","5","8","13","19 December 2011"," I hate to call a movie ""overrated"", but this one fits the definition
","Down here in ol' South America, most precisely in Brazil--which just so happens to be the setting for this movie--rumor has it Brazilian director Carlos Saldanha's ""Rio"" is perhaps the strongest contender for the Animated Feature Oscar, not to mention it is right up there with Pixar's recent works as one of the best animations of the past few years. It's been a consensus among Brazilian critics that it was by far the best animated feature of the year and one of the highlights of the year in general; ""Rio"" earned four stars out of five in virtually all Brazilian papers and magazines and a good deal of the most respected critics of the country surrendered to its so-called tear-jerking depiction of the city where it's set. Well, ladies and gentleman, the truth is, all this praise is nothing but the result of blind boosterism, for ""Rio"" is, in all honesty, a bad movie. Period.<br/><br/>The idea of there only being two blue macaws left in the world and one of them living in Minnesota is quite hard to swallow on itself. Then you add a romantic arc as cliché as it can be: an insecure, spoiled male meets a hot-tempered, independent female. The female doesn't like the male at first; the male has a major issue that he has been struggling to overcome. They forcibly set off on an adventure where they get to know each other; the male falls in love with the female, and, with the help of cute side characters, becomes closer and closer to her. They face a near-death experience toward the end of the movie where it all depends on the male's ability to overcome his issue. Then the female kisses the male and suddenly he finds the strength to save their lives, and they live happily ever after. Yes, Blu and Jewel's plot could be thought up by a nine-year-old kid (who never watched a Pixar movie). It is, at most, a silly story made to sell Rio de Janeiro's tourism potential and thematize Burger King giveaways. Actually, it kinda reminds me of Dreamworks Animation at its worst: uninspired, commercial, overconfident (e.g. Madagascar 1 and the Shrek sequels).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; this movie could be watchable as a fun children's movie if you didn't know about the outrageous overrating it received. But the very fact that ""Rio"" gets to a point where every line is situation is entirely predictable and yet critics claim it was ""breathtaking"" makes me wonder how much praise it would have received had it been set in a country like, say, Australia. Critics seem to be blind to the amount of ridiculousnesses in this movie, ranging from English-speaking bird traffickers and unrealistic situations to silly musical acts and, even though Rio is the director's hometown, preposterous stereotypes (Guess what? The American characters arrive just in time for Carnaval!).<br/><br/>Everything in this movie deserves a 4 out of 10--the characters are cute but extremely stereotyped, some jokes are really funny but most of them are downright naive, John Powell's score is great as usual but the songs are awful, the plot is efficient but way too predictable, and the kids will have a lot of fun but the adults will most certainly not, unless they are proud Brazilians. The only really good aspect of the film is the voice acting, but then again, any film can have good voice acting with the right amount of money to hire good performers like Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway. So if you want my opinion, I say don't listen to the critics--they'll make you watch this instead of the way better ""Cars 2""--and don't spend your money on this, because it is nothing but commercial cinema that confirms how weak 2011 was in terms of animated films. And I say all of this as a Brazilian user."

","Well, it's very difficult, specially for a Brazilian, not to rate this ""thing"" as 1 (awful).<br/><br/>What we see in this movie is a nightmare for any educated Brazilian, and the ""song"" remains the same: A movie that keeps on selling our image as a country that only cares about carnival, naked women, parties, soccer and having fun all the time.<br/><br/>I wonder when we will see people actually thinking before making such travesties related to my country's name. Where are the movies related to our discoveries in various education fields, such as engineering, aeronautics, space, physics, alternative fuels, and all sorts of applied science?

The story of a bird poached from his native land who accidentally ends up with a young girl as she grows up during the 15 years that passes before he's summoned by an animal doctor to mate with a female of his breed because of possible extinction is just the start of what I highly consider one of the best of its kind this year so far.

"saadgkhan","6","5","8","5 July 2011"," Rio is bright and colorful but just not funny enough. Still exotic birds and locations keeps us engaging.
","RIO – CATCH IT ( B ) Rio is colorful and delightful but very predictable and not funny enough. The thing we as adults love the most about animated movies these days is that it amuses children along with adults. In case of Rio, it cannot be said, because this was made strictly for children, there is nothing humorous for adults in it besides looking at exotic locations and feathery birds. Rio is visually fantastic and mesmerizing. It won't be wrong to say that the production team has out done their graphics in capturing the true essence of the exotic birds and locations. Blu is voiced by Jesse Eisenberg and I don't know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing. The whole time it was Jesse Eisenberg we were listening too and not for a second he tried to change his voice to make a unique one for Blu. It was suitable but we will never know what someone else would have brought to the table. On the other hand Anne Hathaway was incredible as voice of Jewel. Not for a second it felt like Anne she really amazed me. Will I.M & Jaime Foxx has to be my favorites next, there combo was great along with George Lopez. Leslie Mann was good but Rodrigo Santoro's character was weird and very amateurish nerdy. Besides the first and last dancing song I personally didn't enjoyed other numbers in the movie. Overall, Rio is a fun entertainer for kids and families."
"Ryan_MYeah","7","5","8","25 April 2011"," A funny, hearty movie. The music is especially worthy of notice.
","What is it that drives audiences to a movie? Word of mouth? Arguably, yes. Box office intake? Rarely. Awards Buzz? Sometimes. But advertising is the main thing that drives audiences to a new movie. I must confess that Rio, today's film I'm reviewing, suffers from the same problem as the earlier released Paul, advertising that makes it look like crap. And even though it wasn't as good as Paul, Rio is a solid movie with heart and humor.<br/><br/>It centers on the last male of his kind, a spix's macaw named Blu (Voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), currently in the ownership of a book shop keeper in Minnesota, who's brought by a Brazilian scientist to Rio De Jeneiro on the eve of Carnivale to mate with the fierce Jewel (Voiced by Anne Hathaway), the last female of the species. But they are kidnapped by smugglers who seek to sell them for countless amounts of money, but they escape into the jungle to make it back to their homes, and avoid the clutches of the smugglers' malicious cockatoo, Nigel (Voiced by cast standout, Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement).<br/><br/>As far as plot goes, the movie's not that special. The film has a certain romantic adventure quality to it, blended with the signature humorous touches of Blue Sky Studios, the film's producers. Is it predictable? Yes, and it's a bit kiddy at times, but Rio makes up for that with it's emotional touch, impressive voiceovers, and wit. The film, with it's clever one-liners and droll sight and sound gags, quite often got a good chuckle from myself.<br/><br/>I must also give praise to the crew who designed the film with the utmost technical quality possible. The movie looked and sounded great. The Blue Sky animators delivered a gorgeous multicolored palette, while Randy Thom did well with the film's sound effects and mix. But what ultimately sticks with me the most about Rio is the songs and score.<br/><br/>The music makes great use of percussive beats, guitars and maracas that are are incredibly catchy, something that's apparent right when the movie begins. The film's composer is John Powell, fresh off an Oscar nomination for what I consider to be 2010's best movie score, and one of my new top ten favorite scores, How to Train Your Dragon, and Rio is yet another outstanding job, so don't be surprised if he makes my year end top five score lineup yet again.<br/><br/>I may have some minor problems with it, but Rio's admirable story telling and movie making methods are enough reason for me to recommend it.<br/><br/>I give it *** out of ****"

","Rio is a vibrant, fun movie that will entertain both children and adults with its humor and spontaneity. In order to save his species, a flightless blue macaw and his keeper must spread their wings and journey to Rio do Janiero trailed by a ring of international bird smugglers. The main characters, a bird named Blue and Linda, his bookish owner, are both flightless in the sense that they choose not to explore beyond what they know. That is, until they discover that Blue is the last male of his species. Nothing forces them out of their comfortable lives except their sudden desire to help save Blue's species. The plot and themes are strong, making it functional and enjoyable to the audience, although it strongly lacks in characterization. Both Blue, Linda, and the entourage of secondary characters are either stock characters or merely flat. Additionally, the movie twists its positive theme of 'have the courage to be yourself' into a negative morale of 'being yourself is doing whatever feels good."" It also has a secondary environmental theme. This theme is enforced by lyrics sung by cute birds singing, ""I just want to live my life to party"" and other similar tag lines. We repeatedly see birds and people dancing at Marti Gras and exploring being themselves by getting loose, partying, and learning to love others by being reckless instead of selfless. Not child friendly themes in my opinion. The movie also exhibits completely flat villains, no mystery, no true conflict (no impossible goal). It's a comedy only film with a strong theme and plot but no real substance."

"sashank_kini-1","7","3","4","12 April 2011"," Blinded by the lovely colors; but not brain dead to disregard plot-boilers
","Rio is set in a carnival-like atmosphere, orchestrated by vivacious, Broadway-themed routines and sizzling, animally-carnal and sizzling dance sequences. Rio also provides an oeuvre of eccentric characters, which like various ingredients of a taste test titillate the eyes. They also manage to get along a few laughter with all their idiosyncrasies; for example, the drooling dog whose slimy slobber inadvertently comes in hand. Also the colors so brightly razzle-dazzle the screen, along with the synchrony of the dances transported me straight to the visually-arresting, larger-than-life Rio de Janeiro parade. But did the movie, the essence, the fabric stay with me ling after the end credits? Sadly not.<br/><br/>Blu, a precocious, protected young Macaw has been living since his babyhood with Linda, a nerdy, caring librarian and has many tricks under his sleeve, none of them involving flying (since he can't). Their fairytale life is punctuated by Tulia, a devoted ornithologist who after a quick deliberation, takes them to Rio De Janeiro to get the last male of the species (Blu, of course) to be mated with Jewel, a fiery but beautiful and independent female whose principles are islands apart from Blu's. Blu is a timorous, coy but adorable bird who enjoys human companionship while Jewel, akin other wild birds, prefers the dangerous yet sweeping jungles. Both embark on quite an epic, unpredictable journey with a multitude of characters to fit the pieces together.<br/><br/>Blu is perhaps the most drawn out adventure in recent years of animation. Unlike Disney, the movie has a no holds barred approach in its story making, somewhat like Casablanca. I didn't like Casablanca much, though. I thought it to be somewhat of a pastiche. Rio is a hodgepodge of collage, impromptu ideas that sometimes hit, and at others miss the mark. I'm currently getting the sixth season of Top Chef in India where a contestant named Robin too experiments the same way. A splash of colors incorporating into one grand picture, yeah, like Sidney Pollack. But Carlos Saldana is not Sydney Pollack; he's a passionate film-maker who makes entertaining movies. And Rio is quite a blast indeed. But a ""dream project"" as ascribed by him- not.<br/><br/>Rio has some nebulousness and inconsistencies in the actual vision that the director must've had at first. Throughout the film, characters fly in and out but not all succeed. Linda is gratingly voiced by Linda Mann who along with Radrigo Santoro acts cumbersome almost throughout the course of the movie. Lesley gets too synthetic and cliché in her delivery, while the scenes with Tulio are platitudinous. Rio is quirkily voiced by Jesse Eisenberg, who comes off smoothly in most of his scenes, even with those which lack finesse. Although sometimes the tone may come as calculative, analogous to his SN character and I felt not completely in love with Blu, but he surely enlightens the banality with his volubly theatrical tone. Anne supplies baritone and luminosity to her relentlessly brave Jewel, which complements Blu's nature, s some of the film's most fulfilling moments come when Jewel tries to make Blu fly while Blu helps her walk.<br/><br/>The subordinate entities add luster to the veneer, some in imposing colors, while others Grey and barren. The most promising are the bottle-cap donning canary and the chest-thumping Cardinal, done by Jamie Foxx and Will.i.am chirpily. Ironically, the prime song sung by the singers themselves is auto-tuned and vapid. Also, the screenplay forces them to recite cheesy catchphrases (i.e. ""its birds versus monkeys!""). Rafael, the toucan and his hissy but affectionate housewife and their 17 brood do provide some laughs, but I hate when Rafael's actor is asked to iterate inane lines ""Sorry, Eva. Can't come home for dinner tonight"". Such dialogs really lack impact in movies. Nigel, as the tyrannous has-been performer cockatoo is cartoonish and hilarious (the ""Cage tyrant"" song had wonderful charm). The monkeys are added impish fun. Luiz as the harmless bulldog is perhaps the most engaging character, wittily written.<br/><br/>The irresoluteness of the film really takes it to a pandering extent where gags are just randomly thrown in to arch out a smile in the faces of young unwitty kids. This is where Disney/Pixar scores one over them as they have sure shot money-making plots but with a touch of heart and maturity. Rio has the heart, lacks the ripeness. And I find it hard to criticize the movie as some moments, including the color-maniacal beginning, are magical. The bumpiness could be smoothened a bit just to add the ""Wow!"" factor so prevalent in Disney movies (e.g. Ratatouille's awe-inspiring ending). In terms of colors and animation, it's a spectacle. But, as a movie, it is a bit trite and incoherent. Sure summer extravaganza!"

","Rio is a good movie. I enjoyed the story, but my wife had a few problems with the movie. The writers and producers really should have talked to some parrot lovers before shooting the movie. My wife had issues with the way they represented parrots: 1. Parrots have 4 toes not 3 2. Never ever feed your parrot from your mouth; a parrot can die from the bacteria in a human's mouth 3. Serving hot cocoa to a bird; stupid!! Chocolate is poisonous to birds; it will kill them. 4. Cockatoos are not villains; they are comedians or love muffins, the toucan should have been the villain, toucans eat little birds in the wild not fruit loops! One can tell my wife wrote the middle of the review. She hopes that some naive owners will not try some of these issues with their parrots. It sent a bad message. The only good thing my wife liked was that they showed poachers in a bad light! In conclusion, a nice ending which was fun and entertaining. I give the movie 7 squawks out of 10."

They are joined by a wild and crazy cast (annoying), of comedic (loud) animals. I wasn't engaged by the plot, I didn't laugh at the jokes, and the only highlight was Jermaine Clement, who obviously got a chance to do some of his own stuff with his highlight song.

There is a joy to life and love here, that few films have. It is a happy musical journey with dancing and fun that everyone can experience. There is no deep sub plot here, just a wonderful time in Rio with some wonderful birds and people..What is unusual is this film made feel very happy. Happy enough to sit through the end titles still tapping my foot to the Latin beat. It is a joy, and I walked out with a big smile on my face."

","When I first heard of Rio my expectations were not high, never the less I wanted to watch it, mainly because of the Studio them self I loved Ice age so I though I would give Rio a chance.<br/><br/>How ever my mind was blown with in the first few moments of the movie actually starting, it was a stunning and vibrant welcoming in to the movie with a exhilarating song to go with it.<br/><br/>Now from the moment I fount out that Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) was the last of his kind and had to mate with Jewl (Anne Hathaway) I had figured out the story but that did not stop me from watching on, and thank god it didn't, though the story was predictable it was told in a magnificent way so much to make want to watch it again.<br/><br/>Moving on to the cast it self, it was not until I looked at the cast list did I see what great performers were playing in the movie, this was down to that I was so took in with the characters it totally slipped my mind to think who there voice actor was, and I was even more surprised when I saw that Jesse Eisenberg played Blue, he was great in the Social network so I was shocked I didn't pick up on him while watching the movie.<br/><br/>Before I conclude this review I would just like to say that the music in this movie was breath taking through out, and at no point did I feel the movie was out of place or was too in your face.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great movie, great for the entire family and if you are on the fence on if to watch this or not then let this be the final push to convince you to watch this as I promise you will not be let down."
"jamesantoniou","6","9","21","6 April 2011"," Harmless family fun, but for such a hyped about promising film from a top animation studio, is slightly disappointing.
","Rio Review: <br/><br/>Over the past few years, the standard for animated films has been set so high by films like How to Train You Dragon, Toy Story 3, Rango, Tangled and Despicable Me. <br/><br/>Sadly, Rio cannot meet the standards of any of the films mentioned above. This is because everything in Rio is so common in films, it is almost cliché; the geeky guy who tries to pull a girl, the interrupted kisses, awkward humour, the cheesy moral at the end. However, despite this, there are some moments where Rio genuinely looks incredible, and the colours and vibrancy puts a smile on your face. <br/><br/>The story is very similar to Rango at the beginning, but not for long:<br/><br/>Blu, a rare macaw, is accidentally transported from Rio to the USA, where he is found and kept by caring owner Linda. However, years later, a man called Tulio comes to tell Linda that Blu is very rare and the only remaining bird of its kind is back in Rio. So - with seemingly little thought - Blu goes back to Rio to mate with Jewel (the other macaw of its kind), and this is where all the unoriginal humour comes in when he is trying to pull Jewel. <br/><br/>However, in some parts, the film sparks back into life, with an extravaganza of colour, best viewed in 3D. Also, Rio's graphics are very good, and the 3D is possibly the best use of 3D I have ever seen. But Rio is let down by unoriginal humour, cliché villains, and a lazy plot. And, Rio isn't a very likable film - kids are not going to go on about it for weeks after watching it, and Rio merchandise will not be on the top of Birthday and Christmas lists, unlike most kids films. It is almost as if it is a shrine to Brazilian born Carlos Saldanha's - the director - hometown.<br/><br/>Summary: Harmless family fun, but for such a hyped about promising film from a top animation studio, is slightly disappointing."
"DICK STEEL","5","14","37","5 April 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Rio
","20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios hit all the right notes with their Ice Age trilogy, a series that I had unabashedly enjoyed, and for their follow up feature with director Carlos Saldanha, the icy cool pre-historic environment got traded for the land of contemporary Samba warmth. Still dealing with talking animals as characters, there was this sense of constant dread while watching Rio as it really tried too hard to entertain and to sustain that party atmosphere, and the filmmakers seem to have run out of tricks in their formula bag to keep one entertained.<br/><br/>Then it dawned upon me that I have grown up, lost that sense of wonderment a kid would have, and probably have been spoilt by Rango. Rango showed the heights that animated feature films can reach if they do not try to dumb it down for the kids, and is more adult orientated fare that didn't have to rely on cutesy characters created just to make kids want to buy their plush toy versions, or to allow for some of the easily impressionable female crowd to go gaga over. It had spirit and a tremendous story at its core, never really needing to rely on the cheap milking of emotions. Rio had gone overboard when you discover that their designs and crafting of cute characters equals baby, small, round, fat, and to speak funny. I see plush toys rolling off the assembly line already.<br/><br/>You would already know the story inside out if you had paid attention to the trailers for Rio. And having the screenplay written by Do Rhymer didn't exactly spell confidence, given his filmography thus far with the Big Momma series, and a number of sequels like Santa Clause 2 and Agent Cody Banks 2, which spell direct to video business. Perhaps the only bright spark that I had enjoyed from Rhymer was his Surf's Up, but alas Rio wasn't as innovative in narrative, following a set path of a pair of would-be love birds hating each other's guts, having to duke it out while chained to each other and finally emerge as winners to reclaim their freedom and walk, well, fly into the sunset together. Sounds like a typical opposites attract romantic tale to me.<br/><br/>Loaded with plenty of characters who talk too much, one cannot deny that it has star power at its side that will positively impact its appeal factor. There's the newly minted ""It"" stars like Jesse Eisenberg who plays Blu the blue macaw with the same whiny, nerdy demeanour Eisdenberg is known to play (someone spell stereotype already), while Anne Hathaway tackles Jewel the spirited female blue macaw in extremely bland fashion, probably the least interesting bird character amongst the lot. Chipping in are Leslie Mann as Blu's owner Linda, who goes into a parallel love story of her own as well with bird scientist Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro), Flight of the Conchords' Jermaine Clement as the villainous bully Nigel, and with others such as will.i.am, Jamie Foxx, Tracy Morgan and George Lopez, who is lending his voice to too many animal characters already for crying out loud.<br/><br/>Animation wise, Rio allowed Blue Sky Studios to dabble in richer and warmer colours across a wider spectrum, and this validates that the studio isn't a one-environment wonder with its bevy of colours filling up the entire screen from the get go, with realistic, vivid textures that compensates not having real animals up there. And the film plays like a musical with just about every Samba tune conceivable packaged into bubblegum pop, never letting go of any chance to chant ""RIO"" every now and then. Like how many complain about Bollywood movies padding their run time with its musical numbers, Rio is also guilty of the same, making it seem overly longer than its 96 minute runtime.<br/><br/>Maybe it's reflective of my current mood or age has caught up with me, or perhaps I now realize I prefer my stories with a lot more grit than fluff. I had expected more, but Rio stayed well within its comfort zone. Definitely targeted at the younger crowd, and the still young at heart who like their characters develop according to formula, and designed with bright colours to stay cute and cuddly (damn, there I said it)!"
"ic_kewl","2","9","22","23 April 2011"," Too over the top and not at all a bit funny.
","I went to see this with my friend tonight and was quite disappointed. To be honest I didn't expect much from this movie but when I saw the ratings on this board before going to see it, I had a change of heart. I went in thinking this movie might be worth the 7.4 given but as you can see I've only given it 2 stars.<br/><br/>The movie was cute but the script was over done. I think they were trying to make this movie funny but it came out very annoying.<br/><br/>The animation and the colours were great no doubt, but the story and the the scripting were very poor! <br/><br/>DON'T GO SEE IT UNLESS YOUR KIDS ARE BELOW 6 AND THEY REALLY WANTS TO GO because there are no other kids movies out at the moment; but even they might find it bad if they have good taste."
"littlemankazoo","8","3","5","24 April 2011"," A triumph of a film that even matches Toy Story 3 in perfection!
","Rio is simply a spectacular film that does everything right, and is likely the best animated film that we've seen since last year's incredible 'Toy Story 3', or even this year's 'Rango'.<br/><br/>The movie has the great starting quality of having an all-star cast assembled. We have Anne Hathaway, Tracey Morgan, George Lopez, Jesse Eisenburg (The Social Network) and others to keep us entertained. They all turn in fun, enjoyable performances. Definitely a nice job on casting.<br/><br/>The animation...This is made by the guys who made Ice Age. The one redeeming quality of the latest Ice Age movies is the AWESOME animation. This movie ups the anty even more. Many shots are full of rich colors, providing great visuals and it provides a nice background for the characters to explore and run through.<br/><br/>The plot...Eh. It's basically a ""last of species"" kind of movie. Basically, the main character Blu is the last male of his species, the Blue McCaw, and he has to...Reproduce with a female blue McCaw, who isn't fond of him at the start. While not a completely original plot, it is an entertaining one and it keeps you interested throughout.<br/><br/>The biggest part of the movie, however, is THE CHARACTERS. Never have I seen a movie that provides so many likable characters. From the very moment we see Blu, we're introduced to unique, fun, zany and extremely likable characters. By the end, it gives a sense that you care about the characters you're seeing, which is always a plus in any movie. However, the human characters are extremely undeveloped throughout, and feel stale and out-of-place with the main plot by the end of the film.<br/><br/>This film also has the decency to feature...Songs. While some can be quiet random and out-of-place, will.i.am and Jamie Foxx put on an AWESOME song performance halfway through the movie. It feels like a Black Eyed Peas song, yet has a great Samba touch to it. While I can't say I enjoy Samba too much, the songs in this movie are fun and get stuck in your head real good.<br/><br/>One more thing I need to add is the main villain in this movie...The main villain is a down-on-his-luck cockatoo who used to star in action movies, who has an almost devilish French accent and speech, and is almost like a James Bond villain...I don't know about you, but that is freaking' AWESOME...<br/><br/>Overall, Rio is definitely a fun movie. While a few problems plague it, Rio has few flaws in-between to prevent it from being a real fun experience."
"Eternality","7","3","5","11 April 2011"," Rio is good fun as a family movie, but to some, their feel-good experience may be muted by a largely forgettable story.
","From the director of the Ice Age (2002, 2006, 2009) films, Rio is an above average animated offering from 20th Century Fox Animation. Despite an A-list voice cast of Jessie Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Leslie Mann, and Jamie Foxx, the film is unable to hold its own against the likes of recent animated films such as How to Train Your Dragon (2010), The Illusionist (2010), and Rango (2011). Writer Don Rhymer, who co-wrote Surf's Up (2007), a surprisingly good animated film featuring penguins, pens an overly simplistic screenplay that lacks creativity. As a result, Rio's story is less than engaging.<br/><br/>Eisenberg voices Blu, a domesticated male macaw from a town in Minnesota who is taken care of by Linda (Mann). A request by a bird doctor to temporarily send Blu back to Rio de Janeiro, where he was originally from, to meet a female macaw named Jewel (Hathaway) so that they could produce offsprings that would continue their rare species, leads the characters head-on into an adventure that pits good against evil in a land known not only for its energetic samba music and dance, and its assortments of kaleidoscopic festival colors, but also for its violent organized crime (think City of God, 2002).<br/><br/>Because Rio is meant for a PG-rated audience, the bad guys depicted in the film are not brutal gangsters but stupid bird smugglers who ought to grow brains. The villains (both humans and bird, and to a certain extent, mischievous little monkeys) are pretty much paper-thin characters that you know would be left with eggs on their faces by the end of the film. Such is the predictability of Rio that it is a film that somewhat gets uninteresting as time passes, though that may not apply for kids, but for the adults who are forced to tag along.<br/><br/>Much of Rio's visuals play to the strength of the flamboyant Brazilian culture. Colors are abundant and vibrant while the spirit of joy can be easily felt. This is especially so in the climactic scene involving a parade of dance performances atop huge elaborately-dressed vehicles that move in a slow procession. Much of the humor comes from the neurotic jokes that Blu cracks up, but even then, it does not quite tickle your funny bone, and may even seem a trifle out of place in this film for kids. Rio is good fun as a family movie, but to some, their feel-good experience may be muted by a largely forgettable story.<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."
"brunograas","10","4","8","24 April 2011"," Great movie!
","RIO provides a beautiful tribute to the city showing a spectacular scenery to a fun, lovely story of two birds. Carlos Saldanha did an incredible job portraying faithfully the details of the city. He also manage to show a not so good side of Rio in such a appropriate way to an animation. But the spirit of Rio is perfectly represented, by this warm film with astonishing landscapes.The music is vibrant with a lot of samba and bossa nova that makes you want to dance during the session. The cast of characters's voice is perfect. Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway work great together. The characters are really funny, with good heart and and should please children as much as adults. The movie shows an improvement since Ice Age. So go see it!"
"Projonline","10","4","8","21 April 2011"," Rio - A Certain Ticket for Family Fun
","I wanted to go to a 3D cinema and the only movie on was RIO. I asked myself 'why not?'. I'm a Carioca who loves animation movies and was dying to see a movie in 3D. I must say, among all the words I could use to describe my first impression right when I put on the 3D glasses, regret was not one of them whatsoever! The music, the characters, the city really mesmerized me. Let alone the fact that the 3D effect is really breathtaking! The movie soundtrack is so captivating; I almost got on my feet and started to dance samba, even being well aware of my total inability to do so and running the risk of looking like a complete wacko. This movie is a certain ticket for family fun. In my very humble opinion RIO is one of the best animation movies ever made."
"prateak09","6","2","3","24 May 2011"," Great animation, but not good as the director's previous Ice Age movies...
","The movie in general is good, the plot and design of everything from the animals to the city is really good, but...I just felt that there was something missing. There's not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments like there was in the director's previous Ice Age movies which are one of my favorite animated movies of all time. This movie lacked the humour which should have been given the main focus. But nevertheless, the most astonishing side of the film is the luminous vision of Rio de Janeiro and its carnival.<br/><br/>Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a talking baby macaw, who is taken from his habitat in Brazil and smuggled in a box to the United States. Falling off the back of a truck, he is given a home by Linda (Leslie Mann). They grow up together in a domestic environment and by copying her he never learns how to fly properly. Years later and a scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) finds Linda working in a bookstore. He tells her that Blu is one the last of his kind and that he should be taken back to Brazil briefly so that he can mate with a female macaw. Linda reluctantly agrees. When placed in a cage Blu meets Jewel (Anne Hathaway), a feisty bird who is intent of escaping and is impatient to Blu's dithering. When the breeding facility is raided by smugglers, Blu and Jewel are caught and chained together in a cage. They have to learn to work together so that they can escape and find Blu's owner again.<br/><br/>Rio Rio"" is set in the exotic Brazil, amidst the world famous carnival. However, the film does not capture the same uplifting spirit. There is only enough excitement for young kids, but little for adults to enjoy. Sure, the visuals are very good, with great colours and smooth animation. The aerial scenes of Rio de Janeiro is breathtaking, but the visuals alone are not enough to make ""Rio"" a success. The movie is a colourful one, but unfortunately not in a metaphoric manner. It is watchable, one can give it that, but also forgettable.<br/><br/>Eisenberg and Hathaway are just perfect as the leads. So are all the all the supporting characters, especially my favorite Nico and Pedro voiced by Jamie Foxx and Will i Am, they were really funny. The soundtrack is one of the main plus-point of the movie. Some tunes are really catchy.<br/><br/>This is a simple animated film for children who are going to love the monkeys and the birds, but they are also going to be nicely demonstrated that birds are so much better off and nicer in their natural environment. All the animals are cute and are likable, so are the human protagonists. Its a fun movie, not just that great as it could be. I rate it 6.5 out 10 for the beautiful scenery and awesome animation."

The Carnaval scenes were so real, I felt I was part of the party. The music was beautiful and energetic. It demonstrated in several ways how rich and fun Brazilian music is. The story is simple, maybe even predictable, but the characters are well developed and again, extremely fun to watch. So if you want to have a wonderful time at the movies, especially with your kids and family, this movie is a ""must go""! A jewel not to be missed! The 3D version with digital sound is the clear best choice. <br/><br/>Have fun in Rio!"

"ndunsmo","7","2","3","19 April 2011"," Stunning animations and excellent music make this worthwhile.
","Well, after seeing Rio recently, I feel like sharing my thoughts towards it. Walking into this film, I actually didn't know that much about it other than the fact that it was about birds in Rio De Janeiro. I saw the positives reception it was getting and what really patented my interest in it was that my good friend Vivzmind posted a journal entry gushing about how awesome this movie is. Well, here's my review, and remember, this is my opinion, not what everyone else thinks.<br/><br/>The plot is unfortunately one of the film's drawbacks, and it seems a shame to open up with that, but hey, writing about the plot first just feels right. As far as the story is concerned, it's your typical talking animal adventure film: a bird named Blu gets separated from his owner and has to find her. The only thing that's not been done in every film of this kind is that they also throw a romance into it. Nothing else is really that special. The villains are pretty typical as are the supporting humans, but hey, they're entertaining to watch. Probably the one major highlight of the story, though, is how the romance is handled. At first, Blu and Jewel can't stand each other, but it slowly and believably develops as the movie goes on and unlike most romances of this nature, it's not in-your-face wink-wink nudge-nudge or super-mushy. It's handled very well. You know it's going to happen, sure, but it's handled in a way that at least makes the audience want it to happen.<br/><br/>As for the other side characters, they're actually quite fun themselves. Rafael, the Toucan, is probably the most interesting and likable character in the film while the other two bird sidekicks, Pedro and Nico are also enjoyable. Pedro is the kind of character I would normally find irritating, but he didn't get on my nerves all that much even if just about everything he did seemed like a desperate attempt at being cool. And of course, the villainous bird, Nigel, is a good solid addition to the film and is much more interesting than his human owners, the other main villains I spoke of earlier. It's a good thing this movie focuses more on the birds than the humans, isn't it? There's also a bulldog named Luiz who I found really funny most of the time.<br/><br/>Speaking of funny, the humour I find to be a mixed bag. See, not only is the story average, most of the dialogue's kind of half-and-half as well. I didn't find myself getting much of a kick out of the verbal gags but I found the visual gags hilarious. It's just that half of the dialogue- related jokes seem tacked on and forced. There are also a few bad puns, too, one such example being a bit where Luiz is enjoying himself and says ""This is the spit!"" because he's always drooling.<br/><br/>The animations are a whole other thing and are one of the film's strongest points. They are just so much fun to watch. The plumage on the birds themselves is very impressive and everything is just so active and energetic that I can't help but get a kick out of watching it. Where the animations really shine is during certain moments that I'm just about to get into starting... now.<br/><br/>This movie's a musical... bet none of you saw that coming, did you? I may have known Tangled was going to be one despite the trailers saying otherwise, but despite this taking place in Rio, I was not expecting musical numbers. And what's more... they are incredible! The songs are so catchy and the numbers themselves are so well animated. Heck, you can find the opening number online simply titled ""Rio-First 2 Minutes"". That scene in itself is spectacular and the others are no exception. There are also a couple that really surprised me with how good they are. First is a song titled ""Hot Wings"". Normally, I would hate this kind of song. It uses so many audio effects and lyrics that seem like they're trying way too hard to be cool for the kiddies, but this song is really well-written and composed and I just love it. Another is a love ballad sung by Nico called ""Fly Love"". When I heard Jamie Foxx about to sing a love ballad, I wasn't sure what to think, but this song is absolutely beautiful, which is why it's a shame the dialogue kind of drowns it out. The only musical number that did not impress me too much was ""Pretty Bird"", the villain song naturally sung by Nigel. Not that it was a bad song or had poor choreography. No, I actually really liked those aspects. However, this scene bothered me for one simple reason: it goes almost completely against Nigel's character. Here we have an elegant, graceful villain and what does he get? A cheesy rap song. I wish I was making that up. For a cheesy rap song, yeah, it's catchy, but it's also out-of-character. Even the lyrics sound nothing like what Nigel would say. It's like the writers were desperate to make him seem ""hip, cool and on the fly"". Nonetheless, the music and animations are fantastic.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the generic story and writing, Rio would be up there with films like Rango, which used their clichés as best as they could to make them feel fresh, or maybe even something Pixar could pump out, but those small drawbacks prevent it from being a masterpiece. That said, though, Rio is still a very enjoyable film and if you're looking for something entertaining and love animation, check it out.<br/><br/>Subject: Rio Score: 7/10 Would I get it on DVD?: For the fantastic music and animations, this one's a definite maybe."

My opinion overall is very positive.

But then he's thrown into an open, exotic and different lifestyle which is where Jewel comes in as this feisty bird wanting to be free. The songs were OK, no Disney songs, but they were catchy and not bad for a non-Disney production. Nico and Pedro (Jamie Foxx, Will.I.Am) were upbeat and fun characters as well as the leading couple with the voices of Anne Hathaway and Jessie Eisenberg who were great together. The little baby blue macaws were cute with their huge heads and tiny bodies. OK, so it may be no PIXAR animation but it has enough fun, cool songs and cool characters to keep you watching."
"iReviewFilms","7","2","3","16 April 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Rio
","Rio is an animation from the same people that brought us Ice Age and so it has a fair amount to live up to. It follows the tale of a blue macaw, Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) who is bird-napped as a chick and smuggled into the USA to be sold. During the move though, he falls from the back of the truck and is found by Linda (Leslie Mann) who takes him in and looks after him.<br/><br/>The years pass by until Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro), a extremely bird obsessed ornithologist pays them a visit and offers them a chance to come to Brazil as Blu is the last male of his species and the last female, Jewel (Anne Hathaway), resides in Rio. Blu (who cannot fly) has lived a sheltered, comfortable life with Linda and is all the more happy for it whereas Jewel is the stark contrast and longs to be free from the cage that restricts her as she has tasted freedom before. So when the two meet, the fun starts to happen.<br/><br/>First off, Blue is one happy bird with the animation and his characteristics reflecting that. You immediately like him and this feeling doesn't fade with time. In fact each character has their unique quirks which enables the comedy to flow seamlessly. I was never gulping for air but the jokes are well written and non-stop with the movie certainly having its moments.<br/><br/>Rio, the movie, brings alive the carnival nature and flamboyant mood that one normally associates with Rio, the city, by including a couple of musical numbers into the story. Unfortunately they are not up to the standard of Disney- they are not very catchy or memorable. It's more pop music and rap with Will.I.Am lending his talents to the vocals than the traditional song associated with animations. The background music however certainly get across the energy and vibrancy of Rio with plenty of samba flooding your ears from the off.<br/><br/>The visuals of Rio are impressive (though not quite as good as Rango) and during the flying scenes in particular the city and its surroundings are well captured with many of the iconic landmarks easy to spot. It probably helped that the director Carlos Saldanha was born and raised in the city and so was able capture the true feeling of the place that other directors would not have been able to.<br/><br/>Did this live up to Ice Age then? Very nearly and I wouldn't mind watching it again to see how it handles a second viewing.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

Some parts are a little meh but they are so few and far between- Rio managed to become a movie that I surprisingly fell in love with.<br/><br/>My favorite characters are that small bird and that fat red bird- which names escape me now. Oh and the guy who looks JUST like the DAD from Coraline- really he DID Lmao and acted like a younger version of him. Then that very minor character of the night guard, cause he was SUCH a Bear lol.<br/><br/>The songs really pull this movie together truly and not only that but the mixture of kid and adult humor (though one scene was SO weird and awkward towards the end). My favorite songs are the main title song and the one where Anne Hathaway goes Yayayayayayayayaya yaaaaa. Everyone in the thearte almost danced- but the little kids couldn't help it and did.<br/><br/>Another small negative is the running time- or maybe just the pacing. But I didn't notice it too much.

","The most recent CGI comedy opened up today and one word to definitely use to describe this movie is colorful. From scene one, this movie is filled to the brim with a wide variety of bright colors that bring energy, excitement, and positive feeling to the movie. After we get a little bit of intro into the lives of Blu and Linda, we meet Tulio who takes us to the wonderful world of Rio de Janeiro. Here is where we get a CGI look of this country and some of the culture that it contributes to the world. Not long after arriving we meet about seven major characters in about ten minutes. From there the movie takes off. <br/><br/>To start with the positives of this movie let's start with the characters. The voice cast for this movie was well selected with Eisenberg making the perfect choice for a smart, well read bird that is socially awkward, after all he nailed that role in the Social Network. Anne Hathaway plays the snappy, headstrong bird Jewel who provides a lot of attitude that many girls will love. George Lopez's soothing voice and his comedy talents made him the perfect role of the toucan that was funny, but also a wise mentor to Blu. The sidekick bird duo, voiced by Will.I.am and Foxx were a welcomed comedy duo that provided those one lines constantly seen in kids movies and many will appreciate that funny nature. <br/><br/>I guess you could say the second strength would be the character variety. As I already mentioned the diversity of the two blue macaw's makes for an interesting combo that sort of portrays a kid odd couple mix. The two sidekick birds make you laugh with quips, which can also be seen in the two henchmen of the main villain, who remind me of a Latino Horace and jasper. Regardless there is also a malicious cockatoo that is reminiscent of Scar from the Lion King. His devilish nature really helps bring back the idea that even the most cuddliest of creatures can be truly evil on the inside, which they have captured well in this movie. Finally we meet the mysterious Louis who is mentioned throughout most of the movie, and turns out to be a dog that reminds you of Sid the Sloth from Ice Age.<br/><br/>They have also captured the beautiful scenery of Rio in their CGI work, which allows one to feel like you are in a cartoon version of the city. The divine statues, white buildings, fiestas, beaches, tropical jungles, and slums are all portrayed beautifully, which made a lot of the surrounding audience want to go there. <br/><br/>Perhaps one of the strongest aspects of this movie though, is the musical numbers integrated into this movie. Each song fits well with the characters that are singing it and again captures the mood like we have seen in many Disney movies. My favorite was the toe tapping song that the birds party to, sung by Foxx and Will.I.Am. Surely there is a song that everyone can get hooked to in this movie, you just have to look for it. <br/><br/>So I have mentioned a lot of good things about this movie, but what about bad. Well this movie is definitely not slow, but the comedy is not the is not the same as it was in the first Ice Age. One big thing I loved about the Ice Age comedies was Sid's dumb nature and unique ways of saying things that made you laugh hysterically. However, in this movie I didn't feel that same kind of comedy and felt it was a little more juvenile in nature. Despite the constant amount of one liners and situational comedies, I was not laughing as hard as I did in Ice Age, which may or may not be an issue for you. Perhaps the only other weakness I could find was that it was pretty predictable and simple in design with no real surprises, twists, or ideas thrown into the mix. Again I don't know if this is really an issue, but it's worth mentioning that it is no new CGI comedy. <br/><br/>My rating of this movie would probably be somewhere between an 8-8.5. I would recommend this movie to those that want a fun, colorful movie for their kids that like singing and dancing. People who like colorful and fun, happy comedies will also like this movie, but again i don't think it is a modern ice age comedy. Finally those who like cute movie, like UP, will like this movie and will not be as sad by the end of this movie. Until next time my friends, keep enjoying the movies."
"rockinradha","7","2","3","15 April 2011"," Rio is no Ice Age; Yet decently entertaining
","What is the one thing that binds all children's movies? predictable plots but of course there are those that make predictable fresh (SHREK. Rio however shies from any experiment in the plot whatsoever. The end of the movie can be deciphered in the first 5 minutes. <br/><br/>That said the movie is overall very enjoyable if you go with it. There are too many moments where u just want to laugh out loud. A word of caution thought; Rio is no ice age. Its written OK; its the action that makes it enjoyable<br/><br/>The animation is superb (nothing less expected). The city of Rio de Janeiro is multi facetly captured (there is a lot more to it than the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer)and the use of color throughout the movie is beautiful. <br/><br/>About the cast and the characters, despite all of them giving a good performance there is not one character who is memorable. One may relate to the protagonist Blu but thats as far as it goes in making an impression. The two human ones are outrightly boring. Voice over is not that big a deal unless u really put yourself into the animated character (Take note Anne Hathway)<br/><br/>The music is pleasant but none of the tracks are going to find their way into my playlist<br/><br/>Overall the movie is worth a watch. Its funny, not so smart and has a great lesson."
"acedj","6","1","1","21 April 2020"," Good movie, but full of issues
","I really enjoyed this film. It is the story of a Sphinx Blue Macaw that is the last known male, aptly named Blu. He and his owner are flown to Rio to see if Blu might mate with a female in an effort to ""save the species"". There are of course the obligatory bad guys that steal the pair of birds with a mind to sell them for a profit. We end up with a family friendly tale of love and devotion and how great people can be. There are a lot of vivid colors and great songs to keep the attention of kids, and enough over the head jokes to keep the adults amused.<br/><br/>Now for the issues. This movie touches on but does not address the terrible thing that happens at the opening of the movie, how parrots are stolen from the wild and the sold as pets. Contrary to popular belief, parrots are not domesticated and should not be kept as pets. These are animals that are still wild at heart and they are also highly intelligent, so this act is akin to an advanced alien race kidnapping your children and keeping them as pets. Sure, the kids might eventually bond with their captor, but it is far from the ideal situation for them. Also they show Blu drinking hot chocolate and eating what looks like chocolate chip cookies, both poisonous to parrots. This is a gross misrepresentation of how to care for a parrot, and one day one of the people that saw this and thought how great a pet a parrot might make will kill their bird through ignorance. I do not mean to climb up on a soapbox here in the review section, but if you are going to put out a movie that so terribly represents how to care for a pet like this, then the issue needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>In closing, this is a great family movie that anyone who does not have a parrot in their care would love and even those that do will enjoy it to a certain point."

","'Rio' is not an animated movie I would personally seek out to watch, but opportunity fatefully presented itself. Minnesota has since 'Fargo' (1996) been an interesting location to begin a movie, but here it has close to no added value. And pretty soon it's off to Rio de Janeiro anyway.<br/><br/>'Rio' is a children's movie, of course. It's colorful, has loads of action based animations, is full of generic characters and has a fairly predictable chain of events (emotional journeys included) and my two nephews were mostly glued to the big screen, though the younger one found 93 minutes a little too much and turned to his toys at times.

","After reviewing and rewatching most of Blue Sky Studios films recently, I would say this is the best and most awesome production from Blue Sky Studios! This is also the film that made me began to pay attention to animation studios and appreciate them, and now, despite all my busy schedules and life pursuits, I am blogging about animated features and animation studios!<br/><br/>Rio (2011) is beautiful, meaningful and everything nice. The storyline, music and graphics are very impressive. Not only those, the film is also witty, hilarious and fun; for instance Blu (a domesticated and modernised bird), is as modernised as we humans do, to the extend that he can't live in the wild anymore so it is funny to watch his antics and adventures in Rio. The visuals is also quite realistic and the animation is certainly stunning, human or animals, each are beautifully designed and everyone can dance! In addition to its marvelous character designs, the voice actors and actresses did a very good job as well which makes all the characters so likable, from the villains to the main and supporting characters!<br/><br/>When I watch this film in theatres when it was first released, the moment the film ends, there were a mix of happiness and sadness. I remembered this fact because I wrote about this film before. I was ""Happy because everyone especially Blu and Jewel have a happy ending; Sad because in real life, Spix's macaws are critically endangered or even possibly extinct in the wild!!!"".<br/><br/>I also mentioned that this was my favorite 3D film my whole life in 2011 and guess what? This still remains as a truth after 3 years! This is still my favorite 3D animated feature even though I've watched (and rewatched) plenty of animations these recent years!<br/><br/>That's how charming Rio (2011) is so you must watch if you haven't! ><"

The thought of Blu being the last of his kind goes right out the window, when they discover there is another Macaw living in Rio de Janeiro. Upon arrival in the large and exotic Rio, Blu meets a female Macaw named Jewel(Anne Hathaway); the two are kidnapped by animal smugglers. Coming to the rescue is a group of smooth-talking, street smart city birds. After Blu is able to escape, he now relies on his new friends to help him learn to fly. Thus Blu is now a bird on the move and is able to stay ahead of the kidnappers still in pursuit.<br/><br/>Outstanding animation and color; lively music and comedy for the entire family.

","Although the animation of this film is most excellent, one has to wonder about the timing. The biggest issue with having the Olympic games in Rio is the crime and corruption. It makes it seem as the major source of crime is bird smuggling, except for the pickpocket monkeys. They show Rio with clean streets and friendly people. The only people in Rio that are friendly are the grifters (the con artists). One also needs to remember that Rio is in Brazil. That's where the corrupt government has allowed so much of the rain forest to be decimated. Then there's the fact that Brazil is the country that helped hide all the Nazi's after WW2. Now you wonder how a film like this comes along and makes Rio look like heaven. MONEY!!!"

","I love animated movies. But when I went to see this, I was really disappointed. It wasn't a well put together movie. The voice acting was just OK, and the story left much to be desired. I found myself asking the question, ""Why does this movie exist?"" It's your cookie cutter, every day ordinary poorly done movie. The art was good yes. But the story was greatly lacking. The characters were shallow and it just felt like an opportunity to use big name actors for a quick money grab. Not a good movie. It's the kind of movie that you would expect to be playing on a small TV on low volume in the back of a doctor's office waiting room. I'm surprised they are going to make a second one."
"jotix100","8","1","1","15 March 2012"," Tropical birds
","Has anyone ever thought animated movies were easy to make? Well, stay until the end because the six or seven minutes of credits of ""Rio"" is an eye opener. There are hundreds of people involved in a project of this magnitude in all kinds of specialties. What appears to be a simple film, one has no idea in what goes on to get the finished product to look this good as one sits in a theater, or at home watching magic happening in front of one's eyes.<br/><br/>The magic of ""Rio"", a film conceived and directed by Carlos Saldanha, is a labor of love. Mr. Saldanha and his collaborators created a simple story about a rare bird that is in danger of extinction. The story and screenplay was written by the director and six others writers who take us from a frozen winter time Minnesota to the Brazilian city of Rio, as carnival is about to start.<br/><br/>The film makes a point about the way the colorful tropical birds are stolen from their natural habitats and smuggled to other countries where most of them are sold as pets. Being kept in cages is not exactly what nature intended for these gorgeous creatures, but that is the fate for most of them, unfortunately. <br/><br/>""Rio"" is, after all, a picture targeted for younger audiences. As such, the creators had nothing but sheer entertainment and not social criticism in mind when they set out with this production. The film is light hearted and a joy to watch. The well known actors that lend their voices to the birds are perfectly matched. The colors are outrageously beautiful. The best thing for anyone is to sit back, relax and enjoy this marvelous trip to that enchanting place called Rio."

","This Movie was an A-grade cartoon animated movie. The movie Rio had the best animated features with ""Up and How to train your dragon,"" the textures and the recreated physics of the movie itself. The plot was a little out of balanced where it is true and the real trivia's where Macaw's can't drink chocolate since it is toxic to them. Though the movie had exceptions and in some of the scenes, you can feel the anticipation all these voice actors and the details that help made the film put into this. This movie is also more recommended for people under the age of 10. Anyone over 16 will probably not like it unless you like these kind of movies. ----- ------- ----- ---- ------- --------<br/><br/>PS: Make a number #2 cause #1 was ""Triumphant."" 10/10"

","This is a movie enjoyable for the whole family to watch over and over. A timeless piece of beauty, humor and romance is how I can best describe it. It kinda puts you on the edge of your seat, as you seem to be going through a roller coaster ride. I first thought it might be another animated movie that is dull as some I've seen that were less interesting & entertaining to sit through. Like for example The Incredibles (2004) which whisked you through all sorts of special effects that you didn't have the time to appreciate anything about the characters. Even what I saw with KungFu Panda (2008) wasn't even close to being this good. I look to definitely purchase this one!"

","Or not. But what does matter is that the movie is fun. And it's not only fun for a younger audience, but also for adults to watch. Some (especially in Great Britain) were fed up with the movie even before they watched it, because the two stars of the movie were starring in an ad for a cell phone company (Orange). Of course that kind of treatment would be unfair to the movie.<br/><br/>If you are not biased and can handle a bit of romance and the overcoming odds story, then you will enjoy this. As Jesse Eisenberg is spot on as a ""bird out of the air"" so to speak. Even people who don't enjoy George Lopez as a comedian, might like him here. I thought his performance was spot on. Not a perfect movie overall, but the cast (as mentioned) and the mostly very well written jokes, work their magic!"

","Combine the vivid colors of ""Finding Nemo"" with some of the plot devices of ""Up"" (most especially telling the backstory through a series of old photos and press clippings) and what do you get? Unfortunately, the combination results in a film not as memorable as either of those Pixar semi-classics. ""Rio"" like ""Avatar"" focuses on blue hued creatures hassled by evil humans (when did we get so self-hating?). Both films are also gorgeous to look at but revolve around only moderately interesting stories and a general lack of witty dialog. For example, despite the main character being a blue-colored macaw called ""Blu"", the film never goes for the obvious joke of another character mistakenly confusing him with a bluebird. The soundtrack also misses the chance to use the old Duran Duran song ""Rio"" or the old Judy Garland number ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" (blue birds fly). Instead the repetitive sounds of samba dominate the soundtrack and most audience members likely agree with Blu who expresses his distaste for Samba. In short, ""Rio"" looks gorgeous but lacks substance - rent any Pixar film instead."

I wonder what this movie would be like in 3D. The story was classic cute. Some may say too typical of a story that is over done but I guess I just enjoy these classics. Perhaps an avian version of 101 Dalmations. Of course the villain was worth hating and not as ""fancy"" or pretty as the hero/heroine. Anne Hathaway was so good that I could even picture her in the sound studio having a good time. I agree that Eisenberg will forever be known as Blu (whether his publicist markets that as good or bad is up to them). Jamie Foxx singing is the new Barry White. His voice for romantic tunes is melted butter. I didn't think I would enjoy this movie as much as I did. This is one of those movies that I will watch over and over again."

It's one of the most excellent animated features I have ever seen this year that contains everything thing I want to see. With a rocking soundtrack filled with incredible music that's just enjoying to listen or sing along to, and we receive the incredible sights and sounds of Rio de Janeiro that it makes us feel like we are part of the celebration.

","I want to go to Rio de Janeiro! Rio is an exuberant CGI animated 3D film with wonderfully vibrant colors that literally jump off the screen. This is a classic fish out of water story filled with romance, life lessons and a fairly predictable ending. Nevertheless, Rio is a truly enjoyable film and nearly impossible to watch without dancing in your seat. Director Carlos Saldanha incorporates a tremendous amount of the Brazilian culture into the film and realistic landscape; it is very easy to forget this is an animation. In particular, the flight scenes offer spectacular bird's eye views of the exotic Rio de Janeiro setting. Breathtaking scenery filled with rich, warm colors is incredibly detailed and mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Although the themes are familiar, the characters are engaging and lovable. Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is a domesticated macaw from a small-town who embarks on an adventure in Rio de Janeiro with native, Jewel (Anne Hathaway) to save endangered animals. Credit goes to the writers for providing a sharp, witty dialog and the voice actors for bringing the animated characters to life. In addition to the incredible computer generated visuals, the music adds authentic Brazilian flavor and zest. I love the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout and provide infectious energy. Rio is not billed as a musical but it definitely has that feel and the music is what makes this fast-paced adventure so enjoyable. The Carnival festival explodes on the screen with vigor and verve providing a dazzling display of movement and color set perfectly to music.<br/><br/>Rio does not have the depth of some other animated stories; however, it is pure fun from beginning to end. This movie is a visually stunning escape from everyday life and serves as an animated brochure for a place I hope to visit one day.<br/><br/>Rio. Dir. Carlos Saldanha. Perf.

The colourful nature of Rio was great, bright tropical colours that you would actually see in the jungles. 'Rio' had good characters and good decisions who to choose for the cast. The way they change was fairly well done. It also made you feel the proper emotion towards the characters, like anger or happiness. There was no scenes that weren't needed in the movie, they all seemed to be in the right spot. A short as the movie was, it still never felt as long as it was.

When little bird Blu is bird-napped from his lush tropical home in Brazil he is shipped to the frigid north where the crate he is packed in falls off the truck and he is lost. Little girl Linda finds and nurtures the traumatized Blu and years later we find the pair have become inseparable friends. Blu has adjusted and loves his home. Linda learns that Blu must return to his native land to mate in order to save his species. Of course things do not go according to plan and adventures begin.<br/><br/>The movie is colorful and action packed. I instantly fell in love with Linda and Blu who are both down to earth and easy to identify with. Some of the graphics were amazing, as I wanted to jump on a plane to visit the incredibly beautiful animated Rio De Janeiro and join in the ""Carnival"". It also helped us to remember there is a seedy side to Rio and to make sure that you watch out for thieves and pick pockets and other nasty sorts. The bad guy in the flick looked just like the male version of Cruella De Vil trying to steal exotic birds for gain with his two bumbling sidekicks. Another thing we noticed which seems to be a trend in recent movies is the males are portrayed as incompetent and weak while the females are smart, sure, and sassy.<br/><br/>This is a good movie for kids but I would still recommend that you watch this or any movie before letting your young children watch it. Everyone one has his or her own idea of what is acceptable content and what is not."

According to the LA Times, one reason is film industry talent are migrating like a flock of birds to animation. Like Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg did for Rio. <br/><br/>And ""most live-action films need to choose between adults and kids. But come up with an animated movie with, say, some exotic beauty and clever wordplay and you instantly double your demographic."""
"leo-gothberg","9","1","1","23 April 2011"," A must see... Even if the story is on the predictable side.
","The characters are flat and the story is predictable. That said, this is up there as one of the best family-oriented movies I've seen since Disney's ""The Lion King"".<br/><br/>The whole movie is laughs from start to finish, and details preserved in the animation and portrayal of Rio are incredible. I won't put many specifics in here for fear of spoiling the movie, but if you're looking for a fun time take the family and enjoy. Also, try looking past the Blu (the main character) and pay close attention to the expressions on Jewel for some extra funny looks of utter disbelief as the adventure unfolds.<br/><br/>Also, keep your mind open as there are things like the portrayal of animal smuggling (mostly specific to exotic, tropical localities) and poverty-related petty crime (common just about everywhere) that is seen in the supporting characters and background parts of the movie. It makes for a good opening to talk to the younger ones that might be in the family about social issues."
"ultrarobbie-1","7","1","1","19 April 2011"," Nice film!
","I was expecting this film (it being a universal rating) to be full of kids jokes and not be that entertaining, but I was wrong. It fortunately isn't chock full of fart jokes and people falling down (a common cliché in kids films) and it was actually pretty funny! <br/><br/>Our story's main characters are Blue, a slightly neurotic but kind parrot companion of Linda whom she found in a box on the street; Jewel, a pushy but kind hearted parrot; Linda, Blu's friendly human companion; and Tulio, a quirky and a bit odd, but still nice, person that Linda meets at the beginning of our story. Our enemies: An evil parrot that works with a trio of bad guys who want to sell both Blu and Jewel for a lot of money, called Nigel, a horrible bird that was once a famous bird. Our two, blue parrots are rare birds, and their species are going extinct, so Tulio asks Linda, to come with him to Rio de Janeiro to breed Blu with another bird named Jewel. Unfortunately the evil trio want to sell both the birds for a lot of money, and must get the birds to the airport in time to sell them. What will happen on this adventurous tale? Go and see it to find out ;)<br/><br/>The CGI was excellent. The views we get of Rio de Janeiro are very nicely done, and the city looked profoundly realistic, including the textures and characters. The animation was brilliant as well. It was also very colourful, but not exaggerated in colour. Just enough to look picturesque and cheerful.<br/><br/>The humour, of course, involved some clichéd jokes such as falling down, hitting a wall etc., but these were fortunately used sparingly, and the film didn't use them as it's only humour, thank goodness. -SPOILER- One part was particularly funny where Blu and Jewel (or was it a ball? I can't remember) bounced off of a woman on the beaches' behind. <br/><br/>-SPOILER continued- The only thing, to me, that I found negative would be the parts where the birds would rap and sing. Fortunately, again, this is only done twice, maybe once more than that. Of course this would be expected in a kids movie, but what are you going to do. -Spoiler finished-<br/><br/>To conclude, this was a nice movie. The characters were nice, the world was colourful and inviting, and the plot wasn't bad, but has been used before. Apart from that one negative point, the movie is very good, and I would recommend watching it. Kids are sure to love ""Rio""!"
"intelearts","5","4","9","6 May 2011"," My 410th Review: Great theme, but maybe not for the smallest kids?
","Rio is brash, colorful, bold, and bouncy full of energy and drive and great characterization. It is a terrific theme: animal trafficking and embraces a very strong Eco message that is just wonderful.<br/><br/>However, and it is a really big however, our kids did not enjoy it, for them the character of the baddie bird Nigel, is, without spoilers, just too much; they were just frightened and even though they like a little, this was too scary for them. At six, you'd think it'd be OK, but they just found it too much and it really ruined it for them.<br/><br/>I guess this will work best with the tweenies - it's a shame the music and the humor are all good - and the fact that this is a real green movie is terrific; but I'll not be buying the DVD of this one."
"blacklist-1","9","4","9","13 April 2011"," A wonderful and infectious animation that can lift anyone's spirits!
","I have been looking forward to Rio ever since seeing the funny orange advert of it. My expectation for this animation were exceedingly high and I am pleased to say it more than delivered. The basic synopsis basically consists of a blue macaw called Blue (Jesse Eisenberg) who is domesticated is looked after by kind book shop owner Linda (Leslie Mann). One day their happy lives are altered by the arrival of a Brazil ornithologist who tells them that Blue is the last male macaw of his kind and is in danger of being extinct. He proposes that Blue come to Rio De Janiero to mate with beautiful female macaw called Jewel (Anne Hathaway). Linda is persuaded and her and Blue go, but when there Jewel takes a disliking to Blue (he can't fly) and soon he and her are captured by poachers who want to sell them for money. Eventually they escape to the jungle to try and get free from each other (as they are chained to one another) as Jewel wants to fly free on her own and Blue wants to get back to Linda. Meanwhile her and the ornithologist try and track them down with the help of young boy Fernando (Jake T Austin).<br/><br/>On Blue and Jewels journey they come up against evil cuckatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) and other colourful bird characters who help them like Nico (Jamie Fox), Pedro (voiced by Black Eyed Peas member, Will i Am), Rafael (George Lopez) and bulldog Luiz (Tracy Morgan). As they journey Blue and Jewel predictably warm to each other as the film reaches it's climax.<br/><br/>Some of the small gripes I really had with Rio, which stopped me giving this a ten is the fact you don't really emotionally connect to the characters as the film dosen't really have heart or any deep meaningful message like the Toy Story films or Up. However I certainly felt a fondness for the characters and yes the story narrative is predictable (as people have pointed out) of Blue and Jewel being together and triumphing over Nigel and the poachers. But most animations are anyway like Toy Story and Up, they all have happy endings, so I don't think that should really be a criticism for Rio.<br/><br/>But I loved everything else, the 3D (which was excellent) was used to magnificent effect and made the visual animation (at top quality I might add) an even more exhilarating experience with the different plants and birds, it was very colourful and vibrant with some breathtaking scenery of Rio itself. The voice-over acting was top-notch. Eisenberg superbly voices Blue, which kept me entertained, with some funny moments and even Anne Hathaway is great (after her disastrous performances in films of recent) at voicing Jewel as being a fierce and independent bird but eventually warming up to Blue. Leslie Mann lends to Linda an endearing quality, Jermaine Clement is terrific voicing Nigel and is very funny whenever he is on screen, whilst the other voice-over actors Tracy Morgan as dog Luiz and Will i Am, Jamie Fox and George Lopez provide great comic support and make the most of the time their characters have.<br/><br/>What I also like was the script, which was refreshingly witty with in particular Blue and Nigel getting some great one liners. This made the film hilarious in parts as it was generally funny all the way through. The songs as well were well sung and had an infectious joy to them, but the whole film had that and as a result even though there is no emotional depth or substance in terms of any messages for kids. (like Toy Story 3) It is still great fun and the bottom line is kids will absolutely love this, whilst adults will find plenty to enjoy. It's suitable for the whole family. It certainly beats Rango the other animation I saw a couple of weeks ago (it wasn't as funny and was not suitable for kids as it was too intelligent) with western references they wouldn't and even I could not comprehend as I don't watch a lot of them.<br/><br/>In the end Rio is a animation that I loved and can appeal to everyone. If anyone out there for whatever reason is in a sad or angry mood, seeing this for an hour and a half should certainly lift your spirits. Rio is the most wonderful animation to come out since Toy Story 3 last year. Long may the film's infectious joy and spirit last."

","Rio was an awesome film. It was hilarious, beautifully animated, epic, colorful, and just plain awesome! I could seriously keep going on. I loved every voice and thought that Eisenberg was perfect as Blu. it's definitely ""best animated feature"" material, and it totally deserves to at least get nominated when the time comes. The story, though a bit straight forward, was heartwarming, a tale of friendship and adventure. Elements of Rio also reminded me of Happy Feet. So if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it, you'll walk away, laughing, and wishing the experience had never ended. I loved all the carnival scenes as well as all the musical numbers and dancing."
"KineticSeoul","4","6","16","2 May 2011"," Maybe the kids might like it, but overall a very generic and formulaic CGI animated movie that relies too much on wacky characters
","This is a pretty bad family flick, however the kids might enjoy it although I seen a lot of them get bored in theater and started to wander off. The characters are over wacky all the time in order to get the audience attention, but I lost interest very quickly. It's like watching something dull, trying to be exciting and entertaining. Even if a whole bunch of characters are constantly wacky and bouncing around all over the place. Now I enjoy watching CGI animated movies, but this one just wasn't engaging at all. In fact I found myself checking my phone a couple of times. The jokes were also very forced and didn't get any laugh or chuckle from anyone, including the kid audiences. Everything about this CGI animated flick seemed overdone in a negative way and so very generic to the point it becomes so very predictable. None of the characters in this was even all that likable or made me actually care for any of them. Plus the direction of it all is so very formulaic.<br/><br/>4/10"

Even the children who sat in front of me the theater did not enjoy at all.

"clifton-23","9","3","7","25 April 2011"," Rio; A Children's advocate and naturalist's perspective
","My wife and I saw the animated movie, Rio, Friday night. We went to the 2-D version. As entertainment, we really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.<br/><br/>With our interest in children, nature, birds, specifically macaws, the movie did pretty good, with two sloppy biological errors. Rio is of course animated entertainment, not a National Geographic documentary, but Rio did touch upon two side stories; Black market parrot trade, and the blight so many children of Rio live in.<br/><br/>You've probably heard that ""Rio"" is about a pet Macaw from Minnesota that ends up in Rio de Janeiro. There, to be bred with ""the last if their species"".<br/><br/>Naturalist's perspective: Maybe we missed it, but we never heard the species of this macaw mentioned, despite the main human character being a researcher.<br/><br/>There are 23 species of macaw parrots (7 extinct), all found in South America and Central America. There are four species of macaws that are commonly referred to as the Great Blues. One has been extinct since 1960. The largest blue macaw, the Blue Hyacinth, is classified as vulnerable, but can still be found in the wild.<br/><br/>One assumes the movie is referring to the Spix macaw. Named after the German naturalist, Johann Baptist von Spix, this macaw truly is critically endangered. The leading book about it, ""Spix's Macaw"" by Tony Juniper, tells the interesting, tragic story. (Wikipedia: ""List of macaws"") While parrots are not as a group, tropical birds, just as the rainforest is the most diverse ecosystem, more parrots species are found in the rainforest then elsewhere. All macaw parrots are rainforest parrots.<br/><br/>As more/most pet macaws are hatched in pet industry breeding programs, reducing the impact on wild flocks, the Spix macaw is not surviving well. Because macaws are the largest parrots on the whole, as a group, they are all challenged because it's hard for these large birds to find large nesting cavities as deforestation continues.<br/><br/>The Spix macaw was always located only in a very small area of South America. Then as Europeans came to the New World and started grabbing macaws from the wild for display and as pets, the Spix macaw started disappearing in the wild. Poaching continues. Since 2000, the Spix is considered extinct in the wild.<br/><br/>Almost none of this came through the entertaining and colorful movie other than the main characters, Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway), are the last of their kind, and the researchers want to breed these two. To make an entertaining storyline conflict, while Blu quickly gets enamored when he meets Jewel, Jewel has other priorities; to escape back to the wild.<br/><br/>Child advocate view: Which brings in the second side story; (spoiler) a street child, Fernando (Jake T. Austin), who has no family, is the one who steals the two blue macaws from the research breeding program. Of course he's stealing them because such activity is his only source of income for this hopeless boy who lives in a shack in the rooftops of Rio. There he watches Rio's extravagant high-income people spending money like Carnival confetti. As you'll expect, in the end, Fernando redeems himself in helping to get the two macaws back.<br/><br/>SLOPPY BIOLOGICAL BLOOPERS: 1. Early scene; Blu's owner gives Blu his morning cup of hot chocolate. The writers could have had fun with this scene in many ways since parrots eat so many things that people eat, EXCEPT chocolate is poisonous to parrots! They should have used some other food item. 2. Parrot feet. Rio uses semi-realistic animation style. People had four fingers and thumb, not Mickey Mouse three-fingers-plus thumb. Feather details throughout the movie. You can see rust on a truck's license plate! Being realistic animation, how could the illustrators make the parrots three toes, instead illustrated with parrot's incredible hand-functioning, two-toes-forward, two-toes-back? Can't the animators count? VERY sloppy, and missing out on a fun opportunity.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: It was a very fun, beautiful, funny, touching, full of music, entertaining movie that we highly recommend. - The bottom line for us is we hope more people think about and get involved with children's programs; locally, and worldwide, --And learn a little about the threat of species such as macaws, so that people will become open to learning about this arguably, most intelligent species on the planet (including humans). -For more, visit PiratesAndParrots.com and , Wikipedia: ""List of macaws""."

This film is just awful I cannot stress that enough. However the voice acting is fairly decent but that is it. The dialouge is terrible and just downright corny. The directer was obviously not paying attention when he made this abomination. This film had no redeeming qualities and belongs in the 4.99 bin. Another bad thing about this was the awful musical numbers. I have seen worse films but this still goes on my least favorite films of all time. Do not waste your time on this pitiful excuse for a movie. Lastly anyone who favors this worthless piece of sh*t film over masterpieces like the hunger games is fu***** high"

"NeHaud","6","2","4","28 May 2011"," A Cute Children's Movie
","I will admit it- some of my favorite movies of all time are children's cartoon movies. The heart-warming themes, innocent plots, all feed into my memories of my happy childhood. Sadly, many recent children's movies have been a major disappointment to me...Over the Hedge grated against my nerves, The Wild bored me (and was a total rip-off of Madagascar, which was a very good movie), and Hoodwinked Too destroyed my love for it's prequel (darn you movie!). However, when I saw the commercial for this movie, the story intrigued me. The colors were brilliant and fun to look at, the story seemed cute (even though not very original...), and the main character seemed somewhat tolerable for a children's movie hero. The movie was as I summarized- cute. It wasn't anything too special or magnificent, but simply cute. The voice acting wasn't very impressive, but it made up for it with it's vivid scenery, enjoyable music, and lovable hero. The story was, of course, cliché, but it was a fun cliché. It seemed to know it was not very original, but it embraced this and didn't try to pretend that it was, and instead focused on visually pleasing the audience. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, however it could never compete with some of the great cartoon classics (I.E. Beauty and the Beast, which is my all time favorite movie!). It is instead, I repeat, cute."

As a passionate Brazilian, born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, I'm proud to realize that Carlos Saldanha didn't fail at any time when decided to make this amazing tribute to our city, Rio de Janeiro.<br/><br/>The story begins with Blu, a Brazilian blue macaw which is captured by illegal bird dealers and goes straight to the freezin' Minnesota, U.S.A. <br/><br/>Blu was raised in a lovely and safe environment, full of comfort and no worries living peacefully with his owner Linda. One day, Linda finds out that Blu is the last male of his specie, and the only chance of perpetuating his specie is to travel to Rio and give Blu a chance to mate with a short temper female called Jade, probably the last female blue macaw of the world. As soon as they arrive in Rio, unpredictable situations take over the story and the adventure begins.<br/><br/>Thereafter, even if I try to summarize, all I'd say it would be insufficient. I was mesmerized with all the swirl of colors, catchy songs, breathtaking landscapes, hilarious dialogs, funny characters (Jesse Eisenber as Blu and Anne Hathaway as Jade were priceless choices, I can not think of any other actors to fit as well as both did in this movie)... it was pretty awesome story, words definitely can't describe.<br/><br/>Since I watched ""Ice Age - The Meltdown"", I had the certainty that Carlos Saldanha was one of a kind. With ""Rio"", he made ​​another worthy, creative and innovative movie, easily able to please all kinds of audiences. It's such a wonderful feeling to know that the entire world can see how remarkable and beautiful our city is. <br/><br/>I appreciate that a lot.

"lasttimeisaw","8","2","4","16 April 2011"," Rio
","This Blue-Sky studio animation is a genuine energizer for the spring time here in Shanghai, saw the 3D-version in the cinema and even one week before its northern America release. <br/><br/>The fun is literally tangible, although the whole story is a standard mainstream Hollywood product, the twist-and-turn is perfectly calculated to meet the expectations of both children and adult audience, which sadly enough though, also means that it is too naive to believe in something surprisingly overjoyed would occur. There is no doubt this one will grab tons of money in the market and further set up a great mouth-of-praise for Blue-sky Studio and shows the world beside ICE AGE franchise, they are truly capable of being a potential competitor of Pixar. <br/><br/>The 3D effect is more like an appendix due to the fact that the all the adorable characters alone is sufficient to keep us embedded in our seats for a fleeting 90 minutes, the Rio de Janeiro location and Carnival also help to relish the whole process. <br/><br/>The voice cast is superb especially Jesse Eisenberg, his distinctively geeky register and drumfire speed is the highlight, by comparison, Anne Hathaway's tone is nothing particular, sidekicks Will i Am and Jamie Foxx attribute their competent effort in rapping and singing respectively. <br/><br/>I call it an almost-perfect-manufactured animation, however, RIO is not valiant enough to bring any groundbreaking revolution into the status-quo (as it had the chance to do so), for example, eventually our unusual non-flying macaw Blu has to accomplish the final rescue of his apple-of-the-eye by taking his first flying and the epiphany comes just on time! Why not keep Blu as a unique as he is? You don't need to do anything to prove to be who you are, right? Because you are who you are! So for me the most memorable quote in the film is I HATE SAMBA, BECAUSE THEY ALL SOUND SAME TO ME! This is golden, I wish I could iterate the same thing about nowadays mainstream films."
"eiram35","9","2","4","15 April 2011"," Rio Movie Review From Parrot Owner's Perspective
","The movie Rio was finally released in theaters today after many months of anticipation. This is perhaps the largest and most prominent feature film centered around parrots ever. From a parrot owner's perspective, this is my impression of the movie as well as the realism of parrot ownership that it conveys.<br/><br/>The story opens in the forest outside off Rio De Janeiro where birds do morning song and dance ritual. While the singing/dancing is of course personified, it certainly alludes to the natural morning song that birds sing.<br/><br/>We get our first glimpse of Blu, the movie's hero, as a baby in a nest cavity. Parrots nest in cavities rather than building nests on branches so this was an accurate depiction. Blu is captured by poachers and smuggled to Minnesota. Like in half the pet featured movies out there, the crate carrying the hero character falls out of a truck and is discovered by the future owner. Not only does this make the owner appear benevolent for saving a lost animal, but it also absolves the owner from responsibility for buying into the illegal pet trade. However, there is actually some truth to the matter.<br/><br/>Rio is actually partly based on a true story and a real species of Macaw. The movie simply refers to Blu as a Blue Macaw, however, at a later point in the movie Cyanopsitta Spixii species is mentioned. The Spix Macaw is one of four Blue Macaw species and was endemic to Brazil. However, due to poaching and deforestation of their natural habitat, Spix Macaws went extinct in the wild in the year 2000. Nonetheless, over 60 Spix macaws have been known to remain in captivity after their wild counterparts went extinct. Two years after the last Spix was observed in the wild, a veterinarian in the the United States was shocked to be consulted by an owner of one in Denver.<br/><br/>Presley was estimated to be 25 years old and DNA confirmed to be a male Spix Macaw. In the movie, Blu was unable to fly although he was fully feathered. Presley on the other hand became accustomed to a life down low from being clipped. Presley, like Blu, also ended up in his caretakers possession by chance rather than being bought.<br/><br/>See the full review on http://TrainedParrot.com/Rio"

","When I went to the theater today to watch Rio, I really had no clue as to what the movie was or would be like... The movie began and there were my favorite Macaw birds dancing , chirping and flying in such vibrant colors that I lay there gazing at the screen in awe. As the movie continued there were many ups and downs, but what I liked the most, were the funny scenes included in every nook and corner of the 96 min movie, which always kept us laughing as gazing even in the most tense situations. The amazing color, texture and brightness to the carnival scenes of Rio De Janerio could not have been brought out perfectly if the movie had been in 2D. The effects and detailing to the movie need a special mention. Every scene was carried out with perfection by the skilled animators of the Blue Sky Studios. Next come the punch lines. Usually animations contain fillers and extra dialogs to continue the movie but in Rio its the exact opposite, the dialogs were so perfectly timed and written that I could not stop laughing at them! Whatever was done for the movie was done in perfection. Though the movie wasn't properly advertised, I still believe it will get a hue turn up for what it has to offer to the audience. I recommend people of all age groups to watch it at least one necessarily in 3D to get the full excitement and fun in an adventurous way... Adeus and have fun...!"
"estebangonzalez10","7","2","4","11 April 2011"," If you haven't been to Rio, this is the time
","¨This is great. I'm chained to the only bird in the world who can't fly! Is there anything else I need to know? ¨ Carlos Saldanha gives us one of the most colorful movies of the year, and it couldn't have been any other way considering the story takes place in beautiful Rio de Janeiro. Saldanha pays homage to the city where he was born, and does it by showing us the beauty of its locations, its people, and its music, during one of the most fun and colorful events that take place every year: Carnival. It's impossible not to like this animated film, despite having a weak and predictable plot, because not liking it would be like not enjoying a trip to Rio. Saldanha takes us to his city and shows us all the beauty Rio has to offer. The visuals in the film are excellent and we get plenty of aerial shots of the city, we see its beautiful beaches, tropical forests, and even get to experience a motorcycle ride across its infamous favela. We also get to meet some of their eccentric characters (Saldanha has a lot of fun with the stereotypes), although the main attraction of the movie are the colorful animals. Animated films have matured greatly over the years and we've come to expect excellent visual effects, but in Rio the visuals are the main attraction and the characters are just a product of their environment. Rio is much better than the other animated film 2011 had to offer: Rango. Rango was an animated film I disliked, but I admitted the visuals were fantastic. Neither of the films have a decent story or memorable characters, but the difference with Rio is that when you have Rio de Janeiro the city itself becomes a character and a very memorable one for that matter. That is why the movie is such fun because it's all about Rio and not so much as the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>The film opens in the tropical jungles of Brazil where a blue macaw's life will change forever when a group of poachers take him captive and smuggle him to the States. Somewhere along the way the bird ends up in chilly Minnesota after the truck that is smuggling him hits the breaks a little too hard and the box where he's in ends up flying out of the truck. The macaw is fortunate enough to be found by a young girl named Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann) who takes good care of him. She names the bird Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and they both seem to be enjoying a comfortable life together when all of a sudden they get a visit from a Brazilian ornithologist, Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro), who claims that Blu is the last male bird of his species. Tulio has found a female macaw (Jewell, voiced by Anne Hathaway) and needs Linda to take Blu to Rio so the birds can breed and save the species. Linda unwillingly takes Blu to Rio and that is where the fun begins because Jewel and Blu don't get off to a right start. She is more of a free spirited bird who enjoys her liberty, and he is a domesticated macaw who can't even fly. Somehow both birds are kidnapped from the lab by a smuggler named Marcel (Carlos Ponce) along with his stupid accomplices, and accompanied by an evil and scary cockatoo named Nigel (Jermaine Clement). Blu and Jewel manage to escape from these poachers but not before they end up being chained together. Both birds end up on a journey trying to free themselves while escaping from Nigel and the poachers and along the way they befriend Rafael (George Lopez) the toucan, Pedro (Will.i.am) the red-crested cardinal, Nico (Jamie Foxx) the yellow canary, and Luiz (Tracy Morgan), the bulldog.<br/><br/>The plot is probably the weakest part out of the 96 minute movie because it is very predictable: it's a formula picture where we have a male and female lead character that can't stand each other at first only to end up discovering they have feelings for each other. We've all come to expect these stories from Hollywood were opposites attract. Fox-Blue Sky Studios may not have the depth in their stories as Pixar does, but they sure can deliver great visuals. Don't expect a heartfelt story like Pixar's Up or Toy Story and I guarantee you will enjoy this fun colorful movie because Rio de Janeiro is a fun place to be, especially during Carnival. The city itself becomes the main character in this film and that is why the movie is called Rio and not Blu or Jewel. The details of the city and the beautiful locations couldn't have been enjoyed more if it wasn't for Carlos Saldanha and his love for the city in which he was born. Rio is a fun and entertaining movie where kids and adults will have a good time alike thanks to the beauty of its scenery enjoyed mostly through aerial shots, and the soundtrack full of Samba which identifies the city. Saldanha couldn't have picked a more different location from his previous film: Ice Age, and the result is visually noticeable. Rio is a lot of fun and I recommend this animated film for the entire family.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","As this animated film opens several birds, including a young Spix's macaw are captured in the rain forest outside Rio de Janeiro and taken to America. The young macaw's crate falls off the van in the snow blanketed town of Moose Lake in Minnesota. Here he is found and cared for by Linda, who calls him Blu. Fifteen years pass then Túlio Monteiro, an ornithologist from Rio turns up asking for Linda's help... Spix's macaws are critically endangered and he needs Blu to go to Rio and breed with Jewel, the last known female. The three of them fly there but Jewel and Blu don't initially hit it off... she is certainly unimpressed that he can't fly. This is the least of their problems though; they are stolen, and chained together by thieving bird smugglers and Nigel, their evil sulphur-crested cockatoo. They manage to escape but their adventure is far from over. Meanwhile Linda and Túlio learn of their disappearance and start searching for them; as do the smugglers.<br/><br/>This film is quite different from the stories one gets from Disney/Pixar; it is brasher in style and a little cheeky at times. This isn't a criticism though; it provides plenty of good laughs, child-friendly thrills and a touch of romance... in other words something for everybody. The main characters are good; I liked how Blu and Jewel's relationship gradually develops and Linda and Túlio work together to find the birds without their relationship becoming obviously romantic. I was less amused by Pedro and Nico, to cliché comedy sidekicks who were more irritating than entertaining... of course they may appeal more to younger viewers who are the real target audience. The character designs were impressive and the animation was top notch. I loved the scenes were we fly through the jungle and soar above Rio; they were clearly designed to show case the film's 3D on the big screen but still work on a small TV screen. The voice cast, which includes Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg as Jewel and Blu, does a fine job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd say that this is well worth a watch if you enjoy animation or are just looking for something that can be enjoyed by all the family."

Events transpire to take him all the way to Rio de Janeiro to meet the last remaining female of his species. Hijinks ensue due to a pair of animal traffickers.<br/><br/>Blue Sky Studios is most well-known for its Ice Age films, which are definitely funny, but have their fair share of cringy moments as well. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It's not very deep, nor will it make you challenge your views of the world or to grow as a person - like something from Disney or Pixar might do - but it is a solid animation movie for the whole family.<br/><br/>The characters are likable, for one. They're pretty one-note in certain respects, but their voice actors are talented and they're given enough interesting things to say and do that you care about what happens to them. I also like that there's some actual character growth. And in a way that feels both natural and earned.<br/><br/>It's also a very colourful film. Fitting, keeping in mind the Brazilian setting. All the different birds look suitably lifelike and I do admire the fact that they've kept the sizes lifelike as well. There are certain birds that are teeny tiny and there are some that are huge. As it should be.<br/><br/>Is it great entertainment? No, not really. But it is all-around likable. Very well worth a watch, especially if you've liked the other films from this studio."

Thus, a big adventure starts, one in which three misfit bandits try to get their hands on the birds for a big amount of money.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful animation which presents the life of Blue, how he's raised by his human friend and how he meets Jewel, a beautiful female macaw, with a mentality on the opposite end of his. Their adventures are well described, with much emotion, managing to maintain interest throughout its entire length. I have to say that the start is a bit slow and somehow rushed, but from there on, laughter and good will are due to form a great atmosphere from which you don't to exit. I must also mention that this move is really hilarious, being able to make you laugh pretty often, making the overall experience a real treat. The story isn't fabulous, but it does its job well, making enough room for its characters to display whatever they desire, and they do it with style and plenty of fun. As you would expect, the animation is top notch, a true delight for your eyes, especially when it presents complex, far away scenery, made almost specifically to impress.<br/><br/>Overall, I found a very good animation, which has a good story, great characters, looks amazing and makes you laugh quite out loud from time to time.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","21 June 2015"," The most Brazilian animated movie ever made
","But you could probably guessed that with the film's title. The writer and director Carlos Saldanha made this a nice feature about his home country. Topics like football, carnival and the rain forest are included, but there are also references to more serious aspects, such as orphan boys living in the slums of Rio or crime in general. Still as this is an animated feature and thus the target audience are mostly younger people, there is nothing too severe in here. The main character is a cookie-eating coffee-drinking blue macaw and we find out he is the one of only two specimen of his kind. The problem, however, is that he is so domesticated by his owner that he cannot even fly and so his trip to Brazil where he meets the other, a female (obviously) who is the exact opposite of him, is full of danger, adventure and a love story. Oh wait, there is actually another love story in there as his owner, a young woman, falls for a wildlife preservationist. The movie starts very nicely with ""Real in Rio"", the song that managed an Oscar nomination and made up for the film coming short in the Animated Feature category.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed this movie. There are many funny scenes in it from start to finish and Blu and Jewel (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway) just like the two humans are quite a joy to watch. However, I have to say almost all other characters did not do too much for me and I believe this film could have been more essential and better without a couple of them. This way, it would probably not have been 100, but only 85 minutes, but I would have approved of that. There are some emotional moments, like when Blu and Jewel discover their love for one another or the two humans do in their macaw costumes, but as a whole it does not reach the emotional heights of Pixar movies. That is not to say it's a disappointing movie. It's lots of fun and the 7(!) people who worked on the script did a fine job all in all. Saldanha also directed the equally fun sequel from a year ago and I am curious if they will ever make a third movie. If yes, I will probably give it a watch. Until then, I recommend this first Rio movie of the franchise."

","It's been a decade since a new animation company competed against Pixar and DreamWorks Animation known as Blue Sky Studios, a division of 20th Century Fox. So far, they made the Ice Age franchise (with the original being critically praised and the sequels received mixed to negative reviews) a Dr. Seuss adaptation *Horton Hears A Who*, and two William Joyce projects ""Robots"" and ""Epic"". <br/><br/>Then, three years later, the company made a new franchise that started with this one known as ""Rio"", a story about a blue macaw named Blu who travels to Rio De Janiero, Brazil with his human owner. One day, after meeting another blue macaw named Jewel, they get captured by a bunch of bird thieves and a cockatoo bird named Nigel. As they escape from them, they must find a way to get back to Blu's owner with the help from other birds.<br/><br/>Looking back at this, I never realized how spectacular this film is. It's not nearly perfect by any means, but it's a really great film. My only nit-pick is that it does have the same clichés that we've seen before (a pet getting kidnapped by people, etc.), but there are other movies that have execution that makes the old clichés work and this is no exception. It does a good job executing those clichés by developing the characters and flowing the story really well.<br/><br/>Everything else is great. The story isn't exactly the best, but it's really entertaining and a cute one that has it's heart in the right place. There's never a moment that would make you feel bored. Also, I liked the energy that was put into it and the humor comes across as fast and thick you can't help but giggle and chuckle. The pacing is very brisk and takes you to the world this film introduces us.<br/><br/>The characters are likable with the help of a solid voice cast. Jesse Eisenberg does a nice job as Blu, the nerdy, but endearing protagonist while Anne Hathaway does a great job as Jewel, the love interest and secondary main character and her chemistry with Blu is very entertaining. The other characters are amazing. Nigel is a very menacing enough villain he even steals the show. The same thing can be said for the comic reliefs, Nico, Pedro, and Rafael.<br/><br/>The music score from John Powell is actually a really good one. Not How To Train Your Dragon worthy, but I liked the Brazilian flavor, the emotion, & energy it gives an epic scale to the film. Also, the songs are really good to listen to. Real In Rio, I Wanna Party (I Wanna Samba), and the others are really nice choices for a musical adventure you'll end up humming them for a long time. Then, there's the animation. The character animation on the humans is fine and the bird designs for the protagonists and the side characters are great, but what really stands out is the visuals. The look of Rio is fantastic. The city, the streets, the ocean, the forest, and the Carnival Festival sequence. It's just... wow.<br/><br/>Overall, Rio isn't the best CGI modern animated feature film and it's not on par with Pixar and DreamWorks Animation, but it's a really fun film with a story that is rarely predictable, characters that are endearing, a few songs that are solid, and has a nice touch of Brazilian flavor. It makes me feel like I want to go to Rio so I can party and live my life. Thumbs up!"

He is a domesticated bird that lives with his owner in a book shop. When a man walks into her shop and asks to take the bird to Rio so he can mate with a female Macaw, they reluctantly agree.

I liked the characters. I thought they were very funny and the relationship they all had together was really well done.<br/><br/>The action was good and was steady throughout the movie. There was not really a lot of time in the film where not a lot happened. It was entertaining throughout.<br/><br/>The voice work was really good. They were so funny in places. Jesse Eisenberg was the voice of Blu. Very well done and very funny. Anne Hathaway was Lewel, the female Macaw. She was also very good, but nothing special. I didn't even realise it was her until the end. They could have got anyone do this voice. Other voice artists were Wanda Sykes, Jane Lynch, Jamie Foxx & Will.I.Am. Again though, I had no idea that these guys did the voices.<br/><br/>I thought this was very good and had its own feel to it. You could tell this was not a Disney film, but that does not take anything away from it.

","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Rio is a fun, bright and colourful film about a whole host of animals living in the inner city Rio de Janeiro and the rainforest just on the outskirts of the city. It although a kids film can be enjoyed by all, not the funniest film ever but still manages a sweet story with some great visuals even for an animation film. I felt the film was firmly a Good movie and would tell you to show your kids this film on a Sunday afternoon, but here is why I think even middle aged adults can enjoy this film.<br/><br/>The story is straightforward and although it is like that it manages to bring smiles to your face and put me in a food mood for the rest of the film. The plot is fast paced with big falls and typical traits you see in Kids movies but I did feel most of all that it wasn't too cheesy like you see in many kids films and churned out a fun story. The villains are fun and the heroes have fun with them too to make a story that is fun for the whole family as well, and with a sequel it has to be said it is good.<br/><br/>The voice cast are good Jesse Eisenberg as the main bird is a scared character who comes out of his shell to be a slight hero as the movie progresses onwards. Anne Hathaway's bird if courageous and hates to be kept in captivity, in comparison to Eisenberg who wants to stay put and has been pampered in America all his life. I liked all the voices even though they were all nearly American even though they are from Brazil but I shall let that pass in sake of the plot.<br/><br/>I love the animation style which is far from superior style motion but serves some great colours up and the vibrancy of Rio is brought to life in this animated film, especially the carnival(what film set here doesn't have the carnival). The movement is also good with fast flowing motion that serves the faster parts of the story well as you feel the film will end soon but not in a hurry and a good pace. I enjoyed the script and it serves to let the Birds and humans have an equal say on the matters all the way through.<br/><br/>The film I believe was meant to be a comedy and now for kids it may amuse them but for more mature people the comedy is poor and near none existent, I enjoyed the films plot and style but the comedy seemed underused and when it came up it just served to annoy rather than make you laugh. Eisenberg seems to rarely get into the role well but it doesn't hinder the movie, the plot as I said is predictable but the movie does turn up some good moments and nice effects and sequences.<br/><br/>I could easily say this is made for 3 year olds but I think lots will enjoy this if they watch it with the intention of not laughing but enjoying a sweet movie and some nice characters too. Those who like animation films generally will like it as it flows nice and I said about the motion being fast, along with the film being not too long either. Finally I must say don't watch this film in a bad mood because I can imagine people would absolutely hate this when they are angry or sad.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 7/10 meaning firmly good, the film serves as fun entertainment for a family but not maybe everyone's cup of tea in truth, give it a miss if you want funny animation. I felt FOX did well to make it and put it out but failed to see if it was really funny, but hey watch it and a give it a try, you may just thoroughly enjoy yourself, but on the same hand you may find it cringe and boring, your call."

Oh, and a cliché villain with no character is thrown in to give the movie drama.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>The main characters are really likable, especially Linda.

I even forgot their names.<br/><br/>Visuals:<br/><br/>The visuals are what make the movie. The beautiful scenery of Rio de Janeiro is what gives the movie it's core appeal. That's what my family was talking about when we left the theater. Just like how Disney's The Lion King was a break-through in hand-drawn animation, this film is how all animated CGI films should look. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Enjoyment:<br/><br/>It was really hard getting around the cringe-inducing dialogue and terrible secondary-characters, but if you can get past it, it is rather enjoyable. The side-characters are pretty much what really killed it for me. If they were different or not in the movie at all, this film would get another star rate from me.<br/><br/>Rewatchability:<br/><br/>This is one of those animated movies you see on Netflix and just skip past it to see what else is available.

So they travel to Rio where our male macaw meets Jewel voiced by Anne Hathaway(who actually sings in this movie too may I add its a musical so you'll be expecting a lot of fun loving,tap dancing songs in this movie which are SO forgettable by the way)a sassy macaw who escapes with the male macaw and together they meet up with a hipster cock and a cool yellow chick (voiced by auto tune man himself Will.I.Am and the yellow chick is voiced by ex Rn B singer turned actor Jamie Foxx). <br/><br/>But an evil bird named Nigel voiced by Jermaine Clements is after them.<br/><br/>Bottom line it was a cute flick,is it epic NO,are the songs good,well some of them are but Nigel's song MAN was that so embarrassing it reminded me of that rapping dog in that god awful film Titanic Legend Goes On,is the voice acting great,sure I guess even though you Will.I.Am's voice a MILE away as for Anne Hathaway,the animation I must say was brilliant but still if you love animal movies and musicals then check it out.<br/><br/>Song: 5/10 Animation 8.5/10 Story: 7.5/10 Cast:8.5/10<br/><br/>Overall im giving Rio a 7/10 out of 5 stars a 3 out of 5."

","If you don't like this movie it is, because you are to old to be watching it to begin with just kidding you are never to old to watch this. Seeing a review with anything below a 7 out of 10 on this movie is ridiculous. Great plot, great animation, great songs that help bring the culture of Rio to your TV screen. Great voice casting and great dialog. Some people say this movie is predictable and to that I say ""What could you possibly expect would happen from a kid movie? I mean half the time parents go nuts if there is a death in an animated movie and so its got be good and positive and pg rated stuff."" So if you think its boring then I say it's probably just your inability to connect with the characters or maybe you're doing to much thinking instead of just sitting back and enjoying the show. If its still boring then maybe you've spent way to much time watching the Fox Channel. It also seems to have good realist geography according to the city of Rio. Expresses good enthusiasm for the tradition of Carnaval. Either way unless you just like trying to insult good movies, then this will be an enjoyable movie for kids and adults to watch. I know, because I have this movie on Blu- Ray. So sit back, relax and enjoy the movie, because it will have you dancing and singing to some amazing music and intently eating buttery popcorn waiting to see what will happen next on this high flying adventure in the grand city of Rio de Janeiro! :D"

","Ironic, isn't it, how ""Rio"" uses an outlined plot and a standard story to produce a wacky, out-of-control party where most of its participants either have wings or fur. Humans may have a hard time keeping up with these singing, dancing, rapping animals, especially if two of them are voiced by will.i.am and Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>""Rio"" opens with a lively performance in the jungle. Birds sweep through the air and swerve through the trees. Consistent through the rest of the film, this sequence is bright and colorful. The birds maintain a low height, probably with a fear of being sucked into jet engines. A baby macaw admires the view from a hole in a tree until everyone is interrupted and caged by a group of poachers. How rude.<br/><br/>Fate is very kind to the baby macaw, who later finds itself in the hands of a caring little girl in Minnesota. Years pass. Linda and her pet bird, Blue, are all grown up. Because Blue was captured very early in his life, he never did learn to fly. Linda is not to blame for Blue's flightless lifestyle. When a bird pushes its baby a cliff, it's called normal parenting. But when a human does the same thing to young ones, it's called animal cruelty.<br/><br/>Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/rio-movie-review/"
"keyos27","10","0","0","23 November 2012"," A great example of why using references is effective and necessary
","Having known Blue Sky Studios since the Ice Age Series, I have anticipated that ""Rio"", directed by Carlos Saldanha, native Brazilian who implements his childhood and real-life experiences while adopting lots of detailed references to bring non-stop squawking birds to life in order to convey an emotional and comical story would not disappoint me. <br/><br/>The plot is simple and intriguing. It is about a domesticated and flightless macaw, Blu raised by Linda who found Blu in the middle of street after being left behind by smugglers tries to stop his species from getting extinguished by mating with the only female of his kind, Jewel while going through all sorts of obstacles. Oh and yes, we get to see a bird that can not fly. <br/><br/>What amazes me is how computer-animated birds move around so naturally by flapping and chirping while behaving like a human being. A great work by voice acting cast. Everyone executes the role really well! For example, the notorious bird, Nizel voiced by Jemaine Clement truly sounded fearful. Of course, it wouldn't be there without the stringent and painstaking job done by talented artists who actually video-tape all types of birds doing various movements and examine them every detail frame by frame thoroughly.<br/><br/>As a graphic artist, I know how challenging it can be to create a realistic and high-poly specimen due to its complexity of set-up for flexible controllers and a wide range of facial expressions. I really admire them for every element. The landscape of Rio de Janeiro (The second largest capital city in Brazil) is spectacular. It makes me feel like I am actually in the city. Fall in love with tropical trees lined up in front of shiny beach and not to mention the imposing statue of Cristo Redentor. All the colorful and magnificent visuals are a proof that computer software has transcended what it couldn't do a few years ago.<br/><br/>The true advantage of Animation is creativity. You can literally do anything using your broad imagination, especially when it comes to a fighting scene. The birds vs monkey battle is one of the epic battles I have ever seen. While jolly and wild monkeys somehow pretends to be Kong Fu experts and tries to scratch and shear feathers, Birds fight back using their sharp beaks to knock them out. <br/><br/>Have to give an extra credit to the music team. They deliver cheerful and harmonious Samba theme songs ""Hot Wings"" and ""Real in Rio"" that pump up the atmosphere of the wild city filled with a herd of birds twitching hips and flapping wings. <br/><br/>As this movie unleash an internal conflict of Blu who chooses to leave his long-term friend/owner, Linda to his hometown with Jewel is indeed emotional. Like in any other children movies, happiness always follows after sadness as it seems like Zoologist, Dr.Barbosa and Linda, falls over heel in love with each other. And seeing an orphan boy standing between them in the end, we get a brief idea of Rio 2 that is coming in 2014. I can not wait for the next adventure."

","I have young kids, and also, as a family, my husband and I decided early on to try regulating media, to watch and listen things more positive, especially for the kids. I've noticed that our kids repeat verbally and physically everything EVERYTHING they watch. It's really turned our lives around. There are a lot of benefits we've seen since we've done this.<br/><br/>With that being said, I haven't found a lot of kids movies I can watch with the kids. They are either too cheesy for me to keep my interest, or they cross the line with kids. As a result, I've turned to a lot of older movies from Singing in the Rain to Neverending Story.<br/><br/>The kids wanted to see it for ages since seeing it in previews and playing the Angry Birds RIO on Kindle Fire. I was skeptical, newer kids movies almost always pushes the envelope with really rude behavior, language, and scary images. We finally saw it on a free summer movie day at my local theater a few days ago. I figured, if there was really anything I find offensive, since its free, we can walk out or just sit it out, and talk to the kids after about things, and make a point not to show it at home.<br/><br/>Rio is truly the first modern I found that really is great for all of us to watch as a family. I'm so pleased that it was entertaining, and in the same time it was safe, even for my standards. No one even said the ""damn"" or anything. I couldn't believe I was laughing while watching it. The writing was brilliant. I didn't know this was a mini-musical too. It was kinda like the classic Disney movies from the 90s. I'm so glad movies like this are still being made, and I hope there are others I can find too. I can't wait to get it in DVD."

","I first heard of this film when I went to my little brother's Birthday party. my uncle had a bootleg of this movie and put it on for everyone to watch. I wasn't impressed. in fact, I didn't start watching until the part when, Blu and jewel met Rafael. and even then I didn't watch the rest of it. My mom eventually got her own bootleg which was a way better quality. One day when I came home from school, I decided to check it out on my own. I Really liked it. But, I didn't finish it. I stopped at the part when They meet Luis. I decided to go deeper research into it. I was impressed. Then I listened to the ""Real In Rio"" Song. I was memorized. The next day, I picked up the Party Edition. I saw it. Then I blew up with awesomeness. <br/><br/>Negatives: I hate tuilo. <br/><br/>Positives: Awesome Music, One of the most colorful movies I've ever seen. Jesse eisenberg, Anne Hataway, Will-I-Am, Jamie Fox, and George Lopez do FANTASTIC Jobs of the voices. ""Real in Rio"" Is my favorite song in the whole movie and perhaps my favorite in ANY animated movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Fantastic movie. This in my opinion is better then all 3 ice age movies. I'm serious. :) 10/10"

","I think Rio makes for a great kids film that adults will enjoy also. I also liked the fact that the animals didn't talk to the people but among themselves. There were a couple of cute songs and lots of famous people doing voice overs. The story revolves around the last 2 blue macrows, a male and female. Blu lives in Minnosote with Linda while Jewel is with an ornithologist, Tulio, in Brazil. Tulio shows up when day and tells Linda they should bring the two birds together to continue the survival of the species. Linda agrees but disaster results when the birds are kidnapped by smugglers. The rest of the movie is about the birds escaping with help from their animal friends and their owners searching also. It had a strong family feeling and ends perfectly.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Worth checking out."

I watch a lot of movies and this one was right up there with another animation favorite of mine, Rango.

","I don't think anyone would deny that although there was a time when almost every animated film that came out was at least good and creative and had some great songs, that time is gone. And ""Rio"" doesn't help the cause very much.<br/><br/>With a very weak, almost-not-there-yet-still-incredibly-predictable-story, ""Rio"" focuses on Blu, a Macaw that was stolen from Brazil when he was young for reselling but inadvertently falls off a truck and into the life of Linda, who raises him domestically in Minnesota. When a random ornithologist walks into Linda's book shop and sees a now all-grown-up Blu, he invites them down to Rio de Janeiro so Blu can mate with his female counterpart, Jewel, as they are the last two of their kind. Because we all know if you get asked to go to Rio by a total stranger, even if you own a business, you just pack up and leave, and so they are off to Brazil. However, before Blu and Jewel can do the deed, they both get stolen for sale on the black market again...and a very light, forgettable ""adventure"" ensues.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that this film is gorgeous to watch. A virtual colour orgasm, ""Rio"" will make you want to go to Rio! And the opening song, ""Real in Rio,"" one of the only two Oscar-nominated songs this year, is a fantastic tune. But the film itself won't hold much interest for anyone over the age of ten. Once you get over the well-done animation and the colours, there really is not much else there. And generally, I find the use of a well-known actor's voice fun in an animated film, but here, Jessie Eisenberg doing the voice of Blu just ends up nothing more than distracting most of the time.<br/><br/>So. Um. Yeah. There's a reason this film didn't get nominated for Best Animated Feature. It's as clear as the skies in Brazil on a sunny day."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","0","16 February 2012"," An overall enjoyable film.
","Normally I'm getting fed up with animated movies with animals in it, that look like real animals but yet behave like humans. But I simply enjoyed ""Rio"" for what it was and it didn't ever angered or annoyed me in any way. Instead it entertained me, even though this movie still has plenty of flaws to it.<br/><br/>A thing that the movie most definitely has going for it are its locations. It makes you wonder why there aren't more animated movies set in Rio de Janeiro. It's bright, cheerful and very colorful (well, depending on where you go in Rio de Janeiro of course), just like basically every computer animated movie! In other words, it's a perfect combination. Besides, it provides the movie with plenty of excuses to feature lots of singing and dancing and jumping around in it, which most modern animated movies seem to love to do.<br/><br/>And just like most of the other animated movies as well, this movie its humor has its hits and misses in it. But luckily it's all getting done and told in such a fast way that you can forgive it for its misses, since chances are that 5 seconds later something good and funny will still happen. And the movie still really has some big hits in it as well. This movie will make you laugh at least two or three times, guaranteed.<br/><br/>But there still is plenty wrong with this movie as well. First of all, its story is being far too simplistic and straightforward, even for an animated movie for kids. There really are no good side-plots and the main story itself is about as simple and generic as it could get, about a parrot getting lost in Rio de Janeiro, trying to get back to its owner, while his owner is also looking for him. But come to think of it, throughout the movie he is actually hardly looking for his owner at all. He is far too busy with his new girlfriend and learning to fly.<br/><br/>Another serious issue I had with this movie was the fact that it kept introducing new characters, basically throughout the entire movie. Did we really need 4 villains and 5 different comical reliefs? Really, every time you start to think; 'this character is going to be important!' a new character pops up and the other characters are getting pushed to the background again. The movie does this a bit too often but maybe they thought they would sell more merchandise if they introduced dozens of characters in it.<br/><br/>Visually there is nothing wrong with the movie. Like I said before, its perfectly colorful and cheerful and Rio de Janeiro looks truly superb in this movie. I also really liked the character's animation. Picking a parrot for the main lead doesn't sound like the most likely choice but it does work out really well for the movie. But the design for basically every animal or human character in this movie is just great. Seriously, sometimes just the look of a character was enough to make me laugh.<br/><br/>Despite the plenty of problems I had with this movie, I could still really enjoy and appreciate it for what it was.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"smfarmer530","4","0","0","13 February 2012"," Colorful but unremarkable
","So mediocre that it's almost an achievement. Almost.<br/><br/>Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age, Robots, Horton Hears a Who!) has some great animators, and their latest film, Rio , is nothing if not full of deliciously curvy character designs and a color palette that is at times sweetly saturated with deep hues, but it's clear that film's budget went primarily to wrangling a celebrity cast and writing some catchy songs. The animation noticeably cuts corners at times—character models are often under-animated and overused, and there's a stifling sense of formulaic rigidity to the whole thing.<br/><br/>It's unoffensive, though. Rio is the kind of animated film that easily entertains and placates kids for its running time. However, I must encourage parents to consider whether or not that's really such a good thing. In an age when animated films are popular and great films are produced with considerable regularity (Coraline, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Pixar films in general not to mention Disney's commitment to localizing Studio Ghibli films), why settle for mediocre?"
"Geeky Randy","8","0","0","9 February 2012"," Great film not only for parents and children alike, but also bird lovers of all ages!
","Charismatic computer-animated musical comedy about two Spix's Macaws on the run in Rio de Janeiro from three bird smugglers and their crusty evil Macaw (voiced viciously perfect by Jemaine Clement). One of the macaws is a flightless domestic, trying to find his owner Mann who's equally lost in the large Brazilian city; while the other is a wild bird trying to escape to freedom. Along the way, they come across many colorful (no pun intended) characters played by will.i.am, Foxx, Lopez and Morgan. What makes this film such a delight is the accuracy at recreating the wonderful avian creatures for the big screen. The comedy can be a bit too slapstick at times, and the musical numbers have the misfortune of being completely out of place; but the film not only has an appeal for parents and children alike, but also any bird lover.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"

","That in mind, there is more of 2011 I have yet to see, hence the so far bit, but I absolutely loved this movie after seeing it when it came out today. From the trailers and advertising it looked like a bright, breezy and entertaining animation, and in my mind it was much more than that. And I genuinely mean it when I say it is my favourite of the year so far, even surpassing the outstanding(if somewhat misunderstood) Rango.<br/><br/>What I loved most about Rio was its energy. Rio for me has more energy than any of the Ice Age(from the same team) movies, and its energy is truly infectious at that. Two reasons especially make it so. One is the writing, I wasn't expecting the writing to be this sharp, funny and witty, looking at some of the previous work the writer has penned, while the jokes are plentiful and come by thick and fast. The other is the soundtrack. It has a huge amount of authentic Brazilian flavour and just ripples with zest. I loved the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout, and further fun is to be had in the Busby Berkeley-style beginning and the truly spectacular Carnaeval finale."

","I don't know why this just doesn't sit well with me. It has everything going for it, a spectacular setting, better than average voice acting and a smooth and well told story.<br/><br/>Maybe, it is because after seeing about 10 or more of these animated tales, my standards are becoming too high. The story involving culture vs. nature has been told many times before and if you are going to tell it again, there has to be something more to it than that.<br/><br/>The characters are for the most part pleasant, except for the two sidekick birds, voiced by Will I Am and Jamie Foxx. Not that there is anything wrong with having two jive-talking characters in an animated movie, but it has been done to death. It is nothing against the two performers, who do quite well.<br/><br/>Normally, I am not a fan of animated musical numbers either, but luckily the songs here are snappy and doesn't take that much screen time. It is just that they are very similar to some I have seen in other animated features.<br/><br/>So, on the positive, this is the by far the best animation from Blue Sky I have seen yet. The plot, while not seen for the first time, moves at a snappy enough pace. There just wasn't any Wow! moments."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","0","31 August 2011"," Well-executed use of a tired formula
","Animated talking-animal films since the dawn of CGI have gotten much more prolific. Now that animals can be illustrated with ease and superb realism (namely in textures such as fur, feathers and scales), the supply can meet the demand and almost every major movie studio has either its own animation division or a relationship with an animation company. ""Rio"" is the product of Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios, the team behind the ""Ice Age"" franchise.<br/><br/>With animated films coming out in rampant fashion, originality has taken a hit. The formula? Pick a country, climate or segment of the animal kingdom and set the exact same story there. So what started as a ""fish-out-of-water"" tale has become a bird/dinosaur/penguin/African animal-out-of-water story. ""Rio"" is a visually beautiful film with a sweet story and humorous supporting characters, but it contains not one original feather in its coat other than the Brazilian backdrop.<br/><br/>""Rio"" tells the story of Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), a domesticated blue macaw that ended up in Moose Lake, Minn. in the care of a socially awkward bookworm named Linda (Leslie Mann). When an overenthusiastic ornithologist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) shows up claiming Blu is the last of his species and he would like to mate him with the lone remaining female back in Rio de Janeiro, Linda is hesitant but agrees.<br/><br/>Eisenberg's eccentricities fit Blu well and help sell the bird-out-of-cage story effectively. When he meets his mate-to-be, Jewel (Anne Hathaway), things couldn't go worse. She wants desperately to escape and return to be free in the Amazon. Blu and Jewel are kidnapped, however, by a man who intends to sell them. Chained together, the must of course learn to like each other in order to survive. Oh, and it would help if Blu knew how to fly.<br/><br/>The writing team makes a concerted effort to infuse the film with the free spirit of Rio's annual ""Carnival"" festival in hopes of adding a meaningful cultural element. It basically results in a few unexpected musical numbers and several overweight male characters dressing scantily, but it helps give ""Rio"" a distinctive flavor. <br/><br/>In my opinion, you go full musical or you don't go musical at all, but the concept works better than you'd expect. Even the typical ""statement of evil"" song from back in the Disney days makes an appearance here and is actually quite funny. Jemaine Clement voices the evil cockatoo Nigel, one of the more sinister and intriguing animated enemies you'll see in a film of this genre. He provides the necessary sense of danger for this all-too-typical adventure.<br/><br/>The character archetypes are the most bland: the out-of-its-element main character, the rebellious love interest, the wise mentor figure (George Lopez as Rafael the toucan), the tiny sidekicks (Jamie Foxx and will.i.am as Nico and Pedro) and the big lovable stupid acquaintance (Tracy Morgan as Luiz the bulldog). <br/><br/>Sure, there's a reason animated films keep coming back to those character types, but ""Rio"" uses them to an unoriginal end. The moral and themes are tired and not given any renewed attention. Do you think that Blu learns how to fly by the end? I even went so far as to try and guess a line of dialogue: ""Blu, you're flying!"" I would tell if you if I was right, but truth of the matter is ""Rio"" is still a light and enjoyable animated flick worth watching.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

Most might have heard her demonstrate her singing talent at the Academy Awards, but this movie is living proof that acting is not the only thing she's good at anymore.<br/><br/>After watching this movie for the first time in theaters and then seeing it again on its DVD release, Blue Sky has demonstrated that they can divert themselves away from their ""Ice Age"" franchise from time to time and deliver a marvelous new story filled with joy, sympathy, and quirks you can't help but follow along. Director Carlos Saldanha has given us a dose of what his hometown in Brazil is like and its tranquility (via CGI) is very engaging. Their research was done really well and hoping to see more of this again and again. For a non-Disney film, I'm giving Blue Sky a chance and saying that their team has pulled off - which perhaps looks like - THE BIRTH OF A NEW FRANCHISE!"

","CGI animated films have become a common genre in recent Hollywood, especially during the holidays. Among them comes a refreshing little film called 'Rio'. Yes, the story is formulaic and easy to predict but formula not necessarily need be a bad thing, especially when it's treated well. So what makes 'Rio' stand out? It is the animation, energy, humour and charming characters that keep the viewer highly entertained.<br/><br/>Most of the story is set in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro and the stunning animation so beautifully captures its essence with incredible detail and various colour. The detail in the characters and their expressions and movement is very well done. The visuals are very pleasing to the eyes.<br/><br/>The film has a very old Disney feel to it, with its charm and humour. It moves at a steady pace and there's plenty of energy. There are also several songs that appear at the right time and are delightfully visualized. Much of the humour is slapstick and there are also enough funny lines to maintain a balance.<br/><br/>The voice casting is brilliant. Eisenberg and Hathaway are very funny as the lead macaws and they are hilariously supported by Jaime Foxx, Will I Am and Tracy Morgan among others. I also liked that the two lead human characters weren't relegated to the background or given little attention. As such Rodrigo Santoro and Leslie Mann are great as the nerdy pair. I was only a little disappointed that comedy queens like Wanda Sykes and Jane Lynch were barely given more than one line.<br/><br/>'Rio' has a lot working in its favour: Humour, energy, colourful visuals, Rio de Janeiro.

However that's the only really big flaw, true some of the characters I didn't care about, and one of the songs is, well, stupid, but I can forgive those because I was having a good time.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the two leads, and the voice acting by Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway is really good. The villain's fun too, and has a really good back story, unfortunately the song he sings to describe it isn't. I enjoyed the humans, but if they weren't in the movie I wouldn't really care. And the comic reliefs were, actually funny.<br/><br/>The animation is absolutely gorgeous, where Rango has outstanding detail, Rio has so many colors, that it's a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>And the songs, are really good, save for the villains, my only problem, they're a little short."

","Rio is possibly one of the best animated films I have seen in a long time! I first saw this in the spring of 2011 when me and mum went down to the cinema in Crawley. The film was done by the same people who spawned the equally brilliant Ice age movies which I have seen too. the film was directed by Carlos Saldanha who did Ice Age 2+3. A lot of people say Saldanha can't direct as well as Chris Wedge (who directed the original Ice Age film) due to 2+3 getting a more mixed word of mouth than the first one, but what I have seen from Rio is amazing which shows that Saldanha knows his Brazillian stuff if not his cold sub-temperature skills. Overall Rio was good. The animation was colourful and cheerful, the characters were fun to watch, the joke's were funny and the voice acting was well.. good. If you like feel-good family films mu friend then this is the movie for you!"

","Rio is a decent tale of the bird Blu. It captures quite well the life of the endangered bird with the situation incorporated. Jesse Eisenber and Anne Hathaway have perfectly portrayed the character of Blu and Jewel through their voices. The movie is a colorful visual treat for kids with all the colorful exotic birds. Story-wise its quite simple but it flows smoothly throughout. Though its predictable but its enjoyable still as its not boring and steady paced with the 92 min running time. Coming to animation, its simply amazing. The lead Blu is the eye-catcher which is beautiful. What's missing is a good script. Still its fun to watch with some humor added in between and thus making it good for adults as well. Though it could have been better but still its great to enjoy with family."

","This movie is about a blue macaw who is the last male of his kind. He travels with his owner Linda to Rio where the last female blue macaw lives. Some of the main characters in the movie are Blu, Jewel, and Rafael. Rafael is a toucan played by George Lopez. One of the best lines in the movie is when Blu is trying to fly and Rafael says, ""Alright Blu, you're flying! Sort of. Not really."" That is so funny. George Lopez has also played in another movie that I really loved called Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2. He always knows how to get the audience laughing.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie is when Blu's owner Linda is waking up in the morning and is trying to turn her alarm off. When she thinks she has it off, all of a sudden she hears more loud noises and it turns out to be Blu! <br/><br/>Every movie has to have a bad guy and this move is no exception. There are poachers that steal lots of different kinds of birds as well as their mean pet cockatoo Nigel who causes a lot of trouble throughout the movie. He also enlists the help of a group of monkeys that turn out to be no help to him at all. Another great part of the movie is when the birds and monkeys fight! It was a great action scene and of course the birds won. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie for all ages because it's such a good movie. There aren't really any scary parts and I think all ages would like it. Go out and see it in theaters when it premieres!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Anthony Aranda, age 8, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic"

","I watched this movie on a lethargic Sunday night and must say that it was the perfect fashion to bring to an end an otherwise lousy day. In few words, Rio is a fantastically executed humorous flick packed with cute scenes and gorgeous animation. Though the movie was a bit obvious at times but the charming & highly amusing sequences don't let you take your eyes of the screen.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg's voice is amazingly immaculate for a bird and he does a great job playing the role of the domesticated exotic bird BLU, who doesn't know how to fly. And Anna Hathaway's voice was so sweet throughout the movie that I actually fell in love with the character JEWEL. NIGEL, their evil counterpart was well scripted and does present wickedness. Needless to say, Jemaine Clement did one heck of a job while lending his voice to the character.<br/><br/>The scenes with the goofy monkeys were outstanding on the level of clowning and were as good as the penguins of Madagascar. Moreover, the drooling amigo the birds find during the end was definitely the highpoint as far as the comic element in the movie is concerned.<br/><br/>Finally, the animation deserves an accolade as it was just magnificent and gorgeous. The movie is filled with vibrant colors and dazzling performances. I truly wish I had watched it in 3D but 2D is not so bad either, in fact it is pretty awesome!!!"
"mikealike","Null","0","0","9 May 2011"," The colours are only the painted ones
","The movie is a colourful one, but unfortunately not in a metaphoric manner. The only excitement remains in the shades of blue, red and so on taken from real life jungle birds. And it is watchable, one can give it that, but also forgettable.<br/><br/>The action is cliché-istic, the idea of fear of flight was used for penguins and reindeer, and the plot to make it fit for a parrot is a bit forced. The humans are the geeky boring figures that seem to come most handy to the scriptwriters lately. The bullied child, or the fat child, and the mature geek...haven't we had enough of that? It does transmit the idea of love, sort of, maybe even coin a tear on this subject to some more sensitive viewers, but bearing in mind that it is hardly a movie for adults, what is this intoxicating children with love stories that actually happen much later in life? Do not take this for a prude affirmation, but rather as one pointing out that new good ideas are hard to find, as it seems.<br/><br/>Plus, what could have saved the movie wasn't there. They placed everything in an exotic country, but the atmosphere is lacking. It is as if they read some tourist leaflets and put them into the picture. Let's throw in some smugglers figures, some famous statue, a busy local market and a beautiful rich residence area...that will do it! The samba was, as one character said, boring, because it felt like old and recycled. The carnival of Rio was all over the place, yet it did not seem to be ""there"". If they went cliché-istic, for example, why didn't the girl dance on top of the carnival cart, but came down and produced a stumbled ballet that went away almost unnoticed? The parrot (Blue - what a creative name, btw), was cute as a baby parrot, parrot-y as an adult and the humans dressed up as parrots were freaky:). <br/><br/>The aftertaste of this animation is that of a spineless one, but then, a lot of those have seemed to meet the ovation of the critics and most of the public in the last year, so nothing new here too. So far this year I liked Gnomeo and Juliet more that this."

","This is without a doubt the most predictable movie on earth, but i don't care, this is so cute. so adorable. and the animation is beautiful. this is truly a masterpiece. yes, its predictable (I could guess what they were gonna see) but it is so much fun!!! The movie focuses on Blu, the last male blue macaw who lives in moose lake with his nerdy owner Linda. he loves his life there, is pure domesticated, but cannot fly. He is wanted in Rio Di Janeiro (i cant spell it!) to mate with Jewel, the last female blue macaw. this is just good fun, teaches great life lessons, and the scenery of Rio is absolutely amazing especially the statue of Jesus standing on the island. I love the idea of the gliders are a way to way fly, that was beautifully done. the characters are great, George Lopez as the toucan, Jesse Esseinberg as Blu, Anne Hathaway as jewel, Luiz the dog is great, and the humans are nicely done. I also like how this film focuses on some poor life in Brazil but does not overdo it to make it scary for children. it focuses on animal trafficking, a huge problem in Brazil, and a main character named Fernando is a young boy who is an orphan and has no one to go to, lives on the streets, and turns to crime for money. but he is such a likable character and gets so much sympathy. I am 14 and laughed at this movie, the whole time.... okay it was hysterical. so did my best friend who i went to see it with. so all you haters who think this doesn't deserve a 7.4, back off, because it certainly does. worth a watch for sure!"

","'RIO': Two Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Another computer animated kids film from the director of 'ICE AGE' (and it's two sequels) Carlos Saldanha. This one tells the story of a Minnesota raised Macaw, who's afraid of flying, that's taken to Rio to mate with a female macaw in order to save their species. The film is written by Saldanha (who was born in Brazil) and six other writers and is said to be his ""dream project"". That's kind of sad considering the film isn't very good. It's beautiful to look at but it's also filled with cheap jokes and is rather boring and predictable. It should please kids but no one else.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg stars as the voice of Blu. Blu is a macaw who was born in Brazil but was captured, along with his family, by smugglers and shipped to Minnesota. The box that Blu was in fell off a shipping truck though and he was picked up by a small child named Linda, who named him. The movie then flashes forward 15 years when Blu is living with Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann) in a bookstore she owns. He still has not learned to fly but constantly attempts to teach himself. One day a Brazilian scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) comes to the door and asks to take Blu with him to Brazil in order to mate him with the last female macaw named Jewel (Anne Hathaway), in an attempt to save the species. Linda and Blu reluctantly go with Tulio to Brazil but once there Blu and Jewel are kidnapped by more smugglers.<br/><br/>I don't usually see most animated kids films in the theater (or at all for that matter) unless they really look appealing or have gotten rave reviews (usually both). This film got decent reviews from critics and fans (not great but decent) and it also has been huge at the box office so I thought I'd give it a try. The film reminded me why I don't see most animated kids films; they're a waste of time and money (if you see them in the theater). Sure the computer animation looks beautiful but that's not enough to keep my interest and with this film I really had a hard time staying interested. I found my mind drifting a lot after witnessing repeated silly jokes and a completely uninvolving string of events (which is the movie's excuse for a story). I like Jesse Eisenberg (he's another reason I thought I might like the movie) and he does decent voice work here but all the supporting comedic players are so tired and played out (including George Lopez, Wanda Sykes, Jamie Foxx and Will i Am). The movie just has nothing of any interest or entertainment value to offer anyone over the age of ten (other than good visuals) and a decent kids film should.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk"

","I am from Rio and the film shows exactly the beauty of the city, but, unfortunately, shows crimes in slums, children working with the criminals, etc. Although it is true, it is not good that a Brazilian story teller shows the problems of the city in a worldwide film like this. All cities have problems.<br/><br/>The film also shows that people here forget everything when carnival comes, or when there is a soccer game on TV.. In the film, a dentist is show in tiny clothes walking in the road, going to carnival, as if even the high class people forget everything during carnival time. That is not true. Most people in Rio do not like carnival and even soccer.<br/><br/>Besides, the film include a beautiful carnival act in avenue, but a little ""without sense"". Why the criminal had to be in the carnival act before getting away with the birds in a plane? The story is weak, not inventive, far from Pixar films. There are scenes similar to Ice Age, like the two birds that get in love falling in the air, as used in the Ice Age film."
"pontram","5","3","10","25 April 2011"," A Beautiful Lie
","First, Rio is nicely made with a scene I will never forget - the huge amounts of slime slobbering dog will always stay in my heart beneath another children's movie where it is all about funny vomiting. The slimy dog caused my body to ripple a few times, while the movie did not loose focus on slobbering for a small eternity. It's nice for me to see somebody with equal taste. <br/><br/>There are nice locations, nice colors, nice enemies, nice heroes, and even nice songs, which was a genuine surprise for me, as I usually hate musicals since my earliest youth. I don't need to recommend this movie to anyone, because it seems that already the whole world has watched it. And most people loved it, because it's lighthearted and funny.<br/><br/>And here we come to the amount of light hearts, which I do equal with selfishness (of the seller). When I watched Rio with my children, my son (18yrs) mentioned the high criminal rate in Rio, one of the highest in the world, and I whispered back that he will not see anything of this in the movie except in a polished way that doesn't exist in reality.<br/><br/>I have the archaic theory that watching a movie on the big screen should include a few educational aspects. That may correspond with amounts of money I spend at the cinema (here about 90 incl. junk food for two adults and three children).<br/><br/>In this case lessons one could learn are, that people will not look behind nice illusions even if they know the truth first-hand, as it should be with the Brazil-originated director. And that the nicer and more excited a picture is shown, the more it should be questioned.<br/><br/>In the town Rio of today's days there are private militia organizations, formed by members of the police, fighting against criminal syndicates consisting of up to 5000 heavy-armed men. While the police itself is completely absent in large areas of the town, the militia constantly pushes the criminals out of their range of influence, but demands also a fee from the citizens. The crime detection rate is near 1%. <br/><br/>I know that the Brazilians have an admirable sense for living - or designing - an exciting life(style), the carnival, the Copacabana... But also most Brazilians are poor, uninsured, live between junk, have no future...The mega-cities like Rio may look modern to us, but living in the Favelas is not an easy thing. 2008 in Rio, until June, about 4000 persons died alone by gunshots.<br/><br/>I understand it's not easy to make a pure fun movie for children with all the bad things that exist around. But who would make a movie about the wonderful live in Japan nearby Fukushima without even mentioning its dangers ? - I would say, only a cynical director on a money hunt could do that.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, when it comes to Disney animations or children movies in general, my concerns should be all the same. Watching an idyllic world always needs some parental correctional afterwords. Couldn't i let fun simply be fun ? - No, not when it's hiding something dirty."

If you ask this to yourself, you wont get a convincing answer, and that is what sums up the entire experience. The animation part was fairly good (ice age for me was better though) but not up-to the level set by recent competitors like Tangled and How to Train Your Dragon; and very pale compared to Cars / Happy feet. <br/><br/>It was not an ""Ok"" movie, BUT a ""Good"" movie, BUT definitively could have been a 'Great' one. This movie came from the makers of ice age and that was written all over the entire 2 hour slot of viewing experience. Isn't that good?.. If course it is but when the Ice age type 'fun' epic is twisted to include a 'message' (bird conservation) oriented story ; it somewhat is not able to do justice to either. Happy feet on the other end could be a direct comparison where the confluence was superb. Rio on that count, sorry to say, wasn't. <br/><br/>On the positive side, it has the inherent carnival vibrancy with pulsating, colorful, exuberant, locales. The details of the city are all there, but so is the big picture (you know, everything that really matters, along with wide panoramas of Rio by night, of a crowded beach, of a sunset). Jesse (facebook) Eisenberg has done a great voice-over job. <br/><br/>This is where Disney / Pixar scores over others as they have sure plots but with a touch of maturity. Rio has the energy but lacks the ripeness. The movie ride is somewhat bumpy without the ""Wow!"" factor so prevalent in Disney / Pixar movies.

","The 'Ice Age' series may be wildly popular but it has done little to bestow prestige upon Blue Sky Studios, whose only other notable credits include the under appreciated 'Robots' (2005) and the more recent 'Horton Hears A Who', which has remained in the public consciousness in anticipation of the release of 'The Lorax' (2012). For this reason I was, somewhat unfairly, not anticipating great things from 'Rio', a polar opposite of Sid, Manny and Diego's prehistoric adventures that takes place in the Brazilian city. <br/><br/>A dazzling, bold palette characterises the feature, bringing outstanding visuals to each and every frame, whether it be taking place in the natural beauty of the jungle or the dull city slums, evoking a childlike sense of awe for bright, block colours. It is a firm reminder that not all animation studios need render their work in breathtaking detail when there are far simpler (and instantly better looking) tools at their disposal.<br/><br/>However much the main storyline is a by the numbers retread of similar works which feature a rare animal breed targeted by opportunist crime lords, there is a unique spin in pitting the domesticated blue macaw (aptly named Blu) against the wild Jewel, resulting in a hilarious dynamic that almost defies the inevitable direction their character development takes. Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway lead the superb voice talent, featuring a stellar billing in which even the polarising 'Black Eyed Peas' star will.i.am proves he is an appropriate addition. Blue Sky displayed excellent restraint in their celebrity casting, and is one of several aspects that give 'Rio' a great sense of authenticity in its well-trained Brazilian accents, alongside the accurate visuals.<br/><br/>A constantly witty script, funny jokes and a lively soundtrack make 'Rio' a memorable family movie and a deserving breakout hit for its studio, who have given themselves a fine opportunity to establish another successful franchise.<br/><br/>9/10"
"badoli","6","1","2","23 September 2011"," It's okay. Not more.
","A fun movie for the whole family. Just don't expect anything similar to the epic emotional drama that was the first ""Ice Age"". The whole movie goes lightly its way without ever really challenging its protagonists. People might say ""come on, this is a kid's movie"". Those people i would again refer to Ice Age.<br/><br/>This movie rather draws a strict black/white scheme. Good guys against bad guys. Great for kids and probably their parents. If you longing for some good character portrait though, a story with surprises, humor outside of an afternoon-sitcom-level and maybe just a little bit of drama you're left all alone in the jungle. This is basically a Disney movie, sticking to that proved formula far to close to let some creativity in.<br/><br/>The sad fact is that by now 3D-animated movies have gone the same way as traditional cell-shading did in the 80ies. While few companies like Pixar still maintain an amazing level of storytelling within the medium, most animation studios refrain from complex and hence risky screenplays. The result are mediocre, but fun movies like this one.<br/><br/>If you want to see what nowadays can be done with traditional animation, you'll have to turn to Japan. Western studios have lost the magic."

","Before watching (Rio), someone told me that ""The Latino music of it is so refreshing"". Well, it was maybe another way to say that the soundtrack is the good thing about it!<br/><br/>The main storyline seems so similar to Pixar's not too far hit (Finding Nemo - 2003); with parrot instead of fish, geeky owner instead of afraid father, and Rio instead of the sea. But of course on this scale (Finding Nimo) prevails with more unique characters and more dazzling image.<br/><br/>The songs aren't touchy or beautiful enough; I hated the too dirty lyrics of the evil bird's song! And basically how come that everybody sings except the leads; whether the human or the flying ones, why it's Lionel Richie to undertake the job every time?! Furthermore, didn't you notice how almost every possible emotional climax, like the one over the trolley, isn't complete with always something to disappoint it?!<br/><br/>The designing of the characters didn't interest me at all. For clear example look at the female parrot; it has nothing to be distinct or remembered by. The slimy bulldog was disgusting; but let's put that one in the corner of ""accepting the other"". The rest is less than important, I couldn't stand most of the human characters; look how the lab's fat guard, who went to dance, looks exactly like the evil man's fat henchman!<br/><br/>Some characters appear to disappear, like the husband / father / guide. I know it's kind of road movies' basis, but the thing is that character wasn't written good or satisfying in the first place. I was provoked by the moment in which the electricity, of the whole city, goes out because one pole in one slum got broken?!<br/><br/>While there are many stars behind the mike this time, Jesse Eisenberg and Leslie Mann are the only ones who made their job work. The climax didn't sound original; I have seen that plane situation which gets opened in the sky, as a climax, in previous other movies like The Living Daylights (1987) and Chain Reaction (1996).<br/><br/>What keep it together are the fast pace, the smooth colors, the flashy lights, the lovely backgrounds, and the nice music. The parallel 2 love stories are well done, with the same slow-motion magical intro for the girl capturing the boy's attention shown twice; one for the birds and one for the humans. Few moments of graphic proved to be exceptional; like the sad, rather collapsed, body language of (Linda)'s character while her bird is being taken into the plane near the end. And the 2 dancing sequences, of the start and the end, are so good they deserve another movie!<br/><br/>All in all, one look to this Twentieth Century Fox Animation's production shows how and why other, cleverer, studios, like Disney or Pixar, spend more time on things like script or songs.<br/><br/>(Rio) is a celebration of freedom, colors and Latino music. Fun to watch, but not for many times, because - really - I have seen it before, many times, and better too!"

","Whenever I decide to do a review about a movie, I always like to look at the ""Loved it"" reviews, and the ""Hated it"" reviews. The fact that I saw 43 ""Hated it"" reviews astonished me. However, most of them said almost the exact same thing, ""Cliche... Predictable... Unoriginal..."" Anyone who reads these reviews will undoubtedly expect the bad things, but now to give my point of view and hopefully make up some people's minds about this movie. First off, when I first saw this movie, I noticed the vivid color and amazing scenery portrayed right off the bat.<br/><br/>In the beginning you are introduced to Rio in it's natural habitat and then you are introduced to Blu, who is captured and shipped to a town in Minnesota. He is found by a young girl, Linda, and she vows to take care of the little Blue Macaw. This is where the true adventure begins because it shows Blu's normal life, and in a flash Blu is traveling towards a 'foreign' land known as Rio De Janeiro. Linda is running her book store as usual, when a man approaches her and after much convincing and begging he gets Linda to consider his proposal to keep Blu's species alive.<br/><br/>Once I saw how Rio is portrayed I was stunned and completely awestruck at the detail, roads, and beaches; almost identical to the actual city itself. As said in the beginning of the movie, Blu is the last male of his kind and just recently they have found the last female of his kind as well. As the usual love story goes the relationship between Blu and his new female counterpart, Jewel, is rough, but through an extraordinary adventure of meeting two hip-hop birds, a very helpful toucan, and a drooling dog, Jewel and Blu experience Samba, hang- gliding, and riding on a trolley at sunset.<br/><br/>There is only one bad thing that I could find with this movie, and that is when the adventure is over, I didn't want it to end. With this movie you get a connection with the characters and feel as if you were actually on the journey. All the way to the last credit in the movie I couldn't wait to watch the movie the next night. There were absolutely no flaws and the music was very catchy and mesmerizing, especially the samba song. <br/><br/>However, if someone were to ask me if there should be a ""Rio 2"", I would have to say no. This movie could not have been any more perfect. I feel a sequel would only end with people having a bad taste in their mouth, but I could be wrong. I would see the sequel, and who knows maybe I would be just as surprised as the first time I saw this movie.

","The plot itself may not seem very interesting. But believe me, the way it is executed will make you feel good, sad, like dancing, and even laughing out loud. <br/><br/>The animations are fantastic. The soundtrack is beyond great. Plenty of catchy tunes. The humor is witty but fits perfect with all audiences.<br/><br/>The situations not only deal about the adventures of two birds, no, it also deals with Brazilian way of living, favelas, love, demonstrating guts in the right moment, and more.<br/><br/>The 3D is also very good although not necessary.<br/><br/>I can say that this is the best animated feature of the year so far. Give it a chance. It's not predictable, in fact, it's very creative. Feels like fresh air for cinema."

","I LOVED this movie. Im not really an expert on movie critique, I'm just a normal guy and i watched this movie with my little cousin. I thought it will be just another cartoon but after the movie ended the first thing i did was check google if there will be a sequel. I cant really explain why but i really liked it. Anne Hathaway has beautiful voice and Jesse Eisenberg is perfect for the role of Blu. The movie is original and funny. I saw some reviews saying that it sucked and that it is only for children. I STRONGLY disagree. It is far from bad and you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. I did and i usually watch war movies. Anyway i really recommend this movie."

","Hi all :)<br/><br/>Rio is truly one of the most inspiring Animation movies I have seen for quite a while. The scripts, graphics rendering and pace are about perfect. Twists&turns along with a number of violence-free jokes make this movie a magic treat for your kids.<br/><br/>I love how the unfortunate incident allows Blu to stand up for himself and fight. Many conversations between Blu+Jewel, Linda+Tulio are so well-written that it makes me wonder how different perspectives on something can be so fascinating as long as you are open-minded albeit their stubbornness and attitude. <br/><br/>To conclude: A single-sided coin is gradually flipped as we move along the movie and the characters interact with one another to make audience believe that differences can make us live in PEACE.<br/><br/>Great job again Blue Sky Studios :)"

","Brilliant with color, movement, action, drama, even some horror and a lot of fun, parades, joy, ecstasy, running away and running after, and even a lot of flying up and down especially for the poor Blue who does not know how to fly, which is a shame for a parrot.<br/><br/>A little of depth about these exotic birds that are endangered by the smugglers who capture them away to sell them in the big cities of the developed countries, here the USA, and even Minnesota. But no real police work against the smugglers, just a union of the victims and bird lovers to just prevent them from succeeding, in other words to make them fail.<br/><br/>The most astonishing side of the film is the luminous vision of Rio de Janeiro and its carnival. If you have never been there go next week and spend some time on the beaches and try to go to the top of the big sugarloaf mountains and meet the Christ standing at the top of the tallest of them. That's a perfect strategy for an emergent country today that has been the target of the latest but not last crisis and that has been able to get out of it even stronger than before. Conquer the world not only with money, certainly not with weapons and bombs, but with culture. That's how the Americans did it after World War II.<br/><br/>That's a lesson to us, in the developed countries too. We take for granted that our languages and our cultures are dominant, and they are not. In a few years a language emerges as more important than ours and an emerging culture becomes a top attraction and agent at the global level.<br/><br/>This is a simple animated film for children who are going to love the monkeys and the birds, but they are also going to be nicely demonstrated that you do not need to be white or black, that all shades of grey are great, and that birds are so much better off and nicer in their natural environment. So do not hesitate and take your children – and grandchildren – to see it and buy the DVD. The music is great and will teach you how to shake your arms and legs and to move your bottom in rhythm, I mean you the adults and parents and grandparents because the children of today have it in their genes.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","I was excited to see this film because the teasers seemed funny enough and I heard that the people who made this film were the same guys who produced the awesome ""Ice Age"" movie. But after getting the tickets, I began feeling worried and guilty. ""What if the movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be? What if the money that we used wasn't worth it? What if I've just wasted my afternoon by seeing this film? What if this is just another movie meant for children?"" But all those thoughts stopped as the opening credits began and the screen filled with a great landscape view and then suddenly, birds of every color bursted into a lively song.<br/><br/>Blu, a Mackaw, is taken as a pet while he is still young, by a sweet girl named Linda. As years pass, Linda and Blu form a special friendship where they both trust,love and care for the other. The only problem is that Blu, a bird, can't seem to fly. One day, Tulio, an ornithologist, informs Linda that her pet seems to be the last male of his kind. He asks Linda if Blu and herself could be flown to Brazil so that Blu could mate with the last female of their kind. Linda, after some hesitation, agrees. However, things don't quite go as planned. Jewel, the last female Macaw, doesn't take well to Blu and because of some unfortunate circumstances, both Blu and Jewel get lost in the wild chained up together.<br/><br/>The humor was not bad. I actually found myself laughing, which I didn't really expect. Some of the songs in the movie annoyed me. I think this movie would have been a lot better if it didn't have a musical-like feel. The ending of the movie is very predictable, but even so, that doesn't mean that you won't feel that short euphoria that all happy endings give us.<br/><br/>The animation is great. The background and the settings were just brilliant. So much color! It made me think that Rio does seems like a grand place to take a vacation in. The parade scene made me appreciate Rio's beauty more, too! If I could rewatch one scene from the movie, I'd pick the parade scene. There's just so much going on and it's a pretty cool scene. If ever you decide to watch this movie, be on a look out for that scene since it really is beautiful and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Viewed on: April 10, 2011"
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","1","6","1 May 2011"," Rio is a film that comfortably perches on autopilot
","Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a talking baby macaw, who is taken from his habitat in Brazil and smuggled in a box to the United States. Falling off the back of a truck, he is given a home by Linda (Leslie Mann). They grow up together in a domestic environment and by copying her he never learns how to fly properly. Years later and a scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) finds Linda working in a bookstore. He tells her that Blu is one the last of his kind and that he should be taken back to Brazil briefly so that he can mate with a female macaw. Linda reluctantly agrees. When placed in a cage Blu meets Jewel (Anne Hathaway), a feisty bird who is intent of escaping and is impatient to Blu's dithering. When the breeding facility is raided by smugglers, Blu and Jewel are caught and chained together in a cage. They have to learn to work together so that they can escape and find Blu's owner again. <br/><br/>Rio is a film that comfortably perches on autopilot. It's a Twentieth Century Fox film that ticks all the boxes for a modern day animated picture. It's occasionally funny, visually inspired and harmlessly entertaining. But watching this we remember how spoilt we are by Pixar's consistency. First-rate animation can no longer compensate for second- string narratives. Small children will be unfazed but adults will find Rio's screenplay, credited to four people no less, to be pretty mechanical. The plot is very loosely tied together through some slapstick chase sequences and equally exaggerated human characters. The humans here lack the deep emotional resonance that we've come to appreciate in recent years. They're quirky but superfluous compared to the film's cute animal characters. The slapstick comedy too will also seem dated and immature to anyone but very small children. The film is quietly funny when it's firing off its sometimes witty dialogue. Eisenberg is a very obvious choice for a neurotic but it's a part he's accustomed to. He finds a few laughs in his enthusiastic delivery of Blue's hysteria. And as expected, the film is handsomely animated. Brazil is an inspired location because of its life and its vibrancy. Rio capitalises on this through its joyous use of primary colours, which enrich the environments and characters on the screen. I enjoyed the subtle touches of animation too, like the expression on Blu's face when he mimes the words to a Lionel Richie song. On whether to see the film is 3D or not: leave the glasses at home. The film is barely ninety minutes long and any additional depth to screen is largely unnoticeable. It's not worth paying the extra dollars. The picture quality would be even more colourful in 2D, without the glasses absorbing the light. While Rio is a film that does little wrong, it does remind us how high the bar has been raised for animation. Given the limited use of the 3D, there would be little lost in saving this for a rental."
"puffball97","5","1","6","24 April 2011"," An amiable outing
","""Rio"" is not terrible like more recent Dreamworks movies where the animated movies always have to depend on star power and pop culture references for laughs, but their stories aren't as convincing as those of Pixar movies. Like most spring movies, ""Rio"" is fine for an outing, but it is not the kind of movie I would put in my DVD collection.<br/><br/>The best thing about Rio is the colors, the realistic animated backgrounds of the South American tourist city which also includes the slums as well as the beaches we love to see ourselves at, and a few good musical numbers, including the song that goes ""I Want to Party, I Want to Samba,"" by Jamie Foxx and Will I Am, who play two birds held in captivity who entertain the other birds. Otherwise, I would say that the story is formulaic and predictable, and we've seen many of these movies before.<br/><br/>The story goes that Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg from the brilliant ""The Social Network"") a nerdy domesticated macaw dropped off in Minnesota from a truck on the streets, enjoys his companionship with his owner Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann), and has never learned to fly. A Brazilian ornithologist named Tulio (voiced by Rodrigo Santoro) comes to town and wants to bring Blu back to Brazil to mate with the other remaining macaw from the country, the independent Jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway). They get down there during Carnaval season, Blu meets Jewel, but sure enough, they are kidnapped by nasty bird smugglers, but make escapes to various parts of the city. It always appears that villains steal the show in otherwise middle-of-the-road movies, and that villain is the smugglers' cockatoo pet Nigel (voiced by Jemaine Clement, who does the best work), who gets more into the action and smuggling than the humans themselves.<br/><br/>Linda and Blu are separated from two-thirds of the movie. She and Tulio are looking for Blu, who is now with the smugglers and Jewel. During the adventures, there are friends who aid in returning Blu to his owner, such as a funny bulldog named Luis (voiced by comedian Tracy Morgan), a wisecracking toucan named Rafael (voiced by comedian George Lopez), and two rapping birds played by Will I Am and Jamie Foxx. Recently they performed that party/samba number on ""American Idol,"" and they did better on that show than in the movie. Then there are ugly, thieving monkeys who Nigel enlists the aid of to find Blu and Jewel in their escapes.<br/><br/>As stated earlier the story follows the formula of most animated movies. Couple meets cute. Couple gets into danger. Then then male bird returns to its owner, and marries the female, producing their own birds. Villains lose and get locked up. Note that Rodrigo, a poor kid, reluctantly works for the smugglers, and would rather be with Linda and Tulio, as he searches back for the macaws. He just kidnaps the macaws just for the money, but the smugglers won't let him get away with that.<br/><br/>In my years of seeing animated movies, I have to say that the Pixar movies are by far the best. They don't depend on clichés and formulas, like Rio. Even the first Ice Age Movie, made by the makers of ""Rio"" didn't depend on these elements. They don't look for star power and pop culture, like Dreamworks does all of the time in recent years. However, ""Rio"" goes slightly above Dreamworks, but still falls into the predictability cliché department. The backgrounds and colors make up the most for the movie, but the plot and character development is just about everything we have seen before as well. Fine for an outing, but not one of the best movies I have seen."
"colinrgeorge","5","1","7","19 April 2011"," Rio de Generic
","""Rio"" is one for the kiddies, so you'll have to forgive this childless twenty-something for feeling at odds with the target audience. The theater was stuffed with tykes with mouths agape—whispering, screaming, and coughing. I have no idea if that means they were enjoying it. From an adult perspective, this anthropomorphic epic isn't necessarily a painful endurance test, but unlike Nickelodeon's ""Rango,"" there isn't a single compelling reason to recommend it to anyone over the age of 12.<br/><br/>The voice cast is unsurprisingly stacked with actors in vogue looking to score an easy paycheck. Jesse Eisenberg channels his innermost neurosis as Blu, our fine, feathered protagonist with a fear of flying. Leslie Mann plays his owner Linda, a bookish Minnesotan who is coerced into schlepping her beloved pet to the eponymous South American city in order to have him (ahem) mate with the only known female of his kind.<br/><br/>If you've ever been subjected to children's programming, you may know the cadence that most of the cast adopts. Sentences delicately spill from animated lips with careful annunciation of each syllable, lest anyone fall behind. There are a couple of legitimately impressive performances, including Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" fame as a conniving cockatoo, and Tracy Morgan from ""30 Rock"" as an oversensitive bulldog. Rounded out by the likes of Will i Am and Jamie Foxx, ""Rio"" draws from a pool of veteran vocal performers.<br/><br/>And if the above talent didn't tip you off, I regretfully inform you that ""Rio"" fancies itself a musical. Doubtless spurred by the success of ""Happy Feet,"" every so often the characters break into exuberant song, which is even more grating than their unhurried dialogue.<br/><br/>The archetypical adventure plays out predictably. Blu doesn't exactly hit it off with Jewel (Anne Hathaway), his undomesticated mate—but the two are birdnapped and find love as they find their way home together. Granted, it's a proved template, but to use the oeuvre of Pixar as a counter-point, there's plenty of wiggle-room to establish identity within the stringent confines of a narrative 'sure thing.' Even when Pixar isn't pushing boundaries, its creative shepherds generally recognize the chasm that separates the kiddie crowd from general audience.<br/><br/>Not that there's anything wrong with catering a cartoon to children, but even under those auspices, I can only recommend ""Rio"" to, what, 15% of the population? Probably none of whom are reading this review. Parents have my condolences if they're dragged to this utterly uninteresting animated flick, though history is fraught with worse cinematic prison sentences.<br/><br/>It's hard to outright hate ""Rio"" given that I am almost two decades the elder of its target audience, and childless to boot. Thus, my window into its appeal is either long-since closed or not-yet open. As a fan of animation, however, I can safely assert that grown ups need not apply. If readymade heartstring pluckers like lost pets and orphans get you all gooey-eyed, maybe ""Rio"" will speak to you—but my sense is that most of us are calloused to such obvious emotional exploitation.<br/><br/>As for the twelve and unders—their reaction was tough to gauge amid the chorus of whispers, shrieks, and hacking coughs. They all pretty much sat still and watched the damn movie. That must count for something."
"VikiLauda","8","0","1","12 May 2019"," My Parrots LOVE this!!
","First off I must say ""Rio"" is highly entertaining, imaginative & overall it is FUN! I have an adopted pair of Plum Head parakeets, & when I first watched this film on a Sunday afternnon on tv, my birds were having a very loud argument (screeching fit) but just 10 minutes in they were silent with their eyes glued to the TV, actually watching it, so I bought the DVD & if I must go out, I put this film on to entertain them! The research into how parrots act & move was done very well ( I have rescued parrots all my life) & very acurate. For instance when Blu is angry in one scene his tail feathers are splayed wide. But I did find it sad that said research failed when it came to birds diet, as chocolate is deadly poison to birds.<br/><br/>The character development is good, there is a slight back story & there are even some terrific one liners like ""Your burgled baubles bore me"" which gave me a giggle. All the voice acting is excellent but I feel the villan development was lacking slightly. Now in this present mass media climate of PC cultural overload in most movies pushing a harmful socialist agenda, the message in Rio is one I agree strongly with, which is parrot conservation & blue Macaws are on the edge of extinction & this movie highlights what is a very real struggle to save the blue Macaws In Rio its presented, tactfully wrapped in an entertaining story, which I really enjoyed. I feel people of all ages will enjoy this movie"

","Not funny, not particularly ""fun"", the story and characters aren't interesting and are rather annoying. There is also a rarity of great key scenes of animation or visuals, for example there is one flying and panorama scene (as one should expect) in the middle which neither leaves much of an impression nor is representative of the rest. Most of the dialogue nad character inateraction is really just average babble and there is lack of mercy in terms of music, especially given that none of the music is any good.

","Fly Love. Fly Rio. The same flying tale told charmingly.<br/><br/>Yes, they seem to be inspired by PIXAR in animation and content too. PIXAR uses toys, cars, rats, monsters and these folks used birds. The content is simple, a bird has to find her home and has to get what it was deprived of, and that is it's flight. Not revealing too much of a story here but yes, it's worth a trip and I am sure that for most part we will be laughing on gags that we have seen earlier. What I think, they did is they took all the famous acts amalgamated them well and the concoction they ensured that was prepared was sweet.<br/><br/>Like one scene, where when the guy tries to drive a bike, he hits the wall and fell off while the girl starts it they fly in the air. A few scenes like the one in which Blue (our protagonist) reads books on how to fly and then prepares itself to takeoff creating a runway as if its an airplane. All these bring out laughs and make us happy. So surely this can be taken a ride for such moments that are many.<br/><br/>There is nothing as such jaw dropping or mind boggling in this animated film and its devoid of any surprise too with a pretty predictable storyline. Having said that, its surely watchable for its lovable characters and the wit and the charm (charm is subjective here, I found it charming and loving but others may find something else). The animation expectedly was top class and one scene in which the two birds go through Rio on a glider is where it brings in a 3D element.<br/><br/>Song, I loved is Fly Love and for this as a director, one needs a good vision.<br/><br/>Note : - I watched this is in Spanish without even subtitles so not sure what each character told each other exactly, but I could easily make out what was going through even then.

"weezeralfalfa","9","0","1","8 May 2013"," Very entertaining, colorful, if racist, nerds + birds vs. poachers + vengeful cockatoo.
","Colorful, fun, if predictable, animation film. Has two major themes: the well-trodden 'The Little Engine that Could' theme, as relates to housebound macaw Blu, suddenly forced to prepare to survive in his native jungle, and the theme that wild animals are best left alone in their natural habitat(or perhaps a large aviary), instead of serving as confined companions or trophies for people.<br/><br/>The NAACP refuses to sanction TV reruns of the popular '50s ""Amos and Andy"" series, because it routinely depicts African Americans as lazy bumbling dimwits, inept crooks, or screaming shrews. Well, they have good reason to object to the characterizations in this film too. The two lead 'good guys' are clearly lily white: one Brazilian, the other from snowy small town MN, USA. They are both very introverted nerds, whose private or professional lives are dominated by their bird friends. They are initially at odds over whether Linda should bring Blu to Rio to mate with Jewel, the only known female of his species, caged by ornithologist Tulio. When this parrot pair is stolen by a gang of poachers and thieves for shipment to other countries, their relationship is further strained, until they decide to work together to recover the parrots. This mission, along with their growing friendship with street urchin Fernando, who stole their parrots for the poacher gang, then regretted his action, serves to cement their positive relationship(Actually, their efforts prove irrelevant to the 2 escapes of the parrots).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Blu is having problems relating to his would-be mate, who has the great advantage of having lived in the jungle until recently. Blu proves a clumsy pessimistic wimp, who has no idea how to favorably impress confident Jewel, despite some coaching by other birds, mainly the street or jungle-wise Pedro and Rafael. Blu continues to complain that he can't fly far, thus has no chance to survive in the wild, where Jewel is determined to return to, if they escape. He doesn't learn that he can fly far until he must, to save himself and Jewel, with a hurt wing, from drowning, after engineering their escape. In reality, pet birds often cannot fly far because their flight feathers have been clipped, as well as the relative lack of wing muscle exercise. The poachers should have clipped their wings(if Tulio hadn't), should they escape.<br/><br/>All the poachers clearly are partial or full African Americans, thus reinforcing stereotypes. Except for the boss, Marcel, they are characterized as lazy dimwits, magnitudes dumber than Nigel, Narcel's eagle-like sulphur-crested cockatoo henchman. Nigel is native to Australia, and speaks with a British accent. He joined the poachers because he wants to extract revenge on the colorful Brazilian birds, because one of them replaced him as the star of a Brazilian TV show. Thus, he acts as a Trogan horse, feigning abuse, to be included in Tulio's collection of confiscated, sick, or otherwise collected birds. He overpowers Tulio's night watchman, paving the way for Fernando to steal Blu and Jewel, then continues to play a critical role in the periodic capture of these prizes. His downing of the poacher's plane, by being pulled into the propeller, should have cut him to piece. But we see him later, much ruffled, but alive.<br/><br/>The gang of mischievous white-eared marmosets can be taken as a stand in for a street urchin pick pocket gang. <br/><br/>The plot actually has a relevant basis. Blu and Jewel have the coloring of Spix's Macaw, which hasn't been seen in the wild since 2000, mostly because of habitat destruction. It's being raised in captive breeding programs, like Tulio planned. Unlike the 'born-free' bias in the film, which no doubt appeals to many identifying audience members, you wouldn't want to release the last breeding pair of a species into the wild, where they are subject to predation and poaching. Blame it on Jewel's misguided refusal to accept confinement.<br/><br/>The lead male/female toucan pair, as colored, are actually members of two distinct species. Unlike these animations, real parrots and toucans have 4, not 3, toes: 2 front and 2 back. Pedro is supposed to be a red- crested cardinal, but his color pattern and extreme obesity make him look like a blend of scarlet tanager, pigeon and red cardinal.<br/><br/>It's not until the ending credits that we learn that Blu and Jewel have 3 chicks, and that Tulio, Linda, and Fernando appear to have formed a family. <br/><br/>In 2012, after this film was released, the animation ""The Pirates"" was released. It has a similar theme of rescuing a virtually extinct bird species(Dodo) from the clutches of an evil uncaring person. Unfortunately, the Dodo has no mate to perpetuate the species, and the naturalist(Darwin) ends up still frustrated in finding a woman who will love him. In those respects, it is less satisfying than this film."

I also like the part with the celebrity actors/musician like Will.I.Am as the voice actors. <br/><br/>PS:10/10, This is in my top favorite anime with Mr. Fantastic Fox."

","From the creators of Ice Age and Robots, I saw the clips and trailers for this computer-animated film and was certainly interested in giving it a go, especially after hearing some positive opinions from sources. Basically, in Rio De Janeiro, a baby Spix's Macaw was captured by dealers and smuggled into the United States of America, but a minor accident causes with the truck transporting his box, and he is found by a little girl in Moose Lake, Minnesota. Fifteen years later the girl has grown up to be woman and book shop owner Linda (Leslie Mann), and the macaw has grown up, named Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) he has been raised with love and in a comfortable home he is a domesticated and intelligent bird, but he has not learnt to fly. One day out of the blue, Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) the clumsy Brazilian ornithologist comes into the shop and knows that Blu may be the last male of his kind left in the world, so he is suggesting to Linda that he should mate with the female macaw he has in Rio De Janeiro. Linda eventually agrees it is probably the best thing to do to save the beautiful species of bird, she and Blu travel with Tulio to Rio De Janeiro, and the bird does meet the female of his species, Jewel (Anne Hathaway), but in the large cage she is more interested in escaping rather than getting to know him. During their escape attempt from the institute Blu and Jewel are stolen by a pair of smugglers and taken to a place for many rare and valuable birds in a small warehouse in the slums of the country. Blu and Jewel manage to escape, even with chains on their feet keeping them together, and they befriend some of the birds on the outside in the paradise surroundings who they want to help them break their chains. The only thing stopping the smugglers trying to find the birds before Linda and Tulio can find them is the big Rio Carnival that is going on in the city, so they send their trusted evil cockatoo bird Nigel (Jemaine Clement) to find them and bring them back. On their journey to break their chains they have many adventures and have fun dancing the samba and bossa nova, Nico the yellow canary with a green and purple striped bottle cap as a hat (Jamie Foxx) and Pedro the rapping red-crested cardinal (will.i.am), Luiz the bulldog (Tracy Morgan) and Rafael the toco toucan (George Lopez), and they are slowly developing feelings. Blu and Jewel do have their chains broken, and obviously there is the point when there is a separation due to an argument or events or whatever, but they are eventually reunited. In the end all the characters end up in the middle of the Carnival, Blu and Jewel are brought back together, Linda and Tulio find them, and the villains and Nigel get what they deserve, so it is a good ending. Also starring Jake T. Austin as Fernando, Wanda Sykes as Chloe the Goose and Jane Lynch as Alice the Other Goose. Eisenberg and Hathaway are good choices for the two leading blue macaw birds that initially do not see eye to eye but eventually find their hearts, and the other voices in the cast, especially Foxx and will.i.am with their rapping and street wise antics, are great fun. The film looks really good with the use of bright vibrant colours for the sights of Rio De Janeiro, the musical moments are great fun to listen to alongside watching the dance sequences, and the effects to take you on the fun filled journey are great, it is a good fun animated comedy adventure for all the family. Very good!"

","Anyone who has ever been fortunate enough to have spent part of their life with a feathered friend, be they parakeet or macaw or pigeon, will be glad they saw this movie. RIO has it ALL - loath-able villains and lovable heroes. My only strike against this movie is the musical score is sorely lacking. They should have brought in Selena Gomez for the soundtrack. Despite this, RIO still rates a 10 from me. It made me laugh and it made me cry - isn't that what you want in a movie? RIO will also capture your heart if you are an 8 year old at heart, trapped in a much older body, such as myself. RIO belongs right next to TOY STORY in the pantheon of best animated motion pictures of all time."

","Rio is one of the best animation of 2011. You can see they put too much effort to create a harmonic animation like this. The characters , the voices, the colors, the dances was original, It really puts a smile on your face during and after you watch it. The story flows well, never goes down , very well imagined characters , amazing colors , It is far better than most of the Hollywood animations. It is not a ordinary animation.

","Rio is a very cute kids movie. I did think it was a little slow at times for the audience who it is attracting. I brought my 7 and 3 year old daughters they liked it but they were ready to jet from the theater as soon as it was over. The animation and story line are great. The music and characters were fun. The writers of kids movies need to consider the attention span of children, I have thought this about a few other movies as well. It's not so much about the time but how quick the story is moving and also if a kid can't follow it they loose interest. My children enjoy movies but their boredom while watching this one let me know it is not on their list of favorites. I on the other hand did enjoy it and would happily watch it again but I don't think it is one we will purchase."

","Anyone who gives this movie a bad review is looking way too much into a movie made for kids! This movie really made me and the group of adults I watched it with(and we are really not a group of 'easily amused' people!We are very critical when it comes to movies!) laugh out loud to many parts and found the humor, dancing and singing to be so much fun and really a lot different than your normal humor, music and themes in a kids movie! Jesse Eisenberg has a perfect voice/character for the part of Blu, and all the birds have such charisma! :) It takes place in an exotic country and is full of colorful animals, with many fun and completely different personalities! I personally found this movie quite enjoyable, and it has become a favorite of mine and still makes me laugh! My son who is 3,asks to watch this movie often on our movie night together!

","When I saw the trailer I expected the movie to be cheesy and lack any real plot, rather to just have tons of puns. Instead, it turned out that the movie actually included a lot of good plot with good characters. There was a lot of intense scenes in the movie but it ended beautifully. Surprisingly enough, the main guy and girl human character never kissed! Haven't seen a lack of a kiss in a while! There were, of course, a few scenes which I found unnecessary. One was the guard who pulled off his clothes and started dancing in questionable clothing. I didn't see the point at all. It wasn't funny to me, an adult or to my mom either. It was stupid. I think they could have made the bird escaping scene a lot better.<br/><br/>Also, as short as it is, I don't really need to see a girl's *** on camera...<br/><br/>But despite these few things, I rather liked the movie. Rated 8/10."
"napierslogs","6","0","1","11 August 2011"," Birds singing and dancing their way to Brazil, and that's all
","I thought it was just for fun that ""Rio"" rhymed with ""Nemo"" and that the story of ""Rio"" (2011) nearly mirrors the story of 'Finding Nemo"" (2003). But there is actual fact in this movie. Hyacinth Macaws (blue in colour) are real birds who are endangered and native to Rio de Janeiro. The cage bird trade — which takes our beloved Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) to Minnesota — are a problem for the species. I'm pretty sure they don't talk though.<br/><br/>I mean form thoughts, speak in complete sentences and solve math and engineering problems. Blu can do all of that but he can't fly. When he returns to Brazil, that is the entire joke and conflict of the movie all wrapped up into one. Which makes the movie very, very short.<br/><br/>To round it out, all the birds, animals, and even humans have to stop and sing and dance for awhile. They have to because it is done in every animated animal movie where the hero returns home (either the artificial or natural home). It's annoying here because the birds do a sort of hip-hop, rap, dance routine — the kind that is in ""popular"" movies. Blu's female counterpart Jewel is voiced by Anne Hathaway, who can actually sing, but she doesn't until the very end in a duet with Jesse Eisenberg who cannot sing.<br/><br/>I liked the animation, especially of the Hyacinth Macaws (and I completely accept that they changed the female's colouring since we do need to be able to tell them apart). The animated ""choreography"" with the multi-coloured birds dancing was cute enough it was almost dazzling.<br/><br/>The reason we animate animals is because it is supposed to be cute and funny, but ""Rio"" unfortunately, really was not funny. Perhaps it will be to kids, but for those of us who find flaws in animated children's movies, it's just not quite cute and funny enough."
"priyantha-bandara","Null","0","1","30 July 2011"," So I just watch a cool animation about birds. And that's about it.
","There are a lot of good animations hitting the screen these days. Yet there are very few 'awesome' animations. I'm afraid Rio is not falling in the awesome category. Maybe the first reason is that it's based on birds (Which are a part of animal kingdom) and we have seeing a good load of speaking animals already.<br/><br/>Blu is a domestic Macau. Bought up in with the care of Linda who is a young book store owner in Minnesota, Blu has no knowledge of what so ever about the real world out of the glass window. But he practically loved the life in side. After a surplice visit from Tulio who is a Brazilian Ornithologist it's revealed that Blu is the last male of his kind. And next thing he is on a place to Brazil with Linda and Tulio in order to meet the last female of his kind. In Brazil he finds the freedom of his life and the companion of his heart when the couple gets kidnapped by bird smugglers.<br/><br/>The plot is quite unique. And it's pulled off with wonderful animation, splendid voice acting and darn good music. But like I mentioned before it lacks some punch. The thing which gives the wow factor is not to be found.<br/><br/>There have being many animations about animals, birds and fishes in the near history. Some have made us jump out of our seats practically. And now the industry is changing. And nowadays if you want people to say AWESOME it has to be something like Wall-e or UP. Something so unique and never seeing before. And this is not like that.<br/><br/>So I just watch a cool animation about birds. And that's about it.<br/><br/>My reviews at flickshout.tk"

","Okay, I must admit that I'm not a big fan of animated movies, but I recognize that some of them could be very good (Like ""Beowulf"") However, I don't like very much the recent CGI movies (Like the ones made by Dreamworks, I guess I prefer the classic animated films made by Disney) However, I think that ""Rio"" was a nice, little film, very good to watch with the whole family. It has comedy, music and romance, and the characters are cute and likable. It was very funny to watch, and it was very enjoyable, from beginning to end. The animation, despite not being spectacular, was very well made, with cute designs and nice colors.<br/><br/>Even when ""Rio"" is not a masterpiece, it is still a good film to watch with the whole family."
"ch_ris127","6","0","2","3 June 2011"," Disspointing. Don't be fooled by its bright colors. Rio is as dull as it can get.
","Music! Dance! Colors! Parties and carnavals! That's what a movie set in Rio de Janeiro can offer, and that's what Rio offered...in a disappointing wave of let down. All the musical showcases are wonderful and beautiful, sure, and they're entertaining too! But what about the movie itself? It's shallow, uninspired and quite boring, to say the least. When the characters don't work, the music don't. And when they don't, you end up getting more joy watching backup dancers dancing than the main characters themselves.<br/><br/>Despite its boredom, Rio is what it's all about - being amazed by the colors and sights the city offers. You've never seen this kind of place in an animation before. The real city looks superb, but dare I say, it looks more amazing and bright in animation. The lights, statue, streets and oh, the carnaval! The carnaval is the most wonderful thing you'll ever see in a CGI movie this year. Surely the huge lineup of colors and samba will delight you, at least for a while. BUT, the movie ruins it all. The sights do take your breath away, and so does the characters (in a bad kind of way).<br/><br/>Let's boil down the characters - the humans are bumbling fools, the birds are flying clichés and the dog is a comic relief that's not even funny. Fine, you may say that the movie is meant for entertainment, not to be taken seriously at all. BUT hey, you'd want something solid and smart for entertainment, and I must say, Rio is the least entertaining compared to the other movies Blue Sky Studios have made. The script could've have seriously done better with the blunt and uncreative dialogue. Every word that comes out of the characters' mouth can earn you a facepalm. The plot could've worked better with better direction, pacing and editing. The musical numbers could've immortalized Rio with its upbeat songs and exciting musicals, but it didn't, because the characters didn't work. You won't feel a thing when the music plays, cause you don't give a dime's worth about the characters. There may be some nice scenes where you look at them and like them, but for most of the time, they're forgettable.<br/><br/>It all seems to fast in Rio; you don't have the time to truly live in the moment. I don't know why that is, maybe it's because of the direction, but whatever it is, it makes the movie bland. Voice-acting? Not the best. You can get better from a foreign movie translation, and that's me being serious. There are a few select voices that are good, but never that good. Again, that's only because of the lousy screenplay/script. It's disappointing, considering the actors hired to voice the characters.<br/><br/>Rio seems like an experimental animation aimed to impress audiences with its smooth pictures and colorful parades. It seems like the studio is still trying to find its ground after leaving Ice Age, but it must be said that Rio, is not their landing spot. They're still searching for a comfort zone. You can feel a bit of their style here and there, but never fully achieving that Ice Age fame.<br/><br/>You never quite see the culture of the city that well either, thanks to the choppy direction and aimless script. The story has too much stuff in it that it makes everything half-hearted. I don't want to compare other movies, but Rio ranks low in execution compared to other animations when it comes to showing a city's culture and mood. Rio is seen here as a city full of party. That's it. The beautiful sights are just sights, nothing more. There's no explanation, no exploration, but instead, head-on action with mindless scripting.<br/><br/>Must be said; Rio looks like something you'd see in a Saturday morning full-length cartoon meant for toddlers. Seriously.<br/><br/>If you like birds, colors and eye-popping animation, this is a no-brainer movie for you. Don't be expecting any brains or charm coming out from this movie though, and truth to be told, the animation isn't that good compared to others (the humans' expression aren't that good). Jokes are lame, most of them, at least. Characters are uninspired, voice-acting is so-so, setting is terrific but the execution is nil. If you're watching Rio, expect to stay and yearn to leave. It does nothing but shakes its tail feathers without even knowing what it's doing.<br/><br/>Rio, is feather-deep in everything. Enjoy! Not."

","I have to admit, I was kind of disappointed by this movie, and I was really looking forward to it. Instead, I walked out of the theater with a massive headache and a feeling of deja-vu.<br/><br/>I will put this caveat: 3D usually gives me a splitting, incredibly painful headache, and this was no exception. But I'm also aware that's a ""your mileage may vary"" thing. My friend was the one to get the tickets, and accidentally ended up paying an extra $4.50 per ticket to see the film in 3D, when it would have been much more enjoyable in 2D. Myself, and two others who I went to see this movie with ended up with excruciating headaches from the 3D glasses. If you don't usually have a problem with it, though, it might be worth it for you to go see it in 3D.<br/><br/>As for the story, it was very cute (I wanted to hug baby Rio!), but reminiscent of many different ""animal wants to go back to his home"" features. It was still enjoyable, with a satisfying resolution and some funny jokes that both kids and adults would be able to enjoy, but it all felt a bit familiar. That's not to say it wasn't entertaining, however. Just don't go in expecting anything revolutionary.<br/><br/>Overall: 6.5/10"
"vanshajkapur","6","0","2","6 May 2011"," Rio - beautifully colored paradise
","They say,""Watch a film with a blank mind."" That is exactly what i did today when i went to watch Rio in 3D. The screenplay structure was rather common and applied in most of the children's films i've seen. It followed a very familiar pattern. Apart from that,Rio is a brilliantly directed film by Carlos Saldanha. After his Ice Age series, the humour and content has just not died down. I struggled to keep myself bored through the film, it kept me enthralled throughout. The characters where beautifully portrayed, even the minor characters of the bull dog(Luiz) and the small birds(Pedro and Nico) had a lot of depth in them. Nigel's character was something that proved that animation is as much, if not more expressive than reel films. Powerful acting and voice. The main character's of Blu and Angel stood out, and the supporting roles made a great contribution to their presence. The script had some beautifully written dialogues, very well timed and extremely funny.<br/><br/>The shots used in the film, with brilliant animation rendering is a joy to watch, especially for a film maker. The camera goes wild in the film with a lot of conceptual match cuts in the film. Although the 3D technology was not justified in the film. the characters appeared out of the screen at wrong and random times. I doubt it would make any difference if i saw the same film in 2D. The music and choreography was another marvelous feature of the film. Will.I.Am did a great job voicing pedro and with the music. Also Black eyed peas' 'Magalenha' and 'Mas Que Nada' made an appearance in the film. Over all the film is a great watch. I would definitely recommend a theatre watch. Also, i will be looking forward to Carlos' ice Age 4 soon. The trailer looks promising."

He falls off the truck and is found by Linda who adopts Blue as a pet. 15 years latter Doctor Borbosa comes from Brazil who has found a female blue macabre and wants to breed the pair to help keep the species alive. So off to Rio during Carnival to get the pair of birds to hook up. The problem at first Jewel the female bird is very fightsy and wants nothing to do with Blue. Well that night a smuggler of exotic birds steals the pair and binds their feet together. Later that night the pair escapes. The rest of the movie is about the 2 birds trying to get unbound, Linda trying to get Blue back and the smuggler trying to get the birds back. The rest is rather predictable.<br/><br/>The movie is a nice kids flick but nothing more. The story is neither interesting or new, the characters we have all seen before. The kids will love it but the adults will probably be looking at there watches waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>Grade C+"
"jonnyhavey","6","0","5","21 April 2011"," Ordinary: The New Angry Bird
","Director Carlos Saldanha has temporarily abandoned his ""Ice Age"" saga moving to the warm, beautiful jungle and city of Rio de Janeiro following colorful birds in the kid safe movie ""Rio."" While the G rating targets young children, adults may find some entertainment from the straightforward, colorful song and dance of Brazilian birds. The problem is ""Rio"" does not bring anything fresh to the animated escape genre. To begin, the film briefly takes place in Moose Lake, Minnesota after bird smugglers transfer a new catch from Rio to the U.S. Their goal is to sell them as pets, however, they accidentally leave a blue Macaw named Blu (Jesse Eisenberg, ""The Social Network"") on the side of the road. In Moose Lake Blu is domesticated throughout the years as he befriends a lady named Linda (Leslie Mann, ""Funny People""). Life is perfect until Blu and Linda are informed by a scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro, ""300"") that Blu must go back to Rio in order to save his species from extinction. In Rio things start off rocky as he serenades his other half Jewel (Anne Hathaway, ""Love and Other Drugs"") and turn to the worse as the two are forced to escape the bonds of smugglers once again. They are aided on their journey by a seasoned entertainment cast including Will I Am, Jamie Foxx, Tracy Morgan and George Lopez. While the birds are running, flying and chirping for their lives another cliché love story forms between Linda and Tulio adding to the overall happy ending.<br/><br/>The vibrant carefree musical vibes of Brazil are seen throughout the movie giving appeal to its colorful birds. The smart vocal casting of musical artists and contemporary acting stars creates speech and choral integrity for the performances in the film. This diversity also draws an older viewing audience who actually know who the actors are, while the quick simple pace mesmerizes kids. With this being said, ""Rio"" is the best G film of the year for all audiences because of its built in kid safety that does not totally bore older viewers away.<br/><br/>Is straightforward cinema good? Yes, however, sometimes a film like ""Rio"" can be so straightforward that it doesn't bring anything fresh to the table. The only original aspect of the film is the fact that it takes place in Brazil ""Angry Birds"" style, but in the end there is no surprise. Consequently there are moments in the film that seem to drag on because the ending is already clear. Also, while Jesse Eisenberg is currently a big name actor in Hollywood, it was very awkward hearing his voice come out of the beak of a bird. His voice personified Blu in a very nerdy way, while Blu was developed as a cute naïve pet instead of a socially awkward parrot..<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Rio"" successfully fulfills childish expectations staying true to youthful entertainment with its straightforward plot. It also avoids causing the excruciating boredom to adults present in earlier G movie releases in 2011, however, it cannot escape the fact that it is only ordinary."

","Well..... where do i begin? Im an avid fan of anything to do with animated films, i honestly believe we will one day soon be seeing a troop of animators and voice actors walking onto the stage at the academy awards, accepting the Oscar for best picture; unfortunately RIO isn't that film. Not to say i didn't enjoy myself, I did. The scenery was absolutely stunning and in 3D!!! (IM DROOLING!) The character animation was spectacular and the characters themselves were all brilliantly voiced and varied.<br/><br/>The story follows Blu, a blue Macaw bereft of his childhood (chickhood?) when he falls from his nest during the films wildly fun opening song and dance sequence. He is snatched up by poachers and sent on a plane to America. <br/><br/>The story takes a quick turn for the adorable here when the crate containing Blu falls from the smugglers truck only to be discovered by a brilliantly animated little girl. The story zooms forward a good few years and Blu has adapted to his living with humans and is quiet comfortable how his life is set up . Blu; voiced by Jesse Eisenberg, due to his altered lifestyle, has never learned how to fly, thus adapting to use different modes of transport like toy cars and things hanging from the ceiling. (This is important as it is the catalyst for one of the last scenes and multiple physical comedic parts throughout)<br/><br/>This is basically the only thing Blu has to overcome throughout the entire movie to complete his character arc. He is shipped off to Rio (along with his owner and Best friend; voiced by Leslie Mann) to save his rare Blu Macaw heritage by planting his seed and ensuring the survival of his kind. There is a love interest thrust upon us, with the only other surviving Blue Macaw Jewel (voiced by Cat-women elect Anne Hathaway, a very clichéd love story in sadly an underwritten part.) As well as love interest between the two main human characters; to balance all the bird love i guess?<br/><br/>A new best friend is introduced, a Toucan who's name i cant even remember (it's voiced by George Lopez), who is supposed to be Blu's guide to Rio and kind of a love mentor. ( He has like 14 kids or something and never wants to stay home with them, yeah great message to kids that one!). Two hideously annoying song birds (only wasted vocals of Will.I.AM and Jamie Foxx) and a cockatoo named Nigel that is the most clichéd bad guy (bird?) on EARTH!<br/><br/>The visuals saved this movie, as did the heart. Even while i was been distracted by all the floats at Rio's Carnival, the Bird suits, the Jamaican bird smuggler with his 2 overly gay companions (whom they explained nothing about) and Tracy Morgan voiced Miguel's disgustingly realistic dog slobber; I was always attached to Blu's tiny little heart strings. Maybe it was because i personally knew how that bird was feeling; being out of my comfort zone and feeling i was in too deep.<br/><br/>A fairly run of the mill story unfold, not uncommonly found in ROM-COMS. I honestly expected Julia Roberts (in bird form) to come out at the end with her ""I'm just a girl, standing in front of a guy"" monologue at the end. <br/><br/>The climax of the film however was incredibly touching, as Blu finally ""believed he could fly"" (thats an R Kelly nod) and swooped down to save an injured Jewel from impending death during the closing set piece.<br/><br/>I normally recommend friends of my own age to view animated films, as i have become accustom to pulling deeper and more adult meanings from the subtext of these types of films, Rio however, i cannot. It's a kids movie through and through with a couple of tiny (failed) attempts at adult humor thrown in the middle, but i cant say i didn't have a good couple LOLZ in there too. Spectacular visuals, great casting and voice acting with a sound narrative. See this if you enjoyed MegaMind.<br/><br/>TRACY MORGAN REPRESENT!<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
