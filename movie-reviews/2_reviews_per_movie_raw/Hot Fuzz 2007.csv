","Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.<br/><br/>The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets-of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.<br/><br/>The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.<br/><br/>The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.<br/><br/>I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous."

","Saw this last night at a special screening followed by a Q&A with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" but wasn't a huge fan but I liked what I'd heard about ""Hot Fuzz"". I still wasn't prepared to be quite as blown away by it as I was.<br/><br/>This film works both as an out-and-out comedy but also as a high paced action film and also manages to showcase the directing talents of Edgar Wright and the acting of Simon Pegg (who can really *act*) The first half is a gentle build up but is generally and genuinely amusing, but once we put the pedal to the floor for the second half the pace is relentless.<br/><br/>The plot is substantial enough but isn't really what we've all come to see - it's about the snappy dialogue and the gags. To describe it as a spoof is unfair - they just corrupt the genre a little and turn up the comedy.<br/><br/>Great fun from start to finish."

","I was lucky enough to see a preview of this film for free after I attended a random screening of Scorcese's the Departed. Naturally hearing that the makers of Shaun of the Dead were behind this I had to go see it - if a group of people can make a romantic comedy with zombies, then a buddy cop film HAD to inventive and original.<br/><br/>I can safely say that it was. I haven't laughed as hard in a film as I did with Hot Fuzz. The parts are all cast brilliantly - in particular Pegg and Frost as the two lead police officers.<br/><br/>Pegg bringing the smart, intelligent, action hardened London cop to the sleep north England village works in a classic fish out of water scenario. It surprised me with it's direction and I will confess I couldn't have predicted how everything would pan out.<br/><br/>When this is fully released I urge you to go and see it."
"snow0r","9","191","243","28 March 2007"," Awesome
","Hot Fuzz is the story of Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), hardboiled super-cop. Intimidated by his arrest record, his cameo-appearance superior officers (Martin Freeman, Steven Coogan, and Bill Nighy) transfer him from the busy streets of London to the sleepy village of Sandford to keep him out of the way and balance the books, because, to be honest, he's making the rest of them look bad. A big cop in a small town, Angel sees murders and conspiracies where the cameo cast of cops and locals see accidents, but, with the help of his partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), it's not long before he discovers that not everything in Sandford is quite what it seems.<br/><br/>Sound clichÃ©d? Good. That's the point. Once settled in Sandford, Hot Fuzz becomes a vehicle designed to send up every action film that has ever taken itself even slightly seriously from Police Story to Point Break, and it does this brilliantly by simply taking everything from these films and pushing them that bit further, making them appear both ridiculous and awesome at the same time. The characters are massively exaggerated (especially Pegg's super-cop and Timothy Dalton's fantastically over-the-top super-villain). The action sequences are outrageous, exciting, and feature a surprising degree of rough justice, perhaps most notably in the form of an old woman getting karate-kicked in the face (or maybe a pub landlord getting his head bear-trappedÂ…). The dialogue ranges from obvious parody (""Did you tell him to cool off?"") to clever Pegg-Frost exchanges, and even the music is perfectly balanced between action-scene rock songs and mock-epic slow guitar pieces.<br/><br/>However, that's not to say that Hot Fuzz is non-stop comic action. The first half an hour or so seems a little slow, but there's no reason to worry; the cast are simply setting up jokes to be knocked down later on, and it is definitely worth the brief wait for the well-paced comic-action masterpiece that's lying just around the corner. As with Shaun of the Dead, the people behind Hot Fuzz are affectionately poking fun at a genre that they clearly love, creating a film that embraces its genre's inherent ridiculousness, and is all the better for it."
"baz_trinity","10","308","409","19 February 2007"," Yarrp!
","Hot Fuzz: The story tells us of an over-active 'policeman officer', Nicholas Angel (Played by the co-star of Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg) who is sent to work his duties out in the countryside, to avoid his use of excessive arrests. Suspicions arrive in the town however, as people start getting killed 'accidentally'. Coupled with his rather unprofessional partner Danny Butterman (Similiarily played by Shaun of the Dead star Nick Frost) they get themselves into suspicious circumstances Nicholas Angel fails to ignore.<br/><br/>But what can I say? It's just hilarious! An incredibly funny, witty, intelligent British comedy that manages to bring you to tears with laughter and also offers extremely well directed and executed action scenes! If you liked the likes of Shaun of the Dead, you'll love this, simple as that. I was oddly surprised to find that it was incredibly violent, albeit, in a cartoony way, but it will definitely make you squint. Plenty of cameo's by the likes of the hilarious Bill Bailey and a great cast will make this a action/thriller/comedy hard to forget! Excellent."
"oooMILESooo","9","334","450","2 April 2007"," -:::::HOT FUZZ:::::- Don't Have High Expectations & Come Out Laughing!!!
","Hot Fuzz is a brilliant new Britsh comedy that really hits its mark!!! Hands down this fantastic film is the new benchmark in British comedies!<br/><br/>Simon Pegg throws you into the extremely tongue in cheek narrative with its quick pace edits, booming sounds and terrific camera work that we have come to expect from Edgar Wright since Shaun of the Dead. Simon Pegg has really exceeded my expectations and credit must also go to Nick Frost who plays the classic sidekick which he accomplishes so well. The aforementioned crafty work by Edgar Wright proves that his style creates some of the best action sequences in the business. Whether it be the shoot'em ups, chase scenes or the jump out of your seat surprises, Wright can really make a film move and does this one ever!!!<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those films you have to watch at least twice to come close to getting every single joke, because they come so hard and fast it is sometimes hard to stop laughing at the previous one in time to hear the next.<br/><br/>Even though the film does take a lot of twists and turns there isn't really a moment where it lacks energy. Sure there are parts that slow it down, but it needs this to build momentum to one of the most climactic and hysterical pieces in film history. <br/><br/>Speed is the key! It keeps this insanely funny narrative flowing while at the same time giving a huge insight into the extremely detailed characters. Each character brings something to the table. It is an inventive yet classic comedy that reaches most audiences with its tongue in cheek and witty humour. <br/><br/>People who thought the cop-comedy genre was finished should definitely see this creative film which will pluck those heart strings and have you slapping that knee while feasting your eyes on the adrenaline fueled action!!!"
"mjw2305","9","123","160","11 October 2007"," In a Nutshell - Don't Miss It!
","After Shaun of the Dead, this second pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost was very high on my wanted list, and it didn't disappoint in the least.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is crammed full of excellent characters, ranging from the eccentric to the diabolical, and every one gets at least one laugh during the course of the movie and most of them get many more. I don't mean to suggest that this film is wall to wall gags; in fact it is far from it, instead it is just very clever and often very subtle humour that runs continuously throughout the film.<br/><br/>Another pleasant surprise was the wonderfully impressive murder scenes, which were pretty gruesome and definitely stood out from the general vibe of the film, which made them far more involving. As well as the comedy and the murders, there is also a genuine sense of mystery surrounding these events and it definitely makes for compulsive viewing.<br/><br/>Just in case all that wasn't enough to satisfy you, there is a very action packed and explosive end sequence that is so out of place and ludicrous it works like a charm, and simply caps the film off in style superbly.<br/><br/>For me this film was every bit as good as Shaun of the Dead, and its definitely one of the best comedies ever made.<br/><br/>9/10"
"phil_stretch_armstrong","10","273","376","24 January 2007"," Watch it 'for the greater good'
","I was lucky enough to see an early preview. I am a big fan of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead, but wow!!!. I have never laughed so much at a film. Even colleagues that weren't that impressed with Shaun of the Dead loved Fuzz.<br/><br/>It was non stop comedy, with some action and a little gore but only for comic effect.<br/><br/>Essentially a spoof of big action American cop films set in a small sleepy village in Somerset, UK. <br/><br/>Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a top cop transferred from London to a place where finding a missing swan is about as exiting as it gets. However, things are about to change as there are a few 'accidents'. Can Angel and his new partner local boy Danny (Frost) find out what's happening.<br/><br/>It's got a start studded cast who all add to the sheer brilliance of the script. <br/><br/>There are so many memorable bits that keep me giggle to myself as I recall them. I cannot wait until it gets general release so I can see it again. I'm sure I missed a few visual gags and film references.<br/><br/>Having it introduced by the stars Simon & Nick was a real bonus. Thanks guys a comic classic."
"Gareth_Hacking","8","147","205","10 February 2007"," Caught by the Fuzz
","So here we have it, the eagerly awaited follow-up from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead. But whereas Shaun (hereafter shortened to SOTD) drew its inspiration primarily from zombie films (more specifically, George Romero's ""Dead"" films), Hot Fuzz throws its net a bit wider, taking in every buddy-buddy cop action film made in the last 20 odd years and combining it with a very British perspective. Think Midsummer Murder spliced with Bad Boys 2 and you should have the rough idea.<br/><br/>Through a series of quick cuts we are introduced to Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), an outstanding officer in the London police force, a super cop with an arrest record 400% higher than anyone else. In fact he's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. So Angel is packed off to the picture-perfect village of Sandford, alone save for his beloved Japanese Peace Lilly. On arrival Angel finds it difficult to adjust to village life, constantly on the look out for crime in a place where there hasn't been a murder for over 20 years and the police station is so quiet that the staff spend most of their time eating cake and ice-cream. He also finds himself partnered with over-eager constable Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny is obsessed with action films and believe's that Angel is his chance to live out his dreams of car chases and gunfights.<br/><br/>With the set-up completed within the first 15 minutes it's on with the plot as people start to die in a series of grisly ""accidents"". Angel is suspicious but no-one believes him apart from Danny. With the body count rising though, the two need to work together to find out what's going on or could it be that Angel is just wound too tightly for country living? Pegg and Frost have been doing their double act for so long it's become second nature and it's nice to see them playing (slightly) different roles. Just like SOTD, they are ably supported by a cast of familiar faces from British film and TV. It's good to see Timothy Dalton having so much fun, playing the sinister Mr Skinner with a moustache-twirling relish. Other standouts include Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as the Andy's, two detectives who spend most of their time verbally abusing Angel and Danny.<br/><br/>The film is packed full of references, which I'm sure will take multiple viewings to catch. There's some inventively gory scenes which are sure to make everyone a bit more careful around churches and model villages, though they are a bit too obviously CGI. It's a shame that the action doesn't kick into high gear until the final third but with the plot not going down the most obvious of routes and since I was laughing all the way through I can't really complain. The film is a success in it's attempt to create a ""British"" action film, combining adrenaline-fuelled action with the mundane and everyday."
"DICK STEEL","10","146","206","19 May 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Hot Fuzz
","I will say it out clear and upfront - I love this movie, and without a doubt, a definite contender for my movie of the year. By the filmmakers of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz has everything that makes great entertainment, laced with wry Brit wit, and while it contains plenty of references from their earlier movie, it never bores, and for cinephiles, you're in for one heck of a time identifying the countless of movie references within. If anything, I can't wait to get my hands on their earlier efforts in order not to shortchange myself in missing out on the gems by director Edgar Wright and collaborating writer Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz follows a typical buddy-cop genre, except that these two are so much more diverse from each other than the conventional cop movies of late milking the obvious race and cultural differences, beaten to death by the Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour films. Here we have the city versus country policeman officers buddying up, each with work ethics belonging to opposite ends. Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is your no-nonsense, straight laced, focused, top supercop who aces everything in his field of work, apprehending felons who fail to follow the law. And with being the top police officer on the beat, the powers that be deem him to be a threat (in making them look inept), and got him posted from Metropolitan London to the countryside of Sandford.<br/><br/>And Sandford is your typical small lazy town, where nothing much happens, and everyone knows everyone else. If a missing swan is a great deal, then you'll know there's pretty nothing much to sustain our supercop's interest, especially so when the station he's assigned to have officers which are extremely laid back, which makes him get off on the wrong footing with partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Danny's the anti-thesis of Nicholas, and spends much of his days daydreaming what a top city cop would be like, and lives out his dreams through his collection of DVD movies like Bad Boys II and Point Break. But the idyllic life of the country gets interrupted with a series of murders (frequently brushed aside as accidents) just as our friends are about to get chummy, and here's where the fun kicks in at top gear.<br/><br/>There are so many things to like about the movie. The violence is one, though I'm unsure if the commercial release here will keep scenes unscathed by the editing scissors. Featuring some of the most gruesome ways to die, it's a blood splattering fest worthy of any serial killer movie. The movie too rewards the attentive viewer, because while the filmmakers load the movie with plenty of easter eggs, minute details, red herrings and the likes, everything will count for something as they come together on the way to the finale, so keep your eyes wide open and your ears peeled. The dialogue is full of wit, with loads of movie references, direct and indirect, and its run up to the end is one of the most adrenaline pumping in recent times, you can't help but to cheer as you lap up the high octane action. Action fans will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Some may not like its editing style, which is quick, sudden, loud, and at times repetitive, but that's just a minor blip. There are enough positives here to satisfy almost everyone, and one that will definitely bring on a smile by the time the end credits roll. A definite must watch! Don't miss this when it screens commercially!"
"chrichtonsworld","10","178","255","2 May 2007"," Even better than Shaun of the dead
","""Hot Fuzz"" is brilliant! People who like British humor will love this one! It is really funny! It manages to make fun of ridiculous plots used in action movies and at the same time entertain you with their own ridiculous plot which is quite thrilling! Even when you don't get the subtle humor there are more than enough visual jokes to be enjoyed! I thought it was a stroke of genius to use some serious actors like Edward Woodward,Stuart Wilson and Timothy Dalton! (Timothy Dalton was accused of playing a much too serious James Bond! Well,in ""Hot Fuzz"" he shows that he can be dangerously funny!) As a parody on action movies this movie succeeds where others have failed! I think the credit has to go to the whole team who made this and ""Shaun of the dead"" including the actors! It shows that they actually like the movies they make fun of! That is essential for the the jokes to work! I thought ""Hot Fuzz"" is hilarious and very entertaining! It certainly is one of the funniest movies at the moment! Go check it out!"
"djvale","10","183","278","18 February 2007"," ""The Fuzz"" Keeps Black Comedies Alive!
","""Shaun of the Dead"" was probably one of the funniest (if not the best) British black comedy that had been released in 2004. With gritty violence that made you squirm, innocent humour (Nick Frost) with blaspheming insults that just made you laugh out loud, and the quick wit of Simon Pegg with some great fun and horror mixed together, ""Hot Fuzz"" had a huge task of competing with the sheer greatness, of which was ""Shaun of the Dead"".<br/><br/>After much keen excitement upon seeing the teaser trailers of Hot Fuzz last year, my stomach churned as if to say ""At god damn last, a film I can look forward to in the new year!"" I felt as though it was best however, to go in with an open-neutral-mind, as I didn't want to spoil the film with high expectations.<br/><br/>I actually was starting to get worried into the first segments of the film, the humour wasn't as sharp as SOTD's first 20 minutes, and there were so many characters to remember, most of whom didn't make sense for a while. It wasn't till Nick Frost was introduced - that the film started picking up its pace and then decided to grab me by the throat. The film from then, was so funny, action packed, gruesome and dark! You just do not expect anything which was what made SOTD so great. The spontaneous actions and humour just kept the film's pace fantastically back on track.<br/><br/>The great thing about Hot Fuzz was just how original it was, and the ending (no spoilers here) just gave itself the stamp of ""Most Exciting & Fun Ending In British Comedy"".<br/><br/>The mystery and murder factor was well done as well, leaving me guessing ""who did it"" all the way through the film, but as with SOTD, the dark and grotesque violence kept its mature rating of 15, very enjoyable, yet very squirming to watch.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for anyone who just wants a good laugh and likes simple great black comedies. If you loved Shaun of the Dead, you will love this film. Just go in with an open-mind and have fun. Definitely worth the Â£6.50 (and the Â£15 when it comes out on DVD)!"

","I confess my first reaction to Hot Fuzz was thinking it was droll but a little disappointing after the faster-paced, hilarious Shaun of the Dead. How wrong I was... now I believe this is the funniest Edgar Wright movie. The first act is slower than Shaun, yes, but the script is meticulously crafted, a comedic masterpiece of setups and payoffs.<br/><br/>Pegg and Frost are great as the by-the-book city cop and his sloppy partner who have to unravel the mystery behind the killings in a model British village. The duo is surrounded by an inspired cast; Broadbent and Dalton shine as, respectively, the jovial Chief and a smug suspect. Considine and Spall have minor roles but get their share of amusing moments. And a brief scene featuring cameos by Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy is a thing of beauty.<br/><br/>Wright is, quite simply, the best comedy director working today. Unlike most of his colleagues he doesn't just rely on witty dialogue and funny performances: he makes the movie *visually* entertaining as well, with his rapid-fire montages, clever transitions and the way he can turn a mundane scene into something hysterical simply by the way he frames a shot.<br/><br/>Worth multiple viewings - in fact, Hot Fuzz gets better every time.<br/><br/>8,5/10"
"ianharb","10","18","25","30 March 2008"," Brilliant!!!
","While this movie is a poke at the big budget action flick, it doesn't fall into the naked gun style of spoof. It comes off as if it is being serious, which makes it all the more funny. The first thing that strikes you is the editing. The quick jump cuts used in action films to make them seem edgier, suggesting a frenetic, tension filled pace, are used through out this film, giving any serious action films editing a run for its money. At first, it seemed a little obvious and contrived, maybe, but as the humor started to offset the serious tone being set forth, the movie really started taking shape. In the end, the editing made this film even more brilliant. The acting was terrific. The Shaun of the Dead stars really proved that they were not just one hit wonders. I now think Simon Pegg is one of the more brilliant comedic writers and actors of our time. His stone faced, serious main character sets a tone that made this spoof. I will now be sure to see ANY movie these guys make. This is one of the few movies I'd like to play again after having just watched it. It was just that funny."

"hnt_dnl","10","18","27","10 May 2008"," A fun-filled, hilarious, joyride of an action film
","HOT FUZZ is one the most entertaining film experiences that I've had in YEARS! This is probably the most enjoyable film I've seen since COLLATERAL. And it's a British film, most of which I find heavy-handed and boring! But not this one! It's actually extremely difficult to put this film into just one category: cop film, action, mystery, comedy, drama, parody, homage? It's actually all of these things and much more. As parody/homage, it definitely has elements of a lot of other 'old' action movies in it: LETHAL WEAPON, DIE HARD, BAD BOYS II (they constantly reference this film along with POINT BREAK), and guess what? There's also a big-time homage to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS at the beginning of the film's spectacular climax! <br/><br/>HOT FUZZ tells the story of London supercop Constable Nicholas Angel (played brilliantly by Simon Pegg). Angel is one baaaad man! He has a ridiculously high arrest rate and is in top physical and mental shape. But his cronies in the London police are jealous of his success b/c he is as the London Chief Inspector says 'making them all look bad'. So Angel is transferred to the small, quiet English burg of Sandford. The head of Sandford's police force, Inspector Frank Butterman (played by Jim Broadbent in a lively, funny performance) assures Angel that nothing ever goes on in Sandford and that there hasn't been a murder or major case in 20 years! Of course, Angel, ever the suspicious and dedicated cop, immediately finds trouble in virtually EVERY situation. There are times in the film where you actually believe that Angel is actually paranoid b/c of his anal personality, even though you know that he is indeed right: there's SOMETHING wrong in Sandford! We constantly see right before several 'accidents' a mysterious hooded figure murdering prominent town citizens. <br/><br/>Angel's partner is Constable Danny Butterman (played by Nick Frost in a hilarious and moving performance). Danny is the Inspector's son and is only interested in screwing off watching action movies and eating ice cream and cake! Angel and Danny's relationship is at the core of the film and is truly one of the best buddy relationships that I've ever seen in film. They are complete opposites, yet they complement each other to perfection. And both men learn things from each other. Danny learns how to be a much better cop and Angel learns how to take it down a notch and appreciate the finer things in life. Angel and Danny's police cohorts are Constables Tony Fisher, Doris Thatcher, Bob Walker, Sergeant Turner, and the 2 Andys (played hilariously by Kevin Eldon, Olivia Colman, Karl Johnson, Bill Bailey, Paddy Considine, and Rafe Spall). They are all just as apathetic to what is going on in Sandford as Danny.<br/><br/>The film sports a great cast of quirky characters that, along with Inspector Butterman, comprise the town's NWA (for Neighborhood Watch Alliance) played brilliantly by veteran actors: grocery store magnate Simon Skinner (one of the former JAMES BONDs Timothy Dalton), surveillance expert Tom Weaver (THE EQUALIZER Edward Woodward), the bicycling schoolmarm Amanda Paver (Lorraine Hilton), Dr. Hatcher (Stuart Wilson), hotel owner Joyce Cooper (Billie Whitelaw), pub owners Roy and Mary Porter (Peter Wright and Julia Deakin), Rev. Shooter (Paul Freeman), candy shop owner Annette Roper (Patricia Franklin), local farmer James Reaper (Kenneth Cranham), and flower shop owner Leslie Tiller (Anne Reid).<br/><br/>I accidentally came across HOT FUZZ while channel-flipping and luckily caught essentially the first 10 minutes of real dialogue of the film (the part right after the obligatory opening introduction and backstory of our hero Angel that I saw upon 2nd viewing). This 10-minute pair of scenes in the London police station where Angel's superiors are telling him they are transferring him and Angel at the crime scene with his ex-girlfriend Jeanine (who I later found out was Cate Blanchett in that body-covering getup) had me laughing hysterically and so I thought I'd stick around to see how this movie was going to turn out. I was sure the film was a comedy by this first 10 minutes, but when I checked the menu description of it, it said it was Action/Adventure and I went 'Huh?' I don't think the real action came until the last 30 minutes of the film, but along the way, I was laughing constantly and thoroughly engaged also by the mystery element and quirkiness of the film. I think that there were at least 5 or 6 times where I was sure that they were at the end of the film and I was completely fooled and then there was another hitch. And it was all worth it! For me, this film is really a great tip-of-the-hat to all the over-the-top action movies of the past 20 years or so. It simultaneously mocks those films while paying playful homage to them. And the key word is FUNNY. You will laugh throughout! This is truly one of the very few films in this decade of the 2000s (came out in 2007) that I've enjoyed from beginning to end! A great achievement!"
"Polaris_DiB","9","21","33","4 May 2007"," How to make a real parody, not package pop culture regurgitation into commodity
","Genre parody is running rampant currently, probably because Hollywood is so out of ideas at this point that they've gone down to the level of making fun of their own crap with even more crap that basically every year we get another slew of pop culture regurgitation in the form of Genre Movie and kids films like Shrek, Happily N'Ever After, and Hoodwinked to make sure nothing worth seeing doesn't have its hilarious counterpart. That is why we need people like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>The thing about Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz is that both of them manage to make fun of, respect, AND transcend their own genres. Shaun of the Dead isn't just a funny reworking of zombie horror flicks, its a damn good zombie horror flick in its own right, and also breaks new ground with the genre. The exact same thing is true with Hot Fuzz. Where any sarcastic Hollywood genre satire would try to show how dumb a clichÃ© is by making it even more outrageous, Edgar Wright simply has the characters say, ""But that would create a lot of paperwork."" Where a lesser parody would make an obvious twist as a nod to obvious twists, Simon Pegg finds out that the motivations for the recent crimes is really much simpler.<br/><br/>But beyond that, these films are good films, removed from genre, in their own right. Hot Fuzz uses a style of quick-cut editing to match the ridiculous quick-cut editing that's become popular in such ridiculous nonsensical films as Domino and Walking Tall, but they don't over extend it to show how ridiculous it can get... rather, they learn something about the form and most importantly make the editing extremely, extremely good. Hot Fuzz has quick saturated action film editing, but it does it in a way that leads the eye gracefully through the action, thus one upping every other bad action flick being ground out by Hollywood.<br/><br/>But the best part is that these films don't need prior knowledge of other films in order to get the joke. A more underhanded reason so many Scary Movie sequels keep coming out is that they directly make fun of recent horror films one-to-one, meaning one must actually see those terrible movies in order to get the jokes. Hot Fuzz stands alone. Even if you haven't seen Bad Boys II or Point Break, you can still follow this movie because it has engaging and colorful characters, good action, and most importantly--CREATIVITY. And even though it provides constant nods to pop culture, it also has its own quirky form of English humor to basically make everybody laugh. Not only does Hot Fuzz transcend buddy cop movies and slasher flicks (with a hint of Westerns, too!), it also transcends spoof genre. Take that, Hollywood! I figured Shaun of the Dead was a one-time deal, but now I hope Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright continue to craft even more genres into actually skillful and fun movies for years to come.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"lithuanian-dude","10","10","14","12 March 2008"," A little bit of everything
","I didn't see Shaun of the Dead prior to the release of this movie. I didn't even know about Hot Fuzz when it came to theaters. I watched this movie when it came to Comcast On Demand and it looked like it was gonna be a pretty funny movie. I got so, so much more than that.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a parody of action movies, and a good action movie by itself. It is really a 3 in 1 movie. It is a slasher, comedy, and an action movie at the same time. The action does take to get going for a good 30/40 minutes, but during that time we are exposed to some really great British humor (which not all Americans like) and witty fast paced scenes.<br/><br/>The plot isn't a bad one either. An overachieving cop is sent to a small rural town where a murder hasn't occurred in many years because he was making his fellow police officers ""look bad"". The cop (played by Simon Pegg) is having boring days at the town until some strange deaths occur. The town thinks they're accidents, but Simon thinks there is a murderous lunatic on the loose. That is the plot synopsis, and while it may seem a little bland it is executed masterfully with a lot of humor and movie references along the way.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz was a very pleasant surprise for me. It is now among my favorite movies and I can truly say it is a masterpiece."

","I had low expectations for a funny, but throw-away film, based on the U.S. trailers.<br/><br/>Turns out the trailers I've seen are selling the film at a disservice, because this is one hip, hilarious, smart, and tightly acted / written / edited film.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg (Sergeant Nicholas Angel) is top-notch, and is a prolific writer / actor the likes of to which to aspire. He plays a believable hard-nosed / -assed officer, and rarely can be seen wearing ""look how funny my writing is"" on his sleeve.<br/><br/>Nick Frost (PC Danny Butterman), Pegg's rotund subtly faux bumbling partner in the sleepy hamlet to which Angel's been reassigned, is so amazingly committed to his character and actions, he's a real joy to watch.<br/><br/>And Timothy Dalton gives probably my favorite performance of his since ""The Rocketeer"". The way this guy can act and have fun with himself is impressive.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strength of the film is its ability to pull off the ludicrous, making me laugh because it's ludicrous, but it doesn't feel unreal. That and being able to pull off the humor and the grotesque side-by-side.<br/><br/>Not to give anything away, but the plot twists in the film feel organic to the genre; the ""genre"" being an Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg film. Almost reverse Scooby-Doo, in a way. Whatever. Brass tacks: I didn't feel jerked around by the plot.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend the film. It's a tight, hilarious, surprisingly high-caliber offering for action and comedy fans."

","You're sitting at the computer minding your own business. There's a random movie starting at your TV. You throw your eye a few times on the beginning. You throw your eyes more and more on it. Finally you take a seat on your couch and decide to watch the rest of the film. How often does this happen to you? To just get absorbed by the amusement/drama/subject/etc of a movie you weren't intending to see, just by a few glances in the starting minutes? I, for one, know that it's something that happens barely seldom to me. Yet, this movie just caught me right from the beginning.<br/><br/>So we have Nicholas Angel (just loved the name choice), a workaholic, very serious, very effective police officer from London who gets transfered to rural Sandford, Gloucestershire. From here he starts interacting with the locals, bringing his fancy, londonistic ways of being a cop to the lighthearted villagers. Not the most likable person, Nicholas forms a bond (more of a hero-fanboy relation) with Danny, son of the Chief Inspector. New, unexpected events take place and the action really starts. Storyline isn't so important in my opinion, as I'm sure the screenplay would've been as funny as with any other epic development.<br/><br/>This film is abundant of British humor, which I love, while Simon Pegg's character can become actually adorable. No fancy stuff for this movie, just smart gags, a perfectly balanced dose of action and many referrals to Point Break and Bad Boys 2 :)<br/><br/>All in all, the main idea is that you should (at the border of turning into a must) watch it. Probably if you saw Shaun of the Dead you are looking forward into this one, if not then you'll be looking forward into SotD after viewing Hot Fuzz (like I am :) ).<br/><br/>Disclaimer - English is not my native language, so be gentle :)"

","Police Constable Nicholas Angel is the pride of the London Service, trouble is is that he is making everybody else look bad, so much so his superiors promote him to Sergeant in the sleepy village of Sandford, Gloucestershire. Yet all is not right with Sandford as the locals start meeting grizzly deaths, thus thrusting Angel into his biggest case so far.<br/><br/>The biggest question on most film goers lips was could the pairing of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg triumphantly follow the monster cult success of Shaun Of The Dead? Well the plot premise for Hot Fuzz hardly leaps out as something to grab the attention span of many, but they have crafted a tremendously funny film that winks at the action genre with genuine love and admiration.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg and his trusty sidekick, Nick Frost, clearly have an earthbound appeal that many {even outside of Britain} can warm too, not pretty or over svelt, these guys are fans of movies making movies purely for the fans, and it shows. Neither Pegg or Frost try to steal scenes from each other, both men after over a decade of working together are clearly comfortable with their coupling and thus manage to fine tune their working chemistry.<br/><br/>Once Angel {Pegg} lands at Sandford Village we are introduced to a ream of British Village stereotypes {archetypes actually}, all characters ripe for hilarious scenarios that our fish out water {big city cop} Sergeant struggles to comprehend. We observe as he is dumb struck at the ineptitude of the Village Police Force {erm service actually} and is then forced to work alongside dough eyed Constable Butterman {a film stealing Frost}. Angel's exasperation at where he finds himself is mirthful joy to us the viewers. The dialogue is priceless, one liners and hat tipping nods to the action genre come thick and fast, in fact you can watch Hot Fuzz repeatedly and play spot the homage each time. I mean come on people, we got both James Bond {a delicious turn from Timothy Dalton} and Belloq in here strutting their stuff. The action set pieces are not found wanting either, director Wright having the time of his life with the crash bang wallop that flows in the final third.<br/><br/>The test of a great comedy is how it stands up to repeat viewings, to me Hot Fuzz delivers no matter how many times it is viewed. For even when you know what is coming up next, the smile on your face is already there before the event, wonderful, wonderful film made by guys who love movies as much as ourselves. 10/10"
"vikingvampireparrot","10","45","89","6 February 2007"," Didn't think it was possible to top Shaun of the Dead, but they've done it!
","Hot Fuzz marks the long awaited return of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's partnership to the big screen. Shaun of the Dead left them with a very hard act to follow but Hot Fuzz easily achieves expectations and possibly even exceeds its predecessor. And the team stay close to their roots with plenty of in jokes and sly nods to other films to keep their core fan base happy. And of course there is the inevitable who's who of British comedy showing up in various roles throughout the film, most memorably Bill Bailey. Although I have to say I was sad to see that Dylan Moran and Jessica Stevenson were absent.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Nicholas Angel, an overachieving supercop from London who is making the rest of his department look bad through his diligent dedication to the job. Cue him being shipped off to a quiet Gloucestershire village, Sandford. Angel does not fit in with the local constabulary, who prefer to eat cake and drink excessively rather than do any police work. When lots of 'accidents' start happening around the village they are dismissive of Angel's claims that there is more to them than meets the eye and leave him to investigate and piece together the details on his own.<br/><br/>The story works well, slowly piecing together what's going on and there are various twists and turns along the way, if nothing too extravagant. The action set-pieces also work well, carefully treading that thin line between comic and just plain ridiculous. There are one-liners aplenty, as to be expected, and this will be another endlessly quoted film I'm sure (not that I can remember any at this point in time, I'm useless like that!). There is also an inspired take on THAT fence jumping scene from Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>Some brilliant characters are introduced in Hot Fuzz. Olivia Colman's character PC Doris has to be one of the highlights, every time she speaks it raises a laugh. It is also good to see Simon Pegg playing a different character from his usual geeky, lovable layabout. Nick Frost again proves his worth as PC Danny, who is more concerned with cop movies than actual police work. Other classics are the proper Gloucestershire copper who needs translating into English, the sly Andy's detectives and a recurring swanÂ…Â…Â…Â…..<br/><br/>All-in-all hats off to Simon, Edgar and team for managing to keep the standard up with their second film, especially with it not being as obvious a target for them as the zombie movie. I wasn't sure how it was going to work them tackling this genre but they have done an excellent job. Let's hope they continue their magic with other themes, maybe a revenge movie? Or a Western?"

"manar_alrawahi","10","8","12","11 June 2014"," One of the greatest comedies.
","Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.<br/><br/>The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets- of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.<br/><br/>The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.<br/><br/>The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.<br/><br/>I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous."
"williampsamuel","9","4","5","7 December 2014"," Funny, smart, and thrilling, Hot Fuzz is a masterful send-up/salute to the American cop movie
","In 2004, Simon Pegg and Edger Wright unleashed Shaun of the Dead, a gory, over the top parody of the zombie genre which delighted critics and audiences alike. Now, with Hot Fuzz, they've done the same for the buddy-cop genre. And they've made a film even better than their first. They've packed in more action, more laughs, and somehow, even more gore.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz stars co-writer Simon Pegg as Sergeant Nick Angel, London's best cop. So good in fact, he makes everyone else look bad by comparison. Thus he receives a less than welcome to be transferred to England's most crime free town and is partnered to the most inept officer in all the United Kingdom. (Nick Frost.) Before long though, a series of grizzly deaths sweeps the village. The local cops shrug them off as accidents, but Nick is convinced that the deaths and connected, and that he knows who's at the bottom of it. But the conspiracy may run much deeper, and be far more ridiculous than he could ever imagine.<br/><br/>Like Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz works largely by collecting every cliché of the genre, and then dialing it up to eleven. And I do mean every cliché, including but not limited to: the woefully mismatched partners who eventually become the best of friends; the by the book big city officer who alienates his small town counterparts with his insistence that everything be done properly; the endless shoot-outs in which hundreds of rounds are fired but only the guys can hit anything; the high speed chases filled with jumps, 1800 turns, and near misses; the cop with a theory no-one believes in; and lots of massive, gratuitous explosions. And just in case you thought of any I didn't mention, don't worry, they're lampooned as well.<br/><br/>And are they ever lampooned! For instance, at one point Angel and his partner engage in an adrenaline pumping foot chase down alleys, through backyards, and over fences, encountering every manner of obstacle- to catch a shoplifter. It's ridiculous, and yet they manage to play it totally straight, with as much action and heart pounding music as if they were after a killer. And that shoot out I mentioned involves nearly every single person in the entire town, right down to the doctor and the priest. And throughout, the level of gore and melodrama are ratcheted up well into the realm of absurdity. The reporter's death in particular is on par with Reservoir Dogs' infamous ear scene. This movie proves beyond a doubt that over the top action can be funny on purpose- take that Michal Bay! But Hot Fuzz isn't just a satire of cop movies; Pegg and Wright have managed to pay homage to some of their favorites while spoofing them at the same time. Nor is all of the film's comedic potential derived from deliberate overstatement. It also effectively utilizes a good deal of screw ball, fish out of water, and old fashioned slapstick, as well as a fair amount of humor relating to some of the village's more odd residents, such as the totally incomprehensible old farmer. Add in some clever (and sometimes dirty) wordplay and gut busting plot twists, and you have a very well rounded comedy.<br/><br/>Of course Hot Fuzz is also an action movie, and a very good one at that. The gunfights, especially the final one, are beautifully staged, the pyrotechnics are first rate, and the fight scenes are both brutal and hysterical. The supermarket showdown is a real treat, as is the brawl in the miniature town. The chases, both vehicular and on foot are top notch as well, delivering both action and laughs. Note should also be taken of the acting. Pegg and Frost's chemistry from their previous films is fully intact, and Timothy Dalton puts in a wonderfully suave yet creepy performance as the town grocer.<br/><br/>Quite simply, Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest, smartest, most action packed, most original, and all around brilliant comedies that Britain (or any other country) has produced in years. If you liked Shaun of the Dead, you'll love this one."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","13","23","6 June 2007"," Funny Fuzz
","I saw ""Hot Fuzz"" a few weeks ago before the big budget summer movies opened in May. Director and Writer Edgar Wright's ""Hot Fuzz"" cost a lot less than ""Pirates 3"", ""Spider-Man 3"", or ""Shrek 3"", but is by far the most entertaining and best written movie. ""Hot Fuzz"" was apparently this independent British film written by Wright and star Simon Pegg that became a hit in England and Europe. With its wry and clever English humor, and spot on farce of American action movies, this ad hoc dark comedy is outlandishly funny. Part of the genius of Wright and Pegg lulls the audience in the idyllic setting of the English town of Sanford, only to vector into faux satanic cults, mass destruction, and mayhem. A signature moment has Sgt. Nicholas Angel drop kicking shotgun toting grandma in the teeth. ""Hot Fuzz"" is admirable in its blindness to taste.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays Sgt. Nicholas Angel, the London Police Force's decorated super cop. He is so good; he puts the rest of the officers to shame. Consequently, his superiors assign Angel to the quiet town of Sanford which has the distinction of being England's most livable townsomething its township cherishes dearly. Very dearly. No longer in London, Nick no longer makes the rest of the police force look bad. At the same time Nick discovers that his girlfriend has left him for another man. Alone and in culture shock Nick arrives in the sleepy town of Sanford. Nick partners up with Danny Butterman (innocent funny Nick Frost), who is the son of Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny is excited to pair up with real-life action hero Nick. Danny is also a fan of the movies ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys II""an amazing narrative touch. Danny inquires of Nick, ""Ever fired your gun in the air and yelled, 'Aaaaahhh!'?"" Suddenly, Sanford experiences particularly grisly deaths (all darkly comic) in rapid succession. One is a ridiculously inspired impaling at a church. Sgt. Nick Angel suspects murder and focuses his attention on slick super market king, Simon Skinner (the great Timothy Dalton). Apparently, all is not what it seems in idyllic Sanford. Nick unveils a bizarre cult conspiracy. This soon escalates to automatic weapons mayhem in an action movie satire of ""Die Hard""-like proportions.<br/><br/>Along the way, Director Wright provides some wacky touches. There is a great sequence in which Nick clears a bar of drinking minors. And Nick and Danny actually watch ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys II"" during a sleep over which is hilarious. The fact that this foreshadows events to come is either sheer genius or just plain disturbing. Simon Pegg is awesome. Even in the abounding chaos Pegg maintains his English reserve and dry wits about himself as Nick Angel. Pegg is so deft at providing a light comic air in the most droll and most distressing moments of his character. Ultimately, this is a parody and Pegg is the believable noble hero. Nick Frost is sidekick genius. As Danny he is the kid on the bench yearning to be the hero. To the movie's credit he is allowed. Timothy Dalton almost steals the movie as the evil Simon Skinner. The former James Bond is such a versatile and talented actor. Here Dalton revels in the role and has so much fun with the over the top villain.<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" is a great dark comedy. It is well written, clever, and deadly funny. ""Hot Fuzz"" is a classic send up of all high decibel action buddy movies. It comically nails all the clichés, and creates some new ones. Simon Pegg is a star. He and Edgar Wright have made a great and entertaining movie for a lot less money than the big summer movies thus far. Someone should take note of this accomplishment."

","Hot Fuzz Edgar Wright Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton.<br/><br/>Words come to mind when watching a film of the immaculate value of a parody of action films, whilst being one itself. Just because they did it so well with Shaun of the Dead in the horror genre, why could it work a second time with the action genre, already way overdone?<br/><br/>It doesn't. Just kidding, no it is a well observed, coherent in being incoherent movie with nods towards Bruckheimer, Scott, the good one, Woo, Bay, themselves, Seagal, and Eastwood/Siegel among the many here.<br/><br/>It starts so formally, with a brilliantly straight cameo from Martin Freeman telling of the brilliance of PC Nicholas Angel, or should that be Angle? As he makes 'them look bad', them being his team, Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy, sadly short, but great moments.<br/><br/>From this moment of forced moving to the countryside, hilariously worked out via A Scanner Darkly style spying, we see how truly job-hitched Angel is, not even having time to spend with his girlfriend, yet his plant gets more screen time and respect. We are then taken through the real world of travelling to Gloucestershire, in traditional Wright way, fast cuts, huge sounds, shaky cam awesomeness.<br/><br/>It's a beginning of true hilarity, first time in the town he rounds up teenage drinkers, oh so true, and the town has a hoody problem, always on their mobiles, it's like life on screen, but of course the bigger issue with a new sergeant here is of course that the swan has escaped. No, of course not, that's not as important as the living statue annoyance, curse them.<br/><br/>That first night we finally meet Danny Butterman, 'C*ntstable Butterman' as aptly named by 'The Andys', two detectives named Andrew, great name indeed, and we also find the time to see Bill Bailey, finally some screen time for him, as the receptionist, basically.<br/><br/>It's a tough film to truly explain without giving away some of the many great jokes and set pieces, but let's start with the darn plot: There's somethin' going' down in this here town, and it's not gonna be pretty. There's murder, sorry, accidents, no, wait, sorry, collisions, conspiracies, cults, constables and all manner of c-words.<br/><br/>The film is funny as well as being knowledgeable of not only action films, but thrillers too, with some of the greatest serial killing seen in films, like when Adam Buxton's dumb reporter sadly bites the big one, well, the big one kinda bites him, it's worse than the same scene in the Black Dahlia, and repeated much more often, but it's so hilariously disgusting. Pruning sheers are used imaginatively, i.e. no beheadings happen with them, actors are given the axe, there's a heat wave for a fridge entrepreneur, and there's a snap in store for the new Sergeant, or is there?<br/><br/>It's tense in some scenes, action packed in others, makes you look twice at the people in your local Somerfields, and it never deviates from being a true Action Thriller, with Comedies. And the best part is, Julia Deakin is given not only more screen time than Shaun, but more lines, hard to beat 'Hello' I know, but they do it.<br/><br/>By the time the twists have been settled, the western moments have set in and the crowd have revived from the dropkick to Granny framer's nose, the film once again picks up, it seems that everyone has a gun, and their mothers, and it will be bloody. Cue slow motion, loud action music with bass and John Woo style leaping, and a couple of one liners.<br/><br/>The thing that film failed to do which annoyed me slightly was one scene in Somerfields where the DVD cases are everywhere and a zombie like henchman is fighting Angel, he should have got a DVD, threw it, and realised it won't work, just that damn nod would perfect it, but then again since Timothy Dalton is so truly hilarious at being evil, and Jim Broadbent does good work in the most obvious of roles in this unobvious film, and Timothy Dalton gets some good gore going, the film is almost perfect.<br/><br/>It ranks with Shaun of the Dead indeed, a perfect second movie, and Edgar shows his geekiness in not only the references with dialogue, but some of the shots, straight out of Bad Boys II and Woo flicks. The editing is as kinetic and exciting as ever, the jokes always work, or try to then get a joke out of failing, once again it melds well, the music isn't as good as Shaun but as long as it's done like the Shaun album I'll be getting the CD, and it's one of those films that deserves, and thankfully was, played loudly and rocked on without stopping for breath for 2 hours, it hurt ;)<br/><br/>10/10 instant vintage cult classic comedy, more C's"

My only real complaint about Hot Fuzz was the lengthy running time.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz could have definitely benefited from some editing, I would say a good 15 minutes. However, it could be easily forgivable as these are the guys whom brought us Shaun of the Dead, which I find to be the most entertaining horror comedy ever made.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and tons of other actions films you should really enjoy this film, but at times it drags on a bit and can be tiresome.

"simonparker1990","10","8","13","14 February 2007"," Shaun of the Dead has met its match!
","Hot Fuzz is simply awesome! I know I have said that about a lot of movies that admittedly weren't awesome in the past, but Hot Fuzz really, really, really is awesome! And believe it or not that is still an understatement for how much of a success story this movie really is. We've got superb characters, more gore galore, intense action, great murder sequences, a witty and inventive script, more cameos from British comedians, subtle references to great action movies and Shaun of the Dead, a great double act from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, a brilliantly fun turn from Timothy Dalton proving finally he's more than just that Bond who did two movies. In fact this movie is practically perfect in my eyes, some people might think the action takes over too much in the final act, some people might think that the movie isn't funny. But in my eyes this movie is everything I wanted and a lot more added on top, a superb follow up to Shaun of the Dead, and easily going to be one of the best, and actually could be the best movie of 2007!The idea behind Hot Fuzz is admittedly not as original or as funny as the idea for Shaun of the Dead was. The idea of Shaun of the Dead was interesting and amusing before I had even seen the film, the idea here has its moments but it seems actually quite rudimentary. However, what Hot Fuzz makes up with is a hilarious script, great performances and just more of a sense of gun and coolness than Shaun of the Dead had. Now it hurts me to say this as I adored every last inkling of Shaun of the Dead, but I still found Hot Fuzz to be a better movie despite the idea being not as creative.<br/><br/>Now then the performances of Hot Fuzz. Well once again Simon Pegg and Nick Frost prove that they really are one of the best double acts ever! They were great as the two best friends in Shaun of the Dead, here they're even better. Admiteddly Simon Pegg's character, Nicholas isn't as fun as Shaun was, but he's a bit cooler and he has a lot of great stuff towards the end. But Danny easily rivals Ed from Shaun. Danny possesses a child like innocence that makes you laugh like mad. His great eyeball sequence had me in stitches because it actually seems real, you can imagine someone doing that to get a laugh. And I suppose in a movie that's got a lot of fantasy action madness surrounding it, there is still the human aspect at the core that makes the movie all the more enjoyable. Its believable while still having the cool slow-mo action shootouts. Timothy Dalton relishes his screen time in this movie, he hasn't done a lot since he hung up his tuxedo as Bond all those years ago, but finally he finds a performance that really shows his talent. The fact that he is clearly having a whale of a time as well made me enjoy his performance all the more. He has some great lines and just seems so well, traditionally evil its great! <br/><br/>The other big thing I want to mention about Hot Fuzz before I give my hefty review a rest is of course the action. Hot Fuzz is parodying cop movies, so its obvious you'll get some action as well. And boy the action is cool. The action I suppose doesn't truly kick off until the final third, and when it does the movie seems to explode with, well there's no other word for it, awesomeness! We have a superbly staged gun fight, no scrap that we have roughly three superbly staged gun fights, a punch up, a car chase and oh we have a lot more as well. The action is surprisingly intense and realistic for a parody. And its this fact that makes the movie so much better. Shaun of the Dead got some genuine frights in the movie as well, well here Hot Fuzz delivers in terms of action and in terms of being a thriller as well. In fact some of the murder sections are surprisingly grisly and tense. I knew the movie would be violent, but I had no idea it'd rival Shaun in terms of gore. The thriller sections of the movie have their own moments of comedy, but they can be surprisingly tense as you sit and wait for the next person to fall foul of the murderer. The movies gory, but its also fun gory, so for those of you panicking that Hot Fuzz features nasty gore like it does in a movie such as Saw then don't panic. The gore here is clearly played for laughs despite some of it being quite nasty in places.<br/><br/>If you liked Shaun of the Dead, if you like action movies, hell if you like movies you must see this film! Its a triumph in British cinema, Pegg and Wright have done it again, now lets hope that lightning strikes three times when their inevitable third project arrives on our cinema."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","6","9","19 July 2008"," Funniest Fuzz Movie
","The incredibly talented team, Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who gave us gems like 'Spaced' and 'Shaun of the Dead' are back with one of the funniest action movies 'Hot Fuzz'. Not only does it brilliantly spoof the American action copper films, it also satirizes the English country-life. There are numerous references to films like 'Point Break', 'Die Hard', 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Bad Boys II' and the conversations where they're brought up are hilarious. 'Hot Fuzz' isn't entirely spoof. It's very much got its own sense of humour and the jokes had me rolling on the floor laughing.<br/><br/>The execution is remarkable. It's shot like a slick action film with quick cuts, sharp editing, adrenaline loaded music, heavy sound effects and lots of energy. Not only does this give it the Hollywood action film touch but it effectively contrasts with the calm, peaceful nature of the countryside. The whodunnit suspense element is well built. Even though not much is happening in the first hour, it moves at a very steady pace and there's plenty of comedy to keep the viewer more than entertained.<br/><br/>The unique comedic duo Pegg and Frost are fantastic as always. Pegg excellently mimics the typical action hero copper and Frost does an equally fine job of playing the comic sidekick who's the complete opposite of Pegg's Nicolas Angel. They are supported by an equally great cast that includes the always dependable Jim Broadbent, a pleasant surprise called Timothy Dalton and a comically mean Paddy Considine. Note cameos by Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, Julia Deakin and Cate Blanchett who provide laugh out loud comic relief.<br/><br/>'Hot Fuzz' is definitely among the smartest comedies. It induces hysterical laughter. It's got great action adrenaline. It's got chaos in a calm atmosphere. It's got blood. It's got murder. It's got explosions. It has adrenaline. It's got energy. It has weapons. It's got wit. It's got slapstick. It's sarcasm. It's got a swan on the loose. What's not to love?"

","Funny, charming and entertaining - Hot Fuzz is one of the best buddy cop and action movies ever made. It succeeds in every aspects and certainly not everything would even work if it wasn't for Edgar Wright's direction. The story, characters, dialogue, cinematography, editing, sound, directing and huge percent of the music is done so well, but like every movie in existence: it's not perfect at all. If i have to list the negatives, they are very small, but i still have to mention them. To be clear, those negatives are not all that huge to break or hurt the movie, because they can be easily forgiven and will not distract everyone from the experience:<br/><br/>The negatives:
<ul><li>The music is good and huge percent of it fits so perfectly in many scenes, but to be honest, even thought i liked the music, i wouldn't buy it digitally or on CD, because it's one of those soundtracks that is not great when you listen it on it's own and it does have some tracks that are ok and not memorable.</li><li>Towards the end there is a car chase, which is combined with a shoot-out. The way it was edited was way too much, even thought the whole movie has fast editing, because of the amazing style of Edgar Wright, but it did cut from shot to shot so many times at that moment and it was the only time, that i didn't like it all that much.</li></ul><br/><br/>Even with those flaws, i still recommend it to everyone, including fans of action movies to watch it. Check it out as soon as you can, because it's not worth missing out."

","I wanted to see Hot Fuzz so badly in the theater, because Shaun of the Dead is one of my favorite movies and this looked just as funny. Unfortunately, most of my friends don't share the same sense of humor as I do with comedies. So I rented it yesterday, watched it last night, and I have to say that this movie delivered great laughs and had a great story. It was so funny to see action movies for what they really are, Simon and Nick were such a great duo, I love these guys, they have such a natural chemistry despite being total opposite characters. Hot Fuzz is such a great parody of every action movie you have ever seen.<br/><br/>Nicholas Angel is a good policeman in London, his arrest record is through the roof, he has been injured on the job, and everyone likes him, well, almost everyone. The London police are a bit upset with how well he does and transfers him as a Sargent over to a small town, Sanford. He meets, Danny, another cop who is just completely clueless to anything around him. In fact the whole police squad is convinced that Sanford is the perfect town and nothing will never happen. Until murders start appearing, but they always look like an accident, but Nicholas is on the move with Danny to find out if Sanford is up to something bad.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a great comedy, I think I still like Shaun of the Dead a little better, but I don't know, I'm having a hard time deciding because this was a great movie too. I loved the Romeo and Juliet scene, how they were doing a homage to the remade version and their cheery version of ""#1 Crush"" by Garbage was just so out of the blue and idiotic, but so hilarious! I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone if you need a good laugh, Hot Fuzz will guarantee you that.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Mr_Hardcastle","10","8","14","11 May 2007"," Unmissable
","~Plot/Writing/Direction~ Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is the most outstanding officer in the Metropolitan Police Service. His arrest record is 400% higher than any of his colleagues. In fact, he's so good that his superiors (Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan and Martin Freeman) re-assign him. They send him off to Sandford, a little village in the South-West of England where nothing remotely exciting ever happens. But it isn't long before Angel has to contend with gruesome murders and strange townsfolk.<br/><br/>This film is mocking the typical American action film by being set in a small village in the English countryside. It is a clear cross between The Wicker Man, and all of those buddy-cop films (with a pinch of horror, too). There are numerous films which Hot Fuzz parodies, or makes (in)direct references to, including; The Munsters, Dirty Harry, Chinatown, The Omen, An American Werewolf in London, Masters of the Universe, Die Hard, Bad Boys, Point Break, Lethal Weapon, Crocodile Dundee, Jurassic Park, Judge Judy, and even the team's earlier film, Shaun of the Dead. So, as a send up of all of these big budget American thrillers, it's fantastic viewing. The comedy and dialogue between the two central characters is brilliant, and the one-liners are purposefully (but wonderfully) cheesy. The story eventually builds to one of the most unbelievable climaxes in an action film for years, and it's simply unmissable.<br/><br/>~Cast~ Flawless. What's great about this film, as well as everything else, is that it's full of familiar faces. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are excellent yet again, providing a good contrast to one another. Their back-up is superb in the form of screen veterans Jim Broadbent, Edward Woodward, Timothy Dalton (who must be the highlight of the film for me), Billie Whitelaw, Paul Freeman, and numerous others. And they're all put to tremendously good use in the explosive final-third of the picture.<br/><br/>~Music~ Most of the film is full to the brim with songs from the likes of Adam Ant, the Kinks, Supergrass, Arthur Brown, the Fratellis, Dire Straits, T. Rex and the Troggs. But in-between is a good effort from Bond-composer David Arnold. He succeeds particularly in the action sequences towards the end of the film, and notably works in themes which are reminiscent of classic Westerns and cop films while maintaining a modern, techno-sound.<br/><br/>~Summary~ I think this film has a very wide appeal, but it is people who can spot the references and appreciate the casting of the supporting characters who will enjoy it the most. It's laugh-out-loud funny, but is far more than your run-of-the-mill action-comedy. It's witty, clever, and the final third of the film left me speechless. If you didn't/don't catch it at the cinema, it's a shame. But if you don't catch it on DVD either, you don't know what you're missing."

","Rotten Tomatoes users rates Hot Fuzz at 95% with the critics only slightly behind at 88%. IMDb is in the same ballpark at 82%, and many of the comments in both systems compliment the movie on its clever writing. These numbers are extremely high... and decidedly young: the average age of the full house we attended in East Lansing, MI: ~25. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a montage of Nicholas Angel's (Simon Pegg) exemplary career as a London policeman. He's the James Bond of the department, with a genuine arrest record 400% above average. In fact, he's so proficient in all manner of police work the citizens love him and begin to wonder why they need so many of the others.<br/><br/>Feeling they're being shown up, the department as a whole votes him ""off the island,"" to a burg in a remote, bucolic region. Sgt. Angel, thoroughly idealistic and committed as he is toward toe-to-toe cleanup of the city, is dismayed to be no longer wanted.<br/><br/>But he takes it in stride and arrives in Sandford, where at first glance the harshest crime is mime statue-standing. <br/><br/>The first pub scene is revealing: Angel introduces himself to the middle-aged couple who own the bar and orders a glass of cranberry juice. The place is packed. As Angel surveys the environment, he notices several patrons are underage. He ejects them, the bar empties, and the camera fades with him at the bar with his cranberry juice and two deflated owners. <br/><br/>One of the patrons leaving is plastered. He tries to drive, backs up and crashes, so Angel hauls him to the town jail. Next morning, reporting to work, Angel discovers the man is no longer in jail and is, in fact, the son (Danny Butterman played by Nick Frost) of the police chief. <br/><br/>Danny, one of the town cops, idolizes Sgt. Angel the big city crimefighter whom Danny fantasizes in such American cult-cop classics as Bad Boys and Point Break. Young Danny's weird, childlike hero-worship combined with frustrations and people conflicts on the job, exasperates Angel even further.<br/><br/>Then people start dying mysteriously. <br/><br/>Angel's crime detection instincts and reasoning are remarkable (Sherlock Holmes-like) and he projects another refreshing quality: complete confidence and competence in doing his job. Last time I witnessed this quality in a movie cop was in In the Heat of the Night (1967).<br/><br/>But I saw a lot of it as a kid, and it's nice to see it again. But Hot Fuzz is too fashionable a movie to look backward: Angel develops a liking for his new #2 (""I wonder if Danny is supposed to be Sancho Panza."") and together they work to resolve the murder spree that the town leaders insist is only a string of accidents. <br/><br/>As the truth slowly dawns, Sgt. Angel looks like the next candidate for ""a fatal collision."" Now comes the ending, which I'm not going to say anything about, except that while thoroughly entertaining it's probably too long by two. My humble opinion (MHO). <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2007"
"Galina_movie_fan","8","8","15","13 May 2007"," ""Forget it Nick... it's Sandford""
","I have not seen ""Shaun of the Dead"" and can't compare the two but I am sure that ""Hot Fuzz"" is screamingly funny. The contrast between the first hour of a gentle comedy and the second part with the outrageous twists and turns and bizarre jaw-dropping events is hilarious by itself. The idea of keeping the picturesque sleepy charming village of Sandford the safest and the most perfect place in the country no matter what even if not original was clever. Two main characters, Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, the finest cop London ever seen but could not take too long and Nick Frost as Danny Butterman, Angel's partner in Sanford, the loyal Sancho Panza to Angel's Don Quixote, are great together because the film took its time to develop their relationship and to make them real and interesting enough to root for them. There are not just the references to and the parodies of the big budget American actions flicks. No, if you look closer, you'll find the homage even to a Woody Allen's film and to the works of John Waters -""Serial Dad"", anyone? The acting is universally good and for me the movie that stars Jim Broadbent, Martin Campbell, Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy and my favorite Mr. 007, Timothy Dalton is definitely worth watching. Oh, I almost forgot - there is a very compelling performance by a swan! <br/><br/>IMO, the creators got a little carried away in the final part and made it a little too long but ""Hot Fuzz"" is still one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time and I don't remember the last time I was laughing in the theater so hard and so loud."

","This movie starts out rather slow, plot-wise. And the zany humor is a bit hard to follow. It tricks you into thinking it's going to be some quirky, fish-out-of-water, buddy cop comedy, which would've made it an okay movie. BUT, once the 2nd half kicks in, it transforms into a murder mystery with some horror elements. Then it becomes a straight-up balls-to-the-wall action movie towards the end.

","I've always been loved the British cinema. This film is just the verification.<br/><br/>I don't know where to start from. From Simon Pegg (which I really love)? From the great plot? From the tons of laughs that gave me?<br/><br/>First of all, I really like Simon Pegg's work. I met him in ""Mission Impossible"" franchise and from that time I knew that I wanted to see more of him and his filmography. I like his Britishness! In this film I like how he portrays the strict person, so strict that is fully comedic.<br/><br/>As I've said, the plot was really great. First because it was actually a parody of all the American action films, that we over-watched in the past and this conspiracy thing was also great.<br/><br/>It's also a very funny film. It does contain gore, quiet splattery, but the blood looks really fake, so I don't think that someone would disgust. Besides, all the violence is represented in a comic form.<br/><br/>I also like that a professional policeman goes to a peaceful village, where mysterious murders are committed, so he tries to solve that mystery that the naïve residents don't think that are actual murders, but accidents!<br/><br/>Authentic plot. Great acting. Really funny. Successful parody.<br/><br/>I really can't find any flaws. Highly recommended!"
"thewillt08","8","4","6","7 August 2013"," Buddy Cop Movie Done Right
","Most people enjoy buddy cop films but a buddy cop film with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright at the helm; we get the best buddy cop film ever made. Sargent Nicholas Angel is forced to move out to the country where he has been promoted to Sargent of a village. He is not too thrilled but he soon finds himself engulfed in a murder case that the town is doing their best to ignore. The deep story is backed up by many laughs and moments this trio puts on the big screen so well.<br/><br/>This movie plays the stereotypical buddy cop movie down to the last detail. Angel is the tough cop who is incredible at his job who is forced to pair up with an almost useless Nick Frost. These two bring their chemistry from Shaun of the Dead and bring it into this movie. Nick Frost is not as funny as he was in his previous role but he does a much better job. He is a much improved actor and shows great range in this role. Pegg on the other hand is funnier than ever. At first I hated Angel as a character, as I think I was supposed to, but he grew on me and Pegg nails it. <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz ties absolutely everything together even better than Shaun of the Dead did. Things people say one time come back and play into the mystery. The first time you watch it you want to know who the killer is and solve the mystery. Great, but the second and third time you go back and pay attention to all the details. The details are revealed to the audience at the climax but going back and watching it again it is very satisfying. <br/><br/>The writing is better than ever in Hot Fuzz. This movie had the laughs but the strongest aspect was the story. For a while the story wasn't really going anywhere but introducing all the characters and getting to know the village. That all changes with the shot of the guy in the black robe, face hidden, and holding an axe. I remember the first time I saw that, my jaw dropped. That was the moment the movie got real and it wasn't like Shaun of the Dead at all. The twists and turns this story take is awesome. The reveal of the murders is so satisfying. I won't spoil but Angel comes up with this whole conspiracy as to why the people got murdered but he was wrong. When the real reason is revealed it was a ""Wait, really? That's so dumb but awesome"" moment. Its brilliant but at the same time it's a little lame. For the type of movie it is I love it but I can see people being annoyed by it. <br/><br/>The gore behind the murders is terrific. The axe and the staged car accident was creative. The explosion was awesome, the shears was disturbing, but nothing was better than the church scene. Hands down, the coolest death I have ever seen. There could have been one at the end involving the model of the church, but he didn't die, which made it ten times better. Let's just say the scene is suspenseful and it got a bit messy. I went back and watched how he died in slow motion and I don't regret it a bit. <br/><br/>There are some jokes in this movie that are hit or miss. Aaron A. Aaronson is a subtle laugh. When Andrew has the foam mustache on his real one brings out a smile every time. The laughs were not as consistent but it wasn't needed. The backbone of the movie is the story, not the comedy. In my Shaun of the Dead review I said that Shaun if the Dead was straight up better. I still stand by that statement but Hot Fuzz had the better stories, better characters, and it got close to better gore. Shaun of the Dead had a special impact on me that left a better taste in my mouth than Hot Fuzz did, but it really isn't right to compare movies it's just a popular topic. <br/><br/>If I had to choose some flaws I will have to call shenanigans on a lot in this movie. This is a segment I will call Reality Check. First of all, I'm pretty sure Angel could have denied the promotion if he really wanted to. I understand it is England and it may be different but the guy should have rights and be able to turn down a promotion if he wanted to. Secondly, after Angel discovers the truth behind the town I was thinking to myself that it wasn't possible. I can't say why without spoiling the entire movie but I can say that somebody would have to notice if people randomly disappeared. Before the murders Angel and Danny walk right by the guy in the black robe. The first time he is in an alley so I figured it was possible. The second time he was standing in front of a white garage door, under a light. Come on, I know Angel and Danny were drunk but they walked right by them. At the church there was no possible way for the murderer to escape due to the fact that he didn't have enough time. Finally, I think the lady would have noticed a guy in black trying to kill her. She takes it like a champ before he bleeds out. It's frustrating.<br/><br/>Overall, Hot Fuzz is a good time. I can watch this movie anytime anywhere and it has everything I loved from Shaun of the Dead. The cinematography was very much the same along with the humor. The ending was an action packed shootout I always wanted. Hot Fuzz is awesome and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval even with the parts I don't find possible."

It's hard to put my finger on why these guys' satires are so much funnier and more intelligent than Hollywood attempts at parody; all I know is that they never seem to stop and wink at the audience, if you know what I mean.

"tnrcooper","9","7","13","3 June 2007"," droll, funny, but also very satiric film
","This movie, from the creators of Shawn of the Dead, plows some of the same territory, but adds some acerbic social commentary to the mix. It is a clear homage to the buddy cop movies which have proliferated over the past 20 years, but it is also a comment on the sometimes corrosive, excessive, civic pride, almost incestuous in its intense devotion to all things local, in England specifically in this case, but it could be translated to other communities anywhere. It is very very funny and pointed, but this satire was not at all hinted at in the movie's marketing. The tribute to the banal buddy buddy cop movies of the last while is sometimes so broad and obvious that it is sometimes almost a re-make, but that said, it is nice that someone (director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg, who co-wrote the movie with Wright) recognize the pervasiveness of the genre. The story is that London police officer Nicholas Angel (a rather playful and unlikely name played by writer Simon Pegg) is exiled to the countryside because of his overly industrious ways and the fact that his industriousness revealed the laziness of the police. Once out in the countryside, he disrupts the routine of small town life by cracking down on small-time crime. He also, however, investigates a series of gruesome murders which the locals attempt to downplay but which he believes (correctly) are related. In so doing, he treads on the toes of many of the locals who have lived there for a long time and who feel they have some claim on the life of the community, to a much more literal extent than he might have anticipated. The acting is fine. No great performances are required. The satiric script drives the film and it is a very intriguing and clever plot. It is an interesting and amusing film with more layers to it than is suggested by the marketing."
"Jimbeeer","6","29","75","28 February 2007"," Mmm, it was alright
","Let me start by saying i love Spaced and Shaun of the Dead, both of which i've seen many many times on DVD (even got Spaced signed by the cast and Edgar) so you can understand my excitement on watching Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>Now i'm home after watching at the cinema both my wife and i thought it was alright. Nothing more. Don't get me wrong, i can think of worse ways of spending 2 hours but it just didn't feel as _sharp_ as shaun.<br/><br/>The best thing about Shaun is it's multi-layered. You can watch it again and again and spot things you missed the first time around. It credits you with a brain and lets you work things out for yourself. Hot Fuzz feels the need to help you along by using constant ghost voice overs reminding you of specific dialogue at salient points.<br/><br/>I think i was just expecting more from it, i was waiting to see slow-mo shoot outs in the village hall, fast cutting one-on-one shoot outs. Walking away from explosions with shotguns over their shoulder. There seemed to be none of that.<br/><br/>Although there were laughs, they weren't belly laughs. Anyone who watched Shaun will remember them bashing a zombie with pool cues in time to 'Don't Stop Me Know' will smile to themselves. It was more humorous with a couple of in jokes to older Wright-Pegg material. I don't think i actually laughed loudly once during the whole movie.<br/><br/>It also seemed to be for a larger audience. Shaun was cult through and through. It paid homage to so many zombie movies it was hard to keep count and some of them were so subtle it was hard to spot without multiple viewings (Foree Electronics anyone?). Hot Fuzz seemed more generic and tried to be a movie in itself rather than paying homage to anything specific, although i did spot the Lethal Weapon reference quite clearly.<br/><br/>So there we have it, it was amusing, but not funny. There was action, but you have to wait a while for it. And some of the characters seemed to be there just for the sake of getting someone famous in. I've never seen Bill Bailey so underused in anything in my life.<br/><br/>It was alright"
"MartinHafer","9","6","11","18 December 2007"," Far better than I expected
","When HOT FUZZ came out, I heard a lot of less than spectacular reviews and naturally thought that the movie wasn't up to the quality of SHAUN OF THE DEAD (which starred the same actors and director). This letdown after a blockbuster isn't uncommon (just ask singer Cris Cross or the group Boston) and I just assumed this was again the case. However, I was very, very wrong. Not only was HOT FUZZ a very good film, but I preferred it over SHAUN OF THE DEAD because it managed to make me laugh even more and I thoroughly enjoyed this clever film.<br/><br/>Unlike many films, I actually liked the back story when the movie began at least as much as the rest of the movie. Seeing how the hot-shot cop was punished for his brilliant police work was a great commentary on bureaucracies. I also enjoyed seeing Sgt. Angel as he sprung into action when he first arrived in the small town for his new assignment. I assumed from the promos that Angel was an over-zealous idiot, but was surprised to see he was just an excellent cop who lived in a world of idiots! This juxtaposition was often very funny--particularly when he made his first drunk driving arrest.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, it was also quite enjoyable, though for me the last thirty minutes were a minor let down. Now most will probably LOVE the over-the-top action and it was a cute parody on the ""buddy cop"" films, but I think I enjoyed the stupider and quieter moments in the film just a bit more. These charming little scenes of daffiness reminded me a lot of the town from the great BBC series, ""The Vicar of Dibley"".<br/><br/>The only negatives I would note are the film style and the violence. As far as the style goes, sometimes the choppy and ""hip"" edits actually seemed like overkill. Many may like it--I think it was just trying a bit too hard. As for the violence, for adults it's fine and appropriate, but since I am a school teacher I am a bit concerned to hear that so many young kids went to see it. For an older teen, it's a good film, but with kids as young as 10 or 12 apparently seeing the film, this is sad. Where are the parents and why the heck won't they exercise a bit of common sense?! This is a rated R movie because it's so violent--not the sort of fare younger kids should be watching.<br/><br/>I could say a lot more, but frankly with 12,305,308,028 reviews to date for this film AND because I don't want to divulge any spoilers, I'll wrap it all up now. Overall, the film is highly imaginative, fun, extremely well-written and engaging. While this WON'T appeal to people that hate action films (and I am actually usually NOT one for this style film), most others will have a great time watching it. Also, if you do watch, note the GREAT editing and choices of songs throughout the film.<br/><br/>What were those TV and newspaper reviewers thinking? This was one terrific film!"
"rguddu_india","4","8","16","12 January 2020"," Disappointing. Surprisingly high rating on IMDB.
","I was deceived by the 8-10 star ratings that come up on the first dozen reviews in IMDB. Am disappointed by this surprisingly poor work.<br/><br/>Some good parts & laughs: first 10 mins, e.g. Angel's interaction with his gf. Inaudible utterances of the old cop and the following translations. ""What he said"" by some junior cop. Suggested improvement in wordings, like ""police officer, not policeman, as later is sexist"", ""Police service, not police force, as later is aggressive"", etc. Angel guessing 'narp', following 'yarp'.<br/><br/>Bad: too fast cuts in the scenes (sometimes i watched at 0.8x speed to be able see what the scene wanted to say), lame plot, incredibly bad/childish scenes involving detectives. Repeats of same scene again and again, like denial by local cops was overdone. Some character's reactions are way over the top to make it 'obvious' to the viewer- fit to be in an indian soap serial. Horribly inexplicable the murders, supposedly happening yet noone in the village cares? The murderer explaining their motives to the cop one by one- fit to be in a 90s cheesy Indian movie. Handler of murderer phones him immediately to detail out all his motives for the 'understanding' of the viewer. Even the interview by seniors of Angel in London office scene had poor/cartoonish elements. Just everybody shown previously as normal people on street turn out to be villainous at the end. Horrible gun shootings scene- may fit in a youtuber's first attempt at movie making. Murderer appears out of nowhere, like in slasher movies, but this murderer was standing, in costume in the open, 10 ft from the serious cop.<br/><br/>I am used to 4-5 extreme reviews for any movie, but that's ok because reading first 20 or so reviews usually give a fair idea of how good the movie truly is. This one remains a mystery: how come so many 8*+ review even after scrolling down 2-3 times. I would think 3 to 5 stars out of 10 is fair."

Just as in ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"" starts of slow, and builds it's way up to a hilarious and amazing second half. It stars Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, a sergeant in the London police force who is reassigned for being too good, and making the other officers ""look bad"". But the small, innocent town of Sandford where Angel is reassigned to, turns out to be anything but that. After a series of grisly ""accidents"", Angel starts to believe there's something much bigger than than a few mishaps afoot. What you see in the trailer for ""Hot Fuzz"" is quite misleading actually, because most of it occurs in the first half of the movie. But after that, the movie takes a large turn into a completely different direction. That direction, which I'm not going to elaborate on, ends in a completely mind blowing conclusion, that you will not see coming. With that said, I would like to note that if you don't like British humor, you might want to stay clear of this one. I, myself, love British humor, and found the comedy aspect of this movie to be genius. In the middle, there are some scenes that drag a little, but it all builds up to the incredibly climactic ending. There's also quite a bit of graphic violence, though it is over-the-top. So if ""Shaun of the Dead"" was too violent, you may want to skip this one. And if you haven't seen ""Shaun of the Dead"", you should really check it out before going to see ""Hot Fuzz"". You will appreciate it much more. ""Hot Fuzz"" is an incredibly entertaining film. You will enjoy yourself so much, you just might explode.<br/><br/>****1/2"
"dr_foreman","5","11","24","21 April 2007"," Color me disappointed.
","I was looking forward to Hot Fuzz - but Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright let me down for the first time.<br/><br/>This is a very, very weird movie. It's a hybrid comedy-action-horror piece, and the different elements don't sit well together. Somehow, Pegg and Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" successfully crossed genres, but the same experiment doesn't work here. The action scenes seem tacked on, the horror comes out of nowhere, and the comedy simply isn't strong enough - the good laughs are scarce.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that the film is simply too intense. It's too loud, the cutting's too rapid, the scenes are too short. Oftentimes, Wright introduces tension and unease in a scene for no particular reason. This technique worked fine on half-hour episodes of his sitcom ""Spaced,"" but it gets wearisome in a feature-length film; beside, it undercuts the real (deserved) tension that develops later.<br/><br/>Another problem is that this movie is distinctly lacking a feminine touch. There are no major female characters - in fact, there are hardly any minor ones. It's very much an overdose of testosterone. (Perhaps ""Spaced"" is so good because comedienne Jessica Stevenson contributed to the scripts and prevented them from descending into this kind of boy's-own stupidity?) <br/><br/>I don't mean to suggest that ""Hot Fuzz"" is terrible. The opening scenes have got something, and Nick Frost is always at least cute. But the jarring shifts in tone, relative lack of laughs, violence, and darkness all work together to produce an unsatisfactory result. I'm looking forward to seeing more work from this comedy team, but they'll have to beat this effort to keep me interested."

","Hilarious action-packed black comedy about overachieving London police officer Pegg forced to transfer into the country by jealous superiors who ""Simply makes us look bad."" When he arrives in Sandford, he notices petty laws continuously being broken and commonly hears the phrase, ""The greater good."" This all starts to add up when citizens of Sandford begin dying in tragic accidents. Frost is terrific as Pegg's dim-witted partner, and Bill Nighy is perfect in the bit role of the chief inspector. Plenty of laughs, plenty of blood, but perhaps a little too much action during the conclusion (probably a little overlong too).

"jaysilentbob37","10","5","9","1 July 2007"," If this isn't the funniest movie of the year, that means we'll have to look forward to another movie as laugh-out-loud hysterical as this one.
","Comedy has always been my favorite genre. My sense of humor covers a wide variety of films, and I'll laugh at almost anything, regardless of how stupid, or silly it is. But once in a while a truly great comedy comes along, and leaves an amazing lasting effect with the laughs. While some comedies have you leave the theater saying ""that was funny,"" and then forgetting about it the next day, Hot Fuzz always hits it's comedic mark, and when you leave the theater, you'll want to quote it endlessly, and bring your friends to see it again. It will have you laughing for days.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), who's police work goes unrivaled in London. As a result, he is transferred to a small village in the country, Sanford, which is statistically the safest village in England. Not much for a hard-boiled cop to do there. The police station is full of cops so lazy and inept, that when people start getting killed in a variety of gruesome ways, they conclude that they were unfortunate accidents. Only Angel's clueless, action-starved partner, Danny (Nick Frost), believes that Angel may be on to something. And as in all murder mysteries, things aren't exactly what they seem...<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a flawlessly written comedy, with non-stop jokes, gags, and one-liners, delivered at such a rapid pace, there is literally no way to catch every one on the first viewing. I've seen the film four times now, and each time, I've caught some hysterical subtle gag that I missed the previous time. While many comedies don't stand up well to repeated viewings, Hot Fuzz keeps getting better each time I view it. There seems to be an unlimited amount of priceless comedy and detail in this film, and that you could watch it a hundred times and notice something you missed each time.<br/><br/>Now, as good as it works as a comedy, Hot Fuzz strangely works as an engaging action/mystery in it's own right. While the action and mystery is entirely satirical and played for laughs, the story actually manages to keep you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. There is a plot twist that actually managed to effectively surprise me. I don't know what surprised me more. The twist, or the fact that the twist was actually thrilling. The third act action sequences are also quite adrenaline-pumping, and feature some of the coolest (and loudest) gunfights in a long time. It's good to have some legitimate suspense and coolness with your laughs, and this film perfectly combines them. Though the first two acts focus on the murder mystery with almost no action, the last act completely makes up for it. You'll leave the theater laughing your ass off and feeling like you've just had a perfect fix of action.<br/><br/>The performances are also great, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have excellent chemistry. It is clear that these guys are the best of friends in real life. And the British accents are surprisingly clear and easy to understand. And Timothy Dalton stole the show for me as Simon Skinner, a sinister business owner who has ""criminal"" written all over him. Every time he showed up on screen, I bust up laughing more than anyone else in the theater.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is without a doubt going to end up being the funniest movie of the year. It is comedic writing at it's finest, and is a great movie in it's own right. I couldn't recommend it more, and give it 10/10.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is rated R for violent content including some graphic images and for language. Sex- 2/10 Violence- 9/10 Swearing- 7/10 Drugs- 4/10"

The difference here is this one rides its own merits of story, character and plot while reminiscing about those great to mediocre action movies of the past without simply twisting a scene directly form those movies.<br/><br/>Or simply: these guys are original. Like their last outing, ""Shaun of the Dead"", they made a movie here with just the right amounts of jokes and didn't rely too much on gags.<br/><br/>A definite must see."

Since Shaun of The Dead, I thought Pegg and Frost could do nothing even close as to what they did in Shaun of The Dead, how wrong I was! <br/><br/>I was laughing my head off from start to finish with Hot Fuzz, even the scene when Frost and Pegg walk home a drunk only for Frost to charge him £20 and for Pegg to give it back to him in 'change.' or when Frost asks Pegg what made him want to be a 'policeman.'

","First of all, how this movie has found its way in the top250 on this site is beyond me. But let's not bring out the axe yet, there are some positive things to mention about this flick.<br/><br/>The camera work, editing and originality are top notch and really impressed me. It speeds up like a MTV music video in the right spots to not let seconds and minutes go to waste in parts of the story that are not essential, though you still catch all that is going on. Very impressive work and I applaud that.<br/><br/>The story in the movie is a standard one - hardened and tough city cop gets - against his will I might add - transfered to the rural area of his country, a small village full of ""standard"" rural movie characters; the majority are simply uneducated, ignorant and stupid people, especially the local police force.<br/><br/>Now to the bad stuff: the manuscript, the twists and the movie as a whole. There are two movies in the history that I have never, ever finished watching because it got so bad, it felt like a true waste of time finishing watching. Casshern was the first, Hot Fuzz sadly placed as my second.<br/><br/>Seriously. When you watch a movie and you acceleratingly just sigh, shake your head and say to yourself ""Now what in the lord were they thinking when they decided to do it like this?"", it's bad. I won't go into details, but story-wise I was not entertained (except for a few moments) when I tried watching, it was more the frustrating way because the characters were so non-believable and the story got more and more aggravating the longer it grew.<br/><br/>The movie was simply surreal (in a bad way) and cheap. Not in its budget, but in its performance. You can't make a good movie with a crappy manuscript where everything is built on silly prejudices and where the twists and explanations are just pitiful. The movie simply fell apart to pieces."

","Let me start by saying that I did enjoy this film, but, it's certainly not worth the high scores its been given by many UK voters here. I suspect that an international audience will confirm this. Regional pride always seems to get in the way of objectivity in the UK. Get a grip people. The fact is that the script is fairly weak for large parts of the movie and it seems to me that they really didn't have enough quality to fill the 2 hour running time. Having said that I found the last 40 minutes of the film very entertaining as it's the action sequences that really shine. Giving the nod to many of the action blockbusters of recent years the movie finishes on a high. Unfortunately it's too little too late to save it from being classed as anything more than a worth a watch but nothing to get really excited about."
"merklekranz","1","26","73","20 October 2008"," Tedious nonsense..........
","First, at 121 minutes ""Hot Fuzz"" seems endless. Second, it plays like two separate movies. The first part is set up quite nicely with a big city cop being transferred to a sleepy little countryside village, because he is so good at his job that he makes the rest of the department look inefficient. After arriving in the small village, all of his fears about such a little hamlet having no meaningful police work seem well founded. Soon however, a series of what initially appear to be accidents, begin to arouse the new sergeant's suspicion that a murderer or murderers may be on the loose. Though there are moments of dark comedy within the story, the second part (final hour) is nothing more than ""cartoon-like"" violence, which becomes tedious and drags the entire film down to the level of total nonsense. Not recommended. - MERK"
"robert-temple-1","3","6","12","1 September 2010"," Not so hot
","This film begins beautifully, and for the first half it is amusing and admirable. But then it falls apart halfway through because the filmmakers decided, in a fit of madness, that it would be fun if lots of people began shooting guns all over the place, in a prolonged series of mock-violent incidents which are meant to make the viewer scream with laughter. But it is not funny at all, it is boring, tedious, and wholly ludicrous. So the film was ruined. I was really looking forward to seeing this, because I know Wells, Somerset, so well, and that is where it was made on location. I forced myself to sit through the horrible second half just to see the town in the background. (It is called 'Sandford, Gloucestershire' in the film, and the Bishop's Palace is turned into 'the castle'. In fact, in the film the Palace and the cathedral are never glimpsed, but the Palace Gate and moat and walls are seen, and there is a mildly amusing running joke about an escaped swan from the moat.) Some of the actors do a very fine job of their Somerset accents, and they manage some of the marvellous rural gnomic humour for which countless British film classics in years gone by have been famous, such as Sandy Mackendrick's WHISKEY GALORE! (1949) and Robert Stevenson's OWD BOB (1938, see my review). If only the film had remained in this vein, it could have been something to be proud of. But instead, it is such an abysmal failure that it is not worth a thought."
"DonFishies","8","6","12","24 April 2007"," American filmmakers take note - This is a hysterical parody done right
","When I first heard about Shaun of the Dead in 2004, I was a bit skeptical. It sounded intriguing, but so many parodies had come and gone and very little of them were actually good. So when I randomly went and saw the flick, I was more than just impressed. I was ecstatic. It was a breath of fresh air, and a very funny movie. And when I picked up the DVD, it only got better.<br/><br/>So when I first heard they were going to do a parody of the buddy cop/action genre, I got a little excited. And after seeing it, I can say that the excitement was well warranted.<br/><br/>Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a by-the-books veteran police officer in London. He lives for stopping crime, and works non-stop. But the devoted officer is not so well liked by his peers, who, for lack of better terminology, are looking particularly terrible in comparison to him. So the higher-ups (which include a very amusing Bill Nighy) decide that something must be done, and send him to a small village with a non-existent crime rate. Here, his skills are seemingly wasted, and his action-movie obsessed partner, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) is a bit too eager to hear about his high speed, shoot-'em up days in London. But when a bizarre string of accidents begin to occur, Angel becomes a little suspicious of the quaint village, and begins to attempt an investigation.<br/><br/>Yes, it sounds a bit more complicated than Shaun, but is it as much fun? <br/><br/>Just about.<br/><br/>Pegg and his co-writer/director Edgar Wright have composed what is probably the funniest and most honest parody of American action films  and it was not even made in America. Everything from the awkward partnership, the homoerotic tension, the friendly supporting characters who do not appear to be all that they seem, a ridiculous villain, overbearing Neanderthal-esquire henchmen, and more, are all on display and are each given at least one moment to shine during the film. Think of every cliché and every element that makes action movies action movies, and you will have a pretty accurate description of what you will find in Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp and quick-witted. Just as fast paced as the editing, you may find it hard to catch everything these characters are throwing at each other. You will either be laughing far too hard from the line before, or it will just come and go so fast that you will sit and think ""What did he say?"" Every line comes off excellently, and the nods and homages to other films' dialogue is just so subtle that it may go completely unnoticed. They just work it in that well. Much like Shaun, the pair use the elements given from the films they are parodying, but they use these elements lovingly, and sparingly. They make the material their own, and use it in a very fresh way (unlike the classless American parody films like Date Movie and Hostel where they basically rip scenes directly out of other films, without making any changes, and call them parodies).<br/><br/>As said previously, the editing is very fast paced. Scenes just come and go briskly. Wright has a very observant eye, and ensures that just about every detail is packed into his scenes. Unfortunately, the fast paced editing does not stay consistent. There is a very large dry spell in the middle of the film that just slows the film right down, and to a point, over analyzes a bit too much. Even more unfortunate is the fact that most of these scenes only have a few snickers or giggles that come out (from people who either think the line is really funny, or understand which film is being parodied), and nothing much else. I felt the same way when I first saw Shaun back in 2004 (although the former film also felt more consistent during these types of scenes), but felt it improved on further viewings. I can only hope that I will feel the same way when I see this film again.<br/><br/>Pegg is absolutely hysterical. Although he is nowhere near as much of a buffoon as he was with his Shaun character, he still has the same lovable tendencies, and the same crazy attitude. He brings a certain enigmatic flair to his scenes, and his on screen presence is simply unmatched by just about anyone. Yes, his humour is dry, but it is a lot less British and much more on the brink between British and American. He plays his character along this brink for the entirety of the movie, and even when he is at his most serious, you cannot do anything but laugh.<br/><br/>Much the same can be said for Frost, who gives another rousing performance as the even more lovable sidekick. His lines are even funnier than Pegg's, and his goofy work here helps offset the dead-pan seriousness of Pegg. While Pegg was just as good as he was in Shaun, I think Frost was a lot more downplayed and not as strong as he could have been. Despite that, his work here is still very good, and still very ahead of anyone in American parodies.<br/><br/>The all-star supporting cast including Nighy, Martin Freeman, Timothy Dalton, Jim Broadbent, and Paddy Considine, are all very well acted, and are side-splittingly funny. Many of them do not get nearly as much screen time as they deserve, but their material is felt throughout.<br/><br/>While it is not as good as Shaun, Hot Fuzz is still a very funny movie. I was a little surprised with how very violent the film is, but it only adds to how accurately portrayed the action genre is in the film. If you want to see parody done right, or if you just want a great time at the movies, than this is a definite must-see.<br/><br/>8/10."
"bob the moo","Null","6","12","26 February 2007"," Wonderfully witty film where Bad Boys meets Vicar of Dibley
","Nicholas Angel joined the police service and quickly made a name for himself, achieving an arrest rate 400% higher than anyone else and breaking many service records. Unfortunately this makes his colleagues look bad and he is ""promoted"" to Sergeant, not in London but in the leafy village of Sandford. Bitter but with no choice, Angel finds himself in the crime-free village and, although he tries to continue his work he finds the only criminals he can arrest are kids and a drunk-driver who turns out to be his new partner, Danny. However the accident rate in Sandford is surely far too high  a fact brought home to Angel when a series of grizzly ""accidents"" occur. But will anyone listen in a village where everyone knows no crimes ever occur.<br/><br/>It is perhaps unfortunate that Hot Fuzz came out in the same week as gun crime was the main story in the UK and politicians were falling over themselves to ""take action"" (because although black people have been being shot for years, the fact that ""good"" black people are dieing now means that the Government will act  fantastic). However it is testament to how much fun the film is that no tabloid jumped on this film in the way perhaps they would have knee-jerked against others. The film does glorify the American Hollywood action movie though, which indeed is the joke and entire reason for the film.<br/><br/>It does this very well by taking the conventions of the genre and putting them into rural England. The former is really well done and is never as lazy as some spoofs where such conventions are explained then spoofed  here they are part of the film and it works better for it. It is worth noting that they also do small village life to a tee as well. The obsession with keeping the image of the village and intolerance for outsiders is well used within the narrative and will strike a chord with those that know. The action is kept for the final third of the film but is better for it because, for the majority of the film it is witty, but the action is more silly humour  it works, but it is best that it is limited.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect film though and those expected a fantastic action movie with loads of laughs will be disappointed. The humour is more about wit and references rather than being a laugh a minute affair. Personally I found it very funny but then some people hated Spaced so I imagine they will also hate this. The direction from Wright is really good. Some of the cuts were a bit frantic at times for my liking but mostly it all looked good and played very well. The cast is roundly good and blessed with stars. Pegg mostly plays it straight and it is an approach that works as the script feeds a lot of the sillier lines to Frost, who delivers them spot on. The two have a great sense of semi-homoerotic camaraderie between them that really fits the action film idea. At first I did worry that the parade of British stars would distract but, aside from the early appearance of Coogan, Nighy and Freeman, it didn't really. Dalton was huge fun, Broadbent fitted his character like old slippers and support is roundly strong from Considine, Woodward, Bailey, Colman, Spall and others.<br/><br/>It won't be to everyone tastes then, and those expecting to be rolling in the aisles may be building it up too much. It a witty and English take on the staples of the Hollywood action movie. It is a bit long and gets silly at the end but mostly it is a lot of fun and the same audience that enjoyed Shaun will find this just as much fun."

Based on Shaun I was really looking forward to more of the same wit and chemistry but I was sadly disappointed for the following reasons:<br/><br/>Unlikeable characters: Lame, not sure if that was meant to be a joke humour: Lack of chemistry between characters: A mish mash of styles that just did not work for me at all: A failure to make the audience care about the village in which the film was set or any of its inhabitants: A long list of lame stereotypes that were not really explored and played with but just stuck out there: Extreme length: Poor script: A sense of cringe-making entitlement: Unfunny, unnecessary gore<br/><br/>Late in the film we discover that people whom the Council of village elders dislike are constantly being murdered in order to preserve the village's pristine image, yet we do not get a sense of dread or incongruity from the villagers, despite the fact that their neighbours and children (in some cases) are just disappearing: the village seems boring, not creepy.... if this was supposed to be a satire of small town hypocrisy then the unhappiness of the residents, even if only privately expressed, would have added to a sense of unease... As it is, the sudden revelation that cartoonish crimes have been happening on a regular basis is not a shock but is just blah: you don't care because you never felt any pain or grief re: the murders/disappearances - my response was: oh, so that's the twist eh... ho hum.... <br/><br/>Peter Jackson did the small town people turned crazed zombie killers thing well in Brain Dead- in this film when the old man with the rain coat pulls out his shot gun at the end, i was like... hmmm that was ..wacky... sigh. <br/><br/>Basically I hated this movie much more that a typical Bad Boys II type movie because it has the potential to be so much more: sadly it was lame, watered down and crappy...."

Of course, it gets dabbed from time to time with humor and some random romance story that has little correlation with the main plot. Of course, not ALL action films fall into this, but most do. It is a genre that has really good films (The Rock, Con Air, Die Hard, Speed, The Rundown), really bad films (Bad Boys II, Lethal Weapon 4, 2 Fast 2 Furious) and then some that are just downright ugly (Beverly Hills Cop 3, Double Team, Biker Boyz, Simon Sez). Now, we have the British creative staff behind the cult classic Shawn of the Dead providing us with their take on the genre that has garnished a lot of money but has established itself with a reputation of being mere mindless popcorn entertainment. What winds up happening is exactly like what happened with Shawn of the Dead: the spoof/satire/homage to the genre its portraying winds up becoming one of the best of its kind, better than most released recently.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz excels as an action film because of its funny build-up, its quite intriguing story, its ability to stay on track, excellent chemistry amongst the actors, and of course, plenty of gruesome action to sink your teeth into. Carrying the formula that propelled Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz entertains you, throws you off with its plot twists, and then has you on the edge of your seat when the action picks up. It does not contain any romance or pointless sex scenes, but that's instead replaced by a dosage of horror and mystery. The pacing is fast and furious, and refuses to slow down. The references come flying (some obvious, some vague) from all directions, and then it even ends like an action filmso plug in the ears if you don't like a lot of noise.<br/><br/>In this over-the-top spoof, we follow Nicholas Angel, (Simon Pegg) a top-notch police officer that is re-assigned because he is making everyone else look bad. That was pretty much established right from the beginning of the film. Next thing you know, he is in a rather secluded, clean, and seemingly happy town by the name of Sandford. Right from the get go Nicholas seems to be a bit paranoid and creeped-out about the mannerisms of the town, as he tries to teach the dim-witted but reliable partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Angel's suspicious rises as a series of accidents hamper the town. Nonetheless, despite the overwhelming evidence and logic he uses, the rest of the police department isn't convinced.<br/><br/>Following the same choppy-edited quick cuts from Shawn of the Dead, Edgar Wright does a fantastic job keeping the speed of the film fast, while leaving plenty of details, Easter eggs, and hints as to what is going to happen next. Adding to his fantastic direction are the funny visuals that can be seen in the background as the subjects in front of the camera engage in conversation. But even with the hints intact, you still don't know where the story is going, and that is thanks to the writing staff (Pegg, again, and Wrightagain). Hot Fuzz is actually a lot less predictable than Shawn of the Deadits also not as funny, but much more action-oriented.<br/><br/>We have quite a talented staff in Hot Fuzz that extends from the creative staff to the actors. Besides the hilarious and likable Pegg and Frost, we also have Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Paul Freeman, Stuart Wilson, and the Oscar-winner Jim Broadbent. While you may not know these names as well as the major Hollywood actors of today, just know that you won't get the typical stomach-churning acting present in the average action film. Hot Fuzz spends most of the movie building up using comical scenes, moments of suspense and terror; and then blows the doors down in the final moments. With a long, funny, yet satisfying shootout, a grand car chase, a tense final fight, and explosions left and right, the third act more than makes for its lack of gunfire and pyrotechnics in the first two parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: While referencing and giving nods to Die Hard, Point Break, Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon, and other superb action flicks, Hot Fuzz becomes among the better action flicks in recent memory. With a plot that actually works, characters are actually dimensional, and with content that is actually smart, this film is over-the-top, gory, but maintains the quality whether blood is spewing onto the screen or not. It may require multiple viewings to actually catch all the references, but with a film this good, you won't mind. It is funny, gory, and out-of-control. The British team behind Shawn of the Dead does it again; only this time hopefully more Americans will take notice of an emerging quality force across the Atlantic Ocean. Here comes the Fuzz."

","Ever since I saw the advert for Hot Fuzz in October 06, I was absolutely thrilled and could not wait until it came into cinemas. Shaun of the Dead is probably my favourite film and I couldn't wait to see more of those comic geniuses Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.<br/><br/>It starts off a little slowly... all the jokes in the first half an hour or so I had already seen in the advert. But then it gets going.<br/><br/>And it could not be more brilliant.<br/><br/>The complete and utter Britishness of the film is so lovable. The same sort of goriness appears as in Shaun of the Dead, but in a similar way it's not scary... just really outrageous! Fans of Shaun of the Dead will notice the subtle references to Shaun of the Dead, which makes it easier to connect to.<br/><br/>There are laugh out loud jokes the whole way through. Political correctness is forgotten. And there are also some ""jump out of your seat"" moments. There's a bit of everything... it's done with such care and perfection. The ending is completely unpredictable, and pretty sentimental too! All in all, Hot Fuzz is a film well worth watching, and after the brilliance of Shaun of the Dead, will not disappoint."

Too big of a stretch banking on the outlandish ideas and success of ""Shaun"". But that's OK they tried. It's just that if I had a chance to go back in time and decide to see it, I would not."
"MOOVYZ","7","7","15","4 January 2008"," Dry, over-the-top, in your face parody.
","I watched this on DVD last night. Immediately after the movie, I watched the DVD extras, which are normally boring but in this case, you get a lot of extras. And they are great. You get to go along with the director and 2 main characters on a media junket through the U.S. Don't miss this trip. It's great, in some ways better than the movie.<br/><br/>After that, I got on IMDb to give the movie an 8. But I realized that an 8 would be based on the combined movie and DVD extras. Many will only see the movie so I settled on a 7.<br/><br/>The movie starts a bit slow, working at the humor. It's actually more of a drama at this point. But once Nick (Simon Pegg) gets to his new assignment, things get better and funnier.<br/><br/>I'm not going to do a review of specifics, others have given you plenty. I will only say that the movie is fun. The writing is excellent, and was hard thought. This movie was not thrown together in a few weeks. The acting is, well, what can you say... it's a comedy and all the players add their parts well.<br/><br/>But know this... this is a dark comedy. It's not all gross-out, potty humor. It is in your face, but as a parody of big budget action films. There is a lot of subtlety going on here. What ""Shaun of the Dead"" did for zombie movies, this one does for cop buddy pictures.<br/><br/>I read many of the ""hated it"" comments here and in almost ALL cases, the complainers admitted to falling asleep or turning it off. Well, no wonder they didn't like it. This is a movie that has to be watched from beginning to end, and you should be paying attention. There's a lot to see and absorb. I watched it with sub-titles on (as I do for many British films) as it helps decipher some of the humor and language quirks. It's also a movie that can be watched more than once. There is real style and effort in this 2 hours and much will be missed the first time through.<br/><br/>So, if you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""The Full Monty"" you should enjoy this send up. And if you like it once, you'll love it more 6 months from now. There is genius in the work. If you're not fond of British humor or dark, edgy comedy, you'll likely not laugh. I actually only remember laughing once or twice, but I had a smile on my face all the way through.<br/><br/>This is an over the top (and under your normal view), in your face (and work your mind) comedy. There's a lot to appreciate. But please pay attention. Otherwise, you will miss the fun and give it a horrible score like those who slept through it. I don't feel anyone should be qualified to vote if they never really saw the movie, do you?<br/><br/>And don't miss the extras on the DVD. Pure fun!"
"tedg","Null","10","24","2 August 2007"," Too Fuzzy
","I'm recommending that you give this a pass unless you are studying narrative introspection.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" was quirky enough that it carried a presumption of cleverness in the small, so minor twists seemed funny and we were therefore amused. This doesn't have that character, at least not in the film itself  merely the idea. I wasn't amused, however lots of people seem to have been.<br/><br/>What is worth remarking on is this business of embedded introspection, a sort of a movie about movie-watching.<br/><br/>Of course all movies are about other movies in the sense that they rely on the past cinematic vocabulary for effect. And this type of movie, which spoofs others depends directly on us recalling the movies they quote to make fun of. We inherit narrative.<br/><br/>But there are further, deeper tricks that have become common now and this is prime example. The setup is that a supercop, the kind that only exists in movies, is sent to a small town. Some trouble is expended to tell us that the town represents reality, being closer to the audience than the world of the supercop. <br/><br/>The running joke is that he is teamed with a dolt who is obsessed by supercop movies. They watch some of these as well as talk about them (too much I think), and at the end, they enter that world of the supercop buddy movie. The trick is that we introspectively enjoy the original form (action, editing) and the layer above which is poking fun at them.<br/><br/>Okay, so far so good. Guess who the bad guys are? Well, we are introduced to the townspeople as a bunch of watchers. And an elite group in the town who more literally ARE watchers. they have the town covered with cameras and watch from a command center. As the movie segues into the supercop-world sequences at the end, the watchers engage in a battle to determine just what sort of a movie it needs to be. They are fighting for a sort of Frank Capra small town Stepford perfection.<br/><br/>Its ""Blue Velvet,"" which was a battle of two movies for dummies. ""Blue Velvet"" in turn was a cinematic battle based on the battle for narrative control in ""2001"" and Kubrick's ""Lolita."" (Which in run was perfected by Nabokov.)<br/><br/>So, its worth watching if you are a lucid viewer.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"matt-mcginty","5","16","43","4 March 2007"," Oh Pegg... where did it all go wrong?
","All hail the mighty Simon Pegg, two series of Spaced, an instant cult classic of a film in Shaun of the Dead and a multitude of cameo performances in the cream of British comedy... so what the hell happened with Hot Fuzz? This journalist, like many other of Pegg's die hard fans was ecstatic at the prospect of a new film featuring him and his partner in crime Nick Frost but left the cinema with a dejected sense of disappointment. Hot Fuzz cashed in shamelessly on Shaun of the Dead's success mimicking scenes and catchphrases beyond the acceptable point of cross-referencing.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's a decent enough film, Pegg plays hardened uber-cop Nicholas Angel, who is ousted from the Metropolitan police by his colleagues (great casting of Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy) for having a 400 per cent higher arrest rate than anyone else. Embarrassed, the Met send him to the quiet West Country village of Sanford to sweep him under the carpet. What ensues is a well contrived homage to the range of films and TV shows that rely on a seemingly peaceful English countryside village being the murder capital of the country.<br/><br/>While the on-screen relationship between Angel and the incompetent constable, Danny Butterworth (Frost) he is partnered with is amusing at times, it's simply not a laugh-out-loud comedy by any stretch. This would be fine if the films obvious one-liners weren't so clearly trying to be just that. Seemingly confused about it's genre Hot Fuzz flicks from comedy horror, to a bad episode of Midsomer Murders concluding with an action finale straight from Die Hard throughout its course.<br/><br/>This all may seem a tad harsh, but it's hard not to be disappointed. With such a great track record everyone was expecting an original and hilarious film from writers Pegg and Edgar Frost. What was produced was a funny film, less witty than its predecessor perhaps, but not without it's moments. The all-star cast of Jim Broadbent, Bill Bailey, Timothy Dalton and far too many more to mention are perfectly suited to their roles with the exception of Frost who's bumbling action film obsessed character sounds like a bad impression of Vicky Pollard with half the depth.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is undoubtedly worth watching but perhaps wait until the DVD. If you're reading this Pegg, I only says these things because I love you and you've hurt me. Now everybody chant ""Spaced: Series 3, Spaced: Series 3... """
"TJ1380","9","5","10","22 April 2007"," One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time
","It goes without saying that parody movies can be pretty hit and miss. While some of them can be genuinely funny, many of the more recent ones tend to fail mostly because they are nothing more than strings of jokes that seem to imply that the filmmakers have a near complete disdain for whatever is being parodied. These filmmakers can learn a lot from Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright and their latest film, ""Hot Fuzz."" While it is a great parody of action movies in general and buddy cop movies in particular, the fact that it's a parody isn't what makes it one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. That is all due to a sharp and witty script, a coherent yet absurd murder mystery plot that takes itself seriously enough to draw the viewer in yet not enough to forget how ridiculous it really is, and an obvious love for the movies it parodies instead of a disdain for them.<br/><br/>The plot centers around Nicholas Angel, a tough London police officer who is apparently so good that he makes the rest of his force look bad by comparison. Basically, he's the kind of unstoppable supercop that cheesy action movies are all about. Unfortunately for him, his peers get tired of him making all of them look bad, so they transfer him to the picturesque and practically crime-free town of Sanford to get rid of him. Needless to say, Angel is not happy with this change, especially when he meets the lazy, dimwitted slackers that make up Sanford's police department. They seem to be far more interested in going to the pub than investigating crime scenes, so they naturally take offense to the uptight Angel and his desire to crack down on all manner of crime (which he does the night he arrives in town even before he officially joins the police force). His only real friend on the force seems to be Danny Butterman, his overweight, clumsy partner who has watched way too many action films. Danny thinks being a big-city cop is all car chases and shootouts just like in the movies he loves, so naturally he's in awe of the tough Angel, even though he is told that being a police officer in the city isn't what he thinks it is. When it becomes clear that people seem to die all the time in grisly and bizarre ""accidents,"" Angel immediately suspects foul play, even though the rest of the police department is too stupid and/or lazy to follow up with an investigation.<br/><br/>The main murder mystery plot is (mostly) played straight even when it's at its most absurd. The humor, much like in Edgar Wright's previous film ""Shaun of the Dead,"" lies with the characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. Simon Pegg does a great job portraying Nicholas Angel as a nearly humorless, uptight, by-the-book police officer who grows increasingly frustrated by the incompetence of his peers. He clearly isn't happy unless he's solving a crime and arresting someone, and it's a lot of fun to watch him scowl and slow-burn at the apparent ignorance that plagues the Stepford-like citizens of Sanford. It's also impossible not to like Nick Frost as Danny Butterman. He has a childlike enthusiasm for the kind of two-fisted heroics that he believes he will be a part of as Angel's new partner. His friendship with Angel also makes for a sweet subplot as we see the uptight Angel slowly start to warm to Danny. The rest of the cast is spot-on as well, with the standout being Timothy Dalton as a sinister supermarket owner who chews the scenery at every opportunity. He's clearly having a lot of fun playing what can best be described as a classic mustache-twirling villain.<br/><br/>If I can find any fault with this movie, it's that it sometimes moves rather slowly. Much of the humor is in the portrayal of the characters and in the clever dialog, so much of it might not appeal to viewers who like lots of explosions and car chases. It must also be said that if you are one of those people, rest assured that the third act of the film more than makes up for it. Without giving too much away, I can say that the movie goes from a comedy/murder mystery into a series of completely insane and gleefully over-the-top action scenes that spoof practically every action movie cliché ever put on screen. In fact, I would recommend seeing this movie for the last thirty minutes alone.<br/><br/>I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard that the writers and director of ""Shaun of the Dead"" were making it. ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of my favorite movies, and I didn't think this could top it. Therefore, it means a lot when I say that ""Hot Fuzz"" beats ""Shaun"" hands down."

This movie is a bit slow going in the beginning but when the action begins it really goes nuts. I haven't laughed so hard in the theater since I saw Borat last year.

","I went along to this movie with high expectations, but low preconceptions. i was sorely disappointed with what I saw. The premise of the film was fine - a spoof involving an over zealous City Cop unleashed into the strange ways of a quiet backwater village. However the fundamental problem is that it is not that funny. Combine this with an overlong 2 hour running time and you are in trouble. The golden rule of comedy films is that no matter how good the content, they don't overrun 90 minutes. This one overshot by 30 minutes and was really a tight 45 minute idea.<br/><br/>The Director, Edgar Wright had a cross over cult hit with ""Shaun of the Dead"" - interestingly the remainder of his work has been more miss than hit. However on the strength of the success of ""Shaun"", a pretty strong cast was assembled including Bilie Whitelaw, Bill Nighy and Timothy Dalton. Valliantlly as they perform though, there is only so much that they can do with a pretty thin script.<br/><br/>Fot film aficionados there are references to other Cop Movies, and in jokes galore, with a pleasingly eclectic score to go with it. However the cod gore fest of some of the village ""accidents"" reprising ""Shaun "" moments are really sub ""Scary Movie "" stuff. And the Gonzo Police action scenes tire quickly.<br/><br/>Ironically the funniest moment for me was the most under stated. He goes into the village pub for the first time, empties it by clearing out all the under age drinkers, then orders a Cranberry Juice.<br/><br/>To be fair the 16 year olds in the Theatre thought the film was ""mental"" - and the plot is undeniably a good premise. But the execution is undisciplined and gratuitously slack hence my unusually low rating."

"samseescinema","5","13","35","10 April 2007"," A Valiant but Sophomoric Attempt from a Growing, Very Talented Troupe of Players
","Hot Fuzz reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is Edgar Wright's follow-up to the clever UK cult smash Shaun of the Dead. Both films run on the same fuel, wearing the chassis of a spoof picture over a more respectful genre comedy underneath. The formula works tepidly this time around, working off a less compelling genre (what can be more compelling than zombies?) and an even less clever screenplay. The same players thankfully return though, with Simon Pegg in the lead role and Nick Frost returning as his adorable doofus foil. The whole project feels like a valiant but sophomoric attempt from a growing, very talented troupe of players and filmmakers. It's not the kind of transitional failure that's bound to oust Wright and company from the business; but the sort of disappointing follow-up that'll quench their loyalists thirst just long enough to wait for their third, hopefully much-improved outing.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright mentioned at the screening last Monday that he and his co-writer Simon Pegg aren't out to make parodies, just genre pictures that are funny. So the chosen genre for Hot Fuzz is the Buddy-Cop Film, popularized by the likes of Lethal Weapon, Vanishing Point, and Bad Boys. Their own version of this cop duo is Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) and PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Angel has been shoved out of the London Metropolitan force for being too efficient. Bill Nighy, in a sly cameo, puts it shamelessly by saying ""You're making us all look bad."" So Angel is relocated to the crime-free village-of-the-year, Sandford, where he meets a dorky gang of police officers sitting around their precinct chowing cake. Without crime there's little need for cops, making Angel an irrelevance. Thankfully, a glib serial killer gowned as the Grim Reaper starts decapitating villagers nightly. Though the rest of the precinct sees the deaths as unfortunate accidents, Angel insights correctly that they're the work a murderer. So as the body count rises, Angel and his cop-flick obsessed partner Butterman, start an investigation of their own. <br/><br/>What must be remembered is that a British cop film hasn't been released in a while, probably because police officers aren't allowed to brandish firearms in the UK, rendering much of the drama that officers unload here in the States moot. Wright capitalizes on this fact and makes it a kind of running joke throughout Hot Fuzz. Without the fingering of triggers and clinks and clanks of reloading and cocking of the gun, Wright turns to every other noise to emphasize. Car doors opening and closing, the unraveling of caution tape, and even the application of a super-stylish toothpick all get their own ridiculous sonic exaggeration. The film also gets progressively American, Wright says, the further into the mystery Angel burrows. The dialogue repeatedly gets dumbed-down from talky British humor to single-syllabic American expressions. By the end, the usually over-explanatory Angel reduces his speech to a single, grimaced word: ""Idea."" But it's only these clever directorial tricks that remind us that Hot Fuzz is from the same womb as Shaun of the Dead. <br/><br/>Bluntly, Hot Fuzz just isn't very funny. It embraces its chosen genre as fully and lovingly as Shaun of the Dead did, but without the same clever severity. The jokes generally aren't molded to fit the Buddy-Cop genre and are scooped more often from the buckets of broad, common humor. Making matters more dull, the Buddy-Cop device fails to be compelling. Sergeant Angel is cold and mechanical, but not humorously so. He's a yawn at best. And though PC Butterman fishes out most of Hot Fuzz's laughs, he isn't much more than a broad, rounded goofball. The whole thing looks fine enough, as Edgar Wright is a budding, impressive filmmaker with a lot of insightful ideas about the movies rolling off his tongue; but this project is a mild misfire. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"

And here's the best thing I can say about it - after an hour of watching, I finally got up and left, and the movie didn't stop me. I walked away from this abysmal mess of a film, this slick fecal-matter bruiser of a bomb, feeling a bit like film makers have finally gone and done it this time: they've given up on real movie-making altogether and sold their greedy souls to special effects, and when they're not animating things, mimicking Saturday morning cartoons with cheesy computer generated effects, they're scribbling scripts in pencil on sugar paper and rehearsing for two minutes before committing their laziness to celluloid. All the big-name cameos in the world couldn't save this steaming turd of a movie, so why should I say anything about it, other than that it sucks. England should be ashamed to be making movies like this, and we should be ashamed to give these kinds of amateur-hour British imports the time of day.<br/><br/>If you're reading this and astounded by the ferocity of my review, and curious about this movie, then let me assure you - after an hour of it, you'll get up and leave, too."

","Hot Fuzz. Don't be thrown by the title. It is a fun flick that will keep you smiling and even give you a good laugh or two. Especially if you have a taste for British tongue-in-cheek humor. Not much of a plot, but you are smiling so much and chuckling at the goings on you don't really mind. Lots of fun stuff along the way like folks called ""The Fridge Magnate""...If you catch yourself smiling or even chuckling at that line, you'll enjoy this film.<br/><br/>DId you ever see a movie where the hero cries ""You mothers!"" and the camera shows a group of women with strollers approaching? Sounds like Benny Hill, right? No, much classier and cleaner. Have you ever watched a movie where the hero is a funny mix of a Monty Python, Reno 911 and Robo Cop character all rolled into one?<br/><br/>If not, you will if you watch this film. <br/><br/>Not the funniest, not the flashiest, not the fuzziest, movie you'll see but fun.<br/><br/>More entertaining than a living statue."

I loved seeing Bill Nighy and it just supports my theory that he is in every British film that has been made in the last 5 years. Also the guy from Hitchhiker's Guide showed up briefly. The fact that everyone in the town was the enemy was a nice touch and I saw it coming, but I thought it was really funny that they killed them for the reasons that they did.

","It is a great cop movie featuring Sergeant Nicholas Angel, he is ""transferred"" to Sandford, a sleepy town. Then murders start which the police take them as accidents which it is weird, some of the accidents do not even seem to be accidents. Nicholas tried to prove to the police that the accidents are just not merely accidents but murders. No one believe him so he has to go around the town to search for evidence. He meets Danny, a funny guy. They go around like the spoof of Bad Boys and others.<br/><br/>It is good, it is violent but it still has some humour to cheer you up. Those who watched Shaun of the dead, you will basically know what type of violence it has. It too has a strong use of language. Its suspense will also keep hold of you. There it becomes a great movie for you to enjoy.<br/><br/>It has some chase scenes and gun-shooting scenes which I enjoyed them. It is a rare sight watching a good cop movie which has humour. It is gritty. It is good to watch it in cinema, it will definitely crack you up and keep you at the edge of your seat. In this case, I like it."

","More great work from the writer and actors from Shaun of the Dead. Those who enjoy off the wall and often very subtle black humor will enjoy this film - those expecting a spoof movie may not as this movie is not an out an out spoof by any means - indeed it is certainly a cut above your average spoofs given such as the lame Scary Movie franchises as a result of i) better acting ii) better scripting iii) thoughtful and clever jokes. The jokes come thick and fast and you will need to watch this one at least twice to see every one. Looking forward to more work from this team.<br/><br/>The only misgiving about this movie would be the slightly slow first half hour (slow in the sense of very little action and few laugh out loud jokes - though still some very good subtle jokes), when Simon Pegg's character is first re-located to the village of Sandford. However, in the context of the plot of the movie, this start was probably necessary in order to build up the atmosphere of the village as being sleepy and rural.<br/><br/>All in all a class act."

","Hot Fuzz was a fun movie to watch. An action comedy that aims to please without taking itself so seriously. It starts off quickly by catching the audience up to where and how Angel the lead character got to where he is. The first half is more about clever joke set ups and letting us learn about Sanford and its townspeople. The second half is where the action kicks in and doesn't stop to the end. Along the way you get treated to some terrific detracting and the actors get you to believe their stories.

Simon Pegg and his colleagues are true comic geniuses. This movie is not only hilariously funny, it has true wit. There's real intelligence in this brilliantly conceived and executed screenplay. It was amply supported by equally fine directing, editing and art direction. I love a good sight gag, and the ones here are priceless. Which brings me to the cast which is so chock full of Britain's finest acting talent that they must agree. Good choice because this is a keeper for sure. {Psst...and Simon Pegg is kinda sexy, n'est ce pas?)

"jaredmobarak","9","3","5","21 April 2007"," Decaffeinated?Hot Fuzz
","Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are back, with a vengeance. Their send up to all those action filmsas they say containing names picked at random from two hats, one of verbs, the other of adjectivesis a fantastic melding of British humor, preposterous action sequences, gruesome horror, and a bit of romantic comedy thrown in for good measure. But then, what action flick doesn't have a little bit of romantic chemistry between its two macho lead actors? As with Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz is not a spoof playing on the weaknesses of movies, deriding them as a result, but instead a send up to the films that they themselves love and adore. By playing on the clichés and lack of realism inherent in those types of movies, Pegg and Wright, in effect, create their own addition to the genre, knowing full well what they are doing because they know action films as fans and want to do them justice while also pointing out their absurdities.<br/><br/>Not quite sure how this comedy powerhouse would hold up to their first masterpiece, I knew all was well once I saw staples Julia Deakin and Bill Bailey involved in the mayhem. Anytime the old ""Spaced"" crew can come out to play, I'm ready to enjoy. The premise of the film is as ludicrous as most popcorn action movies, seeing London's top policeman, I mean officer, being reassigned to the country for doing his job too well and making the station look bad. Upon going to the reigning safest city in England, he sees the bumbling team he is to work with and the small town values subverting him from doing his job. Underage drinking? It's OK because we are keeping them off the streets, anything for the greater good of course. Only when our hero starts to see what the town calls accidents are really murders, does he begin to delve deeper into the motives of the town's elders to see what is going on behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Credit Pegg and Wright for taking the time for some great exposition before we get to the all out gunfight of its conclusion. Viewers should be warned that this is a British comedy at heart, setting up the story intelligently and coherently so that the finale is that much more effective. Again, this is not a spoof of loosely tied together sequences just out for cheap laughs; it is a well-told, complete story that stands on its own without the need to catch every pop-culture reference included. That said though, the comedy is huge when it comes to the subtle hinting at appropriated images from past films. Pegg and Wright have shown with their show ""Spaced"" that they are the kings at pop-culture comedy, think ""Family Guy"" only less absurd in their integration to the story. Sure there are the blatant examples like Nick Frost pumping a clip of bullets into the air (Point Break) and the helicopter flying in slow motion above their heads (Bad Boys 2), and all the one liners culled from decades of actioners, however, there are also lesser known in-jokes like the fence scene mimicking their own Shaun of the Dead, and references to the Addams Family and He-Man among others. Even the Godzilla like fight in a model village, while already done in ""Arrested Development,"" is orchestrated to perfection.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is really all about the actors delivering the gem of a screenplay. The real action flicks are known for their special effects and explosions, but this film does not have the budget for all that. Instead we are treated with many close-up shots during big fight scenes in order to give the look of high-octane action yet keeping within financial constraints. It's the facial expressions of the cast that sell the scenes for realism purposes as well as for big laughs. Our lead is perfectly played by Simon Pegg himself. His dry sense of sarcasm and utter professionalism amongst the idiots of the nation make him the only person to save the town from destruction. As always, his sidekick is portrayed by, real-life best friend, Nick Frost. Frost's ability to be a child is superb and goes well with the relationship of student/ teacher evolving into one of equals. His asinine questions and giddy clapping and laughing are hilarious, but when the time comes to take care of business, he's ready for the big show. The supporting cast are all fantastic as well with their broad characters allowed to run wild, while honed in enough to suit the story. Timothy Dalton has some big laugh moments as the villainous supermarket owner, Jim Broadbent is having a blast as the easy going chief inspector, and Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall give us some of the funniest lines and reactions as the Andys.<br/><br/>In the end, the story really proves to be a lot more intelligent than you might expect. Pegg and Wright not only had to come up with a setup to their big blast of gunfire, but in fact came up with two explanations in order for their reveal to be effective. When our villains laugh and say their motives were so much easier than thought, it's great.<br/><br/>I'm sure many people will end up finding the film to be slow and unfunny, and that is all because of expectations we Americans have. We want our comedies to be broad and in your face, however, British humor is not as cut and dry as that. Hopefully the audiences here will give the film a chance for the great movie it is, or at least sit through it for the awesome payoff at the end. Elderly folk in an all out war with the police, having an unlimited amount of ammo? Only in England."
"sackjigler","7","3","5","21 April 2007"," Hot Fuzz Review
","There is a problem in my mind for someone like me when it comes to movies. I read into them a lot before I see them, especially reviews. Having that in mind, I have been all over this site as well as aintitcoolnews.com and rottentomatoes reading several reviews of this film before seeing it and realizing most to all of them were glowing.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I believe Shaun of the Dead to be one of the top ten funniest movies I have ever seen. It hit all the right notes with me, even when it turned into a real zombie movie toward the end. It was flawless in my eyes. So obviously it would be tough to have a follow up be that good. Kind of what happened with broken lizard. I saw super troopers first along with most people and thought it was hilarious, but what followed from those guys wasn't quite up to par with it, although I am one of the few that enjoyed club dread and really enjoyed beerfest, they just weren't super troopers.<br/><br/>So apparently going into this movie, I had high hopes. I wasn't completely disappointed, but I was a little. I felt the film drug on in spots and never was outright hilarious. There was a lot of fun to be had here, I just don't feel that it was taken full advantage of.<br/><br/>That's pretty much all the bad I have for it.<br/><br/>As for the good, there was plenty. These guys obviously have seen the movies they satire quite a few times. They are spot on with action clichés, anywhere from the bad boys circle cam to riding in on a horse, the gunfights and way over the top deaths. The pointing out one character who HAS to be the villain, It is all very clever. These two fellas work well together and obviously have a great sense of humor. I love the enthusiasm that they bring to the table, this one just did not work as well for me as Shaun of the Dead. Not saying it's bad, just saying if I loved Shaun of the Dead, I really enjoyed Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>I do hope Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg pick out some more categories to poke fun at and I hope it stays fresh and fun. I do recommend this movie to anyone who thinks the trailer looks funny or enjoyed Shaun of the Dead. It definitely has it's moments, but I don't feel the jokes work quite as well as before. But go see it, cause there is fun to be had."
"Stampsfightclub","9","3","5","9 April 2007"," excellent crime comedy with great lead duo
","When watching the trailer I was unsure what this crime comedy would give me as it looked quite dull and predictable, but I was completely wrong as I sat back and watched a thoroughly entertaining film with a brilliant cast that kept me interested from start to finish.<br/><br/>Shaun of the dead pair Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are terrific as the stereotyped 'good guy' coppers who are out to stop crime. The problem is no one believes Pegg's suspicions about the town they live in.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I missed the beginning but caught up straight away and the plot maintained a great exciting and humorous consistent which was a delight to watch. There are great action sequences which will maintain action fanatic's interests and the comedy and drama elements are also well established.<br/><br/>What made the film for me however was one of the twists towards the end of the film and the concept of loyalty and believability to the story was simply sensational, it was a complete shock and made me smile with excitement as to what would happen to the central characters.<br/><br/>The intertextuality from other action cop films such as Bad Boys 2 and Point Break is great and helps the movie create an interesting ideology of the crime genre. By referring to other texts the film is also able to apply a spoof genre which can also make it more interesting for viewers who enjoyed that type of comedy.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg's character Nicholas Angel is amazing. His slickness and power are great to watch and the type of dead pan professional personality he upholds for the majority of the film is simply breathtaking and lovable. Juxtaposed with Nick Frost the two are even better and create a great police duo.<br/><br/>The film has great suspense and is made more interesting through the amount of twists. I love twists in a film as they provide great excitement and expectancy. The suspense and mystery behind the central plot of a series of murders is great to involve audiences in the 'who done it' scenario.<br/><br/>WATCH IT!!!"

","Saw this on the 13th of this month, even though I originally planned to see another film that wasn't out yet unfortunately.<br/><br/>I heard the hype, so I decided why not? This opens with Pegg's character, Sergeant Nicholas Angel as an over-the-top with some fast-moving camera shots policeman, who's obsessed about being as good as he possibly can at his job - such that he can never really 'switch off' and relax.<br/><br/>He then gets transferred to the small idyllic-looking Sandford, and is partnered with an over-enthusiastic Danny Butterman, who's an action film lover and longs for the kind of high-speed car chases his favourite film characters get up to. These are later spoofed, such as Point Break and Bad Boys 2.<br/><br/>But as the plot thickens, and the village isn't what it seems, with some very gruesome murders happening to some of the village residents, Angel investigates and is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding the deaths. There's a twist in these deaths, as you might have guessed.<br/><br/>I have to admit, this overlong for a comedy, and a couple a few seats down from me did actually walk out about half-an-hour to the end, so those with short attention spans should probably stay clear:D It's also not hilarious as what I thought and heard it would be, but just mildly amusing in places. Think Surburban Shootout meets Heartbeat. I enjoyed it, but near the end it does get very loud with the gunfights so I thought I almost lost my hearing.<br/><br/>I see this as a kind of parody of these action films in a way with a British twist if you like."

","I saw this movie thinking that it would be funny based on the reviews I read. This movie is horrible. It would appear as though the writers and directors took a look at what they thought Americans would like and added a little bit of ever movie that America has made.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: The movie starts with a feel of a tough guy bad ass cop (Nick Angel) who is being put out to the pasture for being such a super-cop. As they setup Nick to retire in the office scene where he meets with his superiors, you want to say ""who didn't see that coming?"" as each shot unfolds.<br/><br/>As you get introduced into his new environment, you find that Nick remains a hard ass who basically leads a one man army against crime. You start to see similarities of a cross between Terminator/Rambo and Conspiracy Theory coming into play. Trying to offset Nicks tough persona, they stick him with a Charlie Brown like character so clueless on about everything that goes on who finally grows some balls toward the very end of the movie.<br/><br/>The suspense is second rate at best and the lack of subtlety with how they introduce the villains makes you grow more tired with boredom. As each murder unravels, and the continued denial of murders by the Chief Inspector, you have to think to yourself, either this is all a setup or everyone in this small town is headed for the loony bin.<br/><br/>When Nick finally uncovers whats going on, the rational that you hear by the criminals makes you wonder about the first hour and half of the movie (which includes pointed remarks on the turning a blind eye on crimes witnessed by Nick Angel.<br/><br/>As the movie comes to a finale, you have the Nick enter the town in a Western style (riding in on a white horse) with a Rambo element(body covered in guns). The gunfight scene is a joke and as you see each element of the battle, you have the urge to walk out of the theater.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It seems to want to be a take off of Lethal Weapon put on steroids and speed with a sprinkle of what some might call comedy and a poor attempt at suspense and mystery. Now add the feel of Pulp Fiction and Die Hard. Up until now, I would have been open to British theater. Some of the older TV series such as ""As Time Goes By"" do a much better job of witty humor then this movie could ever do. Someone might want to let Simon Pegg know that the MTV era is pretty much dead.<br/><br/>When I went to the theater to see this movie, I was the ONLY person seeing it.<br/><br/>Bottom line, don't waste your money. You'll get a better laugh from watching a TV sitcom and a better thrill from watching an old action video."

And the most dreadful crime of an un-funny comedy.<br/><br/>It's not easy making a comedy film; you've got to appeal to a wide variety of tastes. US comedies tend to amuse rather than have you laughing out loud. Except for the slap stick! Hot Fuzz being a British production you expect a more intelligent script, wittier and sharper writing. But it just ""plods"" along at a pace which would make a snail look like Usain Bolt.<br/><br/>Cinema audience chuckled at most, certainly never laughed out loud.

I can only imagine that the early reviews of this film on IMDb are by the die-hard fans. I fully expect the average rating of this film to plummet once the general public get to see it.

Even the 'unexpected' disjoints are by now mandatory rather than surprising. From knowing the premise and the writers, the entire plot can be fairly accurately predicted, right down to the fat one coming a cropper. Don't eat the paintballs, Mike.<br/><br/>Cinematically, Wright is going backwards. The trademark jump cuts reach a distracting and aggravating frenzy in the third act; either this is accidental and sloppy, or it's deliberate and obtuse. The budget just isn't there to do the action scenes properly, and the cack-handed attempt to disguise this is painfully obvious. It's neither clever, nor charming.<br/><br/>But worst of all, Hot Fuzz is lukewarm at best. It's dull. It drags. It's a parody of Midsomer Murders, not Bad Boys, and not a particularly sharp one at that.<br/><br/>Pegg and Wright are out of ideas.

I have just reviewed ""Paul"" - also a Pegg and Frost movie - and thought I'd better watch HF again to make sure that I haven't missed anything. So I sat through the whole thing on DVD - and no, I don't think that I *have* missed anything. Including the intended point.<br/><br/>When I say ""sat through"" I mean just that. I have to say that I didn't even smile once.<br/><br/>I suppose - especially seeing the vast majority of the reviews are positive - that I am being over critical. After all, the casting is excellent. The acting is first class. The blood looks realistic, not too Kensington Gore-y. It somehow doesn't gel though: the exaggeration of the Hollywood stereotype in the English village isn't enough to make a take-off movie work.<br/><br/>The camera-work doesn't help, either: a miscalculation by the director.<br/><br/>If I had to sum Hot Fuzz up, I would say that it almost mocks itself without putting an extra edge into the mix, an edge that might have saved a good idea from being an overlong, extended sketch."

","Simon Pegg is a police sergeant from London who transfers to the force of a small and beautiful English village that has virtually no crime but an extraordinarily high rate of death by accident. Pegg becomes convinced that the many bizarre accidental deaths are no accident, that there is a connection of some kind, and that they are actually homicides, but nobody in the village or on the police force believes him.<br/><br/>So far, this is familiar serial-killer territory. And it's supposed to be. It's a send up of every such film you've ever seen, with parodic elements of other genres thrown in for good measure. The musical score is a blitz that pounds us into insensibility. The editing is lightning fast. I don't keep track of these things but I could identify absurd rip-offs of John Woo, Sergio Leone, Disraeli Gears, Sam Pekinpah (""Straw Dogs"" in particular: one man trap and one shooting-off-the-foot-by-shotgun) and I don't know how many other elements of vernacular culture. They blended into one another, sometimes not so smoothly, and not just on the screen but in my by-now befuddled long-term memory.<br/><br/>Oddly, the acting is pretty good. Simon Pegg has the face of everyman. Timothy Dalton is splendid showing the hidden menace in his crocodile smile. And the dialog shows a good deal of sometimes keen wit. In the midst of the inevitable bloody, climactic shoot out, the local minister emerges from his church, his arms outspread, trembling and appealing for peace and love instead of all this violence. Rejected, he exclaims, ""Oh, **** off, then,"" draws two pistols and begins shooting.<br/><br/>I don't know. I guess it's my problem. But the fact is that the kinds of movies this film satirizes are so dumb, so repetitive and formulaic, that they are parodies sufficient unto themselves. But if you enjoyed the originals, you'll probably get a kick out of this. It's good natured. I prefer ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" but of course it's all a matter of taste."

This movie however, the trailer did not grab me but I was willing to watch as the previous movie made was a decent movie. I should have realized that the trailer and the previews for this movie was somewhat desperate as many movies get (Mr. Deeds for eg.) and I decided to watch it. I am glad I wasn't paying for this flick but I can tell you that this movie is more chaotic and very plaid. How the hell do you get distracted for an hour and a half with popcorn? that was the first for me. The jokes are too mild and there was nothing good about the story either. I mean if no one can see that the main chief of the the HQ along with some other key ppl are the villains in the movie (it's OK if you don't guess the few of the townsfolk as conspirators) then you need to put the crack pipe down. This movie was very disappointing and just went down the hole further. The only funny part I saw was was towards the ending where he kicks an old lady in the face.

","Hot Fuzz is one of the most revered movies of the year, and especially in it's native Britain it has been the object of unparalleled praise. I for my part, find the HF-phenomena a bit strange. The reason is not that the movie is crap, it's just not that funny. I have no problem seeing what Pegg/Wright are trying to accomplish, and their target is a good one when fulfilled. However this is not the case, and HF ends up being caught in a vacuum between action, crazy comedy and splatter, instead of being a crazy action/splatter comedy. The action is OK but not mindblowing,the gore feels awkwardly misplaced, and most important; the comedy is not funny enough. I find myself slightly snickering in stead of belly-laughing. Although containing the ingredients, this movie fails to be hilarious, and a crazy-comedy short of hilarious is unfortunately a failure. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the gore-scenes are the gross-out, squirm-inducing kind, not the ludicrous, splatty, funny ones. The plot is not the most important thing of this genre, but I was surprised by the smalltown premise, after the promotion of HF as actioncomedy/buddy/police-parody, which usually are set in the city. In summary; I'm overall disappointed, both due to my own (maybe unfair)expectations of what kind of situations the movie would include, but also by the failure to deliver the gags that actually ARE in the movie."
"pfury67","5","7","17","19 September 2007"," Decent movie, a bit long and the main characters are impossible to relate to
","First, let me start off by saying I think Shaun of the Dead is one of the best flicks out there. I was going in expecting another similarly stellar comedy. Instead, the chit-chat humor and quick shock chuckle moments that SOTD have are basically non-existent in Hot Fuzz. The humor is in the entire scope of what is going on. <br/><br/>There's no way to personally relate to any of the main characters, so the humor is seemingly in the disconnect. For example, somebody is over the top stiff and dedicated, another is comic book villain evil to the core, another character is simply annoying, yet another character is a big evil fuddy foe, and that's basically the joke. The entire movie is based on how nobody is actually like any of the characters, so it falls short of any personal connection. Yet Hot Fuzz tries to draw you in with the dialogue and fails to deliver with any good comedic substance.<br/><br/>The plot also suffers from identity crisis. Is it an action movie with lots of explosions and silly solutions to gunfights? Is it a slasher? Is it face paced? Is it slow paced? Can I view the entire movie without fidgeting in my seat? <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz really isn't a bad movie, it's enjoyable on some levels. I love Dalton in this movie, I don't think they could have casted a better fit for his role nor anyone else have pulled his character off so flawlessly. There are some funny moments too, but they are few and far between. The movie pretends to have a fast pace yet it moves VERY slow. So you're constantly trying to put lots of focus and energy into following the movie and the favor isn't returned.<br/><br/>The movie looked like it was a blast to produce, but in the end, it just isn't memorable."

","Detective Nicholas Angel is an exceptional officer. So much so that he is promoted and moved to Sandford, Gloucester as a punishment for making his fellow officers look decidedly shoddy by comparison. In Sandford the pace of country life is downright sedate and the crime rate is practically zero. However upon arrival it appears that while the crime rate is exceptionally low, the accident rate is sky high. Could it all be a huge coincidence or is there something much more sinister afoot. With the assistance of the chief constable's inept son, Danny Buttermen, an action movie nut who thinks that being a cop is all car chases and gunfights, Seargent Angel has to uncover the truth before another mysterious accident happens to him.<br/><br/>After writing, starring and directing ""Shaun of the dead"" Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg turn their sights to the action/comedy genre, transposing the usual American fare and bringing it to a rustic English setting. Simon Pegg decides in this film to take more of a straight man role and leaves most of the comedy to his friend Nick Frost, who does not let him down giving what could just have been the stooge role of Danny Butterman a great deal of charm and pathos. The rest of the supporting cast do their jobs supremely well, from the Oscar-winning Jim Broadbent, through to Olivia Coleman, Kevin Eldon, Anne Reid, Adam Buxton, Bill Bailey and the supremely brilliant Timothy Dalton who excels as the seemingly obvious villain of the piece. The script and the direction are superb and the film switches effortlessly between comedy and action and occasionally horror. The other mistake that the film so deftly avoids is the desire to slap some kind of love interest in there. By doing this it doesn't muddy the waters and simply lets the film stride those two genre's without having to pause for some pointless sub-plot.<br/><br/>Like all the best films this is one that gets better with subsequent viewings although just extolling the virtues of this film was not the main reason for my review. The main reason is to clarify one thing that always gets my goat about so many of these reviews. Many people refer to this film as a spoof. Let's be clear about this, Edgar, Nick and Simon are, undoubtedly fans of this genre and wanted to do their own homage to the films that gave them all so much joy and entertainment. In doing it not as a spoof (a la Epic Movie) and instead relishing the genre itself they have created a film that can hold it's head high with the best of this genre that the US has produced over the last 20 thirty years.<br/><br/>As Nicholas Angel says ...Punch that sh!t! Awesome!"

","Brits and Americans have different approaches to farce. When American filmmakers set out to be silly, they usually make their intentions plain from the start. In the first five seconds of ""Airplane!,"" for example, the audience knows just what they've let themselves in for. The challenge then is to maintain the lunacy without losing or tiring the audience.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright's golden touch is being silly without being camp or crass. With each subtle jab he leads the unsuspecting audience into a absurdist tar pit of satanic neighborhood-watch cabals, slo-mo boxcutter fights and poetic-vengeance swans.<br/><br/>Some American viewers unused to British culture and comedic sensibilities may not think much of this movie at first; but stick with it. You'll be rewarded with a richness of movie references and inside jokes, as thick and frothy as the ""Scary Movies"" and their brood without being suffocating. Jeremy Clarkson at this point would compare a creme brulee to a cheeseburger, or something.<br/><br/>To the reviewers here who disliked or didn't ""get"" this movie: Give up, it's Sandford. Yarp."

","After reading the reviews posted here I'm not sure why I should bother to add my two cents. This was positively one of the very funniest movies I've ever seen, and the people who say you have to view it more than once to catch all the references are absolutely right. I watched it with one friend then showed it to another and then to my husband and each time I caught more than before. Every time my husband and I sit down to watch a movie I ask him what he's in the mood for and he always says: something funny, with car chases and shooting and explosions. Finally I found one movie that actually fits his bill to a T. Simon Pegg is without a doubt one of the funniest up and comers and everyone seems to agree, but don't discount Nick Frost. His show Hyperdrive was a lot funnier than I had hoped or expected. They each bring something to the table and fit together like a glove humor-wise. See Hot Fuzz no matter what you thought of Spaced or Shaun of the Dead. You won't be sorry. One thing to bear in mind, I noticed that people who didn't like it probably didn't get it because they aren't British. I appreciate those who mention Midsomer Murders. Not a comedy, but shows the importance of fetes and best village contests. Brits (at least TV ones take this stuff seriously, real seriously, like they'd murder for it seriously). And the rest who didn't like it just need to loosen up and let themselves be entertained. One person mentioned recognizing a joke as a joke but couldn't laugh. This makes no sense whatsoever. If it's a joke release the laughter and this movie is definitely to be laughed at and with. This movie is for fun, hot fun. So enjoy your popcorn and enjoy the movie and please, most of all, feel free to laugh."

","Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are a perfect showcase of British comedy at the moment, and how to make a good film. This film has some of Britain's brightest comedy talent along with some good actors such as Timothy Dalton.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), is London's best police officer. He is so good he makes the rest of the Metropolian police look bad and he is transfered to Sandford, the safety village in Britain. However the village was hiding some dark secrets and has a high 'accident' rate. Angel believed that it was Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), responsible for the accidents, but the true was far more darker then that and gives the film a Wicker Man feel.<br/><br/>The comedy in the film is good and is a mix of good jokes, slapstick, visual gaps and parody. It isn't like Scary Movie or Epic Movie where those films just make fun of other films, but parodies clichés and famous scenes and pays respect to those films, like Shaun of the Dead did to the George A. Romero zombie films. It was written and well performed, and adds to my belief when British comedy is done well it is the best in world. They are also little Easter Eggs in the film, such as when Danny Butterman (Nick Forst) was looking through the bargain bin DVDs in the supermarket you see a Shaun of the Dead DVD in there. I also liked it that Danny was a Bristol Rovers fan, especially when I found out Bristol City refused to allow the filmmakers use their shirt.<br/><br/>They is one warning about this film, it is extremely violence and some people might not like that. I personally enjoyed it, especially at the end with Angel and Skinner."

"frankwhat","8","4","8","1 May 2007"," ""Hot Fuzz""  Sizzling Entertainment
","It has been awhile since I've seen ""Shaun of Dead"" but I definitely enjoyed it and was really looking forward to this installment. The best part of the British spoofs is they offer a far more intelligent sense of humor than their American counterparts. Unfortunately most of the mainstream audience here hasn't quite fully seemed to have grasped that concept, but there are those that can appreciate it. Luckily it appears to be catching on. I readily admit that sometimes I'm in the mood for the quick and easy laugh but more often than not I'd like to work for it.<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" wasn't as funny as ""Shaun of the Dead"", although I thought the story was a lot better. Another thing that I like about these British spoofs is that the film was good enough to stand on its own, even if the viewer didn't catch on to any of the references shown. Granted it won't be as humorous but still enjoyable enough. Whereas the American spoof movies usually rely on them alone, which is why they become quickly dated. The tough part is classic movies were paid tribute to here as well so if you aren't a huge film buff then you'll be left in the dark for at least a few instances. That should be enough incentive for you to brush up on some much needed cinema knowledge!<br/><br/>Some critics have stated that some of the parodies are way too over the top and completely unbelievable. Well that's the point as it was poking fun at how many of the action movies are the same way. Others asked, ""could the people in a small town really be that blind and not see or want to believe what was actually going on?"" Yes they could, it happens all the time in rural areas, as sometimes their people aren't fully equipped mentally to realize that there's more than meets the eye from time to time.<br/><br/>The acting was great and no one dipped below the charts on this one. This is certainly one talented comedic troupe. Even though they're all mainly classified as comedians, they are excellent dramatic actors, which is what adds to all the warped fun since they all basically play it straight. I really hope that this bunch continues to make another film in this fashion and that it won't take another three years to do so. ""Hot Fuzz"" was fiendishly clever and got the whole audience involved in its crazy antics mixed with a serious backdrop. These are definitely some short arms of the law you won't want reaching for you anytime soon!"
"xander34","10","4","8","30 April 2007"," Best comedy of 2007
","Edgar Wright, whose previous efforts include the beloved Shaun of the Dead, and the amazing Grindhouse trailer called Don't, manages to impress yet again in his latest film, Hot Fuzz. Also returning from Shaun of the Dead are Simon Pegg as co-writer and star and Nick Frost as the co-star in a loving, British homage to American action and buddy cop films. Nick Angel (Pegg) is the best police officer in London. Yet he's so great, that he makes everyone else (including his higher authorities) look inferior in comparison. He is then ""promoted"" to work in the small town of Sandford, where the crime rate is miniscule but the ""accident"" rate is soaring. As he realizes that the town is much more dangerous than it seems (intentional action cliché), he ends up befriending the Chief's son, Danny (Nick Frost), an inept police officer who wishes his life was more like the cops in Bad Boys II.<br/><br/>For the most part, after British directors have a hit, they head straight off to Hollywood to make their next movie. However, after the cult success that was Shaun of the Dead, Wright stayed in England, and Hot Fuzz is as British a film as they come. The humor is truly more universal than anything like Monty Python or Alan Partridge, which some may love and others simply do not get.<br/><br/>What makes Hot Fuzz so enjoyable is how much fun the filmmakers and actors are having on screen. Countless name drops and references to other movies are present, be it in the dialogue, the lighting or just a particular memorable shot. Action films that the main characters are shown viewing are intentionally spoofed later on in the film. In addition , there are dozens of references to movies that are presumably favorites of the writers. Young audiences might not catch such references to films like Chinatown, The Shining, and Lethal Weapon, and many more, yet the filmmakers implemented these allusions so that if these devices are unnoticed, the plot will not be affected.<br/><br/>The amusing bit parts and cameos range from Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan, to Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson and Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett. Yet the man who reigns supreme over all of them is ex-James Bond Timothy Dalton, in more of a decently sized supporting role than a bit part. Dalton is the mustached Simon Skinner, an absurdly over the top villain who seems to be at the scene of every crime Pegg's character inspects.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a great film compared to recent ""parody films"" like Epic Movie and to a lesser extent Scary Movie, because Hot Fuzz openly embraces the films it imitates, and the characters in the film play it completely straight, rather than acting as if they're in a comedy. Also, Wright actually has a strong visual and directorial style that accentuates the humor and over the top action. The opening of Hot Fuzz is a bit slow for some, but every single plot point covered from beginning of the film comes together in the erratic, explosive, ridiculously entertaining end."
"anagarwa","9","4","8","21 April 2007"," Great movie, action and comedy wise
","This movie was awesome, a barrel of comedy and action and stereotypes being destroyed/made fun of all in one. The action, I have to say was surprisingly good, i expected it to be just comedy but it was good. The comedy was the best, if you love Shaun of the Dead and 'spoof' movies that make fun of certain genres then this is absolutely the right movie. It makes fun of the whole romance with the main character theme, makes fun of the whole 'part of the larger picture' theme. Its great. Only thing that could have done better is maybe include more action though its a great movie as it is without having anything else done to it. If you get an opportunity watch it as the top of your list if you are an action-comedy buff"

Simon Peg tries hard but it just doesn't work this time. the other characters fail also.

"zetes","7","5","11","23 April 2007"," Not as good as Shaun of the Dead, but still fun
","Kind of a disappointment after Shaun of the Dead, but still worthwhile. It certainly is entertaining, after all. Wright's and Pegg's previous film took on zombie films, this one takes on cop movies. The creators follow much the same formula as they did with Shaun of the Dead: they hit upon all the clichés, but add extra layers to the characters and the situation that allow an audience to appreciate it as more than just a comedy. I just don't think this one is as successful. The friendship (again between Pegg and co-star Nick Frost) is fairly poignant, but the rest of the plot is so silly that the emotions don't register nearly as well. Plus, these characters, unlike Shaun's characters, didn't strike me as real people trapped in an absurd movie plot. They're silly characters, albeit with a little more character than the normal comedy (or cop movie), stuck in a silly movie. Don't get me wrong, though, the film has some hilarious comic moments. The over-the-top climax, which plays like a Sergio Leone film, is a lot of fun, and the solution to the mystery that is presented is especially clever. Once again, Pegg and Frost give wonderful comic performances. A lot of the supporting performances are good, too (unlike Shaun, which has a couple of useless characters and a couple of just plain annoying characters), including Timothy Dalton as a creepy grocery store manager."

BEWARE of the misspent £15 for two! Jokes are extremely bad, acting is pathetic, this film does not achieve anything: you barely laugh, there is no suspense, you're not surprised as the plot could have been invented by a seven year old and it does not make any point. I suppose if you liked scary movie and others of the same genre, you will like it. however, it certainly does not top Monty Python (favourite classic), or so many other excellent British comedies. Finally, I would not be surprised if they decided to make it a TV series that would be ditched after the first season as it would be slated by the entire country. Bit of advice, do not waste your time and go and see this. Don't even bother renting it, borrow it from a friend who has got more money than sense and then waste your evening but not your cash."

","Overachieving cop Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) gets rousted out of London for making his fellow constables look bad and ends up in Sandford, an idyllic Yorkshire town, where murders never occur (but there are a lot of accidents). Instantly disliked by the rest of the underwhelming Sandford constabulary, Angel is partnered with Constable Butterman (Danny Frost), the bumbling son of the local police chief, who has dreams of being a hard-ass action-hero cop like the ones in his extensive video collection. Angel soon finds that an escaped swan is the least of their problems and that paradise can be a paradox. The film is very well done, with Pegg and Frost leading a great cast of amusing characters. The plot is clever, the script quite funny, especially the riffs on political correctness, and almost every cliché in the action-cop genre is parodied. This is the second of director Edgar Wright's 'Three Flavours Cornetto' trilogy, preceded by the hilarious ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2005) and followed by the somewhat less successful ""The World's End"" (2013).

I had previously seen Pegg only in a Star Trek cameo, where his talents were wasted at the hands of JJ Abrams. Here, he shines.<br/><br/>As he is reassigned to a quaint British village, it slowly dawns on him that not all is as it seems, and that mysterious deaths are a grand collusion of the villagers. His sidekick is a naive but eager learner, and the two work off each other really well. The quips are hilarious.<br/><br/>The British villager characters are drawn wonderfully, even the little lady with her crossword puzzles is really a demonic killer. The plot proceeds from more of a cop mystery-and-detective story to outrageous action set pieces as we approach the climax.<br/><br/>In a way, the structure of this film is a little like Blues Brothers, an equally quirky movie: things start out reasonably normal, but by the end, things are so over-the-top that you're not quite sure where it transited from improbable to impossible.<br/><br/>I'll have to go see Shaun of the Dead now, even though the title did not sound very inspiring!"

For one thing it is British which I think is great because the Americans kind of steel the spotlight when it comes to film making but this film has shone out from most of these American films. Yes, every film has there downfalls but I'd have to rack my brains for a long time to find a major flaw with this masterpiece. The comedy is great, even better than its predecessor Shaun of the dead. It's a good even mix of both stupid and witty comedy that could make anyone smile. Sometimes when a film is meant to tick two boxes it can get too much of one and kind of miss the other out however in Hot Fuzz the mix of action, horror and rip roaring comedy comes out with one of the best products that you'll ever see. As with Shaun of the Dead it contains gore but its the sort of over the top gore which you can take seriously but you can tell it's not there to harm you for life. Another point that puts it high on any list is the use of catchphrases. Short dialogs that you will find yourself repeating to your friends and will make you and them laugh every time they're spoken. I could go on and on about the growth of the characters through out the film and the amazing performances from Nick Frost and Simon Pegg who never fail to impress. Enough of that.

I am gonna write you an honest review of what i think and what hopefully most others think of this fantastic movie!!! <br/><br/>Acting: Well, yeah, what you expect but nothing special. Simon Pegg does a good job as Nicholas Angel, and Nick Frost does a good job as Danny. Timothy Dalton was also really good in this movie, but he's not the good 007 as we know him to be, this time he is the bad guy. Really the acting was great by everyone in this movie, and NOBODY who reviews this movie can really complain about any of the actors. PERFECT!!! <br/><br/>The Movie: Just great, an incredible police officer from London gets transferred to a small town in the country, but as more and more people get murdered, it turns out that this town may not be as safe as it looks. The plot in this movie is great, and believe it or not this movie is actually very gruesome. There is a scene where a guys head gets splattered and it blows up, and a scene where a guy gets cut up, gruesome stuff! <br/><br/>Overall the movie is great, try it out, and you will be soooo impressed!!! Much better than Shaun of the Dead!!!"
"sme_no_densetsu","7","2","3","10 April 2008"," Not quite as satisfying as ""Shaun of the Dead""
","For those who don't know, this film reunites the key personnel behind ""Shaun of the Dead"" and attempts to do for 'buddy' cop movies what ""Shaun"" did for horror flicks.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are teamed up again and they demonstrate the same comedic chemistry that was at the core of ""Shaun of the Dead"". The support's a little bit better this time around, too, with Jim Broadbent and Timothy Dalton particularly memorable in their respective roles.<br/><br/>The writing is witty and shows a keen observational eye for the genre that's being parodied. Lazier screenwriters would have simply stuck to parodying recognizable movie scenes but this film mostly just accentuates it's own story with stock genre clichÃ©s. Unfortunately, I feel that they do this a little too well in the last half hour or so of the film, which is just as insufferable as a typical prolonged action extravaganza from any number of bloated action films.<br/><br/>The direction by Edgar Wright effectively captures the feel of the type of movie that this film parodies. Again, it's not so much about recognizable visuals but more of a case of new material that retains a distinct 'feel'. There are some nifty music choices as well.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a pretty good film but to me it starts to drag towards the end. At that point the action seems just as vapid as any other cookie cutter action flick. If your tastes gravitate to that sort of movie then you will probably not share my complaint."
"doctorsmoothlove","9","2","3","11 March 2008"," Surprisingly funny and worth viewing.
","Hot Fuzz is almost as perfect as one could expect from an action-comedy film. The story is fluid and believable. There is also a decent amount of LittleKuriboh inspired humor. By the power of grayskull anyone? Have you ever fired two handguns while in mid air? Also, Hot Fuzz is very well edited. From what I observed, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost interact so naturally together, that their on-screen appearance invokes a kind of brotherly humor. <br/><br/>Again, the editing is very well-done. There are effective uses of wipes, dissolves, fades, and regular cuts. In many of the pure comedy scenes, the cutting is very quick, which works especially well to entertain audiences. The fast cutting, at least I thought, implied that the film was serious which it clearly isn't. Another strong point of the film was its plot. It is surprisingly intricate, and only seems to fray at the end. The audience may be surprised when it learns who the real antagonists are. I was surprised that the film could do that. I pride myself on being able to identify weak plots. Unfortunately, the plot becomes predictable at the end, but this happens so late in the film that it doesn't significantly harm the overall experience.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. I don't know if I would purchase it, but I will support its position in the top 250 on the IMDb. Hot Fuzz is a special hybrid film that actually works. Although I haven't see Shaun of the Dead, I really want to after having viewed this one. I cannot recall a better action-comedy film since Army of Darkness. Be warned though, the film is graphic, which ironically adds to it's silliness. I wonder what the final epic of the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy will be. Let's just hope that it is as enjoyable as Hot Fuzz."
"gradyharp","8","2","3","8 March 2008"," A British Bellyful of Laughs
","British comedies remain an ilk of their own - smart, sassy, full of quips rendered so quickly that many are lost in the ether that propels the plot, and characters who often are such finely-honed parodies that they make us laugh at ourselves. HOT FUZZ is a fine example and it is a film brimming with a cast of some of England's finest talent who seem to be having as much fun as the viewing audience.<br/><br/>Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is one of London's finest new policemen, expecting a smart career in the big city, but instead is transferred by jealous superiors (including Bill Nighy) to a little village where his rigorous training seems wasted on the sleepy town. After a first night's arrest of youthful pubsters and an inebriate driver, he reports to duty to discover the that his first 'arrest' is to be his partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) who just happens to be the slow son of the chief, Inspector Butterman (Jim Broadbent). The staff at the police station resembles a vaudeville team played by such fine actors as Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Timothy Dalton etc, not exactly what Angel had in mind as a career advancing opportunity. But soon enough the threads of evil that are beneath the silly facade of the village begin to unravel and what follows is a hilarious, almost Keystone Cop attack on the loonies in this take off of an Agatha Christie plot that curdled.<br/><br/>And that only touches the surface of this witty little farce: the innuendoes pop up out of every situation, giving the astute viewer quiet chuckles throughout the film. Hidden from obvious view are little vignettes by such luminaries as Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan, and Peter Jackson! Director Edgar Wright, who wrote the script with Simon Pegg, knows his way around the genre and the result is an hysterically funny evening's entertainment. Grady Harp"

","If you like British wit and buddy cop movies, this picture is for you! From the creators of the film ""Shaun of the Dead,"" this movie truly does everything for the buddy cop movie genre that Shaun of the Dead did for Zombie movies.<br/><br/>Not just enough to merely spoof the genre, this film takes the concept to a new level with ""Grindhouse"" level over the top moments and edge of your seat adrenaline rush for the latter part of the film. The actors all really seem to enjoy their work and it shows in every scene. My wife and I both walked out of the theater thoroughly satisfied with the entire experience with nothing we could really think of that could have been done better. I really do look forward to seeing what genre these guys come up with next.<br/><br/>A quick word for the weak of heart, however. This movie is exceptionally violent with multiple instances of gunfire, gory deaths and profanity as well as some random sexual references thrown into the package."

","I went to see this movie at the local theatre tonight, as I wanted something to see and only a few English languages are played at a time. Boy was that a mistake. I don't know what kind of trash they were trying to push off, but this has to be one of the worst movies of the year. I fell asleep twice in the movie, because I just got really bored with the fantasy and lack of seriousness and maturity that would realistically surround the events that occur. !!! It started out interesting, then it just got really stupid and unrealistic. The last 20 minutes are ludicrous and a very sad and painful rip off of movies like Rambo or Die Hard. What a waste of time and money. I want my 7,000 won back!"

","This film is a great British comedy with a more direct style of humour. Unlike other British comedies that I feel are too subtle, this one has a slightly more American feel with some faster pacing and more outrageous jokes. The actors delivered this one perfectly."
"alexpitt-345-971699","8","1","1","25 April 2020"," Hot Fuzz - Movie Review
","I remember way back in 2007 when Hot Fuzz first came out. It was the talk of the town for quite a while, with people quoting several of the lines from the film and generally buzzing about how great it was.<br/><br/>All of this was for good reason. Hot Fuzz is an absolute blast, and the main reason this film works so well is one of the same reasons why I love Shaun of the Dead so much; the chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It's truly electrifying, and I also really like their characters. Nicholas Angel has a definitive arc throughout the film, and that was nice to see.<br/><br/>Just like the previous film in The Cornetto Trilogy, the script and the direction are incredible and make for some truly hilarious moments. I also really liked how they made a few jokes throughout the film and then referenced back to them in a slightly different way later on.<br/><br/>The third act of the film is extremely entertaining, although it does get a little too ridiculous. I probably wouldn't change anything, but it felt a bit off from how serious and realistic the rest of the film was. Again, I still found it thoroughly enjoyable, but a little outlandish. It could have also done with being about fifteen minutes shorter, and that would have made for a tighter and more impactful experience.<br/><br/>Overall, Hot Fuzz is a great film, with a wonderful narrative, a witty script, interesting characters, and some beautiful scenery. Apart from a couple of issues, this film is a blast from start to finish.<br/><br/>SCORE: 83%"

I'm usually not a fan of visual gags, but this movie is full of brilliant and artistic imagery that create a comedic atmosphere for the whole movie. It's brilliant the way Hot Fuzz uses camera work, editing, and in some cases, acting to make visual gags that are as funny as they are striking. To me, this is a near perfect movie that will maybe in the future, become one of my favorite movies. It may not be for everyone, but I can recommend Hot Fuzz to a variety of people I know."

","This is a great comedy. It has that fun quirky indie feel to it with none of the low budget drippy music let down. Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel. Angel is London's greatest policeman. In fact he is too good and makes the rest of the force look bad. They promote him and railroad him out to Sanford, a village which constantly wins ""Village of the Year"" awards. They have a low crime rate, primarily because the police don't arrest anyone, a British version of Mayberry. This puts Angel at odds with everyone in town, whom remain polite as he seemingly busts everyone in the peaceful village. The comedy is greater good.

"GiraffeDoor","8","1","1","17 March 2019"," Impeccable pastiche of the action genre that is after a point a fine example of it.
","I really struggle to root for cops in movies but I can put my own biases aside for this movie.<br/><br/>""Simon Pegg plays an ace cop who is moved to a sleepy village to stop his superiors looking bad"". Thus ran the newspaper review that my dad read to me when we were picking a movie to see. And like he said after words: ""That summary DOES NOT prepare you for what you're about to see.""<br/><br/>A pastiche of action movies the same way Shaun of the dead was sort of supposed to be a pastiche of zombie movies but this time they actually are.<br/><br/>Pegg is the no nonsense pig who ""cannot turn off"" while Frost is the film buff that's only on the force to be like his favourite cinematic actioneers. As usual they make wonderful chemisty and yes you will believe Simon Pegg is a serious character in contrast to his incompetent slacker from Shaun.<br/><br/>Many jokes are made on the banality of real police work in the fantasy of rural britain. This is our first act. And then people start dying. It's BRUTAL. I'd never seen actual deaths shown on screen before. But people in the theatre were laughing...<br/><br/>it develops pretty nicely as a sort of semi-gothic mystery and then climaxes in an unforgettable shoot-out where the film becomes the movie that it is trying parody (but still funny). It's an expectation vs reality check that then transforms into the expectation. It's awesome.<br/><br/>it is NOT for the squeamish. Even if you could take Shaun this could easily be too much for some people<br/><br/>Despite having an officer for its hero, I'm glad I saw this and I know I will one day watch it again."

That's just how meticulously thought-out and devilishly well-made 'Hot Fuzz (2010)' really is, working on multiple levels each as successfully as the last, and it's also the thing that most closely ties the 'Cornetto trilogy' together. The flick is simultaneously a hilarious comedy, a successful spoof, an exciting action-thriller, a believable buddy-cop 'bromance', a fish-out-of-water tale and a dark detective drama. Every frame of film and every word of the screenplay feels like they've been wholly controlled by masters of the craft to create the ultimate viewing experience of this kind and one of the best films ever made. 10/10"
"bowmanblue","9","1","1","7 April 2018"," Action has never been so much fun
","'Hot Fuzz' is one of those - rarest of - films which not only spans numerous genres, but is also enjoyable to many different demographics. It's easy to say that 'action' films are a 'male dominated' niche and 'Hot Fuzz' certainly has plenty of action contained within. In fact... it may ever have more shoot-outs and set-pieces than your average straight-to-DVD B-movie with an once well-known muscled leading man at the helm. However, why 'Hot Fuzz' succeeds on so many levels is because you don't have to be a fan of action movies to appreciate it, largely because of its humour. Yes, it's also a comedy. And a 'buddy-cop' film. And has large moments of character development and, dare I say drama as well. <br/><br/>Because of this, I can see it almost appealing to any adult of any age. I won't say 'fun for all the family' as, because of its 'adult language' it probably wouldn't be suitable for youngsters. However, if you don't mind the odd swear word, then join London's best police officer (Simon Pegg) who is, in fact, so good at his job that his superiors decide to transfer him to a sleepy little country town because he's making all the other officers look bad by catching too many criminals.<br/><br/>Naturally, the move makes him a little uncomfortable, being used to dealing with drug dealers and murderers and now forced to - effectively - rescue cats from tall trees. However, the local 'bobby' (Nick Frost) is on hand to 'acclimatise' him to his new life. But, as fate would have it, this idyllic little town soon shows it's hiding some dark secrets which need the pair to investigate.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the plot any further as it's a film that you really do need to see to enjoy. The village is also home to plenty of colourful characters, all of which add to the story and bring their best performances to the table. You may have also seen the Pegg/Frost collaborations 'Shaun of the Dead, The World's End' and 'Paul,' so you'll probably know the type of film you're going to get here - a genuinely funny film which lovingly pokes fun at a genre the film-makers clearly hold in high regard"
"classicsoncall","8","1","1","31 March 2018"," ""Is it true that there is a place in a man's head that if you shoot it, it will blow up?""
","By the Power of Gray Skull! - this film was a blast! I don't go in much for slapstick, but this picture was more that that. It's a finely directed and acted send-up parody of American cop movies, and the homages are both obvious and subtle. Danny Butterman's (Nick Frost) repeated mentions of ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys II"" are the most blatant examples, but there was that one scene with the bear trap that was straight out of ""Straw Dogs"". There's both the original English version and the American remake, and either one works, but ""Hot Fuzz"" is a British film after all. <br/><br/>What's kind of interesting about the story is that it was actually a pretty good murder mystery if you were to remove the comic elements, but then I would ask, why would you want to? Simon Pegg and Nick Frost aren't necessarily hilarious per se, but the situations they find themselves in produce so many clever and funny scenes that it's impossible not to bust a gut. To quote an earlier collaboration between Pegg, Frost and director Edgar Wright in ""Shaun of the Dead"", the trio came up with another slice of fried gold. <br/><br/>So if you want to meet 'the cop that can't be stopped', you have to grab a copy of ""Hot Fuzz"" right off and treat yourself to a good time. The only thing I wish the film makers would have expanded on was the bit about the Living Statue. That had a lot of potential but came to an abrupt end with all the other victims of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance. But if that's the only spot of bother I can come up with, you have to know I had a good time with this flick. I think you will too."
"sharkfit96","6","1","1","25 August 2017"," Fun movie
","Really fun movie, except for any scene that involves a firearm. Especially the one where Danny pumps a shotgun and then tosses it Towards a bad guy and when the gun hits the ground it goes off! Um, no guns don't do that. Guns have what's called a sear block that only moves out of the way of the firing pin when the trigger is pressed. Hollyweirdos would like us to believe that guns just go off at random, but the truth is that they are specifically designed to only go off when the trigger is pulled."
"alindsay-al","10","1","1","3 July 2017"," A truly epic buddy cop film
","Before going to see Edgar wrights new film baby driver I had to rewatch probably my favourite film of his witch is hot fuzz. The premise of the film sees an exceptional police officer transferred from London to a little village where he attempts to work out why the crime rate is so low. Simon pegg plays the lead in this film and he is excellent in this film, he was the perfect person to play this by the numbers police officer and it is truly great to see his character develop with the film and watch him just have so much fun in the role. Nic frost is also in this film playing his partner and he owns his role as well, there chemistry is absolutely brilliant and is really the driving force in this film. Seeing there friendship grow is great and shows just how good both of these performers are especially together. Timothy Dalton is in this film as a supermarket owner and you can tell he is having so much fun in the role, he plays up his sleezy persona and he seems to be having a blast in this film. Jim broadbent plays the police inspector in this film an he is great, he also plays up his role well and I found him one of the more interesting characters in this film. Also credit has to go to the whole police force who were all really funny in this film and bounced off each other very well. The story has just a really fun feel about it as you see pegg try and work out what this village is all about. As the film progresses there are more twists and turns that work and do come as a surprise which leads to a very memorable third act. The script has so many great lines, the humour is so crisp and hilarious that it makes all these characters fun to watch. But also the drama when used is really good as well. The style of the film plays up all the action clichés but it works to add to the humour in this film. The action scenes are really fun to watch and with the style used makes it a truly memorable style. Overall this is a truly epic film that needs to be seen especially if you love Shaun of the dead and the worlds end like I do."
"tankace","9","1","1","10 May 2017"," One of the best crime comedies ever!
","Hot Fuzz is now 10 years old ,so it is a good opportunity to review the gem of action, crime and comedy .For starters ,it is the second film in the Cornetto trilogy which is the brain-child of Simon Peg with his friends Edgar Wright and Nick Frost and in the film they more or less satirize and pay homage to the trademarks of buddy-cop films, while at the same time been their own thing.<br/><br/>So the story is as follows: The ultra officer Nicholas Angel is transferred in to a tranquil village ,where things seems to be calm and the crime rate zero, not a good place for a man of action like him. But as it is obvious not all are as they look like and he tries to uncover what is happening. In general is a crime we have all seen but the way is done and the quotes are what makes this film awesome, what did we expect anything written by Simon Peg is hilarious and amazing and here he didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Another part of the awesomeness is the casting, they are all perfect and Timothy Dalton is the epitome of fun and sinister .And now that I mention the casting both the Hound and Walter Frey are in this one, goodness everywhere I look it seems that all the English actors and actresses are in Game of Thrones, awesome!<br/><br/>In general the film rocks and it is the best crime comedy of the new Millennium since Snatch. It goes without saying that it is a must watch to every one who like action and comedy and cops film of course."

","This movie sports some of the tightest, most detail oriented editing I have ever seen. Nearly every detail from the first act comes around again in some form in the second act. The cuts are stylized and masterfully done. There are many references to other films, both subtle and blatant and the storytelling is as tight as can be.<br/><br/>It's funny and action packed and a bit gory. It lovingly parodies both British mystery dramas and American action movies. I am normally the first to point out flaws in movies, even those I absolutely love.

","London Police Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a try-hard. He's too good at his job making everybody else look bad. He gets promoted and transferred out into the country. He starts his new job by arresting his new partner Danny (Nick Frost), the son of chief inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Sandford, Gloucestershire seems to be a sleepy little town until a series of murders occurs. Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) owns the local supermarket.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg mine the plentiful material from cop dramas to bring a dryly funny satirical take on the genre. This has Edgar's quick edit style. Pegg and Frost continue their great chemistry with Edgar for almost a decade. It also serves as a fun whodunnit mystery. It's choked full of big British stars doing cameos. The last act does get overwhelmed with gun action and the guys struggle to maintain the comedy. They took the Bad Boys and Point Break motif too seriously. Overall, this may not be a comedy for everybody but it's a comedy for me."
"robsta23","10","1","1","16 January 2016"," A Truly Great Mix of Comedy, Mystery, and Action
","Hot Fuzz is a rare gem that is surprisingly better than its critical acclaim. It is a film that can easily be enjoyed as long as you don't mind its gratuitous violence at parts, but it is not the type of film that would garnish nominations for awards since it is more about entertainment than dramatic intent. It's sad that this is the case because it proves to be a solid movie through and through, breaking various conventions to make it stand out as well as implementing humor that is well beyond the likes of many comedies which come out in this day and age.<br/><br/>From the start, the film has a recognizable distinct style involving high intensity editing and excellent cinematography. The opening sequence features a monologue by Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) highlighting his amazing credentials as a police officer in London over a montage of his work in the field which supports those credentials. The visual style that is established in this sequence engages the viewer and proves to never be a bore as it is used throughout the film.<br/><br/>Once again, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are at the core of the movie, and their relationship in this film is much more interesting than their relationship in the predecessor of this film in the Cornetto trilogy: Shaun of the Dead. Whereas in Shaun of the Dead the two were great friends and the core problem was that Frost's character somewhat held Pegg back, in this film Pegg and Frost develop an unlikely friendship after Pegg mentors Frost throughout the film on how to improve as a police officer. On the other hand, Pegg learns from Frost that there is excitement in being a police officer (as seen through action movies which Frost's character is captivated by) and that Pegg should not take the job (and life for that matter) too seriously.<br/><br/>The solution to the ""mystery"" in the film seems too obvious as it is heavily implied in the first half of the film, but the truth and motivation is so unexpected it actually produces laughs with its shock factor. After this reveal, Hot Fuzz takes a turn to be more dramatic and features an action-packed third act which proves to be great fun.<br/><br/>Smart, well-made, and hilarious, Hot Fuzz is the type of film that would simply be a shame to miss out on.<br/><br/>4.0/4.0"

","Hot Fuzz (2007)<br/><br/>Coming out of a growing group of British comedies centered on Simon Pegg and a familiar cast, this one takes on small town English sensibilities with typical zaniness. It's a blast. <br/><br/>Nerdy London supercop Nicholas Angel is banished to a quaint little village because he's making the London cops look bad. But here he seems unwelcome because he's stirring up trouble—arresting underage drinkers, for example. As mysterious murders begin to accumulate, he sniffs a dastardly conspiracy. With sidekick Nick Frost, something will indeed be done about it.<br/><br/>The whole movie is fast and faster, edited with a fury, and in the first ten minutes we get the overachieving nature of our hero and also meet a handful of great British comic forces, including Bill Nighy. But don't get your hopes up—they don't reappear. Still, Pegg and Frost and a host of strong, quirky, smart performers make up the wonderful townspeople, some of them with little comic flourishes that make you laugh out loud. Often.<br/><br/>So, yeah, this is comic, for sure, and fast, which means you have to stay on your toes to catch some of the jokes (some plays on words in particular). About two thirds the way through it all, Angel shifts to Clint Eastwood mode (Dirty Harry, that is) and the vigilante cop in all of us (apparently) takes over. At first this is funny, but even a die hard action adventure fan will tire of the endless chasing and shooting and shooting and chasing—it seems to be half an hour. It's not without humor or variety, but in the overall plot, things have come to a halt. Oddly enough.<br/><br/>And it ends with a bang. Of course. <br/><br/>Enjoyable, yes, and really funny at its best. For any ""Shaun of the Dead"" fans (which is the lynchpin of this kind of British humor), this movie is a must."
"NotVeryModestSquidbeast","10","1","1","20 February 2015"," Please watch this film. It is worth every single second.
","Okay, in all honesty, I do not know for certain if this is my favorite comedy, but it is at least the most well-written comedy I have ever seen (and easily in my top 5 favorite comedies of all time).<br/><br/>Plenty of details are introduced and come back with a satisfying pay-off, and all the details in this movie make at least 2 viewings satisfying.<br/><br/>In addition, Timothy Dalton, Simon Pegg, and Nicolas Frost do great performances, and the editing is superb (and could potentially be the film with the greatest editing I have ever seen). Also Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet is in it, so that's awesome.<br/><br/>In short, watch it, please. This movie is fantastic, definitely worth it, and by far the best of the Three Cornetto trilogy."

","Not going to lie, this is my all time favorite movie. What's surprising is that I wasn't very impressed the first time I watched it. I'm not sure if I just wasn't in a ""movie kind of mood"" at the time but I remember being just ""meh"" about it. I watched it again a year or two later and found myself wondering how I missed all of the jokes and hilarious moments the first time around. Since then, this has been my absolute favorite movie. <br/><br/>I've watched it countless times now and I still laugh out loud. The characters are wacky but perfect for this kind of film. The storyline is interesting and it's pacing is on point. It's over the top in a good and purposeful way and it only adds to the entertaining feel of the movie. I highly recommend watching it since this has become my go-to movie. 10 out of 10 stars."

","What happens when London's most dedicated cop is sent to a crime-free town, and is partnered up with the chief's witless son? Well... you get ""Hot Fuzz"". Now I want to point out that this is my first review, so please go easy on me, 'cause I'm not a professional film reviewer. Nicholas Angel is London's top police officer, but his jealous colleagues decide he's too good, so they conspire to transfer him to the quiet village of Sandford, where he is then partnered up with the chief's son, Danny Butterman. Angel is unable to switch off, while Butterman has seen one too many cop movies. When two members of the Sandford Dramatic Society are found decapitated on the outskirts of Sandford, everyone thinks that it was an accident, but Angel suspects that it was murder as more people end up dead.<br/><br/>Now, I must confess that I'm not a huge fan of comedies, mainly because I just don't have a very good sense of humour, the only comedies I really love are ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"", which was from the same director (Edgar Wright), but when I saw this movie I knew I was in for a good time, and although I don't remember laughing that much when I first saw it, I did laugh quite a bit after watching it multiple times, as some of the scenes were very funny.<br/><br/>But ""Hot Fuzz"" is also an action film, and does it succeed as an action- comedy? Yes, it does, as this movie pokes fun at every action cliché there ever was, I'm not going to list them off because that would take frigging forever, all I'm going to say is while Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg were writing the script, they read a book by film critic Roger Ebert (R.I.P.) that included every action movie clichés so they could use all of them, which leads me to think if that's what the screenwriters of ""Cabin in the Woods"" did, because as the title suggests, this movie does for action films what that did for horror, despite the fact that this and ""Cabin in the Woods"" were filmed three years apart.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg I thought was fantastic in his role, he really developed as time went on, he really got used to his partner, he was just awesome, Nick Frost was also very funny in the movie, and you could tell that he's seen one too many action movies (as I said earlier), and some of his lines were some of the funniest in the film. Among the very funny cast is Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, as well as cameos by Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan and Cate Blanchett in an excellent uncredited cameo as Angel's ex. Overall, everyone's performances were all excellent.<br/><br/>Now among the films that this film references and spoofs are 'Point Break', 'Bad Boys II', 'Chinatown', 'A Fistful of Dollars', 'The Shining', 'Trainspotting', as well as some movies you'd know would reference/spoof and others you'd never expect.<br/><br/>Overall, Hot Fuzz is one of my favourite, if not my absolute favourite, comedies, I'm going to give it a 10/10 on my Miner-Meter. Thank you guys so much for reading and I hope this entices you to see the movie, expect more reviews in the future"

","I love anything that Simon Pegg is associated with and this is a must !! Loved Shawn of the dead and Paul also. I got together with some friends, had some beers and started laughing. There is nothing like British humor  A top London cop who is so good at his job that he makes his fellow officers look like slackers by comparison is ""promoted"" to serve in the sleepy village of Sandford in this contemporary action comedy from the creators of Shaun of the Dead. Police constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) always gets his man, but these days his impeccable record seems to be more indicative of his fellow officers' shortcomings than his own formidable skills as a keeper of the peace. Loathe to stand idly by as their once respectable track record is steadily soiled by the hyper-competent actions of one lone overachiever, Sergeant Angel's superiors at the Met soon determine to remedy their problem by relocating the decorated constable to the West Country village of Sanford -- where tranquil garden parties and neighborhood watch meetings stand in stark contrast to the violent crime and heated gunplay of the city. As Sergeant Angel does his best to adjust to the relative calm of his new environment, his oafish new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) strives to gain the respect of his fellow constables while sustaining himself on fantasies of his favorite action films and police shows. Later, just as it begins to appear as if Sergeant Angel has been relegated to an uneventful existence in the relative calm of the countryside, a series of horrific ""accidents"" lead him to suspect that the tranquil hamlet of Sanford has fallen prey to a sinister plot which reeks of foul play. Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Steve Coogan, and Martin Freeman co-star in the Edgar Wright film. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi"
"lesleyharris30","10","1","1","20 June 2012"," Pegg, Wright and Frost at their Finest,
","Hot Fuzz is a phenomenal movie with an extremely well developed plot and a stellar comedic cast that also shine in more tense moments. It is a wild ride from start to finish, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright really put their heart and soul in to this script, continuing to do so when creating the film. The layers to the plot, the characters and the world they created is unbelievable, they clearly put in as much thought as possible and it shows in every frame. <br/><br/>It starts off seeming like a straight up comedy, and it is absolutely hilarious, maintaining the humour we have come to expect from these guys with Shaun of the Dead. However, as the plot continues, it gets very intense, and the finale had me at the edge of my seat in suspense. It manages to be funny, thrilling and somewhat frightening all at once. <br/><br/>The cast is all around terrific, the layers to every character is exquisite thanks to a clear back and forth with the director. It is always a pleasure to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost on screen together, their chemistry is undeniable. Pegg plays a character far beyond what we have come to expect from him as an actor, portraying a stern police officer and showcasing his versatility. They are also joined by Jim Broadbent and Timothy Dalton, who fit in to this world perfectly, delivering some of their best work, as well as several great minor roles from British actors and comedians throughout. <br/><br/>Edge of your seat hilarity. Funny, ridiculously well structured and suspenseful, there really is nothing else out there like Hot Fuzz, and is a film that reminds me why I love watching movies in the first place, would recommend to all moviegoers. <br/><br/>A police officer is put in to a small country town outside of London. Everything seems fine at first, but he soon discovers there is more to its quaint atmosphere. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Simon Pegg"

","This has to be one of my all time favourite movies!! And I know that won't probably help a lot of people who are deciding whether or not to watch it but you should definitely give this film a chance even if you don't normally watch films like these... I knew when I saw the trailer I was going to enjoy it as I'd seen other stuff with these two actors in - Nick Frost and Simon Pegg- and thought they were hilarious (Shaun of the Dead for one...). I will say though, this sense of humour doesn't tend to attract everyone (namely people who prefer American humour- in other words people who don't get sarcasm and other British comedic traits) which I cannot understand!! All in all it is an amazing film with extremely good acting, great script and entertaining plot line. =D"

I felt the suspense was completely unpredictable too. Brilliant camera angles and direction. The movie gets to grip you in no time at all. An absolute roller coaster ride right since the first scene. A highly recommended one.<br/><br/>I have started to recognize Simon Pegg as one of the best actors around. He delivers an absolutely power packed performance in Hot Fuzz. A must see movie for everyone . 9/10. No major reason to deduct a point but just because this would be an injustice to other ""cult"" movies that I have seen ."
"bkoganbing","8","1","1","4 September 2011"," A Town Like Stepford, oops Sandford
","This film did not get too much play in the USA and I count myself fortunate that I'm close enough to the Canadian border to get these occasional gems broadcast from the CBC. Lucky indeed that the CBC is part of my cable package.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is a too good to be true London police officer who is wracking up arrests and making his colleagues look shameful. It's decided that the place to go to cool that zeal off a bit is the quiet and peaceful rural town of Sandford. In the United Kingdom it's the most crime free zone in the whole country.<br/><br/>In fact Pegg looks like he's going to die of sheer boredom. He makes four collars for minor offenses even before he officially is on the job there. It looks like he is not going to be a good fit for this quiet town. The only friend that Pegg has on the Sandford PD is Nick Frost, the somewhat oafish son of Broadbent whom Pegg is assigned as a partner. Frost who just loves American action flicks with guns and car chases would love for there to be something afoot.<br/><br/>The story behind Hot Fuzz is really quite bizarre and you'd have to go to the American film The Stepford Wives for a comparison. There are no experiments going on to turn the Sandford women into docile feminine drones, it's a mindset that has taken control of the place. The most sinister character is that of Timothy Dalton who is very much like the Arthur Hill character in The Stepford Wives.<br/><br/>This sleeper of a black comedy is really quite a gem. I hope that Hot Fuzz gets discovered on this side of the pond."
"prateak09","8","1","1","20 May 2011"," One hell of a ride...comedy, action and gore...a must see for a Simon Pegg and Nick Frost fan...
","Hot Fuzz is the second film in the planned trilogy; Blood and ice cream, directed by Edgar Wright, featuring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It is the follow up to 2004 film; Shaun of the dead, featuring primarily the same cast as Hot Fuzz, which is not strictly a sequel to Shaun of the dead, since the two films have completely different plots and characters.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a talented young police constable in London's metropolitan police service, who is very dedicated to his job. He gets called to the station one day, and is offered a promotion to sergeant, the downside being that he has to leave London, to take his sergeant post in the crime-free, idyllic country town of Sandford, Gloucestershire. When he declines the offer, stating that he enjoys his current job, it turns out that it is no offer after all. The reasoning behind this is that he is so good at what he does, that he is making the rest of the police look bad. He is left with no choice but to take the post and leave London.<br/><br/>In Sandford he is partnered with fellow police officer Danny Butterman, played by Nick frost, a childish and naive man, with whom Pegg's character gradually builds a friendship with. Danny and Nicholas are polar opposites. Nicholas is a perfectionist and a workaholic, while Danny is a slacker who longs for a more cinematic, action filled life. Against all odds, their personality turns out to be a perfect fit, as Nicholas mentors Danny to become a better officer, while Danny teaches Nicholas to ""switch off"".<br/><br/>As the days go by, strange deaths starts to occur, and while Nicholas suspects murder, the rest of the force brushes it off as accidents. Maybe this town is not so crime-free after all.<br/><br/>This all leads up to a very satisfying climax, one that I do not wish to spoil. All that I can say is that it is action packed, hilarious and exquisitely put together.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright's comedies rely heavily on timing, and this film is no exception. The movie moves fast, and the jokes move along even faster. You can watch it over and over, and always find something new to laugh at. It is filled to the brim with jokes, each joke funnier than the last one. He has a very distinct style of cutting, with fast scenes used as transitions or visual gags. These scenes are usually very clear and straight to the point, such as the scene when he travels to Sandford, a very fast sequence of clips, primarily highlighting the facts that not much is happening.<br/><br/>After writing, starring and directing ""Shaun of the dead"" Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg turn their sights to the action/comedy genre, transposing the usual American fare and bringing it to a rustic English setting. Simon Pegg has once again proved that he is not only good with zombies but also has a Cop, oh sorry!- Super Cop. This movie is not just a master piece but also a treat of comedy, action and a real sense of humor. Simon Pegg decides in this film to take more of a straight man role and leaves most of the comedy to his friend Nick Frost, who does not let him down giving what could just have been the stooge role of Danny Butterman a great deal of charm and pathos. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both great in their roles, delivering their dialogue perfectly. They are a perfect duo. The rest of the supporting cast do their jobs supremely well, from the Oscar-winning Jim Broadbent, through to Olivia Coleman, Kevin Eldon, Anne Reid, Adam Buxton, Bill Bailey and the supremely brilliant Timothy Dalton who excels as the seemingly obvious villain of the piece. The script and the direction are superb and the film switches effortlessly between comedy and action and occasionally horror. The other mistake that the film so deftly avoids is the desire to slap some kind of love interest in there. There is nothing you can expect in an entertainment more than this. I'm a huge fan of the duo. The chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is simply admirable.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz"" is at it's best with the many laugh out loud moments: the runaway goose, translating the local dialect, the human statue ""threat"", the bodyguard who just says ""Naarp!"", and wordplay twists throughout. These smart bits of humor make the film a keeper just be prepared for high action and some gore with your laughs. I give it a whooping 8 out of 10."

","This might be not a nice comment and a bit short, but I felt a bit drained after watching Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>If you expect your audience to 'get' the really funny jokes, you should also expect them to 'get' the storyline. I think they could have cut a murder, or one of the teams get togethers. The story taking forever to unfold was a bit frustrating and made me lose interest for the often hilarious jokes.<br/><br/>You might say that story lines in movies like these are not too important, but I really enjoyed the way it all started. Simon Pegg was very cool being the dedicated Policem.. officer and Nick Frost admiring him was also brilliant. So why not finish the movie with a short but sweet statement and leave out most of the Scooby Doo-like whodunnit stuff?"

","I really tried to enjoy this film, but upon reflection should have walked out of the theatre to save myself from the disconjointed and disturbing finish. The only reason I did not leave was that I was watching the film with other people and did not want to disturb them. This film was sold as an action-comedy, however I found myself barely laughing at the sparse and semi-funny jokes. A 5 year old could have written this script and I am not kidding! By the end we were squirming in our seats just waiting for it to end, while watching the rather painful action scenes. Frankly they were just not put together well. The lack of any harmony or cleverness in the plot or in the directing just left me exhausted. Well thought out action sequences are usually artistic in some way, but not this film. OK, so it was supposed to be raw and gritty, but sorry, it just did not work. I understand what they were trying to do, but it just did not come together well. The film was more of a mess than any thing and went on way too long."

Unfortunately, I would also have been first in line to get out, if I hadn't had to spend ten minutes trying to wake my girlfriend up. In a full cinema, the most the audience managed for the 6 hour duration (it seemed like it) was mild tittering. The only moments that could have been laugh out loud were undermined by having seen them repeated continuously in the over saturated trailers The climatic set-pieces (and they seem to go on for an eternity) were apparently an attempt to ridicule American action sequences  a commendable idea  except just repeating said sequences beat for beat in a crap way doesn't for me make for sophisticated (or amusing) parody. The film reeks of made for TV, and having previously created such genius moments, it is tragic that these hugely talented fellas have created a movie that attempts to ape everything from 'the wicker man' to 'straw dogs', but ended up reminding me of 'clockwise' meets 'the boys in blue' starring Cannon and Ball. Don't listen to the insanely loyal British press giving this 11 out of 10 across the board this film is a dire follow up to the genius 'Shaun of the dead' and 'spaced'"

It tells the story of a cop who is moved to a small country town, with hilarious results. Its the same kind of thing as Shaun of the dead, if you've seen it. It sends up police films and TV shows in this case. It makes fun of everything from bad boys to point break as you'll find out. It is extremely violent, perhaps even more so than 'Shaun'. It gives a joke a second, it is absolutely filled with jokes. There were few times where I didn't find myself laughing or at least laughing from a joke I heard a second ago. Unfortunately, it isn't quite as good as Shaun of the Dead, it could be because I'm not such a big fan of cop films, but i think its because, despite my previous raving review, the jokes aren't as good or as memorable. I saw the film just before i wrote this and I've already forgotten most of the things that made me laugh. Unlike 'Shaun', where i was rehearsing entire scenes and repeating some of the great one liners to everyone i knew. I still am telling everyone about this film... but first i will make sure to say, ""have you seen the other film by these guys? Shaun of the dead."" All in all this is a great film funniest one this year even, and you should see it.

The movie has not come out here yet, it has only come out in I think Ireland.<br/><br/>Anyway, I will make sure not to spoil it for you. The story is fascinating. No movie that I have ever seen has had a story line similar to this one, as with many new movies, how many movies are very similar to others.

Also, there is no great character build up for the two main cops, Angel & Butterman other than Angel is obsessed with being a cop and Butterman likes to watch videos. Your left then to enjoy the acerbic sense of humour and the violent demise(shown in graphic detail) of the many victims of the killer.

The town he goes to is known for having the lowest crime rates, but lots of accidents. Soon towns people beginning turning up dead in some very gruesome ways. Angel suspects murder, but some insists on calling them accidents. When the reporter has that steeple fall on his head, that was so gross, and funny in a very weird/wrong kind of way.

"Coventry","10","3","6","6 October 2007"," Brilliant! It's got everything ...
","And I really do literally mean EVERYTHING you could possibly crave to find in a relaxing and genuinely entertaining cinema experience! ""Hot Fuzz"" brilliantly combines the wittiness & fast dialogs of a buddy cop movie, the excitement & spectacular stunts of a Hollywood summer blockbuster, the absurdity & convoluted plot twists of an Italian Giallo, the excessive gore and sickness of splatter-horror, the atmosphere & setting of a British comedy sitcom and the cast of a thousand. If all this isn't enough yet, ""Hot Fuzz"" refers to multiple great classics of the big screen (""Jaws"", ""The Wicker Man"", ""Straw Dogs"") and even pays tribute to styles and sub genres of the almost forgotten but once golden days of cinema (Spaghetti Westerns, Gialli). For those who were still suspecting ""Shaun of the Dead"", the previous scripting collaboration between Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, to be a fluke, ""Hot Fuzz"" will take the doubt away once and for all. These two British lads are creative and multi-talented movie freaks and they know exactly how the please a wide & versatile range of audiences. The less you know about the film's plot (particularly the main twist) the better, because it's even more amusing when it comes as a totally unexpected and deliciously grotesque surprise. Simon Pegg stars as London's super cop Nicholas Angel, but he's actually too good in comparison with the rest of the corps, and so his superiors shamelessly transfer him to the countryside community with the lowest crime-rate in the whole of England; Sandford. Nick's new colleagues aren't used to solving crimes at all and fill their days with hanging around the pubs, smoking cigarettes and making fun of his obsession with law enforcement. Even when several prominent Sandford inhabitants die in grisly ""accidents"", Nick can't seem to convince them to investigate the possibility of murder. The eventual truth behind the crimes is as demented as it is brilliant, and the last half hour of ""Hot Fuzz"" is a simply non-stop adrenalin-rushing, over-the-top comical, blood-spattered and wildly cheerful spitfire of action highlights. Technically speaking, ""Hot Fuzz"" is a masterpiece as well. The editing is genius, the cinematography is very imaginative and the film makes absolute brilliant use of the rural settings and all its typical characteristics and clichés. Of course, the film owes a large part of its massive impact to Simon Pegg's masterful performance. He's simply awesome and hugely charismatic, especially when depicting the obstinate and firm officer who knows every tiniest detail of the law enforcement book. Pegg's facial expressions (or lack of, for that matter) add even more comical genius to the already hysterical script. The supportive cast (pretty much an assembly of England's finest players) is amazing as well, and each and every one delivers flawless performances. I think Timothy Dalton hasn't had this much fun starring in a film since he completed his first scene wearing the James Bond outfit. ""Hot Fuzz"" is a unique experience all together. It features all the known genre clichés & stereotypes and narrates a seemingly derivative story, and yet, the elaboration is (or at least feels like) something entirely fresh and original. Comedy and violence can melt together in a movie perfectly, it simply requires a gifted team of cast and crew members. Highly recommended! Seriously, if you haven't watched ""Hot Fuzz"" yet, do it as fast as you can!"
"moimoichan6","6","3","6","10 August 2007"," Spaced bad boys at point break.
","Most of the buddy movies from the eighties, from ""Tango and Cash"" to ""Lethal Weapon"" are nowadays already funny to watch, for the narrative and aesthetically codes they use are usually very old-fashion and cliché. ""Hot Fuzz"", witch is sold as a parody of those kind of cop movie, reinvents those codes in a totally out of the blues environment, and give an even more absurd tone to those absurd codes : a little and calm village of England, where nothing ever happens.<br/><br/>Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a kind of ""Robocop"" bobby of London is indeed transfered in Sandford, a village where his amazing skills won't eclipse the ones of his colleges. But for Angel, even when everything's calm, there's always something's happening, especially when the all inhabitants of the town seems so suspects, as if they're trying to hide something, for the ""greater good"".<br/><br/>Just like ""Shawn of the Dead"" mixed the living dead movies with a very spaced humor, ""Hot Fuzz"" transfers ""Miami Vice"" in a very British (an therefor absurd) environment and humor. The all thing is rather pleasant, full of great guests (including Steve Coogan and Timothy Dalton in what may be his best role) : those who saw the previous Edgar Wright's movies won't be surprised by the tone of the movie, and those who expect another Ben Sttiller's ""Starsky and Hutch"" will be rather surprised.<br/><br/>Nothing to say except that if the first part of the movie is really funny and clever, in a very British style, the last act, witch looks more like a gun-fight parody, is way more classic and less enjoyable."
"HeadleyLamarr","7","3","6","6 August 2007"," Yarrp? Narrp!!
","In the IMDb top 250? I don't think so. This is a film that starts out bloody hilarious but ten suffers from serious genre identity crisis. It veers between serious and comic and goes on for way too long, like 45 minutes too long, while it is still deciding what it wants to be. Simon Pegg was hilarious and absolutely deadpan through out. The supporting cast around him was great too. There were some moments of comic genius - By the Power of Greyskull! Yarrp, Narrp? The police force of Sandford had me in stitches but the cloak and dagger mystery was just too much Arsenic and Old Lace style. <br/><br/>A shorter, snappier, less serious version would be a masterpiece but this one became tedious and took itself too seriously in the end. All in all I would say that this was a film would test the patience of your behind unless you were lying in bed while watching."
"Superunknovvn","6","3","6","21 July 2007"," A bit of a disappointment, unfortunately
","After the hype around this movie, all the critical acclaim, the movie's position among IMDb's Top 250 (something one always should take with a grain of salt) and the fact that everything Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright had done since ""Spaced"" was brilliant, I expected a lot from this film. Unfortunately, ""Hot Fuzz"" couldn't really match my expectations. Wright and Pegg have become masters at writing comedy. From the beginning there are many funny lines of dialog as well as clever visual jokes. The problem is that from the get go all these jokes are also combined with over the top-editing and hectic sound effects. I am aware of the fact that this is supposed to be a parody of all the ""classic"" Bruckheimer action movies that are edited just like that, but it still was annoying and took away a lot from the comedy.<br/><br/>About halfway through the movie murders start to happen and Pegg's and Wright's soft spot for the horror genre shines through once again with some nifty splatter scenes. Of course, those scenes seem a bit out of place in a parody of buddy movies, but oh well, they were entertaining enough. The final act, however, is where this movie starts to fall apart. This is where even in ""Shaun Of The Dead"" things got a bit too serious. The problem in ""Hot Fuzz"" is that Pegg and Wright decide to just go along with a completely ridiculous explanation for the murders and have a big shoot-out. More annoying editing and sound effects are added and then, in true Peter Jackson-fashion, the movie ends about three times too often. Again, I am fully aware that the ridiculousness of the plot, the over the top finale and the multiple endings are all trademarks of the movies that are being parodied here, but one wished that the ending would have been executed a bit more thoughtfully, because it's not hilarious-silly, it's just silly.<br/><br/>There's an episode of ""Spaced"" where Tim and Daisy have a pretended shoot out with some street gang. This time Wright and Pegg could afford to shoot the same thing with real looking weapons and blood. The thing is, it was a lot funnier when it was only make believe.<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" isn't awful by any means. In fact it's a highly entertaining movie with a lot of original ideas and a great cast. I do hope, however, that Wright and Pegg structure the third act of their movies more carefully in the future and tame down the brute silliness in some places without losing their edge."

","Nick Angel is the top cop in London, with arrests that are 400% higher then anyone else in his department. This doesn't look so good for everyone else, so the decision to ship him off to a small village is made. Angel arrives and finds it difficult to cope with the lack of real crime and the lack of policing in the village. Not until bodies begin to pile high does Nick suspect something sinister is up and about and he goes an and action rampage trying to solve this mystery.<br/><br/>If the names Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright sound vaguely familiar to you, then you've probably seen the overly funny ""Shaun of the Dead"". After the release of that film, it became an instant cult classic that ran a thin line between comedy, romance and horror. Now these guys are at it again, this time in the buddy cop action genre. It's safe to say they've knocked it out of the park, yet again. It's refreshing seeing talent delve into more then one specific genre, which can only mean bigger and greater things in the future.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz does for action films what Shaun of the Dead did for horror. Bring a unique comedic style and touch to a genre that has been done to death and somehow manage to pull off a great film. Just like Shaun, Fuzz has the same actors making an appearance, where some are in cameo roles like Bill Nighy as the Chief Inspector, right down to the two main stars themselves; Pegg and Frost, who are a perfect comedic pair together. Much to my surprise there were two more cameos, I don't want to give them away, but look closely at the Santa Clause who stabs Nick and his masked girlfriend.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the film you can tell that Wright is behind the camera. The quick action cuts of every little thing (from taking your jacket off to putting your keys in the door) is done in such a fast paced way and so often, that it has somehow become his 'trademark', much like Tarantino with his trunk shot or Scorsese using Gimme Shelter. In Shaun this was used a couple of times, but here it's in almost every scene, yet it somehow compliments the film. When you're homaging and parodying action films, everything should be exaggerated, tightly shot and quickly edited. Even the small things like grabbing the telephone is done in an 'action film' style.<br/><br/>For film buffs, it's neat to pick out the references to other films, that are literally scattered throughout Fuzz. If it's not blatant and in your face like Point Break or Straw Dogs, it's subtle and only spoken. ""Forget it Nick, It's Sandford"". Obvious reference to Chinatown. The reference range from genre to genre. Horror and action films are the main targets, and it's hard not to crack a smile when the final fight scene reminds you of Lethal Weapon.<br/><br/>The townsfolk all play their parts well, with James Bond himself, Dalton, standing out as the devilish supermarket boss. Seeing these townsfolk being so ordinary and timid make for the climax of this film even more enjoyable. The climax itself is the entire third act of the film, which is where most of the laughs are, which is unfortunate. Unlike Shaun, that kept the laughs consistent, Fuzz goes on and off. In the scenes where the laughter is off it tends to drag on a little. This hurts the film cause these scenes could have been cut, making the film shorter and having more of an impact on the viewer. After a slow start, and a off and on funny scenes for the body of the film, it takes something special in the final act to bring the movie into greatness. Hot Fuzz has this and more in it's gun blazing, car chasing, blood splattering, third act.<br/><br/>It's quite right to say that Wright and co. brought their horror specialties to Fuzz, as so many scenes seem like they could have been brought right out of a horror film. All of the deaths are bloody and jaw dropping; as in I did not expect it to be so graphic in this style of film. Fuzz has a hint of Shaun at every corner and of course every other buddy cop movie as well. It's horror aspect played well throughout the film, paying off in the end and of course making another reference to a well known horror film that has it's own cult following.<br/><br/>Pegg takes a drastic turn in this film, from playing a loser that's afraid of everything to a bad ass with impressive sharp shooting schools. With Frost playing the same type of buddy sidekick with a thick skull. This time though, Frost manages to pull off some kind of pity feeling for the character. You feel sorry for him, but you don't know why. Maybe because he looks up to Angel so many times and acts like a big gorilla.<br/><br/>In the end, Hot Fuzz indeed delivers the laughs and the action, which is all saved for the third act. It doesn't reach the greatness of Shaun, but it manages to separate itself from it and for that I can recommend it. It will drag on for some, but others will have a fun time picking out all the references to other films. Enjoy the film for what it is, a funny look on the action genre. With more then enough people and car flying in the air in slow motion from 4 or 5 different angles to please Bay fans. Fuzz is definitely worth checking out."

"Mark1988","8","3","6","8 April 2007"," True Lies meets Monty Python
","Hot Fuzz is quite simply one of the funniest films to come out in years. After seeing it at the cinemas with a few friends we conclusively agreed that we have never laughed so hard in the space of two hours. Yes it's true, Hot Fuzz is absolutely great.<br/><br/>In HF we are introduced a hardened city cop (Simon Pegg) who is assigned to a sleepy country town because his exceptional performance is reflecting poorly on his peers. Upon his arrival it is apparent the town is not only steeped in stupidity but also a close-knit series of conventions shared only amongst the townsfolk. Pegg is an outsider who must try to find acceptance as well as decipher the meaning behind a series of suspicious accidents in the shire.<br/><br/>HF combines clever British-Comedy writing with a completely ridiculous physical violence. The later is very much in the tradition of Die Hard or Predator with extreme gun fights and brutal gore the name of the game. The former is in the vein of the British Comedy Faulty Towers. Some of the situations are predictable but Simon Pegg's displaced city cop is hilarious as he tries to contend with the idiocy on display within his new precinct. Moreover, every scene seems to have a restrained absurdity to it. Not obvious enough to make an audience openly reject the reality on screen, but subtle enough to keep you giggling the entire time. HF shines due to its tight writing and direction and lack of silly, bland sex jokes that seem to litter films these days.<br/><br/>The fighting on display is also hilarious. HF alludes to many classic cop films in its choreography and displaces them into a sleepy English town. The result encompasses obese traffic officers diving for cover and lovable English nanny's touting machine guns in their handbags. It's amazing how the film makes these scenes accessible. The stupidity of the situation is incredibly funny partly due to the deliberately slow pacing of the first two acts of the film. This in turn complements this extreme comedic violence.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a genuine comedy classic. True Lies meets Monty Python is this film in a nutshell. I sincerely hope it attains the cult following it so thoroughly deserves."

","If you've seen the trailer for the latest offering from Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright you shouldn't require a detailed description of Hot Fuzz's plot.<br/><br/>If not, then I guess it can be summed up as this: The best Police Officer in London (Simon Pegg) is transferred to a sleepy English village partnered with a local action movie obsessed cop (Nick Frost) who are both thrown into a murder mystery and then all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>I'm a HUGE fan of Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and the other various works of Wright, Pegg and Frost which meant that I've been looking forward to seeing this film for a very, very long time.<br/><br/>My expectations for this little flick were quite possibly too high. I had to ask myself if it was possible to have a film as laugh out loud funny as Shaun within 2 years.<br/><br/>Thankfully I wasn't in the least bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a fantastic action comedy movie with an outstanding cast from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost right down to the old lady who gets kicked in the face. Timothy Dalton is worth a mention for his spot on performance as a devious supermarket manager.<br/><br/>Yes it's true that the trailer has given away some good jokes and set pieces but within the fast paced 2 hour running time I lost count of the various one liners, visual gags and physical pratfalls.<br/><br/>The direction is slick and frantic with editing that even Tony Scott would find fast.<br/><br/>I loved this film, it is at the very least an equal to the mighty Shaun of the Dead and best it's the greatest British action movie in the last 10 years (that doesn't feature Bond, James Bond).<br/><br/>I guarantee you won't be disappointed (*) See this film where it belongs on the BIG Screen.<br/><br/>And if you're reading this when the film is out on DVD just make sure it's on the largest screen possible and you've got all your friends round too.<br/><br/>(* = Not a guarantee)"

","I've personally given this a 1, but only to try to compensate for the horde of British that are all voting this as a 9 or 10, simply because it is British.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, I'd probably give it a 6 though... except for the jiggle game. That drops it to a 4. Unless a film is ground breaking in some fashion, or impressive in some way (and this film is neither, everything here has been done before), an 8+ isn't really the way to go.<br/><br/>Worse, and I simply can not stress this enough, I had to leave the film at the end. The special effects with the ""mega-jiggle"" cam are so horrid, so terrible, so inane, that I simply could not watch any more. I can only presume that the special effects were so poor, or the acting so inept, that the action scenes needed to be utterly overridden by this new horror.<br/><br/>The jiggle cam horror.<br/><br/>What is it, that makes film makers think viewers come to the cinema, to *not* see any special effect save the jiggle cam? When a car is exploding, when bullets are flying, when a 1 million dollar stunt is occurring, wouldn't it be a good idea to allow the view to actually see what is happening?! I guess not. :/"

Drunk driving isn't funny. And never will be. So that joke was always going to bomb.<br/><br/>We're faced with stars like Timothy Dalton and Jim Broadbent really desperate for money? They must be to appear in this rubbish.<br/><br/>Basically Frost & Pegg watched Bad Boys 2 (which is awful) and Point Break and decided to take all the best bits from both films (that must be all of about 3 seconds?) and put them in their movie.<br/><br/>This clearly shows a very obvious fact ""We don't have any ideas of our own"".<br/><br/>The film was rubbish, the action scenes were far too over the top and didn't help the pace of the film.<br/><br/>This could have been so much better and the film was sold on Pegg and Frost.

Fair enough, why not. I'm all for supporting local talent. But at the end of the day, let's not pretend it's anywhere near as funny as it out to be, anywhere near as funny as the American action comedies it's based on and which it spoofs.<br/><br/>The jokes are clichéd, the one liners are tired, the renderings of British stereotypes are nowhere near as incisive or memorable as even a show like, say, little Britain, let alone the Office or Baron-Cohen's stuff. Even by British standards, the comedy isn't that hot, the plotting is weak, and the slippage between action and comedy at which the original American films excel is sloppily executed.

","Hot Fuzz is about an over performing police ""officer"", Nicholas Angel, who is relocated to the sticks, because he's making his fellow officers look bad.<br/><br/>Being ever vigilant in his duties, Angel waste no time beginning to enforce law in his new location. Soon he begins to discover something deeper, that the entire town is run by a cult who always act in the greater good.<br/><br/>His buffoon partner, Butterworth, helps Angel turn off his Terminator like officer persona, as well as defeat the evil cult.<br/><br/>Now, I realize this movie is supposed to be a comedy. I suppose partially a spoof maybe like the much more entertaining Scary Movie series. Unfortunately, this movie falls short in the humor department. But it's really a mess, it's a comedy that's not really that funny. It's a drama with out any real character development. It's a spoof of well, I guess it's own genre of a film (crap?).<br/><br/>The ending of the movie last 45 minutes, I swear, and by the end I couldn't wait for it to finally...finally......finally.....finally be over. Yes, I realize that some may have found this spoof like, or a satirical commentary on typical horror movie endings that the bad guys keep coming back. Here, it doesn't work, it just becomes irritating.<br/><br/>Also yes I know the really funny, clever, witty names Angel, Stake, Messenger are all supposed to demarcate a point of humor every time their spoken but this ""humor"" simply isn't funny and is as dryer than a cardboard box. 3/10"

","Another outstanding effort by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, the gents who made Shaun of the Dead and again starring Pegg and Nick Frost, with a cavalcade of great character actors.<br/><br/>This time Pegg is a straight laced cop named Nicholas Angel who has such an outstanding record in London that he makes all other cops look bad, so he is sent to what is probably the most quiet village in England so as not to embarrass the rest of the force. (His first ""case"" is to catch a swan that has escaped its enclosure.) Upon settling into the village of Stanford he meets the decidedly less focused local police force and the members of the community who have a deep desire to maintain the status of Stanford as the epitome of excellence in rural England. These seemingly upstanding citizens appear and reappear through the movie, especially the crappiest Bond, Timothy Dalton as the local supermarket owner who seems to be everywhere just before or after an incident occurs. (Side note - Although Dalton apparently sucked it up as 007 I can't help by think Pierce Brosnan dropped a notch with the new Loreal commercials, ""campaigning to save the environment"" ughhhh.) As the ""accidents"" become more frequent Angel becomes increasingly involved in proceedings and also increasingly disillusioned with his fellow members of the force. There are several moments of stylised violence that would be pretty shocking if they weren't so funny, and once ""shit just got real"" Angel snaps and the movie escalates into a 20 odd minute smorgasbord of shotgun-wielding, rootin' tootin' over the top action, which matches most of the movies that the first 3/4 of the film parodies.<br/><br/>What separates this from so many other flicks is the obvious care that the creators have taken at every step of the game, from the script to the casting to the seemingly accidental touches that frequent the film, (for those that saw SOTD you know nothing is an accident).<br/><br/>The supporting cast are all excellent, with many being recognisable from numerous British comedy shows and movies. It seems obvious that both Pegg and Wright watch a looootttt of movies and set out to make something that they would like to watch which both spoofs and honours the buddy cop genre simultaneously.<br/><br/>In Summary: Hot Fuzz is equal parts comedy and action flick, with a fair crossover of both styles throughout. Aside from the stars there are numerous worthwhile cameos that actually add to the film and Pegg and Frost share an effortless chemistry.<br/><br/>I don't like to compare films but put simply if you liked Shaun of the Dead you'll love this.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 9 / 10.

","After seeing a relatively enjoyable experience with Shaun of the Dead, I found myself with an incredible treat known as Hot Fuzz. It proved to be the refreshing film that I think any action movie fan needs to see. Now I have grown so accustomed to action sequences that I have rarely been impressed by action films and 'Fuzz' is definitely one of them.<br/><br/>I sort of see it done the same way that Life of Brain was done. You know that this is a comedy about action flicks yet you cannot help but feel that this is something else entirely. It is that well done. I would actually go as far to say that this is one of the best films that the 2001-2010 decade has dished out. And I think the relations between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were better realized in this film.<br/><br/>10/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","2","4","24 November 2009"," A daring and enjoyable comedy starring Simon Pegg
","I will admit to you, the film does start off slowly, and the finale is very over the top. Plus the murders are unashamedly brutal. But Hot Fuzz is a hugely enjoyable, original and daring comedy. It is fast-paced fun from start to finish. And all this is helped by a sharply observed screenplay, next to flawless comic timing and a wonderful performance from Simon Pegg playing it straight as the over zealous cop. The supporting actors do just as brilliantly with Nick Frost the standout and Jim Broadbent brilliant as always. Paddy Cosidine and Rafe Spall are hilarious as the two Andys, and Timothy Dalton is a pleasant surprise as Simon Skinner, and steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>The camera-work is very dark and brooding, and there are some clever homages to other movies of the genre. At a little over two hours, the film is perhaps a little too long, but the film constantly goes at a break neck pace so it doesn't matter. The plot is rather original and daring, about Nick Angel getting promoted and being relocated to the hamlet of Sandford. The direction from Edgar Wright is solid throughout and has this appropriately offbeat style. Overall, a very affectionate, daring and enjoyable film. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Vishal_s_kumar","9","2","4","9 September 2009"," No, I have not ever fired my gun up in the air and gone 'ahhhh.'
","London's top cop, Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), is highly intelligent and extremely motivated, dedicated to his duty and a model of proper police work. He's so good, in fact, that he's been promoted Sergeant and rather unceremoniously booted out of the city and given a duty in the small town of Sandford, Gloucestershire, because he's making the rest of London's finest look rather bad. Unaccustomed to life in the small town, Angel finds himself busting underage drinkers at the local pub and chasing a loose swan around town instead of ridding London of its heinous criminal element. He's partnered with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), a bumbling overweight officer with a craving for action that's influenced by his love of Cop films. Soon enough, the peaceful town becomes home to a string of terrible deaths; Angel suspects murder, but the other officers on the force reject his wild claims and pronounce each grisly corpse an accident victim. Angel believes local businessman Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) to be centrally involved in the deaths, but Angel is finding it increasingly difficult to gather any evidence against him. Has Angel lost his edge in the idyllic small town atmosphere, or will his instincts lead him towards a deeper, darker discovery that could threaten to challenge all he knows about Sandford? The team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright continue to impress with their ability to fully realize the potential of the Parody genre and hit the nail on the head in just about every single frame of their movies. There's very little about Hot Fuzz that doesn't work; the movie does slow down here and there and the two-hour runtime feels a little bit on the lengthy side for a picture of this sort, but otherwise there's little to complain about. Despite a low budget, Wright squeezes an enormous amount of pizazz out of the film. Of course, it's driven primarily by the two most crucial elements to a Parody: the quality of the script and the ability of the actors to pull it off. Though the genre has become fairly brain-dead over the past several years, Hot Fuzz recalls the quality of Mel Brooks but not necessarily the style; Wright's films are far flashier and a bit more subtle in their humor, but they're no less effective. Through all the laughs, the film enjoys an extremely high quality production value that gives the illusion of a much bigger budget; the special effects aren't mind-boggling but they're certainly effective and fun. The sets look fantastic and the props appear authentic, but once again it all plays second fiddle to the quality of the script and the performances of the actors, two factors which lend more to the overall excellence of any film than simply throwing money haphazardly into secondary and tertiary aspects of the process in hopes of obscuring a lousy plot or poor performances.<br/><br/>Tackling buddy cop movies, much of Hot Fuzz's scripted success stems from the fact that it doesn't even attempt to hide the movies it takes aim at. Nick Frost's character Danny is an Action movie junkie who dreams of living the lives of excitement, danger, clever reactionary dialogue, and slow-motion gunfights that populate the fictional worlds of flashy cops on the silver screen. Among his favorites are Bad Boys II and Point Break; his obsession with the genre allows Hot Fuzz an easy way to poke fun at the clichés that populate such films, whether he simply recalls his favorite scenes; watches them on video; or by the end of the film, experiences the ultimate Action movie shot: ""firing two guns whilst flying through the air."" This represents an excellent means through which to incorporate part of the primary source of humor; not only do audiences actually hear some of the important lines of dialogue (""this $#!% just got real"" from Bad Boys II) or see some of the clips from the actual films that are the target of parody (Keanu Reeves shooting into the air in Point Break) that are later repeated by the main characters in Hot Fuzz, but it provides an absolute reference point for viewers that aren't necessarily familiar with those films. Aside from the scenes that offer a rather direct attack on the material, the primary plot itself incorporates more overreaching clichés that make Hot Fuzz a complete Parody film. There's the obligatory foot chase through town replete with a ""jump over a series of fences"" scene; the feeling-out period between partners; the personality split that threatens to tear the partners apart,(here the paradigm centers around one that's completely serious and grounded in reality while the other is not-so-serious and living in a fantasy world); goofy dialogue; investigative montages; and much more. Also helping the film immensely is the aggressive gore that springs up from time to time. It's rather over-the-top and in another sort of picture some of it would rival the more grotesque out there, but even beheaded, charred, and impaled-from-the-top-down corpses take on a humorous tone in context. The performances tie it all together, selling both the parody and taking the edge off the brutality of the film; Pegg and Frost are fantastic, of course, but the real star of the film is Timothy Dalton and his deliciously over-the-top effort. He never really disguises what his role in the film is, but his ability to keep Angel on his toes and put on a deceptive charm that doesn't sway audience opinion but keeps it from complete confidence in the initial assumption of who he really is all makes him the film's best all-around character."
"barnabyrudge","8","2","4","22 June 2009"," Hilarious, bloody and rather clever action spoof.
","I wasn't expecting much from this very British spoof on the action genre (and, to some extent, a lampoon of gory murder mysteries). However, it is done with considerable style and energy and has some genuinely hilarious moments. Coming away from this film, one feels pleasantly surprised. It isn't just a low-brow comedy designed to provide easy laughs – there's much more going on here. Cross references to earlier movies, witty one-liners, a wacky yet very clever plot, terrific performances, genuinely suspenseful death scenes. the list goes on. There are flaws - but not too many!<br/><br/>Ace policeman Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is too good for his job. As his London superiors explain to him, he's arresting so many crooks that he's making the rest of the force look bad! So, they ship him out to the quiet country village of Sandford, Gloucestershire, a peaceful haven where nothing bad ever happens and the residents proudly tout themselves as the Village of the Year, a competition they've won for countless years in a row. Initially horrified at the prospect, Angel soon realises that all is not what it seems in this ""perfect"" rural village. A series of seemingly tragic accidents raise Angel's suspicion – he believes foul play is afoot, and with the aid of his oafish new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) sets out to uncover a dark conspiracy. Angel is convinced that a cunning murderer is at work, but what is their motive and who could it be? <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a parody of the highly derivative buddy cop flicks that Hollywood has been churning out for a couple of decades – the likes of Bad Boys, Point Break, and Lethal Weapon are gently ridiculed throughout. Likewise many of the murder sequences are reminiscent of the ridiculously elaborate set-ups in slasher movies. Hot Fuzz contains its share of bloodthirsty mayhem, but it all seems done in a weirdly good-natured way which encourages laughter rather than distaste. One scene in particular – a church steeple being dropped onto an unsuspecting victim – is simultaneously gory and hysterically funny. There are flaws, as I mentioned previously. One of them is the (deliberate?) over-editing in a few sequences, which is irritating rather than clever. Another is the way the film seems to have about four separate climaxes and ends up nearly out-staying its welcome. Pegg establishes himself as a genuinely likable leading man, while Frost is broadly amusing as his overweight, under-intelligent partner. The supporting cast is a delightful gallery of old pros – Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward, Paul Freeman, Bill Nighy and Stuart Wilson – all of whom seem to be having an absolute ball playing against type. All in all, Hot Fuzz is a hugely enjoyable parody of the action genre and a refreshing treat in this era of endless sequels, remakes and rip-offs."
"Quebec_Dragon","8","2","4","29 May 2009"," British invasion of action comedies starts here! (hopefully)
","Hot fuzz is a pretty darn good comedy about a super city cop transferred against his will to a small village where nothing big ever seems to happen. The super cop in question, played by Simon Pegg, is extremely competent and by the book. I was impressed at how soberly and seriously he was played without a hint of camp in sight. He could have been in any serious cop drama or action flick. The writers could have easily made him a pompous jerk but he didn't come off that way. It's the third time I see Simon Pegg in a movie and to me he's like a chameleon, I can barely recognize him each time so kudos to him. In contrast, you have all the other characters who are a bit off-kilter or eccentric. I liked most of them, particularly Timothy Dalton as a grocery store manager, but I wish the other cops had just a little more character without going into Police Academy territory. I admit having had trouble understanding some of the accents (not counting the old cop that's a joke in itself) but I'm not holding it against the film since most of the writing, with its share of profanity, was so much fun and witty. The cop played by Nick Frost eventually became likable as a slacker trying to emulate and befriend the uptight Simon Pegg. Their chemistry was wonderful and convincing as I suppose it should be since in real life they've been best friends for a long time. So you seem to have the hallmarks of a buddy cop film with a few quirks and wrenches added for spice.<br/><br/>The directing was certainly above-par and creative. I was constantly amused by how seemingly innocuous mundane actions were made so very exciting through the cutting and sound effects. Let's mention the few surprising bloody moments that certainly reminded me of Shaun of the Dead. Not everyone will like them but I did. I found most of the jokes quite funny, although not laugh-out-loud material until the hilarious last act. That last act was just so unexpected yet logical, with such a dramatic yet comedic escalation (yes both together), that it makes you feel jubilation as it goes on. It's just very satisfying and I appreciated very much how the super cop tried to handle everything while staying true to his beliefs. A typical American buddy cop film would have made him much less ""subtle"", therefore evacuating the comedy, and would have tacked on an unnecessary love interest. Hot Fuzz seems almost like a double-headed beast since it embraces its fair lot of action film clichés while subverting them and since it's both a spoof and a homage. In final analysis though, it's just a great mix of action and comedy.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"

","With little available on the ""New Releases"" front at Video Busters, wifey and I went the weekly route. One of the choices was ""Hot Fuzz"".<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" stars Simon Pegg (in his best work since ""MI3"") as an over the top cop whose extreme dedication to the job has seen him wear out his welcome in London. His superiors decide to send him to a quiet little town that should settle him down and allow him to take it easy. Upon his arrival, he discovers it's even sleepier than he imagined. He takes to arresting underage drinkers and minor offenders to pass the time until he's advised the local cops like to take a more carefree approach. Soon though some out-of-nowhere murders start taking place and Angel (Pegg) has a mystery to solve that he's been waiting for. The action gets intense and Angel is in for the biggest battle of his life.<br/><br/>Quite different but really enjoyable. The film does get a bit weird, but you kind of see it coming, although it does get pretty zany near the end. Some interesting directing, quirky jokes and full-on-yet-humorous violent scenes make it unlike anything I'd seen before. Pegg is great as Angel and there's a strong supporting cast, most notably Nick Frost as Danny.<br/><br/>Well worth a watch."
"Amthermandes","10","2","4","16 January 2009"," 10 reasons to absolutely LOVE this film.......
","1. Originality/cleverness (Not many movies are similar to this. The movie is full of unique and one-of-a-kind humor.) 2. Jam packed with great laughs (Really, if you don't laugh throughout this movie, you were either in a bad mood to begin with, or maybe you're just not an exciting person.) 3. Plot: A super talented police-man officer (lol, get it?) gets thrown from the front line of action in the city to the country, to serve in a peaceful and perfect town, where crimes are unheard of. As he befriends others, he starts to learn that this town holds more than meets the eye.... (Well thought up, perfectly executed. Also one-of-a-kind, you can't argue with that. Character development starts with a bang in the beginning and does well the rest of the film) 4. Action/amazing special effects 5. Different each time you watch it (I've seen it 7 times now, each time I notice something different that makes the movie even better. Most of them are little, like phrases used in the beginning, then used again later on in different context.) 6. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are amazing (if you liked Shaun of the Dead, you should thoroughly love this!) 7. Old people with guns (One thing people look for in a movie, is the unexpected.) 8. Fast paced, moves along very well. (From the beginning, you're thrown into the great story and will have you watching intently the rest of the film.) 9. Unpredictable (Sure you might be psychic and predict a few things, but you'll never predict the whole movie unless your friends ruin it for you. It's got surprising twists and turns throughout with clever dialogue and such) 10. Will have you cheering! (I saw this film twice in two different locations, and both times the whole audience was vocal, in the non-annoying way. We laughed, we were trans-fixed, and we cheered more than once.) Basically, If you love comedy and kick arse action, there is no reason for you not to see and enjoy this movie."
"TOMNEL","7","2","4","4 October 2008"," A strange mixture of comedy, action and horror, that works for the most part.
","Edgar Wright's last film ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a horror movie, and a comedy, but more than anything it was a comedy. There were tense scenes, but the more often than not, the comedy prevailed. Here, it's hard to tell what the heck this is. It's good, but it's a weird kind of good caught in genre limbo, never really knowing what the heck it is. It's a black comedy at times, and sometimes is as tense an action flick as you could find. Then there's the horror. The shady villain ready to decapitate his or her enemies, but the violent images cause laughter. Where most movies have a consistent mood, like an action-comedy, which is full of shooting, but with a wink to the camera, this jumps around. For 30 minutes straight it will be pure nail biting action with very little comedy, before switching to downright jokey scenes. It's good...just weird.<br/><br/>Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a hotshot cop who does his job well and by the book. He's making all his fellow officers look bad, so they force him to be reassigned to ""winner of best village of the year"", Sandford. Nick hates how little his fellow officers in Sandford seem to care about anything. He's paired with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), son of Police Chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Things are pretty boring, and are limited to speeding tickets and underage drinking until a series of violent murders occurs. Secrets are revealed, leading to an odd, yet original ending.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright has a fast paced style of direction that looks good but can grow tiring. Some scenes needed to be played out to build suspense, but instead drop the suspense and let the action happen right away. Constant cut to's and flashy quick shots are reminiscent of Joel Schumaker's ""masterpiece"" ""Batman & Robin"". This movie really shouldn't be compared to a movie like that though. Even with the flashy direction, this was a fine British flick.<br/><br/>The acting is good. The chemistry is great between Pegg and Frost, who are written quite different from their characters in ""Shaun of the Dead"". Timothy Olymphant is excellent in the supporting cast, and manages to be constantly both funny and menacing. The cast mostly consists of many English actors that cause people to say, ""I've seen their face, don't know where, don't know their name."" Several unnamed British actors play backup roles, and they give everyman (or woman) performances that fit in nicely.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has no genre. It jumps around which doesn't always work. But what does work is the acting and the story. Even if this may cause a slight headache due to quick cuts, it's still a funny and action filled comedy triumph for Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 120 mins. Rated R for strong violence and language."
"zxakari","10","2","4","6 June 2008"," Action comedy makes fun of action movies, so is it a parody of itself?
","Hilarious comedy combining a wide range of humor, from slapstick to satire, in an 'in you face' way. Basically this movie is filmed like an action movie: flashing between camera angles making a 'whoosh' sound, plenty of swearing, over the top characters and the quintessential action movie cliché large explosion to top it off.<br/><br/>There is very little action except about 20 minutes, most of it at the end. The movie is about the perfect police man, Nicolas Angel, who gets transfered from his London job--because he makes the others in the department look bad--to an odd little village in the country. There with his lazy incompetent partner who is infatuated with action movies he investigates a series a 'accidents' which he believes are really murders.<br/><br/>Other than his perfect reputation, Sgt. Angel is a realistic police man the only really plausibly realistic character. He does not like to get in to physical confrontation because there is ""a lot of paperwork"", he dislikes guns and says his best police tool is a notebook. By contrast, his partner Danny Butterman is lazy, incompetent and irresponsible.<br/><br/>Most of the movie plays out as a mystery comedy with action-like- sequencing. Plenty of British humor and slapstick. And when the movie truly gets heated up the multi-layer humor makes this one of the best comedies in recent years.<br/><br/>If you like--or maybe even dislike--most action movies and love comedy then this movie is an excellent choice--but caution: some action involved."
"homestar_is_cool","10","2","4","21 March 2008"," It's just too perfect on the first try
","This film reminds you of the previous film that Simon Pegg, the new king of comedy since Mel Brooks and the ZAZ (Zucker Abrahams Zucker, the guys who made Airplane! and Hot Shots!) team, made, which was Shaun of the Dead. It also reminds you of films like Final Destination and Child's Play because it was so flippin' gory! However, what I can say about this film was that it was a perfect slapstick to watch. I loved every minute of it, especially the subtle black humor that happened at the time when both the mansion exploded and when Nick and Danny were watching action films and drinking alcohol. I loved the way they parodied everything by actually sticking to their guns and the real genres, rather than try to make a joke from every cliché that the world had seen in films like Meet the Spartans and Strange Wilderness. It, however, has some gory deaths, a lot of profanity, and some underage alcohol drinking, as in comedy. It is R for all of those, but I caught the film on Cinemax. Boy, it was funny and it succeeded at that goal.<br/><br/>I just don't know why people don't understand the British way of making spoofs. It's about as funny as an American spoof, like Blazing Saddles of Airplane!, but I guess it tries to be serious and it succeeds. I dare you to see this film if you get the chance, but if you are that fan of Meet the Spartans and absolutely hate any smart humor, this film is not for you. You have to understand. Some jokes do miss the target, but you'll get it the second go around.<br/><br/>Oh, and thank God this film made more than Meet the Spartans."
"husks","8","2","4","31 January 2008"," Hot Fuzz works!
","Hot Fuzz opens with Detective Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) getting sent to the small town of Sandford because he's so good at his job that he's made the big city police force look bad in comparison. Angel gets a doughy sidekick (Nick Frost) and is forced to fix problems like escaped swans and rowdy jugglers. When a series of unusual accidents start to befall the residents of Sandford, Angel realizes that crazy doesn't always distinguish between the city and the country, forcing him to take justice into his own hands.<br/><br/>Do you remember how well co-writer/director Edgar Wright and co-writer/star Simon Pegg used zombie influences to tell an actual story in Shaun of the Dead? At first, horror fans were just trying to spot the references to various zombie movies, but - and this is the reason why Shaun continues to grow in popularity - the movie quickly became enjoyable and interesting on its own terms, completely independent from the films that inspired it. Hot Fuzz does an even better job at taking a genre and not just spoofing it, but actually becoming a part of it. And it does it by being hilariously over-the-top and yet miraculously unoffensive. Without giving too much away, Hot Fuzz features some of the most insane gore you'll see all year, including an old lady getting kicked in the face, and a priest getting shot and shouting ""Jesus Christ!"" as he hits the ground. On paper, it sounds like the kind of thing that would offend most of the Red states, but it's so incredibly engaging and well-done, you'll have a hard time imagining anyone not having a good time. Hot Fuzz is so much pure fun, that if you don't like it, you don't really like movies.<br/><br/>Finally, let's make one distinction clear. There's a whole genre of comedy nowadays that just takes what's familiar and simply regurgitates it with more fart jokes and mugging. (""Remember Borat? Wasn't that great?"") Hot Fuzz is absolutely not ""Action Movie"" (although that's probably not too far down the road from those Epic and Date Movie folks). Writers Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg LOVE action movies. Movies like Point Break are easy to make fun of - anyone could do that - but it's really difficult to find a way to both make fun of and pay respect to the cheesy action genre that most of us secretly hold as a guilty pleasure. The final act of Hot Fuzz actually becomes an over-the-top action extravaganza with some shoot-outs and car chases that are as well choreographed as most of the action movies released this year (it doesn't hurt to have recognizable genre faces like Edward Woodward and Timothy Dalton in major roles). In fact, at the end of the year, Hot Fuzz may be both your favorite comedy and your favorite action movie of 2007, and that's no joke."
"Jonny_Numb","7","2","4","21 November 2007"," May be the best comedy of 2007
","Despite a glut of critical accolades, ""Shaun of the Dead"" struck me as an uneven parody/homage of George Romero's zombie films--the premise was well-executed, the carnage grisly, and the laughs sort of infrequent. I don't know, perhaps it was my own bias toward a bunch of Brits sending up Romero's VERY American films (and the subsequent humor being skewed in the vein of the former) that kept the film from being all it could have been. The good news with ""Hot Fuzz"" is that it's not only a fine rebound from ""Shaun,"" but possibly the best comedy of 2007. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), London's finest boy in blue, is reassigned to the small idyllic town of Standford after his superior officer claims he's making the rest of the force ""look bad""; Standford comes across as a squeaky-clean village where a missing swan commands police priority, but when a string of gruesome ""accidents"" claim the lives of several citizens, Angel gets suspicious. Whereas ""Shaun""'s setting seemed to work against it, co-writers Pegg and Edgar Wright (who also directed) strike up a balanced script that takes aim at the Michael Bay/Kathryn Bigelow school of Hollywood cop flicks (""Bad Boys II"" and ""Point Break"" figure wonderfully into the plot), all the while acknowledging the absurdity of rapid-fire shootouts taking place in the English countryside (the last half hour is a jaw-dropping, hilarious tribute to quick-cutting and over-the-top action). The chemistry between Pegg and Nick Frost (who plays Angel's naive partner) is excellent, a comedic collaboration that grows richer with each film; and the supporting cast of British veterans is well-chosen, from Billie Whitelaw to Edward Woodward, Jim Broadbent and even former James Bond Timothy Dalton (as a shady supermarket manager, of all things). My only complaint would be an overlong run time that hurts the otherwise strong momentum, but even so, ""Hot Fuzz"" is a winner."

They are making another film with them two in it in their ""blood and ice cream"" series.These two are probably the best British comedy duo around,id like to see America match up to these two.This film really is the cream of British comedy.The ""blood and ice cream""series consists of Shaun of the dead and Hot Fuzz At the moment but i've heard that they are currently writing a new sequel called ""Chris"" i really hope this excellent duo returns to British theatres soon!If you know of a plot that they may produce;please leave a post on this site.They have covered Horror/comedy :Shaun of the dead. Action/Comedy:Hot fuzz.I wonder what else they can do.But i bet any money that these two geniuses can come up with something."

","Hot Fuzz was a nice diversion, but here's the thing: it just wasn't funny. I could tell where the jokes were. I said to myself hey, that was a joke and I should have laughed. But I didn't. To be fair, there were a few mild chuckles, but no out and out belly laughs. I expected more from the creators of Shaun of the Dead. SotD was funny and sometimes subtle and clever. Hot Fuzz was neither subtle or clever. I suppose this wouldn't really matter if the movie had been funny. <br/><br/>I think that part of the problem is that the movies Hot Fuzz makes fun of already have their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks. Bad Boys II and Point Break are already parodies to a certain extent, so what's the point of making a parody of them?"

","What can I say? It's a brilliant comedy that works on the same levels as Shaun of the Dead (even though I haven't seen it!) The story goes that Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote this film) is one of the best cops in the UK. But his colleagues are very jealous. So, they send Nick to the sleepy town of Sandford, where not much happens a lot. To make things worse, he's teamed up with a wannabe-cop named Danny (Nick Frost). But soon, a series of murders start to happen, and Nick is convinced that this town may not be so sleepy after all.<br/><br/>This film works as a brilliant comedy and a mystery thriller. The thriller only adds to the humour of the film. Simon Pegg was great and brought a lot to the film.<br/><br/>This is the best British comedy in years. Very recommended!"

","Hot Fuzz is one of those films that creates a love/hate relationship with most people. Those that don't 'get it' will no doubt hate it but those that like films like this and pretty much use films like this as a cut off point for their further filmic viewing will love it. I have to admit that I am veering more towards the 'hate it' category as I've seen rather a large amount of films and can honestly say close to brainless, all action and comedic films like this are only fun every once in a while.<br/><br/>I do, however, think it's fantastic to see Britain produce films like this and Shaun of the Dead given the state of affairs Hollywood is in what with all the sequels and remakes that are being made and what better way to make it big in the States by spoofing those action films Americans have become all too associated with. Hot Fuzz is really just a stab; it's a stab at many things. These can include minor stabs at small town police forces or full blown stabs at films that rely on ridiculous, over the top action scenes; two of which are mentioned in this film anyway (Point Break and Bad Boys 2) and two of which are referenced very cleverly to boot.<br/><br/>Also, if you've never been a member of the police force or have never been in a small town/village police station, who knows what goes on inside? The fact the station has its own 'swear jar' and a riot gear storage cupboard that is covered in cobwebs through disuse is absolutely hilarious, as is the relaxed approach all the officers have. I especially liked the head of the CCTV thinking he had a very important job to do when really, nothing criminal happens so there's no need for him to even be there. Another clever convention that the writers included and at well spaced times was the emphasis on seemingly meaningless jobs. So many times do we see focus on Nicholas Angel (Pegg) having to deal with insignificant tasks such as recovering a lost swan or having to deal with a church fete yet they are still moulded into the plot somehow in a clever and entertaining way.<br/><br/>If Shaun of the Dead was a parody of zombie films then like I said earlier, Hot Fuzz is a parody of Hollywood action films. The scene when Danny Butterman (Frost) shoots uncontrollably into the air from a lying position and when the chopper flies overhead in slow motion as Danny and Angel emerge from the wreckage are two scenes straight out of Point Break (1991) and Bad Boys II (2003), respectively; both of which, when they eventually occur are fantastic to watch in an oddly surreal way.<br/><br/>On top of this, towards the end the film seems to cleverly flick between reality and fantasy. The scene in question is when after spoofing so many films in an ultra unrealistic way, the film has the audacity to turn down the chance to use a one liner and this is mentioned by Danny to Angel who replies back something like ""No, that's only in the movies."" Very funny yet playful with the testing of realism at the same time.<br/><br/>What Hot Fuzz lacks for in brains, it makes up for in style as it cleverly switches from opening like a dramatic, cop thriller before turning to an episode of 'Inspector Morse', before morphing again into Bad Boys II and then completing its transformation when it finishes like The Wicker Man (1973). Some jokes however don't work, especially the character of Simon Skinner (Dalton). His constant references to decapitation get very tiresome very quickly and might just as well walk around with a placard saying: 'Here, I'm the bad guy' but this is cleverly played with later on as we assume the writers take us all for mugs. On the whole, if you can look past the things that make Hot Fuzz look more like an hour and a half long spoof show, you'll find a funny and at times engaging film that despite its flaws will pass the time very easily."

","From the creators of Shaun of the Dead, this homage to the police-action genre (from the TV shows like Miami Vice to the Lethal Weapon movie series of the nineties to the Bad Boys of the more recent years) makes the director Edgar Wright and co-writer/star Simon Pegg household names after proving themselves to be a force to be reckoned with in the blooming field of intelligent British comedy. Maybe this generation has finally found its Monty Python team.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz describes how Nicholas Angel, a young and brilliant cop with an arrest record of 400% higher than any other officer in the force, is forced by his London superiors and peers to be assigned in a remote, peaceful and pleasant small English town because he is a major threat to everyone's promotions.<br/><br/>Upon a few hours after his arrival, he has already arrested a few blokes from a bar, and is practically known by everyone in less than 24 hours. The reactions from his fellow officers are quite mixed--Danny Butterman, the son of the chief, looks up to Sergeant Angel as an ultimate embodiment of an action hero in the movies that he has seen; while a few of the officers seem also threatened and skeptical about the excellence of their new member.<br/><br/>As Sergeant Angel gets familiar with the rest of the town, he discovers that some individuals he meets tend to die a few hours after he meets them. The locals tell him that all of the deaths were mere accidental, but Angel believes that there's a conspiracy behind these brutal killings. This leads him to distrust certain people, until he comes face-to-face the real nature of the people behind him--the entire village ganging up on him and feeling threatened by Angel's real heroic, action-packed demeanor. But for Sergeant Nicholas Angel, no one should be above the law. In a memorable segment, he rides on a horse, ala Lito Lapid, with ridiculous amount of guns and ammunitions, and he shows 'em all what he's got.<br/><br/>It's more engaging and hilarious than Shaun of the Dead, and the twist of the movie is just right on the spot.<br/><br/>Witty, hilarious script. Solid acting. British humour. Fast-paced action. Damn. I hope there's a sequel."
"ElmStreetsLastBrat","9","2","4","22 July 2007"," Brilliant and absolutely hilarious!
","I am such a fan of movies like this! I love black humor comedies. I saw this at the $1 movies a local theater in my neighborhood has on Wednesdays. And I had been going every week for the past three weeks and since most of the movies that were playing were films that I had already seen, Hot Fuzz was pretty much my only choice. And I was in the mood for a comedy too so I decided on this one. I wasn't sure about what the plot involved and I wasn't even sure if I'd like it. I did know it was from the same people who had made Shaun of the Dead. I've only seen bits and pieces from that film. I'm not a big fan of zombie movies so I kind of steer clear from that one. Zombies freak me out! LOL. But I decided to give this one a try anyway. and I'm glad I did! The plot is pretty simple. Nicholas Angel (a brilliant and hilarious Simon Pegg) is a police officer who has just been recruited to the London countryside because his co-workers are jealous of his work. There he finds that the officers in the police force don't take their work seriously and are often very lazy and uninterested in saving lives. They think police work is all fun and games. And Nicholas tries to bring some rules and commitment to the force and do his job. But this little town has a dark, dark secret. There are gruesome murders being committed by a person in a dark hooded cloak. And while Nicholas Angel is interested in capturing this murderer and solving these murders, his fellow co-workers just want to sit back and eat doughnuts.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS!!!***** But once Nicholas discovers that pretty much the whole town is in a wicked covenant and they all have been committing these murders (just because the victims didn't' live up to the covenant's standards or had some kind of flaw), they start hunting down Nicholas and try to get him to join. But he flees out of town and after a while comes back, armed with machine guns, rocket launchers, shotguns, handguns, grenades, and other weapons and ammunition. He, along with his buddy Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), wander back into town and start opening fire on the town. And come to find out, the whole town starts shooting back! Even the priests and the nuns! This climactic gunfight scene is the best scene in the film, in my opinion. It's hilarious, brilliantly directed and acted, and dark. But what makes it so funny is that no one dies and only a few people get shot in the foot or the hand. But no one gets fatally shot! And then the gunfight moves into a grocery store where they use buggies and boxes of food as weapons too. So freaking hilarious.<br/><br/>This film was brilliant and incredibly funny. Sure, it was a little dumb at times but it was supposed to be!! And like I said before, that gunfight was the best scene in the movie. Even if you get bored in the first half, you should definitely stay for the gunfight. Some of the death scenes were a little gory and graphic, such as a man having a concrete church steeple landing on his head and a woman having a pair of gardening shears stuck in her throat and blood spurting out everywhere. And then that became a joke between the police force ""she slipped and fell and landed on her garden shears!"" they would say because they didn't' believe there were any murders going on.<br/><br/>Any fan of Shaun of the Dead will enjoy this and even if you haven't seen that film you should see this one if you're a fan of black humor comedies. I'm glad I saw this film and I think it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of comedies, as I am a huge fan. I was not disappointed in the least with this film and I will own the DVD! Thank you for reading my review!"

"sullibrandon","10","2","4","28 June 2007"," Perfect British Satire
","I was afraid that Hot Fuzz would be a letdown - the trailers looked kind of lame, and I wasn't quite used to Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright yet. But I had read good reviews, and I absolutely loved Shaun of the Dead, so I thought I'd give Hot Fuzz a try. The trailers suck and don't even begin to do it justice - Hot Fuzz is the funniest and wittiest comedy I have seen in a long time, possibly even exceeding its predecessor.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a spectacular cop who is so spectacular he is making his colleagues look bad. As a solution, his superior officers have him transferred to the very small town of Sandford, where he must contend with the dangerous threat of underage drinkers, loiterers, and drunk drivers. For the most part, Sandford is apparently a small town with small problems.<br/><br/>Angel teams up with the inspector's son, Danny Butterman, a cop who is obsessed with cop movies, played by Nick Frost, who worked alongside Pegg in Shaun of the Dead. The two once again share perfect chemistry here as classic cop buddies. Eventually some murders begin to happen around time, murders that most everybody dismisses as accidents but which Angel suspects to be something more. An investigation ensues into the classic serial killer that you've seen in dozens of cop movies, parodied lovingly and perfectly here.<br/><br/>Everything about Hot Fuzz works. This is no simple parody that is content to just laugh at its source material. There are so many little things in Hot Fuzz, stuff that you'll need to look for if you want to catch it. Dozens of homages to cop movies are sprinkled all over the place, and the wonderful thing is is that they're subtle, discreet, under-the-counter, woven into the storyline and characters in such a way that they do not jump out and scream at you like in Austin Powers or Scary Movie. This isn't just a parody of cop movies. It's a cop movie. It's a true cop movie in every sense of the word, but its genius rests in the fact that it manages to be a complete cop movie while also making unashamed fun of the genre. As I walked out of this movie I kept on shaking my head at what genius this was - there was such a perfect pitch and feel to this movie I felt it almost literally has no equal in terms of spoofs.<br/><br/>A lot of it is due to the excellent cast and the perfect chemistry they share. Simon Pegg is absolutely brilliant and will eventually take his place among British comedic legends alongside the likes of Rowan Atkinson and Martin Freeman. (In my view he's already there.) The cameos from Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, and Steve Coogan at the beginning were absolutely perfect. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg share a virtually and subtly homo-erotic friendship in the film and it is perfectly and subtly funny, never over the top, but just enough there to catch and laugh at. The people in Sandford also perfectly fulfill their role, especially Jim Broadbent as the inspector. Timothy Dalton as the maybe-villain throughout the film is wonderful and you can tell he's having plenty of fun.<br/><br/>Another great thing that sells this movie is that it doesn't sell itself short on action. A lot of movies would have probably skimped on the action well known to cop movies and focused too much on the parody , but the final thirty minutes of Hot Fuzz are a hilariously climactic showdown. And it's not just cheesy action. There is some fun cheese and camp within the action, but overall, it's actually GOOD - this is action that wouldn't be out of place in a, for lack of a better word, normal action pic. It's a perfect homage to cop movies while also being a wonderfully thrilling scene in its own right. Shaun of the Dead was lacking a little in what truly constituted zombie action, and the final scene at the bar I found to be kind of disappointing and dragged out. Hot Fuzz's final scene is perfect and expertly executed. The rest of the movie contains plenty of creative gore, and thought sometimes I found it to be a little odd that they were putting so much gore into the film, I eventually accepted it as an homage to the many R-rated cop movies that exist out there - and it's not boring gore - most, if not all of it, had the entire audience cringing with how intense and creative it was.<br/><br/>The only thing that Hot Fuzz lacks from Shaun of the Dead is the smart social commentary. Shaun of the Dead was deep and it had some important and interesting things to say, but Hot Fuzz is meant to be just simple and great fun. It's also a better parody of cop movies than Shaun of the Dead was of zombie movies - on the whole it executes its goal with perfect grace and requires smarts and wits to watch. It's not some dumb mindless comedy - so many things in this movie are about watching closely and fully appreciating the love that these creators had for the original material. Many times directors will skimp on thought and originality when directing a spoof - sacrificing character development, plot, and action and just riding the wave of the original's success. Hot Fuzz doesn't even come close to doing this. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright could easily have gone the lazy route, but they absolutely refused, and I respect and admire them for that. This movie is such a film that it is likely people will end up parodying it. A pitch-perfect parody and comedy, Hot Fuzz is entertaining and hilarious and masterfully accomplished in every single way."
"theslick1","8","2","4","25 June 2007"," Quirky and Entertaining But Grisly Action-Comedy
","It's hard to pigeonhole this one as a comedy, an action film, or a thriller, but it's fair to say it has elements of all three genres. If you are accustomed to Hollywood films that neatly fit into one of these genres, you will no doubt size this one up as a cop/buddy film (i.e., Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys, etc.) but you will be in for a shock as the film progresses, if only for the occasional but graphic violence that lies ahead. I say ""graphic,"" but it all seems a little cartoon-like when you see how the characters react to it. If you think of the Monty Python skit of the knight slowly being dismembered but continuing to fight off his foe sans arms and legs, you're on the right track. I didn't see Shaun of the Dead so it was my first encounter with either of the leads, who are both very good. All in all, this is not a classic but it is a nice diversion from the fare that Hollywood usually serves."
"Kryzak","9","2","4","30 May 2007"," It is hilarious!!!
","This movie is AWESOME! I liked ""Shaun of the Dead"", but the humor in there wasn't ""roll on the floor laughing"" type humor (for me). ""Hot Fuzz"" takes the same lead and a similar cast, and makes an even better spoof of police movies like ""Bad Boys"" and ""Point Break."" The first 2/3 of the movie was clever, funny, and well done, but as I realized after the movie, EVERYTHING was there to set up for the last 1/3 of the movie. The last part of the movie made me laugh so hard my stomach hurt! The absurdity of the situation combined with the action sequences were a match made in heaven. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes a good spoof and a good laugh!"

","Hot Fuzz was simply a lot of fun. Simon Pegg's follow-up to Shaun of the Dead (not a sequel) delivers once again with its very blunt, rapid humour. The film direction and editing was sublime - extremely fast paced yet so easy to follow. The storyline itself is quite similar in ways of Shaun of the Dead, using the same actors playing similar roles, except, Pegg's character isn't as much of a loser as that in Shaun of the Dead. Nick Frost is also in the same role, playing the sidekick to Pegg, a loser with no friends and very dimwitted and lovable at the same time.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is essentially a spoof on the police drama genre, but it isn't so obviously a rip-off. It has a proper storyline which, even as a comedy, keeps you thinking till the end. The film's take on modern society and the role reversal of the old community and chavs is quite hilarious and clever. In the beginning, Pegg's character ignores the idling hoodies with a snuff, just as people would prefer to do in real life, then later shows that in fact they are the saviour of Sandford whilst the oldies are there to brainwash it.<br/><br/>This is a must see film that will bring out all kinds of emotions from you. Never has a film mixed comedy, action, suspense, horror, gore, drama and detective/film noir in such an effective way."

","How to top Shaun of the Dead? Such a question had been endlessly circling between moviegoers worldwide since the release of the impeccable satire yet tribute to zombie films mixed with romance and a healthy side of British comedy in 2004. The combination (cleverly billed as ""rom-zom-com"") clicked, but with expectations raised so high, the possibility of a follow up which could match or exceed Shaun in terms of creativity, cleverness and sheer enjoyment factor seemed a daunting prospect indeed. Fortunately, director Edgar Wright and his co-writer and star Simon Pegg proved ahead of themselves, as they embraced their sudden fame rather than falling prey to its trappings, following up their previous hit with an exuberant and masterful send up of the oh so stereotypical buddy cop movie. The result? Hot Fuzz. <br/><br/>Director Wright's body of work is an interesting one indeed, as he seems constantly torn between showing immense knowledge of whatever genre he is satirizing, while delivering a superb entry in said genre all the while - a trait he continues with Hot Fuzz. Chock full of enough references of classic (and some classically bad) action films to keep even the most experienced action buffs busy, Hot Fuzz is itself a testament to the sheer quantity of knowledge and enthusiasm Wright and Pegg had for the genre. But all the same, while Hot Fuzz is clever enough to never take itself too seriously, and remain for the most part a wonderfully tongue in cheek satire, the filmmakers don't shy away from the task of creating what is simply one of the most adrenaline fuelled, blood pumping action sequences ever seen on a movie screen. Wright also keeps things interesting throughout with a rapid fire editing style (seen in smaller doses in Shaun), showing blindingly fast montages with exaggerated sound effects, a wonderfully unique technique which really succeeds in retaining the audience's attention without seeming pretentious or mind-numbing. <br/><br/>It is this final combat scene and the few preceding it which really make Hot Fuzz the wonderful piece of work it is - while the build up throughout the film, establishing the characters, the setting and the pseudo murder-mystery feel to the plot, and throwing in a few chuckle-worthy one liners all the while is for the most part comical and entertaining, it proves a bit too slow and uneventful, with the clever comedic touches too sparse to really make as much of an impact as one might hope. Fortunately, the climatic showdown is enough to make up for any of the film's prior shortcomings - gut-wrenchingly hilarious, yet endlessly energetic and exciting all the same. It is in these last few scenes Hot Fuzz really excels, and raises the limit from simply chuckle-worthy to flat out hysterical and supremely entertaining. <br/><br/>It helps of course that Wright seems to have rallied up nearly every British character actor on the planet to make an appearance, though it goes without saying that the real attraction of the show is the simply wonderful dynamic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost reuniting once again after TV's Spaced and Shaun; this time as a hard edged, obsessive London cop and his witless country bumpkin partner (with Pegg playing the straight man for a change, allowing Frost's dimwitted character to pick up most of the punchlines). But there is also wonderful comedic support from the supporting cast, including Jim Broadbent as the bumbling but warm hearted police chief of the backwards British town Pegg's character is sent off to, a scene stealing Timothy Dalton, a far cry from his Bond days as a hilarious and very suspicious seeming grocery store baron and Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as verbally abusive detectives with highly questionable facial hair. The film's tongue in cheek cameos are also highlights, with the likes of Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan raising many a laugh in their minute scenes as Pegg's jealous fellow London policemen, and unrecognizable, blink-you-miss-'em appearances from Cate Blanchett as Pegg's ex-girlfriend and Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as a murderous Santa Clause. What's not to love? <br/><br/>All in all, Hot Fuzz proves itself as one of the most gutsy and energetic satires in recent history, side-splitting action cliché parodies mixed with adrenaline pumped tributes to the genre, fuelled by a wonderfully witty script and Wright's trademark rapid-fire editing and brilliant cinematography. It's just a shame it takes so long for the film to really get going, but once the plot picks up and the action starts, Hot Fuzz makes its place as one of the most entertaining comedies or action films in recent history... see it for 'the greater good'. <br/><br/>-9.5/10"

","In 2004, the zombie comedy *Shaun of the Dead*, hit us like a shovel to the face. *Hot Fuzz* is like that same shovel  to the bollacks. Harder, heavier, grittier and gruesomer than *Shaun*, Brit import *Hot Fuzz* throws down action badder than Hollywood's baddest bad boys - and it's a comedy.<br/><br/>The same team that brought us *Shaun* (writer-director Edgar Wright and writer-star Simon Pegg) have found their havoc stride with *Hot Fuzz*, which does for law enforcement what *Shaun* did for the dead  bring it to life just to beat the living cliché out of it.<br/><br/>Pegg is Nicholas Angel, a London supercop transferred by the London brass (fed up with him singlehandedly making them look bad) to an indolent Sandford village, which he treats as rigorously as London, adhering to ""official vocab guidelines"" and wearing his vest on foot patrol. Ragged by fellow officers for his big-city élan and partnered with plump, oblivious action-movie fan, Danny (Nick Frost), Angel becomes dubious over the village's drowsy façade after three Sandford residents have fatal ""accidents."" His friendship with Danny becomes his only lifeline as he uncovers a provincial conspiracy to retain the village's award-winning bucolic aesthetic  through murder.<br/><br/>Whilst paying homage to Action Film canon (John Woo, Michael Bay, Richard Donner, Clint Eastwood), Pegg and Wright's forte is in taking the vinegar out of the conventions: ""Is it true that there's a point on a man's head where if you shoot it, it will blow up?""; after a villain is dispatched into a refrigerator, ""Did you tell him to cool off?""; a music swell will suddenly cut short when the action on screen takes a turn that the audience and, it would seem, the film-makers were not expecting; or Angel will pull a rugged hero-face into the camera when he screeches a squad car to a halt  then he will pull that same face when he screeches a bicycle to a halt; or Danny badgers Angel with excitable questions that he believes a big-city cop should have lived through: ""Have you ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?"" ""Have you ever fired a gun whilst in a high speed pursuit?""  all of which happens in due course to the unsuspecting dynamic duo with film-makers' tongues planted wickedly in cheeks.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it is hard to follow a surprise hit (*Shaun*) with a ""planned"" hit, because we the audience now EXPECT the laughs. And we expect them with a lot more snot and giggles. (In that respect, it might almost have been favorable for *Fuzz*'s intended audience NOT to have seen *Shaun*.) Suffice to say, *Hot Fuzz* seems a tad more ""forced"" than *Shaun*. It doesn't help that American marketers insist on giving us ten different thirty-second trailers containing ten gags each, specifically to spell out that *Fuzz* is a comedy, to American audiences whose sensibilities have been blunted by this type of actioner that actually takes itself seriously. Thus, adding the ""expectancy quotient"" to the deadened ""advertised gags,"" we are left with an uphill battle to jocular nirvana.<br/><br/>Which indicates how good *Fuzz* is, to still pull off a goodly wallop of jock.<br/><br/>Oft-times, British humor does not translate well to American audiences, the prime example that bridged that gap being Monty Python. But we realize Python did not succeed entirely when supposedly reputable media like *The Hollywood Reporter* still employs empty vessels like Ray Bennett: ""When the two start flying through the air with automatics kicking, you'd bet they would give anything to be in a Robert Rodriguez film and not in a comedy at all."" Uh  is there any point explaining parody to someone who is not equipped to comprehend it? Danny's character almost represents the fumbling-for-apprehension American psyche, when he blurts explanations to callback gags and specifies the movies that *Hot Fuzz* actually spoofs.<br/><br/>Like *Shaun,* editing is performed with the gale-force of ripping gonads, editor Chris Dickens placing *Fuzz* spectacularly and squarely in its actioner genre for maximum parody - if it wasn't a comedy, it would be an A-List B-Movie.<br/><br/>Not only do Wright and Pegg knock down movie conventions (Angel elocuting like Eastwood in avenger mode; camera swooshing around the two bad boys like Michael Bay in-de-hizz-ouse), they envelope-push social convention as well, molding Angel and Danny's relationship into an ambiguously gay-ish interaction, yet never actually stooping to facile gay jokes, but skirting the ambiguity itself for the laughs. Angel is also the world's first openly-atheist hero (without that fact involving a plot point); there is also no female love interest forced into the plot for pap Romantic Ending Protocol.<br/><br/>British comedic mainstays, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan all cameo in the first ten minutes, then are sadly missed. Replaced in Sandford with other Brit cameos: Timothy Dalton's suspicious grocery store manager, Jim Broadbent's sinister Police Inspector and a double-decker bus load of familiar faces.<br/><br/>The allusions are innumerable and definitely require a second viewing for their lightning passage (*Straw Dogs,* Dire Straits' *Romeo and Juliet*), but familiarity with *Point Break*, the *Lethal Weapon*s and *Shaun of the Dead* itself will get you over the ""British humor"" hump.<br/><br/>And really, if you don't get it by now, after Python and *Black Adder* and *Fawlty Towers* and *Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels* and Ali G and *Extras* I have here a shovel.<br/><br/>Present me your bollacks.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

","Hot Fuzz is a cheeky British parody of both the Agatha Christie murder mystery and the American violent cop (think Bad Boys I and II) genres. It starts out amusingly ridiculous, moves to snickeringly ludicrous, then takes it up a few notches to gigglingly over the top. Oddly enough, it's when the violence and gunplay got most extreme that I laughed the most. The hyper-violence, though cartoonish to adults, might be inappropriate for pre-teens, though.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote the screenplay, stars as the nearly believably, over-virtuous constable Nicholas Angel of London's Metropolitan Police Service. Two years into the job, and Angel has 400% more arrests than the next best cop, making everyone else on the force look like a slacker by comparison. So, to eliminate this embarrassment, the chief ships him off to the countryside (the amusingly ridiculous part).<br/><br/>Angel arrives in the sleepy hamlet of Sandford in Gloucestershire, where the town immediately seems a bit a Stepford-esquire. Angel swoops in and continues his incredible conscientiousness, pissing off townfolk and co-workers alike, except for the hero worship of his lazy, bumbling partner, Danny, the local police chief's son (and co-writer of the screenplay). Angel is bored out of his mind until there is a gory and apparently accidental death. Certain incongruities make him suspicious, although his coworkers can't believe that in their serene little town, this would be anything more than an accident. A few more of these, and Angel gets properly exercised, mostly at the police dept.'s comic unwillingness to believe that the deaths are connected. At this point, I was involved enough to share Angel's frustration, although the parody of the buddy cop relationship kept me chuckling.<br/><br/>When Angel uncovers the truth behind the deaths and the town itself (the snickeringly ludicrous part), he takes it upon himself to take down all the bad guys himself. Of course, Danny rises to the occasion to help him. This is where the movie abandons all pretense of believability and goes gigglingly off the rails.<br/><br/>To enjoy Hot Fuzz, you must not take anything in the movie seriously. The movie is not dumb, it's just a sharp and bloody variety of slapstick."

","It must be stated before all else that I am not a fan of British entertainment. I never have been. It's nothing against the British, I guess I among those who just don't get it. The distinction between this particular piece of British entertainment, a satirical action picture brilliantly titled Hot Fuzz, is although the production may be British, the target of parody is something uniquely American: the big-budget, loud, and often times not very good action picture.<br/><br/>Like most guys in the 18-29 demographic, I find almost nothing as fun as watching a bloody, explosion-filled, and for some, headache-inducing testosterone-driven ninety minutes of excitement in a dark movie theater (although with DVD these days, it's almost just as much fun at home). Unfortunately, there's often more brains being blown up on screen than brains being put to use behind the camera. Hot Fuzz is perhaps the first action extravaganza in years to have thought, story, and characters to go along with the mayhem. Those not familiar with the staples of the genre will most likely be lost, but for those who have grown up on a steady diet of Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and the other action franchises of the last twenty years will probably be left breathless. Even my mother, who is not a fan of violent action, found it to be brilliant satire. A big part of what is be satirized is the unintentional romanticized buddy conventions of action epics, so Hot Fuzz like Edgar Wright's previous masterpiece Shaun of the Dead, often plays out like a romantic comedy. Use that logic with your girlfriend and you may have a date to the best movie in years. 10/10"
"Quinoa1984","10","2","4","21 April 2007"," uproarious British spoof; a send-up that delivers the high-octane action, tons of puns and tasteless gags
","Edgar Wright has somehow outdone himself from his previous first feature comedy/zombie movie, Shaun of the Dead, with his Hot Fuzz, a send-up of all those cop/law-enforcement movies where the style goes berserk and beyond post-modernism into some kind of frantic 'show-em-what-we-got' method of big-bang action and cheesy catch phrases amid an absurd plot. This time, Wright and co-writer/star Simon Pegg know very well how much the absurdism already goes on in those movies, particularly those by Michael Bay, and the send-up is all the more brilliant because there's nothing extremely hateful towards the movies (one might think, for sort of guilty pleasure sake, Wright and Pegg sit around watching these movies as much as the Danny character does in the film), and the level of zaniness imposed knows no boundaries. <br/><br/>Actually, the boundaries are sort of set by genre, however this even dips into movies such as The Wicker Man (which is actually very indebted to the main storyline), Scream, and even Godzilla in one scene. And unlike Shaun of the Dead, the gags, however subtle or post Monty Python they get, practically never stop. This time, tone doesn't drastically change; it's consistently with a tongue placed firmly in its Great British cheek. And speaking of Monty Python, as I walked out of the theater a late Python member popped in my mind in relation to Simon Pegg's Nick Angel in Hot Fuzz: Graham Chapman. Here, Pegg shows completely, like Chapman, that he's perfectly capable of playing the straight man in comedic situations, even more here than in 'Shaun', and that his level of being the ""normal"" in an otherwise zany comic setting makes it seemingly even. <br/><br/>Then, suddenly, in the third act, we see Pegg's character have to take a turn by way of how the story makes its dark twist in revealing the situation of the ""accidents"" that have been going on in the seemingly peaceful small town he's sergeant in, and finally, Pegg brings out the level of crazy comedic timing that's been under the surface the whole time. This climax, of course, is one of the funniest things about the film, but it's all been preempted by Wright and Pegg setting up the film with clichés and archetypes, turns that are pretty obvious each step of the way, and even in the moments that start to get less funny as mores-so amusing, and all the more ironic in that it's set among characters that bring out this level of comic hysteria.<br/><br/>At first, some of the humor is in little vicious stabs that strike out because of how blatant they are on the part of the filmmakers: the swan, the unintelligible small-town English folk (some with many, many, many firearms, which is sort of a spoiler by the way), a golden statue man, and a man in a costume of Death, as mere visual gags. Others, for me anyway, were almost in-jokes, like the laugh-out-loud bit with Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy (in the same frame no less). But it's not simply visual comedy, however that is a big factor in it all as Wright is almost TOO good at mimicking the hyper-kinetic Bay style of editing and jump-cuts. It's also that there's a great ensemble too, with Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Paul Freeman, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall, even Timothy Hutton joins in relishing the underlying poke in the ribs in practically every scene. <br/><br/>Yet through all of the parodies and splashes, pun intended, of appropriately graphic violence (it comes close to Grindhouse, which Wright provided the ""Don't"" trailer, in wisely imploring gore and massive shoot-outs for comedy sake), there's a sharp level of wit in the dialog, a clever repore in making us actually care about some of the characters (Pegg and Frost anyway, especially after a bout with Point Break), and keeps you laughing when the whole shebang ends. As Danny says at one point, in a manner of speaking, ""Man that's off the f**king chain!"""
"humm51","10","2","4","12 April 2007"," Shoot 'em Up and Laugh it Out - Expect the Best of Both
","Too many comedies these days make me groan instead of laugh, and I have started thinking perhaps it is only that I am older. I know after seeing this film that is not the case. We have all seen many recycled ideas just go on and on. These guys give us time-tested ideas with a fresh perspective. Shaun of the Dead marked a new standard for comedy and Hot Fuzz continues the trend. Pegg and Frost (and Edgar Wright) are fans of their genres and make a point of pointing it out without winking at us all the way through, and many fan-filmmakers ought to take heed. I feel appropriately nudged along, not shoved into a ""here we go again,"" because we do not go again. Sharp, witty dialogue and carefully placed plot devices sparkle, edged with spit-fire editing that assures the rapid pace we crave. There are also some very different twists that may not be too surprising, but the punches are definitely spot on whether you see them coming or not. It is not a satire per se, rather, there is plenty of satirical material sprinkled to accentuate the inherent absurdity of most action films. But there is some pleasure that can be derived from such absurdities, and the filmmakers give us this at face value. They love the ""craft"" of police bang 'em ups, and they honorably emulate them in a way I have never seen in the genre itself. In other words, I relate more with Police Sergeant Nicholas Angel and cannot ""turn it off,"" but as he learns to, so do I. I am taken along so fluidly without even caring that nothing needs to make too much sense because I know there are times when it's better if it doesn't. I am not a fan of routine action movies, but if I enjoyed this film as much as I did, I can only imagine what this film will do for true ""die-hards"" like the filmmakers themselves. Some may feel a bit off for laughing at some of the terrors, but it's all part of the fun. Get outside your element, or revel in it, whichever it happens to be for you. There's something in the seemingly quiet burg of Sanford for everyone."

","Walking into the theater for this premiere I knew I was in for a treat. It began with me having to sit through a screening of 'Electra Glide in Blue' which felt like forever to watch. But when the house lights went on, I felt that twang of 'geek' hit me like a rush of marshmallow fluff being poured all over my body. It was one of the loudest movies I've ever seen. 'Hot Fuzz' hits you right from the beginning and never stops punching your gonads until the credits. Lots of guns, tongue in cheek jokes, and action movie references were thrown in on top of some damn fine acting. I laughed out loud more times in this film than I have in a while, and that's saying quite a bit. If you didn't like 'Shaun of the Dead' (although who didn't?), you still might not be disappointed with their latest offering. It's on a different wavelength as 'Shaun', but still just as amazing."
"KiltedGreen","9","2","4","8 April 2007"," Superbly crafted dark action comedy
","Usually, when I see a 'comedy' film trailer at the cinema it's for some hideous, unfunny film. So when I saw the trailer for Hot Fuzz and laughed all the way through, and had the same reaction when I saw the trailer again I knew it had to be seen.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz didn't disappoint in any way - it's an adrenaline thumping ride, it has a wry and beautifully observed script, a dark, creepy and unsettling element to most of the village scenes (that feeling that 'something's going on here'), the superb quick-fire repartee between Sgt Angel and PC Butterman just left me with a constant grin. I adore films that combine fast paced humour with wit and cleverness and this one does it with style. Some of the lines are delivered in such a 'matter of fact' way and still manage to be hilarious - Angel correcting other members of the police station for using the phrase 'Police Force' because it creates a wrong image, they should be using 'Police Service' instead is not in itself funny, but with Simon Pegg's determined delivery and the hapless giggling of the other police staff it takes on a whole new angle.<br/><br/>There's a superb array of supporting characters in both the police station and the village itself that really create a wonderful stage for the proceedings - lost swans, village fêtes and of course, murder. Or is it an accident? Sublime.<br/><br/>I've never seen Shaun of the Dead, but after this I can see that I'll have to sort that out."

","Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, director/writers/actor respectively, struck gold with their previous film Shaun of the Dead, for what is a cult hit. Wright and Pegg, tapping the same source of Shaun, are far from bleeding their well dry. Spinning conventions of the zombie genre around with the rom-com, Wright and Pegg give action it's due in the small village of Sandford, where death is more prone from an over indulgence of tea and cake at the local NWA.<br/><br/>Sandford starts to become lively on the arrival of hot shot and all round saint of the law, Officer Nicholas Angel, transfered from London after being extremely to good at the job and making everyone pathetic in the shadows of his commendations. Teamed with lout Danny Butterman, Angel unable to shed his rock solid adherence to the law, loses mental stability in the sleepy village where the law is transparent. After a series of seemingly unfortunate accidents, Angel smells foul play, though convincing the locals their village has a murderer is harder than apprehending the killer.<br/><br/>The chemistry of Hot Fuzz lies upon Pegg and Frost. Perfectly complimenting each other, whether Pegg is stiff and robotic and Frost runs with the shenanigans, or both in action mode, there is a natural play off one another, never fighting for the punchline or spotlight. Writers Wright and Pegg, don't really reach the creative level of Shaun of the Dead, in retrospect the revelation of who's behind it all is rather esoteric, but that and plot holes are quickly filled with a 'who cares' mentality. The comedy is non stop, along with a constantly spiked energy level, with Wright showing of his flare as a talented director in one bombastic yet creative shoot out. Pegg and Wright have laced moments, heavily on Point Break and Bad Boys 2, with myriad of references to virtually every buddy cop film, cop show and other films and shows to spark the childhood memories.<br/><br/>Together Pegg and Frost make strong leading actors, though they are surrounded by countless solid supporting actors and cameos. Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan as the London officers is Angels transfer. Bill Bailey, Olivia Colman, Kevin Eldon, Karl Johnson as the woeful Sandford officers, a solid performance from Jim Broadbent as Inspector Frank Butterman. Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as ignorant detectives Wainwright and Cartwright. Stand out performance by Timothy Dalton, as the sly greasy shop owner Simon Skinner, and all the members of the NWA. <br/><br/>Whether a Shaun of the Dead fan or not, Hot Fuzz has all the goods for anyone wanting an intelligent comedy/action film."
"keynesrules","8","2","4","10 March 2007"," Watcha' gonna do when the Fuzz come for you?
","Hot Fuzz is undoubtedly the funniest R-rated action comedy, film set in a quaint English village so far. The real question is; could it possibly be the greatest buddy cop film of all time? The genre has become so by-the-numbers of late that it seems ripe for satire. Fortunately writers Simon Penn and Edgar Wright appear to love the source material they delightfully skewer, making references-a-plenty to their predecessors  Lethal Weapon, 48 Hours, Point Break and Bad Boys to name a few. However, unlike the painfully dull, teen catering spoof movies (Scary Movie franchise, Epic Movie, Date Movie), the humour is not handled clumsily and neither is the screenplay overloaded with easy jokes and obvious references. Hot Fuzz is that rare movie which manages to satirize while giving the genre a complete overhaul. At times the film reaches Python-like levels of comedic brilliance.<br/><br/>The setup is simple enough: Nick Angel is metropolitan London's top cop. His office is on the streets of the city and business never closes. As a matter of fact he's so good at his job that he singlehandedly outshines his entire department. This does not sit well with his superiors who quickly promote him and pack him off to the sleepy village of Sanford  winner for the last several years of the coveted ""Village of the Year"" crown. Once here the film begins on an entertaining fish out of water track as we witness Angel's toughest assignments which include a crackdown on underage drinking and capturing an escaped Duck (scene stealer of the year!) Naturally he is reprimanded by his superior officer, Inspector Frank Butterman, played ably by the wonderful Jim Broadbent, who always seems to be too good for the parts he plays. He is formulaic-ally teamed up with the less competent Danny Butterman, whose puppy like enthusiasm and man love for his new partner injects hilarity into the inevitable male bonding moments of the film. Look a little closer though and you'll see how good the satire is. We are never shown Nick Angel's love interest - a metaphor for the fact that the love interest in a buddy cop film is typically unmemorable? Except of course for Téa Leoni in ""Bad Boys"", but I digress...<br/><br/>All is not what it appears to be in Sanford, naturally. Someone is killing residents of the village and the murders appear to be connected. The rest of the local police service is content to call each case an ""accident"" and shut the books, but Nick Angel is not convinced. ""Sanford hasn't had a murder in over twenty years"" he is told, but what of the malicious remarks made by supermarket owner Simon Skinner? (Played by Timothy Dalton obviously having a great time.) Don't worry; I haven't spoiled anything for you. The movie makes the identity of the killer fairly clear from the outset, though you may be surprised by the motive. As with Shaun of the Dead and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, it's the menace used to underscore the humorous screenplay which works effectively by keeping the audience amused and unsettled in turns. A serial killer is at the very least disquieting and each time the viewers settled into the comedy groove of the movie, the writers orchestrated another gruesome ""accident"". The fate that befalls one plucky reporter is a particularly cringe worthy moment.<br/><br/>The film's biggest laughs come at the climax when the action ventures into the preposterous not simply because of the level of violence (which brings to mind the term 'disproportionate response') but also because of the setting. I loved the ""man with no name"" reference just prior to the final confrontation which had the audience screaming hysterically at my screening.<br/><br/>Having said all that, a few things did not work for me. The reveal scene in particular lasts a tad too long and while suspension of disbelief is a given with a story like this, the logistics behind the ""accidents"" are mind-boggling considering Angel keeps such a sharp eye on the town. The odd joke falters and Angel escapes a Mexican standoff too easily. These isolated moments do not detract from one of the most entertaining movie experiences of my life, and the film works really well as a date movie."

","When this film was released in th UK, it was inevitable that it would be compared to Shaun of The Dead, the team's previous film.

Some critics reviewed the film as being funny but slightly too long. I did not find it too long at all, and the ending was one of the funniest moments. I have to travel about 25 miles to get to the nearest cinema, and I was glad that the film wasn't the usual 90 minutes for a comedy film because I felt that it was worth the trouble to get t the cinema to see it.

","If you're going to see this film, then doubtless you'll have already seen Shaun of the Dead, and probably Spaced, the three having more similarities than differences. So you have a reasonable idea of what it's going to be like, and if it'll be your thing.<br/><br/>I think this film is a bit of a mess. Structurally, it's gapingly flawed. The opening third turns into more like the opening two thirds, hence the entire film has to take place in the last thirty minutes or so. It can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a cop action thriller, a horror movie, or a late night Sunday TV drama.<br/><br/>Basing a film around police in England is difficult, because everybody hates them, especially after the de Menezes shooting. These ones they try to make appealing by having them mostly goof off all day and eat ice-cream. This merely makes us hate them more.<br/><br/>Others have commented on the lack of laughs in the movie. It's completely true. They seem to have just forgotten to put the jokes in there. I can only assume they went for a 'funny in a difficult to describe way' feel, and ended up with a film as limp and dead as a mattress that's just been pulled from the bottom of the ocean. What we're seeing is more of an animated storyboard with full script to come.<br/><br/>Oh, and Timothy Dalton is very miscast as the lead villain. You end up feeling sorry for him. His every look and gesture seem to say ""Remember me? I played James Bond once. I was unnverving and disturbing. I was critically acclaimed for it. Now here I am running a rural supermarket. I'm worth more than this."" Overall, my argument here is with the director, Edgar Wright. Shaun of the Dead worked well, so it's surprising to see another film of his bungled so incompetently. Having a hit and being Brit cinema's next big hope always seems to be the kiss of death, condemning your next five projects to be overblown, Yank-pandering confusothons. Just ask Guy Ritchie."

Any one expecting to see a movie with clever sub plots and intricate jokes will probably be disappointed but if you want a two hour escape to action, bloodshed and a lot of laughs this really is a must see.<br/><br/>Timothy Dalton is fantastic as the loathsome retail magnate and the rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British comedy... anyone remotely funny at the moment is in this movie.<br/><br/>A must see!!"

","Hot Fuzz, is from the maker's of 'Shaun of The Dead' basically spoof's over the top Hollywood action film's such as Point Break, Bad Boy's 2, and even manages to reference Dirty Harry, It also manages to lampoon the Clint Eastwood Western's.<br/><br/>The film has a surprisingly large amount of gore and splatter too much in fact! this of course will satisfy all the gore-hounds out there.<br/><br/>The cast list is impressive it's a revelation to find two time James Bond Timothy Dalton, who is cast as a shady supermarket manager, 'The Wicker Man' Star Edward Woodward in a supporting role, <br/><br/>'Raider's of the lost ark' villain(Belloq) Paul freeman, plays the reverend, usual British acting legends Billie Whitelaw, and Jim Broadbent and Bill Nighy, also feature. The film is suitably lensed in 2:35:1 aspect ratio which lends to the modern day western look. all in all a hilarious comedy."

","This film is spectacularly amusing. If you don't think so it is highly possible that you are, in fact, dead. Sorry if that's bad news but really, if you didn't laugh at this genius piece of film-making you've not much to live for anyway. All involved deserve some sort of gold star. Churlish gripe: it starts a bit slow. It may well be character building and set up the gags that come later, but it does drag the film down a mark or two. But when it gets going the laughs come thicker than Nick Frost's dumb country policeman (sorry, police officer) and faster than Simon Pegg's supercop's draw. The ensemble cast are wonderful, with Timothy Dalton rightly being singled out, the surprise gore and violence is effective and shocking, the direction and acting are spot on, and, well, any film that has an homage to Point Break surely must be watched and then watched again. Ace!"

The film had some great actors in it, and I also was impressed with the cameos from Nighy among others.<br/><br/>The film made me laugh a lot, although perhaps there were not so many laugh out loud gags as other Brit comedies I've seen. And dare I say it.... I didn't think it was as good as Shaun of the Dead. I do however think it is well worth watching, and I have a sneaking suspicion that this film needs a second viewing to catch all the missed gags from the first time round (there were that many - you hadn't finished laughing at the last one to catch the next properly!) All in all, if you like Brit comedies, this is well worth a watch."
"AdrenalinDragon","9","2","4","16 February 2007"," Top comedy mixed with 'ridiculous' action + the Shaun Of The Dead crew = A British movie success!
","Yes, Hot Fuzz met my expectations. For all those people worrying that Hot Fuzz won't be as good as Shaun Of The Dead, let me tell you that you're wrong and Hot Fuzz reaches to the top (no surprises!). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost star in another fantastic movie which I knew from the start wouldn't suck since so many know these two get along so well in movies. Action and Comedy fans will love it! <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz starts off with a top London cop named Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) who's so good at his job that it makes his police force seem bad in comparison. So he gets sent off to this calm and crime-free town and meets up with another policeman named Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). While both are there some strange and unusual accidents happen in the town, and Nicholas gets into suspicion and tries to solve the mystery. Will he work it out? And how will things turn out for the town? <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz will offer you non-stop comedy the whole way through and a smart top script from the writers Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (Who wrote the superb comedy 'Spaced' and 'Shaun Of The Dead'). Shaun Of The Dead comedy exists in the film, and Simon and Nick play their parts in the movie exceptionally well as usual. Not to spoil too much but you'll love the action scenes, sometimes you'll wonder whether to laugh or be impressed with it because I had problems deciding as well!<br/><br/>So overall, Hot Fuzz lived up to the hype, and tops Shaun Of The Dead easily! For those comedy and 'Spaced' fans you must check this out straight away! At the moment it only seems to be out in the UK but trust me, everyone else especially the Americans will also love the British humour. Expect to see a lot of fun action as well, and a great day at the theatres. Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, Nick Frost. You've done it again! Can't wait to see more movies from you lot!"
"dave_robert_barratt","8","2","4","14 February 2007"," Funny, but not as good as Shaun of the Dead...
","Saw this movie on preview night with thoughts of Shaun of the Dead in my mind - one of my favourite comedy movies of all time.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz starts off slowly with a few laughs in the opening third, but when it finally gets going there are a number of very funny moments.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are perfectly cast, bouncing off each other brilliantly.<br/><br/>There are a couple of references and in-jokes to Shaun of the Dead that also work well. The fence jumping sequence is hilarious.<br/><br/>The final third is a shoot 'em up extravaganza, with lots of guns, car chases and explosions.<br/><br/>Overall, it is pretty good stuff, but the other reviews on IMDb seem a bit OTT. For me, Shaun of the Dead had far more laugh out loud moments, and is a movie I could watch again and again (I bought it on the day of release on DVD). Hot Fuzz was certainly worth watching, but I won't be rushing out to get the DVD in a few months time..."
"bauulben","10","2","4","14 February 2007"," Bring the Noise! Comedy at its absolute best.
","I've just seen Hot Fuzz at a midnight showing, and can safely say it is a truly excellent movie, and one that works on so many levels. The humour is very much in the vain of the excellent Shaun of the Dead, but arguably, this is the better movie. Without giving too much away, the first half of the movie is part comedy, part genuinely touching drama. Simon Pegg especially shines in his role as the super cop Nick Angel struggling with finding meaning to his life, he really excels in bringing out the inner struggles of the character. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a straight up silly comedy, there are some genuinely moving parts that really sucks you into the movie. The development of the relationship between Pegg and Nick Frost's bumbling bobby character is one of the most realistic and touching I've possibly ever seen in a cop movie, it's truly genuine. In fact, all the characters are played completely realistically, totally dead pan by the superb cast, including a very worth while turn by the venerable Timothy Dalton who brings some genuine menace to the screen.<br/><br/>This is all wrapped in a brilliantly timed slice of comedy genius, the script is razor sharp and the laughs come quick and fast. Hilarious little throw away shots and cameos from every major British comedian on TV at the moment keep the viewer paying close attention. This isn't over blown slapstick comedy, but for the most part very wry and intelligent dialogue based humour. However, when the big visual gags do come along, they work all the better for being so different to the comedy in the rest of the movie. The real genius of the comedy here is none of it is obvious, there are no jokes in the movie or trivial juvenile humour, this is social aware, very clever and for the most part clear, yet at the same time subtle humour.<br/><br/>Possibly surprisingly, the plot is actually very good, and keeps you guessing along with the characters as the story unfolds. There are twists that you don't see coming, and you really can't predict how the movie unfolds. The climax of the movie is its true crowning moment, working on the very powerful imagery built in the first two thirds of the movie it works unbelievably well, I had a massive grin just plastered to my face, my face actually hurt after the movie. Whilst the end of the movie could be described as rather silly, the very serious first part lends it enough credibility to make it truly work. Again though, this is played totally dead pan by the excellent cast, and the scenes are intense enough that one finds the absurdity of the settings absolutely hilarious instead of just simply absurd.<br/><br/>It's hard to portray just how well this movie works, it's tied together by a fantastic cast, razor sharp script, perfect timing and settings, excellent plot, amazing action scenes and a small number of utterly over the top gore for many hilarious ""EWWW!!"" moments from across the audience. Oh, and the best swan in the history of cinema. Even if you're not a fan of old cop movies, this is still a truly excellent movie, but if you are a fan of said movies such as Bad Boys or Point Blanc, you'll be in heaven here. Remember, like Shaun of the Dead, this isn't a spoof, the comedy isn't about mocking these movies, it is genuine in its admiration for them, just transposes the ideas to a comic situation.<br/><br/>Please go and see this movie, it is really that good. All I can say is ""Bring the Noise!!!"""
"bursilak","10","2","4","12 February 2007"," Exceptionally crafted film
","Wright & Pegg's story of officers Nicholas Angel and Danny Butterman is a well researched look into the cop/buddy genre, the workings of the UK police, and a slice of deep fried comedy gold all rolled into one. Their new film is easily on par with Shaun of the Dead - I felt it was slightly better, in fact. An immaculate supporting cast, coupled with intense & honest performances by Pegg & Frost, tied up in an innovative and bordering-on-silly but remaining committed plot line, combine to the result of the best film I've seen in a long time. Pegg's performance as hard-edged high-achieving PC Angel and Frost's enthusiastic PC Butterman are a sufficient contrast to their previous screen outing to feel that they're not just recreating the same archetypes in a different setting, and the script - encompassing action film, Agatha Christie style English countryside murder drama, and man-love buddy story - is slick & original, dealing nods to the genres it references but at the same time never seeming derivative or too tongue-in-cheek parody or referential. Having not read much about this film before seeing it, one of the highlights for me was that having no comprehensive opening credit sequence, the appearance of each supporting cast member in the story gave me a warm little smiley feeling. I viewed this film as a masterclass in storytelling, and am extremely glad that there are filmmakers out there with such a careful eye on the craft of comedy."
"dgwfriend","7","2","4","7 February 2007"," Not a lot of fuzz about nothing...
","Take London's top cop, whose arrest rate is embarrassing his bosses, and send him to a soporific, apparently crime free, Gloucestershire village where he can embarrass no more. Okay, it's maybe not the most inspiring, or indeed plausible basis for a film but it should be remembered whose hands Hot Fuzz is in. Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright and Nick Frost are fast becoming something akin to the Holy trinity of contemporary British comedy. With two series of the Channel Four sitcom Spaced and the rib-splinteringly funny Shaun of the Dead under their collective belt they appear to have their chosen vocation pretty much nailed. <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is to the police movie what Shaun of the Dead was to horror - an unrelenting parody, littered with references to the best and worst of crime-fighting on screen. It brings together the cream of Britain's current comedy pantheon. There are outings for Oscar-winning Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, Bill Bailey and the actor Kevin Eldon. There are also welcome appearances from Edward Woodward and the joyfully over-acting former 007, Timothy Dalton. For his part, Pegg plays the exiled London bobby Sergeant Nicholas Angel, ordered to what seems to be the sleepiest of sleepy backwaters. There he's partnered with Nick Frost's asinine PC Danny Butterman. As he battles for acceptance from his newly acquired (and somewhat less than welcoming) peers, including the brutishly brilliant Paddy Considine, we learn that all is not as it seems in this provincial idyll. A series of gruesome ""accidents"" point to something altogether quite, quite sinister. All of Nick Angel's skills are surely going to be put to the test. Oh the irony...<br/><br/>What develops is one of the most farcical, preposterous films around. But for all its utter ridiculousness, it's very, very entertaining and very, very amusing. Rapid-fire, superbly written humour and some very rapid editing ensure there's little opportunity to let the mind dwell on any potential flaws. It's perhaps not as consistently funny, and so maybe not quite as consistently good as Shaun of the Dead but it remains incredibly enjoyable. There are moments which will surely be laughed at over and over again. And that's perhaps what Hot Fuzz calls for most - to be watched more than once. It's well worth it."

","The action genre has been getting more and more bland as the years go by with movies tending to seem like they're just the same movie with different actors but every once in while a few movies breaking the mold and become something greater, one of those films it is the 2007 movie Hot Fuzz. Hot Fuzz is a parody action comedy that perfectly mocks and emulates genres. Hot Fuzz stars Simon Pegg, most well known for his role in Star Wars: The Force Awakens as Unkar Plutt, and Nick Frost, whom is most well known for starring in the other movies in the Cornetto Trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World's End.) and is directed by Edgar Wright, who has directed of all the movies in the Cornetto Trilogy along with my own personal favorite movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World so you know the direction, shot, and composition are going to be great. The films main character Nicholas Angel, played by Simon Pegg, is the best cop in all of London so good that he makes all of the other police officers in the station look bad so to avoid this the higher ups decide to send him to Sandford for a cushy desk job out in the country far from the city of London. The main supporting actor Nick Frost's character Danny Butterman is a Lethal Weapon, action movie loving junior cop whom when he first meets Sergeant Angel idolizes him for seeming to be a character ripped straight from one of his favorite movies. One of the biggest themes in this movie is old vs. new, for example Sergeant Angel in the beginning of the film is very stuck to his ways when it comes to police duty always doing things by the book one of the biggest things is the third in Sanford where he first checks the ids of everyone in the bar, almost everyone is underage, and as he takes a drunk man who attempted to drive home arrests several people along the way, this shows his by the books nature that made him the cop he is. One of my favorite things in Hot Fuzz is it's blatant use of foreshadowing and visual gags, for example the movie foreshadows be later soon in the movie when they make an announcement at the beginning of the festival outside the church, another thing that I enjoyed with the film was its use of visual gags when it came to paperwork making paperwork seem all intense when it is really just bland and mundane. The are two things make Hot Fuzz the great movie that it is, it's British style comedy and how it was shot. Now with a parity comedy is an obvious thing but these jokes that are told or not just simple improvised quits or you get from a Adam Sandler movie, take pixels for example where he comes into a room with a bunch of government officials and starts making fun of them for no reason at all where is in this movie jokes are used to build tension to carry plan or just change the mood. As for how it was shot most details in the frame seems to be important in one way or another and in the B roll which tends to be boring shots of the location maybe a plane lifting off or a car driving off isn't the most exciting thing to watch yet in the movie they have purpose to it, take for example when in the when Sergeant Angel is going from London to Sandford, it goes from him leaving his apartment with his peace Lily to a taxi to him on a train train stop getting woken up by a train passing by back on the train driving past the Sandford welcome sign and into the city. Now while this sequence is not the most exciting thing what it does is show us the audience the distance he's traveling, this is not a some place that's close by where he could hop on a train and then just go back to the city, no Sandford is very far away. As for its parody aspect and how it handles that it starts off with Sergeant Angel rejecting the clichés in action movies to then at the end becoming the cliché action movie character that he rejected in the beginning. To conclude I believe that Hot Fuzz is one of the best action films to date with clever writing and great acting that parodies and exemplifies what can make these action movies great."
"anselmdaniel","9","0","0","23 December 2018"," A rousing and pleasing buddy cop movie
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a buddy cop action movie directed by Edgar Wright and written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. The movie stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in the leading roles. A police constable named Nicholas Angel, played by Simon Pegg, is an overachieving officer in London. He is promoted to a remote village where the crime-rate is virtually non-existent. Throughout the movie, Nicholas Angel uncovers evidence of foul-play in Sandford, the remote village.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is another cult classic movie from Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost. This movie owes many homages from older buddy. cop movies. The entire movie is made by people that enjoy these movies as well as wanting to create something new in that genre. This movie is made by the admirers of the buddy cop genre and it really shows.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright Knocks it out of the park with the direction and editing. The movie is similar to Shaun of the Dead with its quick cuts and overall direction. This is good as the direction also plays to the movie's strengths of the mysterious Sandford and the hilarious neighborhood. This is a fairly lengthy movie compared to Shann of the Dead at 121 minutes of running time. There are absolutely more story events, and characters. This works in the film's favor as many of the movie's entertaining moments are aided by the length. The movie's introduction of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance leads to many funny moments later in the movie.<br/><br/>Much like Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play partners in the police force of Sandford. These two actors have good chemistry and it is different from Shaun of the Dead. Nick Frost plays Police Constable Daniel ""Danny"" Butterman. Danny Butterman is a buffoon and not suited to police work. He has an infatuation with buddy cop movies and it shows throughout the movie. These two characters handle much of the boredom in the countryside of Sandford. The interaction between these two characters are so fun to watch that I am glad the movie was as long as it was.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast does a great job as well. The highlight is Timothy Dalton playing Simon Skinner. Simon Skinner is so fun to watch as the grocery store owner constantly harassing Nicholas Angel in his investigations. This character is introduced and is handled so well throughout the entire running time that I enjoyed every moment that he was on the screen. Simon Skinner's slimyness is reflected incredibly well by Timothy Dalton.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is at a great level. There is a mystery in Sandford and the revelation is well worth it. The mystery's revelation had me in stitches as Nicholas Angel, came up with much better reasons for the murders than the culprits did. That entire scene is worth the build-up for the entire movie. If there are any weaknesses in the movie it would be the slow build-up.<br/><br/>The movie does not feature many action scenes. This is narratively appropriate but the trailers make the movie more action-packed than it really is. On multiple watches, this movie's lack of action does not bother me as much as it did at first. There is still a lengthy action scene at the very end where every trope from buddy cop action movies is used.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Hot Fuzz. Not only is this movie a great homage, but it is also a great movie.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

They seriously have the best chemistry I've ever seen and are hilarious to watch. This movie is very over the top in a fun and clever way. The deaths are all over the top and ridiculous, but they're meant to be.

The fact that such a over the top story takes place in a rural town in Gloucestershire makes it all the more satisfying.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays the character of Nicholas Angel extremely well with how he is such a focused hard-line professional that always sticks to the rules, which is juxtaposed by Nick Frost's Danny Butterman who is more laidback. Their dynamic of the straight guy playing off the funny man works very well and provides for much of the humour. <br/><br/>Speaking of humour, it is quite simply fantastic and had me laughing throughout.

","Point Break or Bad Boys 2? That is the question, at least it is in Edgar Wright's 2007 action comedy Hot Fuzz. Edgar Wright is without a doubt one of the most creative filmmakers working in the business today. Every single one of his films has a special feel to them from the directing, to the writing, even to the most minute, unnoticed details in the background. His movies are fantastic, without them I would have never been inspired to pursue the film business as a career myself. While I love all of his movies, My favorite of his (and one of my favorite movies of all time) has to be this film.
 As stated before, Hot Fuzz was released in 2007 and stars Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, and Timothy Dalton and is part 2 of Edgar Wright's three part series: The Cornetto Trilogy, A series movies with differing styles and genres but are all connected by having the same actors and Cornetto Ice Cream at some point in the movie. I consider this movie to not only be the best in the Trilogy but also one of Edgar Wright's best movies in general as this is one of the smartest action comedies I've ever seen. Hot Fuzz follows Sgt. Nicolas Angel (Played by Simon Pegg), A serious no-nonsense police officer for the London Metropolitan Police Force. He is so good at his job that he makes every other police officer on the force look bad, so the chief inspector has him transferred to the small rural village of Sandford, where the crime rate is extremely low but the accident rate is incredibly high. There he meets his new coworkers, a bunch of lazy, moronic and dorky Officers who have never seen action ever. More specifically he begins to bond with Danny Butterman (Played by Nick Frost), a young officer who loves action movies. The Two solve small crimes around the village, however when two actors are in an ""accident"" Nicolas Angel begins to investigate, however this accident may be more than what it seems. Going into more details would spoil integral plot points and the more blind you go into this movie, the better.
 The story is told in a way where you can guess what the characters are about to do, but your not entirely sure how the events will actually play out. And there are plot points that are so well done that every time you think that you've figured out what its planning to do, it throws a curve ball that seems odd at first but is cleverly connected to everything else. Credit also needs to be given to the stellar performances from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Both of them have great chemistry as partners( This is also due to them being such good friends in real life). All of the other actors portray their characters very well too, especially the police chief played by Jim Broadbent and the shady supermarket owner, Simon Skinner (Played by Timothy Dalton)
 The shots are composed in a way where every scene is unique and memorable, the dialogue is incredibly well written with many quotable lines and jokes, even the simple visual gags in the scenes are laugh out loud hilarious. While this film is at heart a comedy and satire of American blockbuster action films, the tone in the movie can become surprisingly dark, especially near the end. The highlight of the movie though is the last 30 or so minutes when everything goes absolutely insane. One thing i must say though is that this is NOT a family friendly movie, swearing is very frequent and the gore is heavy, however it adds to the overall charm of the film.
 I can't stress enough how much I enjoy this movie, It's one of the few movies that I consider to be flawless and great. It can be enjoyed as a dumb action movie and as a smart satire of said genre. As I stated before this is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time, As time goes on the film has grown a bit in popularity but it is not as recognized as it should be, This is one comedy that should not be missed. <br/><br/>4/4 Stars, I highly recommend it."

","When I watched Scott Pilgrim vs. the World I had no idea who director was nor was I interested at all. After Baby Driver name Edgar Wright began to get the significance. Then I saw Shaun of the Dead and decided to watch everything that this man made. Hot Fuzz, the second film of this ""trilogy"", takes over Shaun of the Dead's cast and style and takes them one step further. Movie begins a little confusing and it seems that it will not be able to maintain the level of its predecessor, but then in the second half it turns into a black comedy thriller that overcomes it in every way. Original and completely unexpected turns with continuous bombardment with quality humor will glue you to the screen. Perhaps it is not one of the best movies of all time, but it certainly is one of the most entertaining.<br/><br/>8,5/10"

The editing is genius, like any other Edgar Wright movie. Although I won't say this movie isn't as character-oriented as Shaun of the Dead, which managed to have excellent characters and keep you invested in the story, however, I won't fault this movie due to the fact that this movie is mostly about the overarching mystery. Hot Fuzz is a very clever movie that I will continue to re-watch looking for new nuances and, overall, entertainment."

","Hot Fuzz is a pretty good movie with a pretty interesting plot. I somehow don't seem to get tired of the use of fast transitions that just catch me by surprise. I also laughed a lot in this movie and found it much funnier than Shaun of the Dead probably because they had a bigger budget and could invest in better settings and CGI. I guess that a daily police life scenario had bigger opportunities to make jokes than a zombie apocalypse scenario. I do give it a 9 instead of a 10 because it is ""almost"" perfect with the exception of certain parts I found maybe a bit weird or confusing. One part was when Sergeant Angle told a bunch of schoolkids to enter a shop to distract this old shopkeeper when he could have just shot her from where he was. Another weird part was when Angle and Danny tried shooting the conspiracy members during a shootout scene, and both of them were missing a lot of their shots. It is understandable for Danny because he has only shot a gun once which was when he shot this fair game owner's leg by accident. However, Angle missed a lot of shots with a ""shotgun"" when he fired a rifle at 6 small targets with perfect accuracy. Overall, it is a pretty good movie with a lot of jokes and creative uses of storytelling. P.S., I do not know anything about guns or how they work, I have never done a review for a movie until now, and I don't even know why I am doing this long ass review(which is unconvincing and full of grammatical errors) for this movie."
"EthanBJones_03","9","0","0","31 May 2017"," Good movie but too much paperwork
","'HOT FUZZ' was directed by Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Jim Broadbent. ​A British constable (Simon Pegg) feels certain foul play is afoot when a series of grisly accidents rocks his quiet village.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a god damn hilarious parody. If you hate parodies, you'll despise this movie. It beats off every cliché like the holy ghost. It couldn't be any less serious if Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were dressed as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck while riding a rainbow pony on Mars while simultaneously being chased by both the cast(not characters) of Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Coronation Street. It's a completely bonkers movie that owes all of its praise to Edgar Wright's stellar direction, the incredible writing(courtesy of Wright and Pegg) and a series of brilliant performances that elevate this movie into greatness. Please, I made the mistake of putting off watching this movie until now and I regret my decision. I watched it on Netflix and then bought it on blu ray mere hours later. It's a great comedy and I wholeheartedly recommend it.<br/><br/>Need more convincing? Fine. This movie could have provided some completely pointless story just to usher along a series of unfortunate events for the main cast. It does not. While it is a tad bit predictable at points, the writers provided a solid mystery story that supports the humour and cast. The ending is perfect and may be one of the best parody movie moments in movie HISTORY. That awesome action sequence is pure genius and I cannot flaw it. <br/><br/>Need more. Jeez, you're difficult to convince. Simon Pegg is excellent as Nicholas Angel(who is also the name of one of the cast by the way!) and his personality is a perfect contrast against his partner(Danny Butterman(played excellently by Nick Frost))'s joking and comical persona. Jim Broadbent was great as Inspector Butterman as was Timothy Dalton as Simon Skinner. The villains were incredibly fun and predictable and they genuinely keep you guessing who it is, even though you probably guessed it before the half way mark. Each and every character is memorable, if not by personality not by name. That is pretty damn impressive considering how many there actually are in the movie.<br/><br/>*sigh* I've started now so I'll finish, even though my persuasive skills have undoubtedly convinced you already. Wright directed this movie flawlessly and I adore how he uses the cinematography to provide humour. The costume design is literally flawless. I dare you to poke a flaw in Wright's costume design because you just cannot.<br/><br/>This movie is first and foremost, a comedy. And it perfected that art. I've not laughed as much in a very long time. The mystery is genuinely intriguing and the action is also awesome. If you don't like this movie, I don't like you. It is a hilarious movie and probably one of the funniest I've seen in a long, long, long time. Please, do yourself a favour and watch this movie. I'll rate it a near perfect 9 out of 10 swans."

","""Hot Fuzz"" is a co-production between France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America that resulted in this 120-minute movie in the English language. It was released back in 2007, so it has its 10th anniversary this year. The director is Edgar Wright and I am sure you have already seen something by him. He wrote the script together with lead actor Simon Pegg, who plays Nicholas Angel. So yes despite the several production countries, this is certainly a very British movie. You may have come across Wright and Pegg already in ""Shaun of the Dead"" or, more recently, ""The World's End"". But we shall talk about these on another occasion. Now it is all about this 2-hour film we have here. The cast includes several pretty familiar faces like Oscar winner Jim Broadbent or Bond actor Timothy Dalton (looking a bit like Daniel Day-Lewis) as well as Golden Globe winner Bill Nighy. Dalton actually makes for a pretty good villain I must say, a nice positive surprise in here. Pegg is solid and gives the film some dramatic tension while everybody else feels as if they are in it 100% for the comedic approach, so it elevates the level quite a bit and despite initial uncertainty I approve of Pegg here. Nonetheless, it is all about the comedy really. The crime and mystery aspects are there, but they never really work as well as the humor. This is not a problem at all as they never wanted to make these work as well I am sure, in the sense that I don't think they were ever going for the gritty serious crime drama route here.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is probably when Broadbent's character keeps talking about how police officers who make mistakes like speeding or driving under the influence have to make up for it by handing free ice cream to the entire force and that's pretty hilarious. Much funnier than it sounds here. That much is safe. Anyway, Freeman (Martin, not Morgan) who I am usually not too big on and Coogan had a solid little cameo early in the film and it was also one of the better scenes. As a whole, I would say that I very much recommend the first 80 minutes or so until we see all the townsfolk at that ceremony that looks like a black mass or something. Sadly, this is when the film loses a lot of quality afterward. It loses itself in pointless fights, special effects and action sequences while sacrificing the nice tension and approach from the entire almost 1.5 hours before that. I have no idea why they decided to make such a huge break there in terms of tone and atmosphere, but I absolutely do not approve. And this was really a negative deal-breaker for the film. It would so much have deserved a better ending / final chapter. Luckily, everything before that was still good and convincing and entertaining enough that I can give it a thumbs-up, even if it is not as enthusiastically as I had hoped. Watch it though, especially if you like some of the other Wright/Pegg collaborations from before/after 2007. I also have a feeling that we will get a sequel at some point, but we'll see. British movies tend to take their time with follow-up films if we take a look at T2 this year for example. But ""Hot Fuzz"" is just too popular a film I guess that they never return to the story. Enough now. See it."

Good follow on from Shaun of the Dead (another pretty funny film but that's for another thread)"
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","0","5 March 2017"," Pretty good even if it wasn't as funny as I'd hoped.
","This is the only of the Cornetto trilogy that I've seen, and I would hope that the other two are better than Hot Fuzz. For a comedy, it was disappointingly not funny. It was sort of entertaining throughout, but failed to make me laugh out loud consistently. As an overall movie, it was pretty good, though. The police montages and echoes added a nice touch, and the way it called out action movies was fun.<br/><br/>Normally, I find that story structure has a negative effect on comedies, because it forces a ridiculous climax that feels like it has to top all the other jokes so far. This was one of the few cases in which I felt like the climax of a comedy was actually satisfying. However, it comes at the expense of a very slow beginning. It always felt like it was moving fast because of how Angel's cop mind is always on overdrive trying to identify conspiracies, but it takes a long time for anything significant to happen in terms of the overall story. Then the entire third act pretty much turned into one extended action scene, which had some cool and fun moments but got a bit tedious. Still, for all of the pacing issues I had with it, I was pleased that it actually had a story that made sense and didn't have any plot holes.<br/><br/>The characters play a pretty big role, particularly the minor characters. Seemingly everyone in the village has some kind of pertinence, and each one gets a pretty good amount of attention considering how many there are. Our two main roles make a nice buddy cop duo. Nearly every word out of Danny's mouth made me smile with his adoration of Angel and his obsession with cool action movies. Angel's belief in the role of paperwork in nailing crooks was great for his character; partly because American cop movie characters never seem to bother with paperwork of any kind, and partly because it gave us a reason to root for Angel. The only characters I had problems with were the rest of the Sanford police force. They tended to be hard to keep track of and weren't that memorable.<br/><br/>Though it does parody adrenaline-pumping action movies, it wasn't all that satirical. The satire is light, just seen in the overall style of the movie rather than directly making fun of other movies like Mel Brooks does. It really makes fun of small-town life just as much as it does action movies. Hopefully, this portrayal didn't offend anyone, but the ending with Angel finding the happy medium might make up for it.<br/><br/>I would recommend this more as an action movie than a comedy. I hadn't expected it to be as gory and explosive as it was. Most of the action is mindless, but there's a couple of pretty gruesome parts. If you go into it with the right attitude and know that it will not be laugh-out-loud funny, you may find that you enjoy it more than if you expect it to be totally slapstick like the trailer. Most of the humor is more subtle. It probably won't make you grow a six-pack from laughing, but if your in a bad mood, it might succeed in picking you up a bit. Overall Rating: 7.8/10."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","0","0","17 February 2017"," An Efficient Parody of Police Blockbusters, Lighter Than Shaun of the Dead
","Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright get together to continue the work they started with 2004's Shaun of the Dead, this time dropping a parody of cheesy police action flicks. Like its predecessor, it works on a satirical level, but also as a standalone - albeit one with far less heart than we saw in Shaun. Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a straight-laced London constable who's so fanatical about his job, the top brass worry they'll look bad by comparison and ship him off to the minor leagues. There he partners with Frost, a slobbish underachiever, and swiftly uncovers a vast criminal conspiracy. Fuzz relies heavily on one-liners and sight gags, which are generally pretty effective, but lacks a real emotional hook. That makes for an entertaining two hours, if not for endless re-screenings. The best work comes from the supporting cast, with Timothy Dalton leading the pack as the town's squinting, scheming, mustachioed mastermind grocer. And, of course, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall are downright show-stealing as the two Andys, resident detectives more concerned with needling newbies than cracking cases. I could've done with a lot more of those guys. A good film, with some big laughs, but no more than that. It's tough to avoid constant comparisons to the team's preceding effort, which isn't a fair match."
"sosmetallin","8","0","0","12 November 2016"," Not the typical comedy you would expect
","Hot Fuzz is about the most capable, disciplined and dedicated police officer you've ever seen, Nickolas Angel. When he is transferred from London where he works to a small village he will realize things there are far more interesting than he was expecting at the beginning. Straight to the point: I totally recommend this movie. Skip the mainstream comedy you were planning to watch and give this little diamond a go. Are you bored of the typical full of sexual humor comedies we usually get? This movie is for you. Are you not? Its OK you will still love it. Do you think that humor in cinema is more than just watching someone saying something funny or getting into an embarrassing situation? Then, like I said this movie is for you. I did have some minor issues, though, so let me explain everything.<br/><br/>The movie makes it clear to you that it's a comedy from the first seconds. It's not only about the jokes which are not too clever (but most times work), it's also about the plot and the tone of the film. It's some kind of crime-action-comedy-hybrid and I have to say the director combined them well. Every time you think it's becoming kind of serious, something funny will remind you what you are actually watching. And now, let's move on my favorite aspect of Hot Fuzz, the visual comedy.This is the art of telling a joke through images. Not many directors know hot to use it, so it feels like a breath of fresh air. The key factor for this kind of comedy is the editing. Either it is the funny part of the scene or it propels a joke, it always makes Hot Fuzz fun to watch and it is a major reason why you will never get bored. But the editing is just a As far as the characters are concerned, Nick Angel and Danny (Nick Frost) are fleshed out well and they make a nice team I enjoy to see together. Apart from them, every other character has his/her own funny quirks that make them enjoyable as well. Those minor issues I was talking about earlier have to do with one or two exposition-heavy scenes(not too heavy) where we are explained what's really going on in this village(the only parts that I felt for a moment that all this built- up tension is lost) and something about the action scenes. Most of them are fun to watch, but sometimes the camera gets a little too shaky and you may not understand exactly what's happening. Moreover, there are a couple of times it gets too violent(gory actually) and I suppose they could be considered unnecessary by some people. If these things don't bother you, then you will definitely have a good time. So...nothing else to be said here. Have fun!"

Edgar Wright did a phenomenal job directing, as he usually does. <br/><br/>I can't say much about the movie, because you would have to see for yourself on how fantastic it is, and I fear that saying anything else would spoil even the tiniest detail, but I can say that if you watch the movie, you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>One more thing, If you fear that the action overtakes ree comedy, or vise versa, I can say one thing, don't worry, it doesn't.

SMALL TOWN. MODERATE VIOLENCE. This is about to go off. I mean I'm sitting throughout this film laughing and I'm like why is that then I remember it's a freaking part of the cornetto trilogy. With a unique spin on the sub-genre of buddy cop films(which I haven't watched a lot of). It's so much fun you'll need some ice cream. The film revolves around Nicholas Angel(Simon Pegg) who is a big city cop who can't be stopped-but he's making everyone else on the force look bad. When he is reassigned to a small quite town called Sanford,he struggles with his new seemingly idyllic world and his bumbling partner(Nick Frost). Their dull existence is interrupted by several grisly and suspicious accidents,and the crime-fighting duo turn up the heat and hand out high-octane,car-crashing,gun- fighting,big city justice. I gotta admit it felt kind of slow but when the murders started and the jokes,fences and ice cream kept coming I kept laughing and putting a smile on my face. This would actually make sense,what the murders do in this film,that could happen it brings a situation you would probably see this happen in a small town or village where everyone knew each other. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost come packing with the same hilarious chemistry they had in Shaun of the dead,when there together on screen your going to die of laughter. This satire of American action movie is one of the greatest films conceived by man,even if it's only issue I feel is that it does move pretty slow. It's fast with it's action and clever so I'm giving Hot Fuzz a four and a half out of five."

","Last night I said how the only thing I knew about Shaun of the Dead was it has zombies in it? Well, the only thing I knew about Hot Fuzz was how it has cops in it. And I think that's less defining than zombies. For some reason I also thought Hot Fuzz would be the most boring out of the ""Cornetto trilogy"", but I was proved wrong. I enjoyed Hot Fuzz at least at much as I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>I assumed Pegg and Frost playing pretty much the same characters in every movie, but they were surprisingly different. It was hard to imagine Simon Pegg as a plausible bad ass cop, but he rocked that part. Nick Frost's character had some similar qualities to his character in Shaun of the Dead, but he was able to make too slightly similar characters appear distinct on the screen. <br/><br/>The cinematography in Edgar Wright's movies is amazing to watch. It's pretty typical in general, but there are a lot of those really short face paced shots of certain details. They may be annoying to the eye, but they are extremely effective, even when used so excessively.<br/><br/>Compared to Shaun of the Dead the plot of Hot Fuzz is surprisingly clever. It deceives the viewer, so they focus on the certain character, who seems obviously guilty, and the viewer can't even think of the true nature of the crimes. The whole movie in general is slightly absurd, slightly extravagant, but it works! And the true murderer's identity... It's even more absurd, which is why it goes so well with the story in general! It makes the viewer go ""What the hell did just happen?"" What the hell was just revealed? It's absolutely, astonishingly clever writing.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is an amazing action comedy, one of the best there is, considering how unique the location for this kind of movie seems.

","Hot Fuzz is humorous, dark, twisted and distinctly British. It's filled with action, references to other action flicks and the cynical Brit sense of humor the story is delivered with makes it universally lovable, that is if you appreciate that kind of thing. <br/><br/>Frost and Pegg seem to have their fingers on the pulse of the international audience without pandering to the most common denominators. While the characters portrayed by the cast are hardly groundbreaking in originality, *SPOILERS START HERE* lets be brutally honest about it for a second, the secretly satanic seemingly hospitable townsfolk conspiring to do a ton of evil sort of commands that *SPOILERS END HERE*, they more than make up for it with the little quirks, traits and innuendos that help mark Hot Fuzz as a British comedy flick. That and the lack of the obligatory romantic interest who was supposed to be captured and rescued so another checkbox could be ticked not to neglect some age demographic. <br/><br/>All in all a good watch if you're in the mood for a comedy and Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller doing their shtick in some random setting without an interesting or properly developed plot or side characters won't cut it for you this time around. <br/><br/>Sorry, had to get that out of my chest."

","The comedic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are changing the way people view British comedy. For decades, the Brits have been far behind us, featuring the dry, the peculiar, the tedious, and worst of all, Monty Python. Ten years ago, I wouldn't see a British comedy if you paid me, but now, all I need is to see this duo involved and I'm there! Hot Fuzz was the duos follow up to the wildly successful Shaun of The Dead, and while it doesn't compare to that film, it is still a really funny movie. The film features Simon Pegg as London's toughest cop, who is unwillingly transferred to a small town in the country. Paired with an idiot, he's about to die of boredom, and starts looking into the towns history of mysterious accidents, only to discover a pattern. Once Pegg has the scent, he's on the trail of a long running town secret, one that is ridiculous yet hilarious. Unlike Shaun of The Dead, the story here isn't as cut and dry. It requires some background and does take quite a while to get going. Unlike any of their other films, previously or since, the duo decided to pack all the fun into the last half hour of the film. Hot Fuzz certainly has it's moments, but it's the last half hour that makes it a classic. Simon Pegg plays the serious one for a change, leaving much of the laughs up to Nick Frost who certainly doesn't disappoint. Personally, I prefer Pegg over Frost and would have liked to see his character loosen up a little bit, but it doesn't really take anything away from the story. The first half hour of this film, you're going to think I'm crazy, but by the last half hour, you'll be thanking me for recommending you see this film. It is a must for fans of buddy comedies and it just might force you to watch Shaun of The Dead again."
"sol-","Null","0","0","29 December 2015"," Shaun of the Cops
","Posted to an idyllic small town whose denizens believe that their low crime rate is due to being lax when enforcing the law, a workaholic city cop discovers something sinister afoot in this police spoof from the makers of 'Shaun of the Dead'. The film has received some flack from those insistent on comparing the two films, and 'Hot Fuzz' does pale in comparison without the urgency or sense of real danger that made the earlier film so dynamite - but it is still a solid comedy with great flashy editing. The film derives a surprising amount of humour from Nick Frost copying things that lead actor Simon Pegg has earlier said but mixing up the words, and zany touches that initially just seem odd (the swan) lead to some big laughs later on. The film also gives Timothy Dalton his best role since leaving the James Bond franchise as a condescending local business owner with something up his sleeve. What really sets 'Hot Fuzz' apart though from the myriad of other spoofs out there is the darkly comical turn it takes in its final third with a grisly solution to a series of local murders Pegg that starts investigating (hilariously, the villagers keep insisting that they are accidents even when foul play is obvious). Adding a little extra depth, the filmmakers also throw the workaholic nature of Pegg's character on the table, questioning what he may be missing out on by dedicating his life to his job. The film never plucks too deeply into the character, but there is ample characterisation for one to be able to appreciate the film as a study of man examining his job dedication in addition to a laugh-fest."

","The difficultly to define Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz is one of the things that makes Hot Fuzz such a fun and original film. It very much finds itself at a crossroads of genres rather than operating in one specific realm of cinematic classification. If you simply bill the film as a comedy, despite it largely being one, you're neglecting to mention the excessive amounts of violence that often isn't played for laughs, the immense amount of action spectacle, and even the mystery and crime element essential to the plot. If you simply call it a crime film (being that ""action"" isn't one of the six main genres), you dismiss the ubiquitous elements of parody and satire that bleed through nearly every scene of the film.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the incredibly serious police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), who is working with his bumbling partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) in order to investigate exactly why and how the town of Stanford has went more than two decades without a murder, yet the town always seems to be caught up in little accidents that find its citizens killed. The two embark on a journey that involves corruption, secret groups, and unfathomable bloodshed all while trying to uphold the integrity Stanford still has in itself and its name.<br/><br/>The way I see it, Hot Fuzz is an amalgamation of comedy and crime, and maybe with a sprinkle of horror. The comedy is largely classifiable as screwball, as it's largely bent on dialog and the idea that everybody but Simon Pegg's Officer Nicholas Angel character is the only serious soul in a sea of bumbling and blissfully ignorant buffoons. The crime element largely stems from the inherent mystery as to why the town of Stanford has remained murder/crime-free for an upwards of two decades, and that core mystery is what kicks the plot into motion. The aforementioned horror elements are very sporadic, but largely stem from the execution of the murders, which largely disrupt the flow of the film, regardless of what genre it was working towards in the momentary. The murder scenes are often abrupt and occupied by vicious bloodshed that turns the film from a goofy comedy into a vicious and violent picture.<br/><br/>Speaking in a descriptive sense - one that has the film operating in a very subversive sense - Hot Fuzz largely occupies a fictitious world, where characters occasionally act as if they're too dumb to function like normal human beings. Consider the over-dramatized reactions of much of the townspeople of Stanford, specifically the officials who are keeping the murders a secret. They are broadly drawn caricatures where, in a more conventional crime film, they'd be slicker, more believable, and more passable as key players in a conspiracy movement. With that, the writing team of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright (and occasionally Nick Frost with the other two installments of the Cornetto Trilogy), there is an emphasis on merging genres that allow for broad, satirical comedy in addition to gruesome bloodshed. The excessive, unrelenting violence in ""Hot Fuzz"" is noteworthy being that it often comes after some witty dialog or situational humor. This creates a very evident narrative dichotomy that emphasizes revisionist principles in terms of merging genres rather than sticking to one particular genre.<br/><br/>Speaking in a prescriptive sense - one that has the film adhering to conventions and preconceived genre formulas - Hot Fuzz abides by comedic conventions by way of dialog, a common approach in satire. Consider the scene when Nicholas speaks to the older woman and she randomly shouts ""Fascist!"" towards Nicholas, stopping him in his tracks before realizing she is filling in a box on her crossword puzzle. The same trope is used when Nicholas says ""hag,"" referring to another answer on the woman's crossword puzzle, despite the fact that Nicholas utters it like he's referring to her. This is a fairly recognizable attempt at comedy – the classic misunderstanding to us, the audience, between the characters in the film. Comedic convention also arises from the fact that characters are put in a situation they'd rather not be in, or one that's precarious to their safety, well-being, or specific morals. Nicholas Angel being paired up with Nick Frost's Danny Butterman, a goofy but well-meaning police officer, adheres to comedic convention because the two are polar opposites; Angel is stern and self-sufficient whereas Butterman is the more roly-poly type of cop who often seems in it for the fun.<br/><br/>For the crime aspect, despite Hot Fuzz, in a way, rebelling against the conventions of buddy-cop comedies by having the two mismatched leads discover and infiltrate a conspiracy, the film does indeed play by the genre's tropes. In the end, the bad guys are violently defeated, the two leads learn to embrace what makes one another unique and their own person, and two men we've followed since the beginning of the film come out on top. This is a very classical element in a film that, in many ways, is largely revisionist. However, in order to incorporate the new, you need to have some of the old, which is why the descriptive aspect of the film is just as important as its more descriptive aspects.<br/><br/>Above all, it's the ridiculousness and the sheer outlandish premise that draws us to Hot Fuzz; there's a magnetic sense of urgency that attaches us to the characters and their personalities from the start. Seeing one character, who is stern and serious, alongside a goofier archetype both get into sticky situations no matter how hard they try, is one that, when taken here, feels fun and fresh thanks to Pegg and Wright's variety of situational humor. Hot Fuzz is very much genre revisionism, and in a prescriptive sense, it's a film that emphasizes its differences from the comedy, crime, and action genre rather than the conventions of the aforementioned genres that it abides by throughout the course of the film."

","A great slice of British-ness mixed up with perfectly delivered humour, amazing side characters and more subtle jokes that make the rewatch factor for this movie higher than most comedies - Hot Fuzz might just be the perfect modern comedy. Simon Pegg is spot on as the up-tight character who warms to Nick's country police officer, but a lot of the praise must be passed onto the background characters who make this a witty character study akin to the works of Swift. There are many who may prefer Shaun of the Dead, but, for me, Hot Fuzz is the better slice of British town life and elevates the tone of the wit and humour to a near perfect high."

","Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are one of the most brilliant comedic duos of our time. And nowhere is this more abundantly clear than in this film, their greatest comedy to date.<br/><br/>Almost superhuman London police officer Nicholas (Pegg) is somewhat forced to move to a small rural town where he meets up with its various inhabitants, one of them being an ineffectual local cop (Frost), who happens to be the son of the local chief of police. And thus a man used to the high octane action of London crime scene is forced to attend tea parties and to solve crimes such as rampant swans terrorizing the local fields.<br/><br/>But then people start dying, seemingly by accident.<br/><br/>What makes this such an effective comedy is first of all the comedic capabilities of its two main leads, but also how quick it is. Every scene has a joke, often multiple, and almost all of them are bullseyes. It's also very British in that the characters themselves don't seem to be in on the jokes. Most of them take the hilarity very straight-faced, which paradoxically makes it all the more hilarious.<br/><br/>The film is also not afraid to go over the top and often, but in an intelligent way. The jokes don't pander to the lowest common denominator and the plot itself is more of a thriller mystery than your typical ""let's put silly people into silly situations"" comedy plot. The final climax is even a straight up action sequence, though of course suitably over the top one.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is one of the best comedies I've seen because it treats its viewers with respect. It's quick with a joke, but equally quick with character development and multilayered plot. Definitely worth a watch."

","Hot Fuzz is my favourite comedy of the new millennium, as well as in my top 5 favourite films of said era. I already thought Shaun of the Dead itself was a perfect film, yet Hot Fuzz is even better.There are so many film and pop culture references, inside jokes and foreshadowing, ranging from the subtle to the more obvious. Just how long does it take to write a movie this layered? It's like Bad Boys meets The Vicar of Dibley meets The Wicker Man. British comedy has long been about quality over quantity, just look at the small episode count of British sitcoms, or films by Aardman Animations which employee a similar style of humour to Hot Fuzz; there is more comedy in this one film than several Hollywood comedies combined. The pacing and consistency of the jokes in Hot Fuzz is perfect, never is there more than 10 seconds that I'm not laughing. For me the best laugh was saved until the end, when the swan attacks the police officer in the car.<br/><br/>Those moments when Danny (Nick Frost) asks Nicholas Angel about films he has seen, just how many times have I been in this situation in real life, when someone names films one by one (usually junk food films), and when you say you haven't seen one they keep going onto you about it. Angel himself manages to be a likable character despite his overt political correctness, but for me Timothy Dalton steals the show. He really is one of the last of his kind, as a Shakespearean trained actor who can play these types of debonair villains, here he just has the smuggest look on his face.<br/><br/>It's easy for a film to mock bureaucracy, this seems to be one film which speaks in its favour, then again how many films can make the act of filling out paperwork look exciting. The film's use of fascism and the concept of ""The Greater Good"" (the greater good!) as a theme surprisingly is highly thought provoking.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz satirizes action movies by being grounded in reality and with Danny's misconceptions between fantasy and reality, yet at the same time also celebrates them. Having an action movie with British police officers, set in a small English town and full of Hollywood action movie tropes, the concept works on so many levels, likely because there doesn't exist a tradition of cop movies in the UK. Plus having the bad guy's hideout being an outlet for an actual British supermarket chain is another stroke of brilliance. There's just something refreshing and satisfying watching these Hollywood clichés spoofed in a British manner. Action movies have never been a favourite genre of mine, especially this brand of shaky cam, fast cut action, but the action scenes here are legitimately edge of your seat thrilling. The film's use of CGI blood is my only complaint, but when a film is this amazing I can look past this one flaw. Thank you Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg for improving the greater good of British cinema (the greater good!)."

","Hot Fuzz (2007): Dir: Edgar Wright / Cast: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine: Odd titled comedy about a cop so good that he is transferred to a small England village. Discouraged he accepts the transfer only to discover that this seemingly peaceful village has an alarming accident rate that he argues as murder. Director Edgar Wright attacks cop action films with wit and intelligence even going so far as to mention the absurdity of other action films. He previously collaborated with Pegg and Frost on the very funny yet extremely gory Shaun of the Dead. Simon Pegg plays the accomplished officer determined to solve the case but this proves difficult when several factors place against him that nearly result in his death. Nick Frost plays his buffoon partner obsessed with action films. He will learn a surprise within his family yet manage to avoid certain betrayal by using intelligence. He proves loyalty despite the chaotic climax. Jim Broadbent appears as police chief and Frost's father who hides a secret of his own. Timothy Dalton plays someone whom Pegg has suspicions yet he manages to maintain ahead of him. Paddy Considine also appears in a comic turn as DS Andy Wainwright. While often as graphic as his earlier hit, Wright scores again with an attack on action film violence within films that generally aren't that hot. Score: 8 / 10"

The greatness comes from the simplicity of this film: just two guys screwing about in a village in England. That does not mean its boring though, oh no, i was hooked from the start of the movie to the very end. The only thing that's wrong with this film is its name! They could have come up with something better than 'Hot Fuzz'! I think that this is the most underrated movie of all time. There's very few movies i rated 10/10 and this was my first.

It's somewhat disjointed and goes off in a million different directions pulling in references from tons of action movies and even a few horror movies, frequently shifting from satire, comedy and spoof to near drama and back again. Many of the lines and scenes are hilarious, and, while the violence is actually pretty graphic and realistic, at the same time it is over-the-top and cartoonish, so it isn't very disturbing.

","A top London cop who is so good at his job that he makes his fellow officers look like slackers by comparison is ""promoted"" to serve in the sleepy village of Sandford in this contemporary action comedy from the creators of Shaun of the Dead. Police constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) always gets his man, but these days his impeccable record seems to be more indicative of his fellow officers' shortcomings than his own formidable skills as a keeper of the peace. Loathe to stand idly by as their once respectable track record is steadily soiled by the hyper-competent actions of one lone overachiever, Sergeant Angel's superiors at the Met soon determine to remedy their problem by relocating the decorated constable to the West Country village of Sanford -- where tranquil garden parties and neighborhood watch meetings stand in stark contrast to the violent crime and heated gunplay of the city. As Sergeant Angel does his best to adjust to the relative calm of his new environment, his oafish new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) strives to gain the respect of his fellow constables while sustaining himself on fantasies of his favorite action films and police shows. Later, just as it begins to appear as if Sergeant Angel has been relegated to an uneventful existence in the relative calm of the countryside, a series of horrific ""accidents"" lead him to suspect that the tranquil hamlet of Sanford has fallen prey to a sinister plot which reeks of foul play. Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Steve Coogan, and Martin Freeman co-star in the Edgar Wright film."

","This film is simply amazing. It's a parody of typical Hollywood action films set in small town England. The whole setting is very reminiscent of Midsomer Murders.<br/><br/>The basic story line - London police officer Nicholas Angel gets transferred to Sandford, a small, boring town, because he is too good an officer and thereby makes the rest of the London police look bad. But Sandford is far from as boring as it initially seems.<br/><br/>The story is basically an episode of Midsomer Murders mixed with action films like Point Blank, Bad Boys and so on. And it's delivered with loads and loads of black British humour.<br/><br/>Everything in the film is very thorough. The script, the characters, the visuals, special effect... it's all top notch. What really makes the film great, is Simon Pegg's performance as Nicholas Angel. Even though his skills are over the top, he's totally believable as a police officer. While the rest of the film is quite unrealistic, his character actually feels very realistic.<br/><br/>The film makes a lot of fun of Hollywood action films as well as British crime series (like Midsumer Murders), and does so extremely well, while at the same time, it's a great and very entertaining film in its own right. And it's absolutely hilarious in the best way possible, without being downright ridiculous like most parody films. And it's very British. Which is a good thing in my opinion.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best parody films ever, possibly even the best. If you're a fan of Shaun of the Dead, you can't go wrong with this film. Shaun of the Dead is very good - Hot Fuzz is even better."

","Fresh from the success of Shaun of the Dead comes Hot Fuzz, a refreshingly playful movie from the writing team of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. Playful in the sense of a buddy cop movie homage, comparison of policing in the US and UK and parodying the British love of small town murder mysteries. <br/><br/>Plucked from the mean streets of London and unceremoniously dropped in the sleepy village of Sandford in Gloucestershire, dedicated and by-the-book police officer Sgt Nicholas Angel (Pegg) finds himself in a town with zero crime rate yet an alarmingly high number of accidents. Angel is paired with the impressionable PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) who possesses a large belly and an even larger DVD collection. In the absence of a romantic lead for either character, the pair becomes engaged in a predictable homoerotic relationship just as in any of the movies Butterman so dearly loves. Frost's character has such a warm admiration for Pegg's intense, constantly serious Angel. The pair forms an excellent comedic double act in which they ably complement each other through both their facial expressions (Frost is amiable, prone to embarrassment and Pegg is questioning, prone to frowning) and their movements (illustrated perfectly with the fence jumping).<br/><br/>Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent) – Danny's father – heads the local police force, all of whom are charmingly incompetent but it is the Andys (Rafe Spall and Paddy Considine) who steal each of their scenes undermining and gleefully insulting Angel at every opportunity. Instead, village matters are delegated to the Neighbourhood Watch Association (abbreviation unfortunate but intended of course) who are more preoccupied with winning yet another village prize. It is only after a serious of unfortunate events, or accidents as the Sandford Police refer to them, does Angel sense something is not quite right in this seemingly idyllic village. <br/><br/>Action and laughs tumble out of the film thick and fast, the frenetic pacing is helped by those rapidly edited shots every time a drink is poured and loved so much by Wright they are repeated throughout the Cornetto trilogy. Also plentiful are the references for any movie buff to be occupied throughout. Bad Boys 2 and Point Break are most obvious as Frost's Butterman finally gets in on the action he so desperately craves. Others point to the eerie atmosphere that such a place can generate as in the case of Straw Dogs and Wicker Man. TV also gets a look in with Sandford itself a cross between The Bill and The Vicar of Dibley. As the mystery unfolds there is even a tip of the hat towards the likes of Poirot, Marple, Morse et al. <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz possesses the hallmarks of Great British comedy – heavy use of puns, silliness and a celebration of the mundane – and is able to maintain the high laugh count even as the action occupies centre stage in the final quarter of the film. Though with the cast (a who's who of British sitcoms) seemingly having tons of fun amid all the action, it is hard not to want to join in with the whole thing."

With all this under his belt, things go awry in the perfect village that is Sandford, and it's up to him as sergeant to figure out this intricate mystery. <br/><br/>This film has a bit of everything in it and the delivery and casting was well done.

","In this second theatrical collaboration between Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright, they take on the buddy cop movie and deliver another slick, funny parody.

While there, he stumbles on a conspiracy and sets out to stop it by any means necessary. One thing this movie definitely had going in its favor was that I enjoy action movies a lot more than horror movies. That's not to say I disliked SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but I like the action genre more. Like its predecessor, HOT FUZZ deals with genre clichés in a fun way while never exclusively relying on them to mine laughs. There was also a lot of references to other action movies that I thought were hilarious. And speaking of humor, I felt that this film was a significant improvement in terms of comedic writing from SHAUN OF THE DEAD. There was the more subtle British humor, which I am warming up to, and the more up-front genre-derived humor. Both work extremely well, and all of the actors deliver it perfectly. The only quibble I have with this film, though, is that it's about 10-15 minutes too long. This is mostly due to the ending, which feels like it could have ended at a couple spots, but then kept on going. What was there was funny enough, but in my opinion it could have been shortened a bit. Overall, HOT FUZZ is an improvement over SHAUN OF THE DEAD and delivers a hilarious action movie parody that genre fans will enjoy."

","I was not sure what to expect from this movie that I found on Netflix a while ago while browsing through the catalog. The movie poster makes it look like a hard-boiled police action movie but reading the reviews it became clear that it was more of a comedy. I had not heard of the movie before but it generally got good reviews so the other evening me and the boys sat down to watch it.<br/><br/>This is a fun movie. A good, old-fashioned British comedy. The core story could very well have been a serious crime story but the way it is implemented makes it so incredibly silly in a fun way. It starts off pretty much right away when PC Angel is told that he will be promoted but moved, because he makes the rest if the bunch of the dimwits at the precinct look bad, to a small British town where the most fun you can have is to watch the grass grow or get drunk and from there it goes downhill for Angel.<br/><br/>His new colleagues are somewhat weird not to mention more or less useless when it comes to police work. The by-the-book Angel is getting more and more frustrated and his only friend is the son of his new boss, whom he arrested on the first day by the way. When the grizzly ""accidents"" starts to happen the movie, in particular the explanations as to why they are ""accidents"" and not crimes, become more and more absurd. The special effects guys seems to have learned a trick or two from the Monty Python gang when it comes to over the top gory blood splattered scenes by the way.<br/><br/>In the final showdown between Angel and the totally wacko gang that keeps the town ""clean"" by deadly serious methods is short references to great many action movies. The amount of shots fired and the ratio of misses versus actual hits is nothing short of ludicrous. It was just so absurdly funny that it is difficult to describe.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for some good solid British comedy then I can recommend this one. It is a very well done comedy and a lot more enjoyable than the get drunk and/or fall on your arse and/or and puke all over the place ""comedies"" that comes thirteen to the dozen today."

Despite the fact that it looked a bit overwhelmingly fast at the beginning , it looked deep in the main character's life after that. Being funny in some parts and completely shocking in other is one of the best features of the film . It could make you laugh at such horrible incidences and it could shock you at points which you thought everything is now alright . I recommend it to anyone who is interested in watching a film that was not made before ."

And I was not let down.

It's the cast that make the movie, as the plot is fairly standard. <br/><br/>The story is filled with the standard elements, but the movie is anything but standard, and that is thanks to the cast. Olivia Coleman, Edward Woodwood, Martin Freeman, Bill Knighy and Rory McCaan (The Hound from TV's Game Of Thrones) are all here offering solid support.<br/><br/>This film plods along grabbing every easy laugh along the way.

","The first time I saw this movie I was both laughing out loud and really shocked and surprised. Hot Fuzz is about a top cop from London (Simon Pegg) who gets transferred to a small village in the country. Everything seems really calm in the village at first, until a series of strange murders start changing everything! Everybody in the village except the top cop seem to think they were accidents, so with the help of his fellow cop (Nick Frost) he has to prove he's right. The story may not convince you when you hear it, but it's the great dialogs and dry humor that make this film what it is. Pegg and Frost just make the perfect duo with their hilarious chemistry, they can make you laugh like nobody else. Of course we already got to see them together in Shaun of the Dead, the prequel of Hot Fuzz, but personally I think they're even better in this one. The film will, like i said, surprise you at certain moments, the first half is completely different than the second. You're not allowed to take the plot to seriously, that's not the key point of this film. I can also highly recommend watching Hot Fuzz multiple times because you'll discover so much things you didn't see the first time, even after the fourth time I discovered new things that amazed me."

","It is very hard to make a good comedy, but to make good and smart comedy takes a real genius. "" Hot Fuzz"" is a brilliant parody on both Hollywood action nonsense and the cozy village fairytale. The two, at first sight incompatible ingredients, mash beautifully in this hilariously funny movie. Fanatical, by the book city cop gets transferred into a picturesque green paradise, full of dimwits. Add a generous sprinkle of strange deaths, murders masked as accidents and it's a winning proposition. What makes this comedy stand out is a marvelous dead pan that it's played with. The first class cast plays these part as seriously as they would perhaps ""Macbeth"". That level of conviction gives the movie that extra punch and wins your heart while you exercise your laughing muscles."

","Hot Fuzz is awesome. English humor in general is kinda weird (nowadays at least), since that it mostly consists in making fast jokes that are quickly cut in a weird editing, so it definitely don't appeals for me. But, somehow this filmmade me laugh. It's genuinely funny and above all – original – even if it's a parody. Yeah, It's more a satire than anything else, but still being a parody with personality. I mean, you just realize it's a mocking film after the first 40 minutes, that weren't that good in my opinion, but it shows the development of the film. I didn't like it mostly because of the fast and unfunny apparently 'nonsense' gags that suddenly appeared out of nowhere – I thought, worthy noting -, but then I realized that the gags and everything weren't nonsense at all. That was the funniest part about it. As a parody, it mocks the American action/thriller films in general. Being said, my first impression by Edgar Wright wasn't one of the best. I really didn't like the Cult-film 'Scott Pilgrim', it was way too messy and forced, but Hot Fuzz conquered me. In fact, I think it's one of the greatest comedies of the last decade. Really worth checking out. 7.9/10"

","So this film is the second in Wright/Pegg Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy, the first was Shaun of the Dead and third was The World's End, and it takes place in Sanford, Gloucestershire, GB. PC Nick Angel is a high achieving cop in the London Metropolitan Police Service whose by the book attitude and highest arrest record of any other officer in the Met starts to make his superiors believe he's too effective, making the other officers look bad by comparison. So he's promoted to Sergeant and transferred to the sleepy seemingly idyllic village of Sanford. After arriving and making an arrest of three drunk and disorderly teens and a DUI after a visit to the local pub, Sergeant Angel meets the eccentric (and exceedingly creepy) residents of the village. He's partnered with the buffoonish but well meaning PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) and settles into a boring routine of investigating complaints that lead to chasing livestock, giving an unappreciated safety lecture to high school students, and generally wishing he was back in London. Sgt. Angel and PC Butterman, however, investigate a series of gruesome deaths attributed to accidents but Angel suspects foul play on the part one of the most prominent local citizens, Mr. Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), a successful local grocery owner. Angel's investigation lead to a weird and funny revelation about how desperate the town's leaders are to keep Sanford as the England's ""Village of the Year."""

","Hot Fuzz is the second film in the 'Cornetto Trilogy' of spoofs from Edgar Wright's team up with Pegg and Frost. The film itself is easily up there with the best comedies of recent times. It's the perfect sent up of the action genre that features brilliant jokes, a hilariously gripping story and truly funny characters. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around PC Nicolas Angel who is transferred from action packed London to the seemingly idyllic village of Sandford, where it's claimed there hasn't been a recorded murder for 20 years. Angel is can't accept the quiet lifestyle and the incompetent police force, until a number suspicious accidents take place which he feels are more than just coincidences. Angel and his partner Danny clash with everyone as they try to find the truth. The story flows brilliantly and keeps you guessing all the way as to what the truth is behind events, peppered with laughs and an explosive climax. You do get invested in Angel's mission and it does a wonderful job of mixing the comedy with some high octane action set pieces.<br/><br/>The cast is superb. Simon Pegg is great as the stern Angel who has to adjust to the village, he does a brilliant job of being the straight man as he holds the centre of the film together. Nick Frost is really funny as his dim but well-meaning partner, his likability and blundering make him an engaging presence. Jim Broadbent was solid as usual as the chief inspector. Timothy Dalton was a highlight having the time of his life as the self-confident and sinister Skinner, he mixes in Bond like suaveness to great effect. Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall where excellent as the sarcastic 'two Andy's', both have some great lines as the chemistry between themselves and Pegg is excellent. Both Olivia Colman as the slow Doris and Kevin Eldon as the pretty useless Fisher round up the force superbly. The rest of the villagers fitted their roles effortlessly. <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a flawless send up of the action genre. Nearly all the jokes hit the spot, whether they are parody (the references to Point Break and action puns are great such as ""Did you tell him to cool off?"") or trying to deal with the local issues like a runaway swan, which is just hilarious. The film has a sharp with that means the jokes never let up and the British sensibility helps it shine. The funny thing is that the action scenes are actually better than most pure action films. The non- stop climax is just full of explosive fun action, it is incredibly well made and has a mix of gritty as well as hilariously painful scenes. Pegg and Frost make a faultless comedy double act, Pegg's invincible man is wonderfully played off by Frost's enthusiastic bumbler as both are perfect as the centre piece. The whole set up is executed perfectly, plus the characters are well rounded and really bring something unique or different to the table. It's also refreshing how dark and gruesome the film was willing to go, the death scenes were both hilarious and grisly which added to the dark comedy feel. It felt like it was always pushing itself further to see what it could get away with. Edgar Wright once again puts in the quick cuts that fit in well. <br/><br/>On the whole Hot Fuzz is an extremely funny, well written and acted buddy cop send-up."

","Hot Fuzz is an Excellent and hilarious Action-Comedy that is filled,fantastic direction,an amazing cast,great laughs,explosive Action,a wonderful script and a memorable film score making Hot Fuzz a outstanding Cult Classic.<br/><br/>Set in the United Kingdom,Hot Fuzz tells the story of Nicolas Angel,a decorated by the book British Police Officer who's really good at his job in fact Nicolas is so good that his superiors feel that Nicolas makes his fellow officers look bad. And because of that,Nicolas' superiors transfer him to Sanford a small crime free town in Rural Gloucestershire to continue his police work and is partnered with bumbling cop Sgt. Danny Butterman. While there Nicolas discovers that there have gruesome murders of town folk that are made to look like accidents and when decides Nicolas to investigate and laughs,Action and Chaos ensues.<br/><br/>After the critical and financial success of the Zombie Horror Comedy Cult Classic Shaun Of The Dead many wondered what would director Edgar Wright,Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do for an encore and the great trio responded with Hot Fuzz,an hilarious and very thrilling Action-Comedy that is the second film in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy and is another Cult Classic. If Shaun Of The Dead was a film that mocked and paid homage to Zombie movies and Horror films then Hot Fuzz is a film that mocks and pays tribute to Action movies and Buddy Cop films of the 1980s and 90s. As someone who loves and is a huge fan of the Action film genre I loved what the film Hot Fuzz was doing and what the film was doing taking a funny and hilarious target at the Action film genre and it's trademarks with non stop laughs and thrilling,no holds barred Action and the film never stops until the very end. The Comedy and Humor in HF is done with greatness and manic energy that is clever and offbeat almost to the point where you will be weak from all of the laughing you be doing while watching the movie. Edgar Wright loves Action films and Wright and HF wears it's Action film style on it's sleeve and makes hilarious references to Action and Buddy Cop films such as Die Hard,Lethal Weapon,Point Break and Bad Boys II(the latter two which are shown in HF)and also has some Action movie trademarks such as Gunfights,explosions and car chases. HF makes fun of Action scenes that you have seen in certain Action films and are serious but HF turns serious Action scenes on their head with smarts and dry wit. If you are an Action movie lover you will love Hot Fuzz's great sense of humor. Nicolas Angel and Danny Butterman are an amazing and funny Buddy Action duo that follow the classic tradition Buddy cop duo such as Riggs and Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon and Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond in 48 Hrs. Like those two fantastic duos Nicolas and Danny don't really like each other in the beginning(or in this case Nicolas doesn't like Danny)because Nicolas is the straight man and Danny is the funny one and loves Action films but as the movie goes on Nicolas and Danny start to like and understand each other and how they do things and when the two characters are together there is great laughs and humor but also depth and personality that is real. Nicolas and Danny are a memorable and unforgettable Action Buddy cop team that will stay with you after watching the film. The screenplay by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg is fantastic and really well-done giving the characters laugh out loud,rapid fire dialog that is fun and over the top and every joke in the film is done in such a flawless way. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and thrilling and will definitely have viewers excited and glued to the screen because with each Action scene there is so much devotion to detail and execution that every Action scene had to be perfect and the Action scenes are perfect. The ending or final 30 minutes of Hot Fuzz is thrilling and masterful because it mixes non stop laughs and explosive Action that have you roaring with laughter and on the edge of your seat the whole time and will definitely put a smile on your face. An funny and outstanding conclusion to Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>The cast does great jobs in their roles. Simon Pegg is excellent and funny as Sgt. Nicolas Angel,with Pegg bringing deadpan Comedy to the role. Nick Frost is brilliant and hilarious as Danny,Angel's new partner and has great scenes and chemistry with Pegg. Jim Broadbent is fantastic as Inspector Frank Butterman,Danny's Father. Timothy Dalton is wonderful as Simon Skinner,a local Supermarket owner. Also,lookout for credited and uncredited cameos by Cate Balanchett(Janie),Film Director Peter Jackson(Thief Dressed as Santa),Steve Coogan(Metropolitian Police Inspector)and Bill Nighy(Met Chief Inspector).<br/><br/>The direction by Edgar Wright is brilliant and stylish,with Wright always moving the camera with zooms,close-ups and tracking shots and giving the film a wonderful energy and Wright also does a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Wright.<br/><br/>The score by David Arnold is fantastic,intense and thrilling and matches the Action movie tone of the film. Incredible score,Arnold. There is also great songs on the soundtrack by artists such as Supergrass(Caught By The Fuzz)and many more. A wonderful soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love,Edgar Wright,Action Films,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Hot Fuzz,an Excellent,hilarious and explosive Action-Comedy Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","This is not a movie. This is an experience that will take you on the craziest and wildest ride of your life. I had no idea that this movie was in some way linked to Shaun of The Dead but once i found out Hot Fuzz had the same actors and director from SOTD, I had to watch it. It probably is better to watch SOTD beforehand. Hot Fuzz is a million times better though and the writing is brilliant. However, i am in awe of Edgar Wright's Directing style. The shots are fast paced for the action sequences but are slow enough for the comedy to sink in within them. The writing is the star of the movie. This is not a total trash talking, dirty minded movie. The curses are sort of necessary and fit in with the characters. For instance, the main character played by Simon Pegg does not curse until more than half-way through the movie because he is a serious cop unlike Nick Frosts character who can swear but picks his moments. The action does not stop right up until the very end of the movie which is a delight The writing is also witty and funny. This movie is very graphic, especially the death scenes of the villagers but it all comes together for this outrageously epic plot that has an end that will completely blow your mind. This is not a predictable episode of CSI. This is the best comedy I have ever experienced."

","This is probably one of my favourite of the Edgar Wright films, though I must admit that most of his films (at least those that I have seen) are typically British in taste. Mind you to suggest that you do not like a particular Edgar Wright film can be blasphemy to some people, but to those people I simply suggest that they get a life. Shaun of the Dead was, well, okay, but this one was quite amusing, despite the story itself being a little unoriginal.<br/><br/>Basically a police officer, Nicholas Angel, is really good at what he does, in fact he is so good that he puts the rest of the Metropolitan Police to shame so they decide that it is probably best for their reputation if they find him a nice post out in the country where he can basically stay out of trouble. Mind you, within ten minutes of arriving in the small English country town, he has pretty much cleared everybody out of the pub because, as it turns out, they are underage.<br/><br/>The thing about this film is that there are a number of accidental deaths, and Angel comes to suspect that there is some sort of conspiracy afoot, so he sees it as his duty to get to the bottom of it. However, while there is indeed a conspiracy afoot, it turns out that it is nothing like he actually expected it to be.<br/><br/>Like a lot of comedies, I tend to find that the jokes generally only last for a short time, and usually when you have seen the joke, it just does not seem to be all that funny any more. I guess that is why one should watch films like this sparingly, unless of course you are watching it with a group of people, Mind you, when you are watching a film with a group of people, the laughter that is generated can actually be quite contagious.<br/><br/>As for this film, it is a pretty good film, with a lot of unexpected twists in it. Okay, also because it is set in England, it did create a bit of a pinning for me to go back there which, to be honest with you, is one of my favourite places in the world."

I also found it very humorous seeing Simon Pegg in a more serious role right after Shaun of the Dead for the fact that it is a complete opposite in character. This movie really does make you laugh and there are many kinds of jokes in this movie to satisfy any sense of humour.<br/><br/>PROS/CONS: Though the movie is very funny, I found it to be rather slow in the first half and in some cases lacking.

","Story/Plot - PC Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is at the top of his game. He has high arrest rates and has reduced crime. However, those above him are worried that if he stays in London he will continue to make them and the rest of the London police force look really bad. As a result of this PC Angel is pushed out of London and into a sleepy Gloucestershire town of Sandford.<br/><br/>Now Sergeant Angel, he teams up with a hapless PC named Danny Butterman whose father is the towns chief of police. The Sandford police force seems to have a way of punishment for in-house problems, and that is cake and ice cream.<br/><br/>Out and about on their daily duties Danny is constantly asking Nicholas about aspects of his previous action in London, curious to see what happens outside of a law abiding town. Or is it really a law abiding community.<br/><br/>Two actors are decapitated in a road traffic collision, which the community and police are branding an accident. Sgt Angel on the other hand has his doubts, doubts which are soon added on by further deaths in the community. Sgt Angel is pushed out of town by the so called neighbour hood watch.<br/><br/>On his return Sgt. Angel with PC Butterman by his side take on the neighbour hood in a shoot out. Only one side can be victorious.<br/><br/>My Verdict - I have watched Hot Fuzz several times and each time I laugh just as hard as before. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg have a brilliant on screen relationship and can bond their characters into what the writers have portrayed. They compliment each other in different ways and make an excellent pairing.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright has co written and directed a comedy masterpiece and a film that will continue to be loved for decades more.<br/><br/>I will always recommend Hot Fuzz for everyone to see.

","The movie Hot Fuzz is definitely an action thriller. However, the movie begins with more comedy over action and ends off with action galore and guns firing everywhere. However, the direction manages to include comedy throughout the film, which just adds a wonderful aspect of entertainment to the movie. Simon Pegg delivers an amazing performance as Nicholas Angel, and his work partner Danny is a wonderful friend and a great comedian as well. Nicholas Angel is the ideal cop and would make for a perfect police officer in today's world. The movie hooked me up from beginning to end, and was very well-structured. I enjoyed the fast-moving action sequences and the camera running through different incidents at once in a super-quick pace. One thing I would recommend for this movie is more focus on the criminal(s) of the grisly crimes that take place, as opposed to merely trying to eliminate them. For instance, the movie could perhaps provide more details on who did what in the crimes and how they were planned out. Other than that, I would say this movie was quite amazing!

","Co-written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, directed by Wright, and starring Pegg, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen. I compare it to the ""Hot Shots"" movies by Abrahms and Proft. Part slasher flick, part buddy movie, part action picture, this film keeps me laughing all the way through every time I see it.<br/><br/>Pegg plays Sergeant Angel, a hot-shot cop that no one can stand. He's in a big city, and his boss sends him to a small, rural village just to get rid of him, hoping Angel will resign out of boredom. However, Angel discovers a crime ring in the small town. The supporting cast is great: Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as detectives Wainwright and Cartwright -- or is it the other way around? The Equalizer's Edward Woodward, <br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes shows Sergeant Angel doing research to discover the murderer. It's played the same as all those Schwarzenegger movies where Arnie's character is suiting up for the assault, jamming knifes in sheaths, shoving ammo magazines in assault rifles, jerking harness tight -- while Angel is photocopying newspapers, highlighting words, circling errors with dramatic music adding tension and excitement!<br/><br/>The movie bears repeated watching, as you get more of the jokes when you pay more attention than the dialogue warrants at first watch. The movie includes every action movie cliché that you can remember. It's incredibly well-written, and Pegg nails the role. I think Wright and Pegg really hit their stride here."

","Hot Fuzz might not be as great as Edgar Wright's previous movie with Smon Pegg and Nick Frost but it still manages to be at the same time one of the best comedies of 2007 and one of the best cop movies of 2007. Pegg and Frost are good as always and as in all Wright movies the editing is so smooth and lightning fast that it manages to make paperwork look like the coolest damn thing you've ever seen. Hot Fuzz plays with the tropes and clichés of cop movies in a amusing way while at the same time functioning as a perfectly passable cop movie in it's own right that you could enjoy without knowing much about the genre. However having some knowledge of the many movies the film references adds a lot of enjoyment to it. Most of the humor however comes not from referencing other movies but from the absurdities of setting a hard edged cop thriller in a small quiet English village."

","If you did not see this movie when it came out in theater or when it was released on DVD/Blue ray, it's not too late. The Simon Pegg and Nick Frost duo is a pleasure to watch. Earlier this year I watched ""Paul"" and after enjoying the antics of the pair, I wanted to see more. I recalled having seen promos that featured the two, and Hot Fuzz was what I promised myself to watch. For the record, the voice-over of the alien by Seth Rogen in 'Paul' was an important factor for my liking that movie but I was curious to see Pegg & Frost as a team again. I was not disappointed, 'Hot Fuzz' had quite a cast, if you're familiar with UK actors, and the writing was pretty darn god, so was the directing; the production was understandably a hit and gladly, my usual sources for ratings and reviews all score it way above average.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are well rounded actors; when serious actors take to doing comedy (let's say Hot Fuzz is primarily a comedy) good things can happen. Frost happens to be in a favorite movie of mine, ""The Boat That Rocked"" so the more reason for the interest I had for the movie. I'll go out on the limb and say more people have seen it that would care to acknowledge. I don't think there's anything embarrassing in admitting you liked this movie, it's well done and the dialogue is just the type of humor that makes you feel smart; let me clarify: Some comedies will make you appear intellectually challenged because the humor is not routed in sophisticated thought, while other comedies such as this one, are. One more thing, in addition to a pretty good comedy, you get a fair murder caper; it's a good deal, get it, watch it."

","Part 2 Of The Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy<br/><br/>Director of Shaun Of The Dead, Edgar Wright teams up yet again with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost to create the best cop movie in recent memory. Simon Pegg plays London Cop Nicholas Angel, a cop who is too serious and too good at his job. In doing so, he makes everyone else at the London PD look bad. His superiors decide to transfer him to the quiet community of Sanford, where there's little crime. Simon Pegg plays London cop Nicholas Angel, and he's absolutely brilliant in the role. The film is hilarious, and Iconsider a comedy masterpiece. I love this film. The jokes are great, sometimes crude, but they don't overdue it, which is great. Nick Frost Plays Angel's partner Danny Butterman an action movie buff who wants to have a ""bad boy"" police career. Both actors light up the screen, and like in Shaun Of The Dead, they create something extremely funny on screen. The pair simply go great together, and when you get these two in a film, you get a top notch comedy. Hot Fuzz has all the elements of a buddy cop comedy, but one thing that really makes it standout among others is the good mix of action and hilarious comedy. Both comedians here are terrific, and the rest of the cast are very funny too. Edgar Wright has made a fine follow up to his zombie comedy masterpiece, Shaun Of The Dead. Hot Fuzz proves yet again that he is a great director who knows how to mix comedy with another genre very well. The film may not appeal to everyone because this is of course a British film and with that said, it's got British Humour. But to those who don't mind that, give this one a shot. The film is truly a work of originality. Even when the action starts, they still manage to do something stupid on screen and the film strongly delivers big laughs. A well constructed film with a good cast, and a good story with loads of laughter and action. A 10 Star British Comedy Movie. And Can't Wait Or Part 3 The World's End"

","Shaun of the Dead... now Hot Fuzz. It started off a bit rough for me. i wasn't really enjoying it much, but as it kept going the central mystery got me hooked. The deaths are quite crazy and hilarious, and the film always outlandish. Not an incredible film by any means, but the last half is definitely better and kinda lives up to what I thought it would be like. This is one to be watched with a bunch of friends. Overall, it is equal to Shaun of the Dead. None of it lives up to the first half of Shaun, but its last half is stronger than Shaun's so overall, they balance each other out. Still, I had wish maybe it was a bit better and more unpredictable (although the 'killers' certainly were awesome and their reveal was the best scene in the film)."

","There is still something about many British-made films which makes them disappointingly – well, British. I'm not talking about the 'British' films which are, in fact U.S. productions made with U.S. money and are merely touted by our homegrown cheerleaders as being 'British' because they were made in British-based film studios with British technicians. I mean those which are a tad small-scale and which have a kind of defiant dog-in-the-manger feel to them. It's not just that the production values are lower, it's also how quickly they can resort to well-worn clichés and trade on a mythical Britishness. But there are now many British films which wholly transcend that feel, and Hot Fuzz is one of them. It, too, resorts to clichés, but does so fondly to send them up. Yes, it is ludicrously over the top but enjoyably so. Not once does it pull its punches, not once do the film drop its guard and give us a knowing wink which is a current failing of quite a few contemporary British comic actors: throughout it succeeds in spades because it is played dead straight, and is all the funnier for that. I saw this within hours of watching Paul, another Simon Pegg and Nick Frost vehicle and that, although also very entertaining, loses on points because, being made for the U.S. market and in the process being so oppressed by the imperative to succeed that it pulled its punches all too often. Hot Fuzz never does, from the tongue in cheek send-up of a small Gloucestershire town and its phoney bucolism, through to the gruesome murders and the wild carnage of the closing gunfight where most of the town's great and good are slaughtered. It would be difficult to exaggerate just how over the top it is, but despite that it hits the spot each time. For this viewer, at least, it is 100pc successful."

","I've been wondering if there are few decent British films being comedic but full-packed, there are lots. Hot Fuzz to begin with is seriously entertaining. I thought that its sharp, fast-paced, eccentric movie style is a turn-down but no, it made me curious. Getting puzzled I was fascinated how they sheathed the whole story with mystery, revelation and evenhanded action, comedy and a little bit of drama. Simon Pegg brought well his character. I've used to stereotyping him as only fit for comedic roles, but the moment I saw his scene with Nick Frost near the end, I thought ""This guy is pretty convincing"". He can act well, the way his job demands. Speaking of Nick Frost he was always funny. He was deliberately suitable to play his role. Pegg and Frost's combination is really laughable. I was also surprised that Jim Broadbent appeared in this film, he played well his character. It's not ennui to watch this film over and over again. Edgar Wright's brilliance in pulling all together in this film made it always fresh from the oven. Though there were similarities with his recent Shaun of the Dead (which admittedly was the best) Hot Fuzz nevertheless was way cool in comedy and story. Entertainment unexhausted I believe I strongly recommend seeing this film to anyone delighted with its comical wittiness in action, comedy and mystery."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","22 January 2009"," Totally unique, witty ""dark/action"" comedy
","""Hot Fuzz"" seems to get most of its fame from being the follow-up to ""Shaun of the Dead"" by director Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, but the truth is that this film is better and it stands alone as a great dark, action comedy without ""Shaun.""<br/><br/>The first reason ""Fuzz"" is better than ""Shaun"" is because it's more accessible. Some people have stigma's against zombie movies and ""Shaun"" was sort of stuck playing off the characteristics of zombie movies. ""Fuzz"" is a small-town murder mystery wrapped in a horror film wrapped in a comedy. Sometimes all that makes it hard to take seriously, but when you embrace that it's all for comedic effect and stop caring so much about plot, it's all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film's main character is Nicholas Angel (Pegg), a top cop in London who suddenly gets transferred to the small rural town of Sanford because his diligence makes all the other P.Os look bad. Of course in Sanford, the citizens talk of ""the greater good"" and don't care much about proper law enforcement provided everyone's happy. Of course when ""accidents"" start happening resulting in people's deaths, all that begins to change.<br/><br/>It doesn't sound exactly like a comedy on premise, but the clash of Pegg's big city super-cop personality and that of the ignorant Stanford citizens is a starting point for all of it. There is an onslaught of bizarre characters in the town who play up their small-town innocent mentality by making jokes, insulting each other or acting plain weird. This is where the skills of a supporting cast with Jim Broadbent and Timothy Dalton come in. Capped off by the humorously naive performance by Nick Frost as Butterfield, sort of Angel's assistant, there is plenty to laugh at whether it's the female officer's sexual explicit jokes to her all-male department, the ""Andys"" two foul-mouthed detectives, or the variety of slurring characters that only the townies can understand.<br/><br/>All this time, ""Hot Fuzz"" builds toward an action movie spoof resulting in one of the more satisfying end sequences in any film, especially comedy. Usually comedies end in cheese as the writers tie up the more human elements of the story, but ""Hot Fuzz"" blossoms into the stylish action flick it wants so desperately to be given by the amount of ""Bad Boys II"" and ""Break Point"" references. Wright definitely has an eye for action and you could predict this based on his overuse of fast close-up jump cut sequences. This gives the end as much style points as it deserves spoof points.<br/><br/>There really is some brilliance to the writing--all loose ends of the mystery are tied up and nearly all the jokes that are made in the film come back for another round of laughs in the end. You simply don't see comedies do that well anymore. So while it may come off initially as sort of gross, over-the-top, violent humor, it concludes on a satisfyingly witty note."

","It's really a movie that is made great by its writing and style. Edgar Wright has a very particular and stylish directing style. His movies bring comedies to another level. You'll be always able to recognize an Edgar Wright movie (even when Simon Pegg isn't in it) through its style. It's fast and enhances and makes truly the movie its comical moments. But also the writing is great. Despite the fact that it actually has a very simplistic concept and the movie is basically a one joke movie (a big-town, successful police officer, who does things always by the book gets promoted away to the dull and slow countryside.). The story and its script are filled with some great and just plain silly (in a good way) moments and some unusual, funny characters.<br/><br/>Of course things in the country side are not as calm and innocent as it seems at first sight. Soon he stumbles upon a series of sudden killings. So yes, there actually is still a main plot present in the movie as well, which is an enjoyable one that knows to keep you interested throughout as well, no matter how silly it gets at times.<br/><br/>After this some crazy, absurd, over-the-top action kicks in, which really makes the movie all the more hilarious to watch. It's obviously deliberately done totally over-the-top, just as are the movie its characters all. The movie is needlessly violent and graphic, which actually works all the more hilarious for the movie its comedy because its all so extremely well and professionally done. It was the foremost reason why for instance ""Shaun of the Dead"" also worked out so well.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg's and Edgar Wright's previously successes have as a result for this movie that some big well known actors show up in this movie in some small roles. Actors such as Stuart Wilson, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent and Cate Blanchett all appear in this movie. It even has Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson in it, in a 3 seconds cameo. Of course Simon Pegg still is the central character of the movie but this time he and Nick Frost don't need to carry the movie as much alone as they for instance still had to do in ""Shaun of the Dead"". They are both great comedian actors but it's a real good thing that the movie has also some great supporting actors.<br/><br/>If you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"", you will love ""Hot Fuzz"".<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","To be honest, i wasn't expecting Hot Fuzz to be much of a movie (i was unaware of how good Shaun of the Dead was). I caught this film on HBO and i should admit, i received way, way, way more than what i expected. 'Hot Fuzz' is one of those movies that is hard to describe in common description, its not outright funny, nor is it all action. But it is what genuine popcorn cinema is, outright entertainment. The best way to describe this movie is that it is HYSTERICAL.The film is very familiar yet very different from other films that belong to the comedy-action genre. The point is, Edgar Wright doesn't take the genre too seriously here and tries to mix up a long of things. The film is odd, ridiculous, funny, and has great action sequences as well. It's a strange mix, but the director is talented enough to make that strange mix actually work big time. From the start, the movie was always going to offer something different, and the quick-paced start suddenly settles into a mundane, lazy early days for Nicholas Angel at his new town. Murders happen, but none of them were shown too seriously, and then we have the townspeople muttering them as 'accidents'. Now that's one odd thing. And the film does manage to keep the suspense going even though it never sounded as serious to be unpredictable. When the plot is revealed, it gets more ridiculous, only to serve us all up with a wonderful crescendo of an ending (The fight scene at the climax is just mind-blowing). It's everything that looks out of place coming together. A cop story, located at a small British town, the heroes are two cops, one riding on a horse armed with several shotguns so stylishly decorated over his body (dont forget that stylish cooling glasses, duh), and another being a filmi gimmick, and who are the villains? The town's old people. From a priest to the lazy police chief to a store owner even to a old lady, they are all armed and attack as if they are professional killers. Now that's something you don't see all the time. Just sit, watch and have a blast. This is what i call all-out entertainment with some creative thinking. Well written, well executed, and never pretends to be anything more than what it is."

","My Take: Lampoons over-the-top action movies by turning itself into one. Look out Jerry Bruckheimer! <br/><br/>Movie parodies are usually banal these days, especially since the film relies too heavily on references rather than real hilarity. Luckily we got the Brits who still happen to know how to make a purely funny genre satire, and isn't afraid to even go beyond over the top. The creative team behind SHAUN OF THE DEAD, also a brilliant British comedy import, proceeds with yet another hilarious and clever spoof that is possibly the funniest one I've seen in a long time. Possible one of the best comedies I have ever seen. Here's the buzz people: It's HOT FUZZ.<br/><br/>The talented comedic team-up of Edgar Wright (director), Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (actors) give another shot at parodying a certain film genre and result in a darkly funny and cleverly hilarious winner that'll throw the straight action team-up of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay back to the storyboards. Now, joke's on you guys! But other than just lampooning everything on the action movie dictionary from Arnold to Woo, the film takes on a life of its own. It has a story that also (mind the 'also') functions as a clothesline for the numerous clever laughs and some terrific star performances. Yes, Pegg and Frost alone make for one star-studded affair. They work really well together.<br/><br/>The plot follows top MET Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Pegg), the roughest, toughest police in the force. In fact, he's so good, they reassigned him since his superiors are worried that he's no-holds bar attitude makes the force look bad. They reassigned Angel to the idyllic town of Stanford, where nothing at all happens. The only greatest 'crime' of the town is graffiti, a statue-like street performer and daily escapades with an escaped pet swan. But not to lately, a series of bizarre (and very bloody) ""accidents"" occur, people turned up dead. Or murdered, believes Angel who thinks that there's some serial killer who's making everything happen in a town where nothing at all happens. Angel, partnered by local police sidekick Danny Butterman (Frost), try to figure things out and set things right, big city-style.<br/><br/>The film contains as many pop references, as well as those in many action pictures, from famous key scenes (shooting with two guns in a slow-motion shot reminiscent a scene from John Woo's FACE/OFF) and overused clichés such as obvious villains (Timothy Dalton? A sneering bad guy? Up to no good? Come on!) and action overdose (the slam-bang finale inspired from even the best of Bruckheimer & Don Simpson). It does these so with a clever and biting sense of humor. The jokes, references and lampoons are actually funny, and not just for the time. HOT FUZZ doesn't even require you to take your thinking caps off. But mot of all, there's the comic timing and clever in-turns of Pegg and Frost who are terrific on-screen. Their funny, and smart enough to know the audiences expected something smart from them. The movie is over-the-top to be sure, and there is a high level of violent content much like 'Shaun'. Not all audiences of all tastes will enjoy everything about HOT FUZZ, but there's so much more to see here, and I'd be damned if I stop you from seeing it. If funny is what you always wanted from a comedy (and you'd better consult your dictionary if you don't), then you'd better call The Fuzz.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","This is the story of a straight-arrow police officer, Nicholas Angel, who is reassigned to a village with both a high-weirdo and high-accident quotient. Our Hero, Sgt. Angel, is the only one who suspects foul play. From here, we get the most hilarious send-up of buddy-cop movies since ""Starsky & Hutch."" The British just have this way of making so many goofy and improbable things happen in a comedy while having the actors play it completely straight and true without any winking to the camera. And it just clicks. That is what I love about this movie. How the characters range in their broadness and earnestness. Never is this more evident than in the re-teaming of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who are Britain's answer to Abbott and Costello. Pegg's almost cartoonish (ALMOST being the key word here)earnestness and Frost's childlike ignorance are just absolutely irresistible.<br/><br/>I also like how they totally mocked the conventions of modern-day American action movies (The one-liners, the loud effects, and the zoom-ups; so Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott) and also made them the centerpiece of Frost's quirks without banging us over the head with it. In fact, all the character were given quirks (Doris is my favorite)that are on-screen just long enough to make you laugh but not enough to wear out their welcome. Director Edgar Wright doesn't assume you have a short-attention span.<br/><br/>The violence is fairly intense but it serves to amuse rather than horrify and it works for the most part like in ""Shaun of the Dead"". This also doesn't get too excessive. On top of that, the action totally kicks ass! Not only are our leads funny but they make more charismatic action leads than most of the hunks and wrestlers out there.<br/><br/>My only problem is how the climaxes keep getting piled on each other at the end which I guess is supposed to poke fun at how some action films go on too long but it got somewhat redundant. Other than that, this is one of the best comedies of 2007 and I strongly recommend it especially for Wright/Pegg fans."

It's success is due to a witty script and good performances (although it does have it share of stars - the cast list reads like a who's who in British Comedy). The only minor criticisms I would have would be that at times the humour unlike Shaun of the dead the taken to it's basest level and the running time is little bit overlong (comedies should just not be much more than 90 mins  it gets a bit dull after awhile).<br/><br/>All in all Hot Fuzz is a laugh out loud comedy gem with another brilliantly oafish performance by Nick Frost."

","Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright score another hit with this intelligent, funny and at times pretty thrilling follow up to their smash hit zom-rom-com ""Shaun Of The Dead"", which I also loved. What was brilliant about that film was that it hit ticked every box it advertised: there was plenty of comedy, plenty of romance (be it between Saun and girlfriend or Saun and best mate), and plenty of zombies.<br/><br/>Not sure how you could class this film - maybe an action-thriller-comedy-spoof-ensemble piece. Or not. But there was again plenty of every one of these.<br/><br/>Great writing, great casting, great stunts and great special effects - basically the film is great. It sets a ""Lethal Weapon""-style movie in a small English town that just so happens to be full of A-list British actors like Jim Braodbent, Edward Woodwood and a brilliant Timothy Dalton. The boys have obviously gone up in the world budget wise after ""Shaun"" - in the first scene alone we have Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy! The twists in the plot are slightly unexpected and very entertaining, and Pegg and Nick Frost once again make a great double act. My only criticism I have is that there were too many endings, kind of suffering from ""Return Of The King"" syndrome there, but I guess that was needed to fully round up the spoof elements to the film.<br/><br/>On the whole this is a genuinely funny film to watch with your mates (though not your Gran). Oh, and there's a couple of really good gory moments in it too. Well, what did you expect? These boys made a zombie movie! 8/10"

","In the tradition of Shaun of the Dead, the trio (Wright, Pegg, Frost) create a film that is much more of an homage than a comedy. And what a brilliant homage it is. The first half mainly consists of the dry, witty humor that played throughout most of Shaun of the Dead. Personally, I was a huge fan of this. Coming from a British background, I really adored all of the dry British humor that was used and the clever spoofing of some of the action genres biggest moments/situations was also quite hilarious. Unlike the Scary Movies of the modern world, Fuzz knows how to do a parody. It doesn't go insanely over the top and gimmicky, barely linking the story together with scrapes of former film plots. Instead it bases the entire film around one plot, and cleverly pokes fun of other films in scenes or perfectly disposed one liners. The second half is just a complete explosion of action and frenzy. The homage is perfected with some of the best and most engaging action I've ever seen, as well as being filtered with some great humor (Timothy Dalton with a spike through his chin moaning 'Owie'? I'm in.) that makes the experience all the more enjoyable. The trio once again creates one of the most hilariously entertaining films I've had the pleasure of seeing, and I'm sure I'll be able to watch it a thousand times without getting the slightest bit bored. On a side note, the cameos from Cate Blanchett, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy and Peter Jackson are absolutely wonderful and hilarious."

","Shaun of the Dead parodied Zombie films (although I had not seen Romero's films) and by all appearances Hot Fuzz was a parody of the cop/action genre. The films starts off this way but I felt like the writers had nowhere near enough jokes to fill a movie so they had to invent a story. The lead character moves to a boring town (for a policeman) which doesn't seem like the most interesting way to start a police/action story. The small country town setting could have come straight out of Heartbeat and only Simon Pegg's presence throughout keeps the film from descending into amateurism.<br/><br/>Timothy Dalton in a very enthusiastic performance is revealed to be the town villain but a Scream-like plot is introduced before he can be hauled away. This extends the film another half an hour but it left me wondering what the film was supposed to be about.<br/><br/>I think watching Shaun of the Dead may have given me false expectations of this movie and I think if I knew that it was something more akin to The Parole Officer than National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon I could have enjoyed it more.<br/><br/>I found Hot Fuzz entertaining but I felt they could have done a lot more with the opportunity and that it's probably best suited to the domestic British audience."

He is paired with Danny Butterman, who countlessly questions him on the action lifestyle. Everything seems quiet for Angel, until two actors are found decapitated.

Angel and Danny clash with everyone, whilst trying to uncover the truth behind the mystery of the apparent ""acidents"".<br/><br/>After watching the amazing 'Shaun of the Dead', i knew as soon as i heard about their new product, that it was gonna be another fun movie to watch. This movie does not disappoint. It's got a large ensemble of amazing talent which create some wonderful scenes. Their are some good action sequences which would really get you hooked in. Their blood does look a bit off at times, but is a fun addition, especially as spots of it hit the screen. If you loved 'Shaun of the Dead' or if you like action films, then you are really going to enjoy this.

"eastbergholt2002","9","0","0","2 September 2007"," Funny Movie
","Hot Fuzz is cleverly written and very funny. As with Shaun of the Dead the filmmakers take a Hollywood film genre and transplant into an English setting with weird and unlikely results. On one level it's a send-up of American action movies but it also takes a swipe at the suffocating, boredom of life in a small English village where nothing ever happens. The actors in Hot Fuzz look and talk like very average Englishmen. Hollywood action heroes, by comparison are usually buff, good looking and seem almost super human. The cast's very ordinariness is part of the film's charm, but they can seem out of place in their own movie.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays Nick Angel a London cop with an arrest record so good he makes everyone else in the Met look bad. As a reward, he is promoted and sent to, Sandford, a sleepy, backwater in rural Gloucestershire where there is absolutely no crime. Angel is a loner whose new colleagues resent his zeal and air of superiority. His new partner is an overweight but likable yokel(Nick Frost)who loves American action movies. The village of Sandford has a mysterious secret which Angel gradually uncovers and the film ends with a crazed gun battle involving little old ladies. The cast is excellent with Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward, Steve Coogan, Bill Nigy, Martin Freeman, Jim Broadbent and Billie Whitelaw in scene stealing roles. The film has to be seen to be believed and it's very entertaining."

","If you enjoyed SHAUN OF THE DEAD, you're going to feel an irresistible pull toward HOT FUZZ. Done in similar fashion and with familiar names, Hot Fuzz is an action flick that loves to take jabs at those cop and western films we so loved growing up with. Everything from PALE RIDER (an old Clint Eastwood film) to BAD BOYS is referenced in some fashion, and they will most likely tickle your funny bone.<br/><br/>Instead of deadbeat zombies, though, this time we've got a sleepy little town with a deadly secret. Feeling very STEPFORD WIFE-ish, a highly successful police officer named Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is forced out of his undefeated duties as London cop-extraordinaire and into the dull and mundane town of Sandford. Partnered with the chubby and inept Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), Officer Angel learns to slow down but not before discovering a few strange things about his new town. They've won, every year for some time now, an award for being the best town in England. Not much to argue with there. But Nick Angel soon sees death lurking here and there (and when I say death, I mean scythe and all!) Townsfolk are cut down and the local constabulary simply wave them off as accidents. But to Nick these are NOT plain old mishaps.<br/><br/>A conspiracy theory soon engulfs Nick's solo investigation and we find our lone hero riding a pale horse into town while loaded for bear (queue whistling Eastwood soundtrack here). The big question, though, is can he trust his lame partner, Danny, to back him.<br/><br/>Battles and bloodshed fill the screen as Nick finds himself at odds with everyone in Sandford. From blowing away the clergy to drop-kicking an octogenarian in the face, Nick has his arms, legs and other appendages busy keeping himself alive as much as solving these supposed murders.<br/><br/>There are a ton of great lines in the film, showing that writer/actor Simon Pegg has some significant screen writing abilities (one of my favorite lines was after Nick and Danny watched Bad Boys and Nick said, ""Well, I wouldn't argue that it wasn't a no holds barred, adrenaline fueled thrill ride. But there is no way you can perpetrate that amount of carnage and mayhem and not incur a considerable amount of paperwork."" And I enjoyed Danny's, ""By the power of Greyskull!"" moments, too.) Making parodies of previously serious or scary films seems to be Pegg's and Frost's forte. And they do it exceptionally well. Although I think Shaun of the Dead is the gauge by which their future works will be judged, including this one, I also think they've hit upon something that isn't bathroom humorish like the SCARY MOVIE films/franchise. The dialogue and action fit together well and are meant for those who enjoy their laughter with a little more thought and quite a few in-jokes.<br/><br/>I still hold Shaun of the Dead as a much more entertaining film, but this one rates up there well enough, too."

","Most of the reviews that I've seen that are bashing this movie are doing so because the movie is taking itself seriously enough. Its supposed to be a comedy! THe reason the last 20 minutes of it are so hectic is because they're spoofing buddy cop movies like Bad Boys 2 and Point Break. The extreme gore is also another tool that they use. <br/><br/>I found this movie to be hilariously funny and had absolutely no problem sitting through the whole thing. It seemed to me to equal that of Shaun of the Dead. True, it is a little slower going in the beginning, but if you can have an attention span of more than 5 minutes, I guarantee to you that it picks up and becomes hilariously funny and wildly over the top (in a good way).<br/><br/>Simon Pegg does another wonderful job and while I was used to him as the lazy slob from Shaun of the Dead, he quickly takes on the role of Hero Cop in a quick and believable fashion.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone that is old enough to watch it and to anyone who has time enough to really enjoy themselves"
"marsean9","10","0","0","27 August 2007"," My... Here comes the Fuzz.
","Half of 2007 has been a year fully loaded with Hollywood remakes and sequels that to the extent takes out my excitement in them. Last year I was looking forward to these films but only ended up with Transformers after hearing these bad reviews from my peers. <br/><br/>Well my interest in movies almost faded out until a friend of mine excitedly telling me about this film. I was like ""Ok let's give it a try"" and I thought another waste of my time but I was dead wrong. Since then I found myself watching it numerous times already and it became one of my favorite films of all time. So what's the reason behind I loved this movie? <br/><br/>1) It does not depend on massive CGI overused by films nowadays. 2) No cheesy dialogues. 3) Overall dim-witted style of humor. 4) And finally, I seen two of the funniest actors alive. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (I initially thought Pegg here as a real action star, very convincing). <br/><br/>Nicholas Angel (Pegg) an overachiever Policeman Officer was reassigned right after his promotion when his officials felt he was more of a threat to their own carriers. Soon found himself in a boring village called Sandford, became part of a ragtag police force... umm... service and teamed up to a childlike Police Constable Danny Butterman (Frost). Their differences takes most of the first half of the movie and just turn out to be hilarious. The later part consist of gruesome deaths and action packed gun fights which blended very well with the story line. Also, what I found funny here are the reasons behind the deaths of some locals which are very ridiculous compared to a more logical explanation rendered by Angel (well illogical deaths happen a lot in slasher films... correct me if I'm wrong). Though the film took two hours but the unlikely duo will not disappoint you, their mere presence makes the movie entertaining. Trust me they are enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>For me they totally trashed other promising films this year. Well too many to mention and don't need to enumerate them. The plot if I'm not mistaken is very absurd, too crazy to be true. Though it serves well since its a parody in the first place. But the portrayal of these British actors makes the film believable. They have filled it with so many distinguishable actors that contributed very nicely for the greater good of the film.<br/><br/>Aside from the main characters, my personal favorites if you ask me is the baritone-voiced Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) and the jolly yet creepy Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent... he acts so natural that something in him makes me believe he's my own boss at work). LOL. Only few movies can manage to make likable villains. <br/><br/>This film opened my eyes to British comedies and introduced me to my other favorite movie of all time Shaun of the Dead (which is different by comparison and hilarious in its own right). I was disappointed I just known them recently, so I'm already anticipating to their next project since I heard that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are going to make a follow-up, a Cornetto-Trilogy. Very original. <br/><br/>To sum it up. No doubt this is one of the best movies as far as I can remember and you better not miss this. A classic in the making and will crack you up with laughter. Though you may find it hard to understand British accents but bear with it, you will get used to it and find the humor later after watching it several times and it still comes to be hilarious. Trust me, tested and proved."

","'Hot Fuzz,' ""a new comedy from the guys that created 'Shaun of the Dead,'"" is a side-splitting entry to the buddy-cop action-com genre, which last saw its box office peak with 2003's 'Bad Boys II.' The film works as both an homage to past cop actioners  including 'Dirty Harry,' 'Lethal Weapon,' and most notably 'Point Break' and the aforementioned 'BBII'  and as its own intelligible whodunit account, packed with well-written characters, constant laughs, witty dialogue, and a non-stop twenty-minute gun-slinging finale that'll leave you salivating for more.<br/><br/>Pegg is dealt the role of Nicholas Angel, a London Metropolitan Police Officer, whose dedication and hard work have led to his transfer to London's quite, crime-free countryside village of Sandford. After expressing his displeasure, regarding the transfer, to the Metro Police Service's Chief of Police (Bill Nighy), Angel learns that his reassignment has already been finalized, and finds himself in Sandford by nightfall. Upon arrival, Angel quickly establishes his seriousness about eradicating any and all criminal activity, including the under-aged consumption of alcohol  which has otherwise gone unnoticed or ignored by the village's populace.<br/><br/>Time slowly ticks away for Angel as he finds his most thrilling assignment yet to be the pursuit of a winged escapee (a swan), which he tracks alongside partnered police constable Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, 'Shaun of the Dead'). Over the course of his brief, couple week stint as a Sandford police officer, Angel finds his only friend to be, in reality, Danny, son of Sandford's Chief Inspector Frank Butterman. Though Danny's good intentions seem outweigh his clumsiness as an officer, Nicholas finds him to be quite the annoyance and relishes the moments in which Danny is not bombarding him with silly questions about things that are often insignificant. Nonetheless, after a few beers, the two bond over Nick's past field-action experiences as one of London's finest, and, of course, action movies from Danny's wall-covering collection.<br/><br/>Soon enough, the two movie buddies and partnering officers, along with the whole village of Sandford, are beset by a string of sequential ""accidents"" which have claimed the lives of a handful of its inhabitants. Convinced that these incidents are, in fact, more than just accidents, Sergeant Angel catches much ridicule from the townspeople and colleagues, most noticeably the ""Andys,"" detectives Andrew Cartwright (Rafe Spall) and Andrew Wainwright ('The Bourne Ultimatum''s Paddy Considine). When Angel's most promising suspect, Sandford's local Somerfield supermarket owner, Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), arises, the Sergeant does everything in his power to bring him down. But when Angel is proved to be unsure about his prime suspect, and without any facts or evidence to support his theory, he puts his own safety, and that of his fellow officer, Danny, at risk.<br/><br/>Written by Pegg and director Edgar Wright (both of 2004's 'Shaun'), 'Fuzz' capitalizes on its assumption that any film -even one as absurd as 'HF' - can find monstrous success riding on the back of a dexterously constructed line of characters and a simple, yet brainy script. However, this film surpassed just any level of cleverness, integrating small fixtures within its deftly-crafted main story. Guided by the direction and crafty hand of Wright, and propelled by the hysterical performances of previous collaborators Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, 'Hot Fuzz' makes for this year's biggest surprise and pre-summer's most enjoyable film. Brace yourself, ""here come the Fuzz."""

","I love any kind of comedy and this movie was definitely funny...but it wasn't that funny. This is just one of those movies that has a cult following and people love it more for that reason. If it was a multi million dollar movie and highly advertised not as many people would find it as funny. It has a lot of little moments that are worth a laugh, but I did not find myself hysterically laughing much. The camera work is pretty cool and the cuts are pretty neat. Even if the movie was not a comedy it would still look very good. It is also British which makes it much more funny to listen to foreign actors swear and so forth. The movie is definitely worth a watch, but is is overrated."

","Well, the guys that made Shaun of the Dead did it again with this film. It's not exactly a spoof, but I'd say it's a comic homage/parody to the buddy action genre, much like how Shaun was a comic homage/parody to the zombie genre. And they really studied their source material because the movie references are all over the place.<br/><br/>That makes this an excellent film for people who love movies because if you watch it carefully, it's hard for five minutes to go by without you seeing something relating to another film. Of course, most prominently featured are the two films, Bad Boys II and Point Break. Nonetheless, having seen Bad Boys II once, I could catch bunch of the references, including some shots that are lifted directly out of the film and redone with the crew of Hot Fuzz. Dozens of other movies and television shows are also referenced, but I'm not going to list them all.<br/><br/>Of course, all this referencing isn't always a plus. The Michael Bay-style overflashy montage and editing used early in the film, I feel, really distracts and detracts from the story early on and it doesn't seem to be justified or meaningful. I level this critique against Shaun of the Dead as well as both of these films suffer from out-of-place editing sequences where the movie doesn't require it. It left me searching for meaning that wasn't there.<br/><br/>The film also takes a while to build up. There's a lot of time spend getting to know the characters and the town before things actually go crazy. And it's a little funny and it's cute, but for a little while, I was left wondering why I was watching what I was watching. On the other hand, once the film goes into crazy mode, it takes everything to a whole new level. I've never seen so much combat and gunplay with so many older people before. Some of the moments were laugh out loud and others were just amusing, but the action goes from crazy to crazier and it's all very fun to watch. Because of the way it's written, it doesn't require the same suspension of disbelief that Bad Boys II fails to capture and so it ends up being quite enthralling.<br/><br/>However, despite the wonderful parodying and the enjoyable action-comedy, there's something lacking in this film, and I think it's a matter of heart. The characters do develop and grow and we see glimpses of the same heart that we saw in its predecessor, but it's all been glossed and the film, I think concentrates a little too much on the parody, the action and the comedy and just a tad too little on the relationship between Nick and Danny. That's not to say it's not believable that they are friends, but it's just not the core of the film. I think that's what made Shaun very strong, on top of the comedy and homage. Hot Fuzz doesn't center in on it, more centering on the action and the homage than the buddy and loses a little because of it.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's highly enjoyable, especially for movie lovers and I still recommend it as a high mark in buddy action comedies, even as a parody. 8/10."

In the begging the story of the main actor who was the police officer, explains about his history in 10min quickly and in a comedy way and then how he end up in the old town (non-city area). Then he meet an fat officer who's lazy in his job and these two actor have really good combination of comedy acting. Also in the ""Shawn of the dead"" these two actor have similar role as this movie. Even thou this movie has some cruel violence scenes but it was in funny and not like horrific that you turn your face around :). The enemy were mostly actor of old age, there mind was screwed a bit, but the kids were not the enemy mostly brats..

This is a small little town where the biggest thing to happen is the swan escapes. But soon there appear to be very grisly accidents that Angel is convinced are actually murder. Can he persuade his bumbling staff and new partner to see things his way, and save the day?<br/><br/>I was looking forward to this ever since it was announced. Shaun of the Dead was a hilarious spin on the zombie genre and I really wanted to see what these guys could do with the meandering buddy cop genre. All I can say is bravo. This movie not only was as good as Shaun of the Dead, it surpassed it. <br/><br/>But before I talk about what's wrong with this movie, let me get into it's flaws, because yes, there are some. Mainly, this movie runs two hours long and close to the middle there is a noticeable lag in things happening. The movie really could have used a trim here and there to tighten up the pace of the movie. And that's really the only problem I had with this movie. It was just too long and stretched out.<br/><br/>Now onto everything else. WOW. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have done a completely wonderful job in bringing this movie to life. The characters are all completely three-dimensional, which is something that buddy cop movies lack anyway. In addition to that, Pegg and Nick Frost actually bring some acting to their roles and both handle them well. Pegg was hilarious, even though he was supposed to be the straight-man, in playing the tough by-the-book cop. Frost plays his sidekick role to perfection. And the supporting cast all have their roles to play and they do so wonderfully. <br/><br/>Another thing I loved about this movie? Edgar Wright chooses NOT to go the PC route. There's lots of gore(including a brilliant impaling scene), and the gore itself is almost over the top with how much blood comes from these deaths. In addition to that, we get swearing priests, a mentally-handicapped guy named ""Lurch"" and old ladies get kicked in the head. It's all hilarious and works very well. <br/><br/>The final thirty minutes are great, but would be nothing if not for everything that led to them. With the well-written script and well-acted characters, something else is very present. The use of foreshadowing. Pay attention to things said or done in earlier parts of the movie and it makes it that much better when they are used in that last half hour. Which by the way, is very action packed. I'd argue it's more action-packed and executed better than a lot of the genre fare that is out there today. While also throwing out lots of references to films within this genre(such as Point Break and Bad Boys II). <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is definitely the funniest movie I've seen this year, and it's also a good action movie on top of it. I think we can pretty much agree when Pegg, Wright and Frost work together it's gold. I recommend you see this as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 of *****"
"Thunderbuck","9","0","0","16 May 2007"," VERY, very funny
","HOT FUZZ is a very funny movie, but it works by (mostly) playing it straight. In fact, for the first half of the movie, Simon Pegg makes a fairly credible action hero.<br/><br/>I don't know that I'd call HOT FUZZ a send-up, or a parody, because it does play so straight. I'd call it more of a highly-skewed homage. The plot is negligible, though I've seen worse in mainstream action flicks. The lines are delivered with the same kind of earnest weight you'd see in any number of cop-buddy movies.<br/><br/>The story bogs down for a while in the middle, but that's because it's setting up for the climax. The last 45 minutes of HOT FUZZ is the most brilliant, sustained piece of comedy I can remember.<br/><br/>Yes, it's funnier than SHAUN OF THE DEAD, and probably anything else you're likely to see this year. TOTALLY worth a theatre viewing."
"seawalker","7","0","0","7 May 2007"," Not bad
","I work with a guy who saw ""Hot Fuzz"" at a preview screening. He came into work the next day and announced that it was ""The best comedy of all time!""<br/><br/>Er... No. It's not the best comedy of all time, but it isn't bad. Yes, it is too long, but it's mostly very funny and I thought (blasphemy!) that it is probably better than ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (which also wasn't bad, but not as brilliant as everybody thought it was). A riotous mickey take, especially towards the end, of those high octane action films that we love and loathe. Lots of great cameos (see if you can spot a very well known Australian Oscar winner) and a great supporting cast of British character actors hamming it up. Great soundtrack of British pop music, as well."
"Hint523","8","0","0","6 May 2007"," Fuzzy at first
","Hot Fuzz starts out with laugh out loud joke one after another. By the time the main character has moved into the town, I've laughed at least a dozen times.<br/><br/>The story is about a cop, fuzz, johnny law, whatever you want to call him, whose been reassigned to a small town because he's making everyone ""look bad"" so they put him in the town with the least number of crimes in England. <br/><br/>Soon enough he realizes that all sorts of people are being killed, and while everyone in the town thinks it's all ""accidental"", this guy knows something is up. Slowly he unravels the murders and whose behind it, but still nobody will believe him. Step after step leads to a half an hour shootout where every bloody death you can imagine happens... at least twice. All of a sudden a movie that started out hilarious ends up being way too much gore.<br/><br/>While a lot of the deaths are hilarious, it gets old fast. Wright and Pegg are trying to make an homage, but instead it becomes just like the others: pointless violence. I would have liked to see just comic violence, no blood. THEN it would have been a 10/10.<br/><br/>Still, a good show"
"charchuk","8","0","0","27 April 2007"," Hits the mark much more than it misses
","Despite how much I loved Shaun of the Dead, I had my reservations about seeing the follow-up collaboration, Hot Fuzz. Perhaps it was due to my pure indifference toward high-octane, shoot-em-up action flicks, or perhaps it was just because I couldn't believe that anything could match the brilliance of Shaun. The trailer seemed to confirmed my fears, as it was considerably less funny than I would have hoped for, but once the glowing reviews started rolling in, I was a bit relieved. All of them seemed to say the same thing: it was not as good as Shaun. So, with mild trepidation, I went out and saw Hot Fuzz to judge for myself.<br/><br/>And the result is: I agree. It is not as good as Shaun of the Dead, though that may be for a couple of reasons: I was expecting it not to be, Shaun took me a few viewings to fully appreciate its brilliance, or perhaps its just my lack of outright love for action flicks. Whatever the case, I still found it to pale in comparison to the brilliant zom-rom-com (or is it rom-zom-com?). Do not take this as a sign that the film is bad; quite to the contrary, it's one of the funniest films I've seen. It just was missing something. All of the ingredients were there: same director, same writers, same leading duo, same style of humour. So what went wrong? I suspect that it tripped over its plot. The story of Shaun was simple: it merely re-told the tale of every other zombie movie from the past 40 years; a relatively easy plot to follow. It just added its own spice to it. The problem with Hot Fuzz is that it gets too caught up in trying to tell its story that it forgets to make the audience laugh. As the mystery is solved about 2/3 of the way through  complete with a scene that made me remember The Da Vinci Code, whether intentional or not  the tone sharply turns from light to dark. The characters have been developed so well that it seems like almost a cheat to the audience to treat them this way. Thankfully, all is not as it seems, and the film soon redeems itself with a fantastic ending. But that section in the middle was enough for me to downgrade the grade, if it was only a brief hiccough.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is absolutely terrific, though. Apart from a slightly awkward opening scene, the laughs are fast and furious, obvious and sly, dirty and dirtier. The cast of characters are so insanely colourful and yet somehow real; they're funny without being stupid. From the dirty-mouthed female cop to the asshole pair of detectives to the dastardly evil supermarket owner, every character has their moment in the sun and shines. The evolution of the relationship between the two leads feels real and yet somehow still manages to mock the typical buddy cop dynamic of most action flicks; like Shaun it mocks the genre in a loving way, paying homage to its roots while still laughing at them. The nods to other films aren't as apparent as in Shaun  perhaps that's due to my own relative inexperience with the action genre, though  but a few notable ones  Point Break  are not only obvious but embraced. The stunning death scenes are available in all their gory detail; in fact, I was so blown away by the death scenes that I will devote an entire paragraph to them.<br/><br/>The first death scene starts off normal enough: a killer cuts off the heads of his victims. But what happens next  the staging of the scene  is what blew me away. Two decapitated heads lie in the middle of a road; the town welcome sign stands crooked a few feet away, bloodied on the bottom and hopelessly mashed; a topless convertible sits perched over an embankment beyond it, showing the signs of an obvious accident, two headless corpses sitting in the front seats. In a comedy, it was stunning to see such a viciously gory and horrific accident scene  but it made me laugh. The second death is a mere house explosion, but the third death has to be the single most gruesome effect I've ever seen. A man has his head literally replaced by a giant cornerstone. To see it is to believe it. It must be witnessed.<br/><br/>All in all, Hot Fuzz is another worthy addition to the comedy subgenre of loving spoofs that includes Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and, of course, Shaun of the Dead. It doesn't quite measure up to those two, mostly due to the problems with the plot. Though the mystery was interesting, the payoff left something to be desired. Apart from that, the film is a hilarious take-off on the action genre, at once both acknowledging and ridiculing the influence of shoot-em-up flicks, and certainly should not be missed. And definitely should be seen twice."

","From the guys that brought you Shaun Of The Dead(2004), comes a cop comedy that takes goofy stabs at Lethal Weapon(1986), Point Break(1991), and Bad Boys(1995). But I like the way this movie didn't try to be an overly goofy spoof like Date Movie(2005), and Epic Movie(2006). It tries to make a certain story out of it, then the spoof parts are added in. It begins with Londons top cop named Nicholas Angel(Simon Pegg), who is transferred because he is to good at his job,(O'h boy what a reason that is). He is transferred to a small town were not much happens, Although Nick does not like it, he tries to make the best out of the situation. He is paired with Blissfully ignorant cop named Danny Butterman(Nick Frost). Then a few deaths start happening, Nick thinks there murders, but everybody else says there accidents. Will Nick ever prove it. An enjoyable comedy, believe me you'll laugh your head off."
"DarthPaul85","8","0","0","25 April 2007"," Well done, a true successor to Shawn of the Dead.
","I was anxious to see this film, but I had my doubts. Shawn of the Dead was great, but it also had a much better premise. Would a ""cop film"" really have as much potential as a ""zombie film""? Read on...<br/><br/>Within the first few minutes of the film, Shawn of the Dead (SOTD) fans will be reassured. The cinematography, dry wit, and occasional sight gags are all in full force. <br/><br/>Arguably, this is a ""funnier"" film than SOTD. There's the dry wit and some citchy dialogue, but there's also a lot more direct laughs and ""just over the top enough"" scenes. The cinematography is used to an even greater extent for humor, and usually successfully. Also, this movie has something SOTD lacked: a great villain. Timothy Dalton is, hands-down, one of the funniest parts of this movie. And that's saying a lot. <br/><br/>However, this movie is far from the perfect comedy. Pacing is an issue, especially in the down scenes. It wouldn't be so bad, but the movie's ever-present quick-cut style of editing (the exact same from SOTD) gives us the impression the down scenes are supposed to be funny. This, for me, made some of them feel longer and almost forced. <br/><br/>The characters are also a bit lacking in this movie. There are exceptions...Timothy Dalton really is great, Pegg does a GREAT job, showing he can really act. Frost is somewhat endearing. Other than that, WE DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY. SOTD definitely wins out for realistic and identifiable characters. I hate to complain about this because all the actors do a fine job, but the characters feel more appropriate to a farce than a satire. One interesting character (Pegg) isn't enough. <br/><br/>My last complaint...the plot really is rather thin. Again, it's not about the plot, it's about making fun of the plot. Still, the movie has to explain so much and it's actually rather long. Since this movie is a satire/parody, there's nothing that original or fresh about the plot...so when there's a break from the comedy, there's little to fall back on.<br/><br/>But, this movie's triumphs are greater than its faults. The jokes are mostly spot-on, the main characters are quite funny, and...without giving too much away, this movie has some of the most satisfying action/comedy scenes since Army of Darkness. I wouldn't say it's going to be a classic, but it's definitely two hours well spent."

","On a breezy New York night on April 21, I had the opportunity to go to the movies to go see Hot Fuzz, the long awaited follow up to Edgar Wright's smash hit film Shaun of the Dead. Not only is this film here but it delivers way more than you would expect. Hot Fuzz does something many films cant do, and that is to make an absolutely ridiculous idea and make it into a clever comedic action flick that deserves its recognition. Not only was this film absolutely surprisingly superb, but I didn't have the intention that this would be just as good as Shaun of the Dead. The direction in the film is all that you'd want from Edgar showcasing all the hilarious and action packed scenes, especially his patent lighting fast paced editing, that make this movie so great. The cast too is just brilliant, with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Bill Nighly you just can not go wrong. Very action packed film, a few gory scenes (a trademark perhaps of Wright), and some twists and turns. This truly is the BEST film you will see right now and you will definitely get your moneys worth. Highly recommended!! Congrats again to Edgar Wright for making such terrific films and to the excellent cast including the superb chemistry by Pegg and Frost. Keep up the good work and looking forward to more of Edgar's work.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. Amazing, Hilarious, Out of your Seat FUN!!! P.S. I also recommend the brilliant satirical zombie flick Shaun of the Dead, which also was directed by Edgar Wright."

","This was a very slow buildup. The attention to detail was lovingly done and it showed in the dialogue, editing, and so many other subtleties. The creative geniuouses of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg allow the movie to use time honored techniques of lulling the audience into a false sense of calm and great foreshadowing to bring it on in the second ""act"" and they don't stop until the ride is over. The momentum lasts and lasts... This movie is NOT for Children. I saw the sneak preview last week and to families had brought 5year olds up to young teens. There is a great deal of vulgar language and horrific blood and guts events that will scar a childs mind for a long time to come. So please if your reading this, excersize good judgement and leave the kiddies at home!

","Having had a lovely valentines day meal, i was looking for something to finish the night off. We ventured around London looking for somewhere showing Hot Fuzz but to no avail, everything was fully booked!! Then we happened upon an out of the way cinema with plenty of tickets available and what a bit of luck we did! From the outset, i should point out that there are obvious comparisons between this and Shaun of the dead, the main characters and the director being the most obvious. However where Shaun of the dead was rather a niche subject, Hot Fuzz has a subject which will appeal to the masses. The jokes are all spot on, some are visual, some are one liners and some are whole sequences which will have you in fits of laughter. The film begins slowly as a London policeman adapts to a new life in the country, but before long things start to hot up as everything isn't quite what it seems. The movie moves along at a perfect pace and there are some fantastic characters involved. The film actually has a slightly eerie feel to it and the last 25 minutes is an out-and-out gun fest. I would highly recommend this to anyone with an ounce of humour or who enjoys cop/action movies - a must see film!!"

","Am I the only person who has seen this film and found it hugely over-rated? The overall impression I had was of a film that is not nearly as amusing nor as slick as it thinks it is. The makers have created a very smug movie that positively challenges its audience not to go along for the ride and get taken in by the sharp editing which makes you think you are seeing and hearing more than you actually do. In fact the special effects are just about passable, the shoot 'em up near the end tedious and the soundtrack nothing more than the usual crash - bang excesses that every 'action' movie has to have nowadays. Clearly appealing purely to the juvenile market, 'Hot Fuzz' is also some 30 minutes too long. What a bore."

Despite this, the movie is stuffed with great gags, fantastic details and marvellous performances, so I'm sure will repay re-viewing.<br/><br/>I think there were possibly too many characters in this, so the middle third gets a little bogged down, and a lot of the editing and sound effects which worked wonderfully in the 'Z' movie didn't translate to this genre quite so well.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, highly recommended."

The cast for the film was good, but it failed to help rescue this film, A highlight in the film was Steve Coogan's 30second appearance and there was one funny bit in this movie i remember which was the bit where the fat guy says a girl has been fingered and Simon Peggi spits out the cranberry juice!

","I honestly believe that the makers of this film should be sued for false advertising. Every major commercial and ad out there makes Hot Fuzz out to be a comedy, but surprisingly enough, it isn't. In fact, there's barely any humor in here. Most of the film is an apparent murder mystery that turns into this huge town conspiracy/cover-up thing, and it's actually taken in very dark and not at all humorous tone. It's sort of ironic: Transformers never took itself seriously at all (and Spider-Man 3 not very much for that matter), while this wound up taking itself so seriously it forgot to be fun or humorous, as if the director up and decided he'd actually rather be making a very dour, grim and gritty film rather than a light-hearted romp like the trailer shows. If the rest of Edgar Wright's films are like this, I don't want to bother with another one. I want a comedy that's supposed to be a comedy, not a drama that's supposed to be a comedy."

","It seems I've been one of the few people on this planet who watched HF but id not (yet) see Shaun of the Dead. Maybe that's a good thing, not being drawn to this whole Pegg/Wright hype. This movie is not all bad. It just seems to be missing the point. One hour into the movie I asked myself: ""What could possibly follow up now that lasts for another 55 minutes?"", and the answer was simple: Nothing! While I loved the slow paced, intimate and subtly comic first part, I just hated the second splattery, action-packed, ""oh-lets-parody-blockbusters""y part. The transition between the parts is so harsh, that I was thinking ""What? Are you serious?"" for some minutes. Guns ablaze, I finally got that that's it, this is how this story ends. Felt a lot like ""KOPS"", which is funny for five minutes, but then ceases to be so. I'm glad I watched HF on DVD and got something to do while watching it....<br/><br/>So let's go into detail. The movie starts off with a who-is-who of British comedy. I loved Pegg in Spaced, one of the reasons while I rented this movie, and in the first minutes, Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan unexpectedly show up. Wow! And then, there's Bill Bailey, the brilliant ""Manny"" from Black Books, and lots of other familiar faces. What can possibly go wrong? A lot! But let's see to that later. The gory scenes in the beginning are shown in unnecessary detail, but that's just my opinion, might work for others, but I think it's doing absolutely nothing for the story, the feel of the movie, or anything else. Maybe it's just a pointer to what to expect in the second half, to lower expectations, and I wish I had lowered my expectations, so I might have enjoyed the second half. The characters are being established quite well, it's a real treat to see the cop from the city trying to settle in the rural environment. Not that it's not been before, but there are some ideas that make it stand out against the rest. The relationship between the protagonist (Pegg) and his sidekick (Frost) is drawn very well, sometimes a little cheesy, but other times just brilliantly, so that's OK. A lot of stereotypes appear, but that's not so bad, as they fit well into the whole feel of the movie and just add to the atmosphere, just like props do. So what are we looking at in the second half: The revelation of the whole conspiracy is somewhat funny, but it's much more ridiculous. After having a decent story line, characters you can relate to, it abruptly lays all these burdens of decent movie-making down to become a parody - of ""Bad Boys"" - of the worst kind. The main characters are pressed into blocky stereotypes (and this time, the bad type). This insight does not arise from my vast knowledge of movies (I did not see any of the Bad Boys films, Michael Bay, you know...) but from the constant shoving of the DVD-Case or the Movie itself in my face during the first part. I mean, what is the point in parody, when you have to explicitly say what you are going to parody? The whole ""Point Blank"" thing, for example, mentioning it THAT often, even showing the original scene, is just pathetic! This is the cheapest and worst way of parody, and there's much better material on parodies out there. The finale, trying to be somewhat sentimental, just does not fit after the 40 or 50 minutes of the before mentioned style and so fails miserably. <br/><br/>My advice: Watch the first half, then pause, get considerably drunk, and then watch the rest, this might turn this movies into a great experience."

But just when things start getting interesting again, Nick starts to discover a truth more baffling than even he could imagine.<br/><br/>As a much better reviewer than me has already said, it's unfortunate that Hot Fuzz came out in a week when gun crime had hit the headlines of British newspapers in a manner unprecedented to anything seen before. Even for a film setting out to parody Hollywood action movies and the British mentality to gun violence, many probably thought it in bad taste after the week's shocking events. Still, it doesn't seem to have hurt it's box office performance too badly, being the second film from writer/star comedy duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost after the over-rated but highly successful Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>As I've already said, it's setting out to send up Hollywood action films and simultaneously mocking the British response to this way of life. I did snigger a few times but I can't say there was anything that really made me explode with laughter. It's more successful as an affectionate tribute to the films it's setting out to take the p*ss out of, beaming through with Frost's character passionately singing the virtues of such films as Bad Boys II and Point Break, just two from his over-flowing library of such films.<br/><br/>The film does well performances wise. Pegg is actually really quite convincing as a hard, no nonsense policeman, even though he's playing it for laughs, whilst Frost is great fun in the support role, eagerly and joyfully trying to emulate his big city partner to great effect. As the villain, Dalton's far more restrained than his days where he played James Bond, although it's safe to say he'll now be typecast forever in this dastardly English villain role. And there's also a nice supporting appearance from Jim Broadbent, content to play a secondary character in spite of his wider recognition now.<br/><br/>I'd liked to have laughed a bit more, but I can't say I didn't have some nice fun with this film. More than I was expecting after the disappointment after the hype of SOTD. ****"

","Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a tough cop who is transferred to a small town to join the police force over there. However, he is paired with a goofy cop, by the name of Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) and both of them and the police force start discovering some very bizarre murders and events in the small town which could all be related.<br/><br/>HOT FUZZ is a lot like SHAUN OF THE DEAD. No...wait, let me just correct myself. It's A LOT better than SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It's got more laughs, it's more action packed and it's fantastic popcorn fun. I promise you, HOT FUZZ should definitely be considered as one of the most entertaining and funniest films of all-time.

","With the cinemas being flooded with a bunch of pathetic comedies (Norbit and Epic Movie to name a few) it is a true relief to see a comedy that is actually funny. The more surprising thing is that has a great story, hilarious actors and it is very clever. Much like Shaun of the Dead was (kind of) spoofing zombie movies, Hot Fuzz is spoofing action/cop movies and like Shaun, it does it really, really well.<br/><br/>Nick Angel (Simon Pegg) is the perfect cop. With an arrest record 400% higher than any of his other colleagues and top in his graduating class you would think the police force would want him around. Instead they ship him off to Sandford, a crime free village. But of course not is all what it seems. A series of grisly ""accidents"" have been occurring lately and Nick suspects foul play so he teams up with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) to uncover the town's secret.<br/><br/>The Shaun team know how to make comedy. They blend witty humour with slapstick and spoof and they produce one of the funniest movies I've seen for some time. From start to finish it's non-stop laughs. The only thing that really lets this movie down is the poor usage of CGI when it came to the deaths. It was too obvious and at times really laughable. But that does not ruin the entire movie as this is probably one of the best comedies that will be released this year.<br/><br/>4½/5"

","I went to see this film on the back of all the hype. Friends had seen it and said it was funny and there was so much built-up about it that I presumed it was going to be a huge disappointment. I was expecting the script to be trying too hard for laughs and lots of cliché slapstick and double-entendres that you usually get from a Brit comedy. Plus, I thought Shaun of the Dead was good but not great so I wasn't expecting to be blown away quite as much as I was.<br/><br/>I'm glad to say that these worries were laid to rest and it's probably the most entertaining movie I've ever sat through in the cinema. It was witty but fresh and original. It had *proper* action scenes that usually belong in a Hollywood action film, not in a Brit comedy/wannabe action film. And most importantly, the plot was well written, the dialogue sharp and clever and the acting top-notch from some well-known faces.<br/><br/>Pegg and Wright are genius!"
"TajMahal2000","8","2","5","6 March 2007"," Great film but spare us the bloody scenes
","Simon Pegg plays a London cop who is dispatched to a Gloucestershire village because his great talent and high arrest record puts his fellow officers to shame. He immediately clashes with the residents of this 'sleepy' village who take exception to his style, meddling and eagerness to prove that the growing body count is the job of a serial killer and not just an accident. Pegg is both charismatic and fun to watch as the tense cop who takes his work very seriously, unlike his dim side kick played by Edgar Wright, who is also one of the funniest characters in the film. This is an enjoyable story, particularly the last 40 minutes or so when the tide turns against the village cult and the real gunfight action kicks in. The only thing I didn't like about this film was the gory & bloody scenes that came with each murder. Seeing someone's head being crashed like a watermelon by falling church masonry is not in the least bit amusing to me. I am normally against film censorship but in this case I would happily opt for a 'cleaned up' DVD version."

With supporting cast from an old Bond in Timothy Dalton is surprisingly fun to watch. The direction and production is top notch. I found it to be have quite a dark atmosphere about it but maybe thats just because i find quiet country villages quite disturbing, and by the end of this film you might know what i mean! I found the plot a tad predictable but the twist at the end and all the antics leading to the climax certainly keep you entertained and laughing out loud.

"spartacus533","9","2","5","19 February 2007"," Bring on the noise... it's the Fuzz
","In 2004, Hollywood unknowns Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Ed Wright burst onto the scene with Shaun of the Dead, which despite being more or less a one-joke film stretched over 90-odd minutes (admit it!), was a critical success and a minor box-office one. Now, armed with a bigger budget, bigger cast and a huge lot of pressure in following up their hit is Hot Fuzz, which tries to do for the Met Police what Hollywood Actioners do for the LAPD etc. So, the big question on everyone's lips was, how do you follow up a film like Shaun of the Dead? Answer, with a film like Hot Fuzz, because, no ifs or buts, Hot Fuzz is the most refreshing and stylish British movie of recent years. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg is Sgt. Nicholas Angel, a police officer who is freakishly good at his job. When his chief Inspector, played by Bill Nighy sends him away to a remote village in the rural countryside for making the rest of the force 'look bad, Angel arrives with little enthusiasm, and expects to be bored out of his skull. Paired with the witless but lovable movie-buff PC Danny Butterman, and the most cynical yet clueless police force imaginable, Angel's job takes a turn for the bizarre when a series of bizarre accidents lead him to believe that there is a masked murderer on the loose... but why is everyone in the village quick to blast his theory? <br/><br/>As you would expect from the writer and director of Spaced, Ed Wright creates a very bizarre setting for his two leads, Pegg and Frost, to act out in. The village of Sanford is just a little too perfect, and all the residents, including a standout Timothy Dalton as a slimy Supermarket owner, fit the bill as creepy villagers who are obviously hiding a dark secret. Simon Pegg is convincing as Nicholas Angel, the ""perfect"" cop who is practically idolised by Frost's Butterman, who clearly yearns for the chance to, in his words, ""jump through the air while shooting with a gun in each hand"". The film is edited in a tricksy-Hollywood style, which is overloaded in the first half on the film, before becoming more acceptable. The action is frantic and highly credible considering the clumsily handled zombie raids of Shaun by the same director, and the $7 million budget is wisely spent, with well-choreographed shootouts and even the odd explosion. Humourwise, it is on par with Shaun, and I guarantee that you will need the Hiemlich manoeuvre to wretch out the popcorn when Angel fly-kicks an elderly woman in the face. <br/><br/>Saying that however, Ed Wright is no Michael Bay, and the one car chase of the movie is short lived and looks like something directly out of ""The Bill"", save for great comic timing from... a swan. For an action film, the shootout is relatively blood-less, almost all of the film's gore coming from the surprisingly graphic murder scenes and an injury sustained in the film's (anti)-climax, although even it is handled in a comic way.... which is the film's other low point. The film just can't take itself seriously enough to handle some of the darker moments. Although there are times when Pegg and Frost really consider themselves action stars, some of the shootouts could have been improved had Wright decided to inject a little more seriousness in them. Save for a brief scene at the end, you never once doubt that the pair will survive. But these are minor niggles in an other-wise hilarious movie. If Ed Wright can make the Met Police look this cool, then there's really no stopping him. <br/><br/>Verdict: Matching Shaun of the Dead in humour and enjoyment, this is funny, action-packed and the most enjoyable cinematic outing so far this year. 4.5/5"
"stu_mclachlan","7","2","5","18 February 2007"," Phomenal fun
","Not landmark cinema, not a cultural milestone, but as a ""cut above the rest"" film, Hot Fuzz is great.<br/><br/>The film's basically a buddy cop movie with the very British twist of a seemingly pleasant village in the English countryside. The humour, as with Shaun of the dead, just keeps on coming. The dialogue, whilst not quite as snappy as in Shaun of the Dead, was excellent.There's a superb balance between subtle/in-your-face comedy, and between seriousness/silliness. On the serious note, there are a couple of mildly scary scenes, and a couple of extremely gory moments, especially one hysterically violent moment involving a church wall that had me in stitches. The action sequences, too, are superb, and this kind of multi-tasking from the creators was very refreshing. The final shoot-out is great fun.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Simon Pegg once again proves that he is a hugely capable actor. The whole cast was perfect.<br/><br/>So, Hot Fuzz. It's the kind of film Snakes on a Plane should've been. Whilst both films are hugely enjoyable, Hot Fuzz is just more polished on every level, and definitely one I'll be seeing again. Not Godard, but far, far above all the sub-standard bull that's clogging up cinemas today."
"iKickstand","7","2","5","6 February 2007"," First a Rom-Zom-Com, now an action-comedy?
","I saw this film last night at a preview screening at the vue cinema in Romford.<br/><br/>I must admit I was a little worried about the movie, during the first 10 minutes. There are surprisingly few laughs at the start of the film which may put some people off or cause people to expect the worst. Thankfully it does pick up soon enough though.<br/><br/>Being a fan of Simon's, Nicks and Edgars previous work, it is impossible to not compare this to Shaun or Spaced. And although Fuzz only really shines in the second half, and I don't feel this film had as many quotable one-lines as SOTD, it does have very funny parts. Nick Frost is great as usual, and plays a very different & unique character then Ed or Mike. I did feel Pegg's character was maybe a bit too serious though, as most of the comedy was left to the village supporting characters (played by a lot of Britain's comedy stars).<br/><br/>I think the biggest surprise was how good the action element was in the last section of the film. It really was as good as any other action film around these days, and left me wondering if Hot Fuzz was intended to primarily be an action or comedy film.<br/><br/>One word of warning for anyone young planning on seeing the movie: some of the murder scenes are a bit gruesome. But nothing worse then in shaun.<br/><br/>Overall a very good British comedy film,, and nice follow up to Shaun of the dead. I would gladly go again Now I just wish the guys would get on with spaced series 3!"

","It was obvious that we wanted more from the makers of Shaun of the Dead, and we definitely got a film that was just as (if not more) funny, from director Edgar Wright. Basically it starts with the successful career of Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), but instead of being promoted to London officer, he is being transferred to the crime-free village of Sandford. There he is partnered with PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, Pegg's best friend), a huge action movie fan and son of Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny wants the chance to get into the type of action Nick has seen, but the village if the wrong place Nick believes. But that will soon change when after a while of solving small minor crimes and problems, there is a hooded murderer in the town. When Nick and Danny find their suspect, Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), they find out is more than one more man. It is pretty much every character Nick met over the few months, and they just want to win Best Village in Britain. Also starring a great British cast, Kevin Eldon as Sergeant Tony Fisher, Paddy Considine as DS Andy Wainwright, Rafe Spall as DC Andy Cartwright, Peep Show and Green Wing's Olivia Colman as PC Doris Thatcher, Karl Johnson as PC Bob Walker, The Wicker Man's Edward Woodward as Tom Weaver, Billie Whitelaw as Joyce Cooper, Bill Nighy as Met Chief Inspector, Bill Bailey as Sergeant Turner, Steve Coogan as Metropolitan Police Inspector, Martin Freeman as Metropolitan Police Sergeant, Anne Reid as Leslie Tiller and Stephen Merchant as Peter Ian Staker. The highlights for me are the huge gun fight and chases towards the end with Pegg and Frost vs. pretty much everyone in the town. This film will obviously be a big hit with British cops, it makes them look cool, and it makes me proud to be British. Very good!"

"theoldinhabitants","5","2","6","28 May 2009"," I guess I don't get it.
","I tend to agree somewhat with most of the ratings I see here. Bad Hollywood action movies get something like 4 stars - likely because there are enough tasteful people like me that drop a 2 star rating on them and pull them down closer to where they deserve to be. And likewise, there are enough tasteful people giving films such as City of God 9 or 10 stars, lifting them up closer to where they deserve to be. But for once I've stumbled upon a rating I simply can't understand. 8? Seriously? This film gets an 8? How about Burn After Reading for a dark comedy that ACTUALLY deserves an 8. I've never entered a comment on this site before but now I feel I must: Apparently this is a parody of Hollywood action movies. The problem is, there's nothing funny about it. This film is EXACTLY like a bad Hollywood action movie. Exactly. I may have well watched The Fast and the Furious; I would have been just as bored. This film was so close to the real deal that I was at least a half hour into the film before I realized that perhaps it's just a bit TOO ridiculous and could be a parody. Very difficult to make it through this one. I couldn't wait for it to end, but of course just when you think the last bad guy is gone, yet another bad guy pops out of the woodwork for one last over-the-top action scene - JUST like the real thing. They PURPOSELY made a bad film that goes on for 2 hours. And that's supposed to be the joke. But what's the point of that? You could have made that point in a ten minute comedy-sketch. No bad film deserves 8 stars - even if it did an outstanding job of being intentionally bad.<br/><br/>I've never seen The Fast and the Furious but I'm pretty sure I would have given it something like 2 stars. I gave this one a 3-star bonus just for making fun of a genre that deserves to be made fun of, so it gets 5 stars from me."

","It wasn't bad, just disappointing. The basic story was good and it had some nice funny bits, but overall the characters and story didn't work for me the way they did in Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>Shaun was very funny AND serious. The bit where he shoots his mum and the end with Ed were actually moving. Also, the pacing, framing and choice of music were bloody perfection. No matter how funny it got, i believed the characters, their actions and what was happening in the story. I was involved! Hot Fuzz never really made me believe in that world and the story taking place. It was mainly just silly. It had holes the size of my socks and i didn't think all the characters worked. I thought it was a bit of a mess. A fun mess, but i was hoping for a movie that got to me more than just a few laughs.<br/><br/>And it reminded me WHY i hate movies from directors like Michael Bay. The action scenes were not done with a great deal of thought or cinematic feel. Just - get a lot of camera's running + shake them about a bit + cut it together in a pace were no shot can be seen longer then a second + add to that a loud soundtrack = and you have yourself an action scene. I HATE THIS! This is not John Woo style (or even Rodriguez).<br/><br/>I expected better choreographed visual action sequences from a guy like Edgar wright and a better story+characters from the guys that brought us Shaun of the Dead."

In fact I'm only just over 'the night that was' now, forty eight hours since it all started. Enough of my personal problems. Though I must share with you one of my shortcomings before I proceed any further. I am not at all familiar with the work of Mr Pegg and Mr Wright. So I was going into this film with no perception of quite what to expect. A lot like the whole of the rest of the weekend for that matter.<br/><br/>We both arrived somewhat dazed at the cinema just as the opening trailers started to roll so by time we queued and stocked up on sugary products and popcorn in order to rejuvenate our somewhat flagging serotonin levels we strolled in to find our seats midway through the last ad just in time to see the BBFC's certification of the picture flash up on screen. I know this bothers a lot of people, even me on occasions, but for an afternoon screening in our local cinema this kind of behaviour is recommended in order not to have to endure the drollery of the hooded mass that makes up Southampton's Hoodie clad Chav 'maseve'.<br/><br/>On with the show! I found the film absolutely enthralling. I could identify with Pegg's character through out as I too can be something of the perfectionist. That's all I'll say about the plot. The humour I must admit I found rather accommodating. (I lied earlier when I sad I was unfamiliar with their work, I once saw twenty minutes of a episode of Spaced and didn't think too much of it).<br/><br/>Both my buddy and I are quite the closet film geeks so we were throughout able to fill in the gaps in each other's knowledge. And we felt rather superior as we roared with laughter and applauded as the Chav mass around us stared blankly into their mobile phones. Despite this the uncouth behaviour of our fellow movie goers there was only one rude interruption when the cinema's fire alarm was tripped. My buddy suggested tearing the place up. But I told him I was too hung-over and that he probably was too. So he ran (as best he could) off to the lobby for more fizzy pop.<br/><br/>After this crude interruption the film rolled on. The second half having even more action and laughs than first. So much so I almost had to leave the theatre. My nausea almost getting the better of me. But I endured. With gritted teeth and tears of delight running down my face as the film unfolded before my eyes.<br/><br/>Seriously film fans, go see it But, not with a hangover."

The cinematography and editing are fantastic, pulling you into the movie and making you want to watch more and more.<br/><br/>This is the best cop movie I have ever seen. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost kill it as the two leads, but all of the actors are fantastic. You can tell how much thought went into the casting, as there are even easter eggs throughout the movie relating to why certain people were cast. These subtle details are a perfect example of why this movie is so great. Everything was planned perfectly, down to the most minute detail.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is the writing. Unlike many movies, there is not a single line of dialogue in this movie that goes to waste. Every single line in this movie from every character either foreshadows something in the future or calls back to something previous in the movie. It's pure genius, and it makes this movie infinitely re-watchable. There are so many details, secrets, and easter eggs to keep an eye out for that you will pick up something new every time you watch the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is not just a hilarious buddy cop movie. Every detail of this movie was intricately planned for maximum effect, so even if you took out all the comedy from this movie, it would still be fantastic.

Instead of having the normal boring cop movies, this one brought a different approach to the table as you followed Simon Pegg. He is a cop that does his job too good for anyone to like or want him to be apart of their team. About half way through the movie it seems to add in a horror streak to the film, mixed in with mystery and action, while still keeping the show light. Making you wonder, what genre does this movie fit into?<br/><br/>The relationship between Nicholas Angel and PC Danny Butterman was written quite well. It was far from the usual cop partner relationship that is showed in most films, instead of having Butterman as a stupid cop who can never do anything right, he's just a normal guy trying to honestly do better. Even though there's very little back story to the characters and no normal romance thrown in there, it made the movie enjoyable because it was out of the ""Ordinary"" expectations."
"Offworld_Colony","10","1","2","7 February 2020"," How do you follow up Shaun of the Dead?
","With a budget busting send up of all things action, with a positive skew to our good old boys in blue, and all the silliness of a small village Agatha Christie, Hot Fuzz is easily the most quotable, most detailed and most flat out fun of the Cornetto Trilogy. Is it my favourite? Not by a long shot, but it's hard not to admire a send up of Bad Boys 2 that also manages to be completely its own beast.
Hot Fuzz is so densely packed that it's hard not to appreciate a new gag each time; and although it doesn't quite have the timing and pacing and quality of gags and lines and character that Shaun did, its reverence of the en vogue action films of the time is enough to allow it to shine.
Also very much timeless and a product of its time. It seems Edgar Wright is a talent in this department.
The film that put Simon Pegg on the map as a real credible action/comedy/dramatic star. A film that sometimes buckles under its own bloated complex and layered plot, and its myriad of influences not least of all Wicker-Man horror, Broadchurch style provincial Brit crime mystery, Man on Fire acid action flicks and Michael Bay excess.
It's got broad, British gags, some absolutely blinding acting and line readings, perfect parody/homage, and tight jokes that make up for the fact that Wright struggles against the budget and his still-youthful directing style and forms a choppy and overlong but still robust and entirely entertaining film of silliness."

He's so good that his higher uppers send him to peaceful Sandford in order to receive less professional embarrassment on their part. In Sandford, Nick meets Danny (Nick Frost), an overweight, lazy officer and proprietor of American action films like Point Blank and Bad Boys 2 (not the original, mind you, but part 2). In the meantime, odd ""accidental"" deaths unfold in the small town, and Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), the town magnate, is a possible suspect.<br/><br/>Cop meets cop, expert meets sloth. The two unlikely cop-buddies will form another cinematic duo against corruption in a city that last complained of a runaway goose. What is pro-cop Angel to do with his spare time? It is an understatement when I say the gags smack you in the face. The moment you laugh at the first one-liner, bloody action – both literal and metaphorical – hits the screen as if you're watching a sneak peak of the new Die Hard film. To add to the fun, current British marvels, Steve Coogan, Jim Broadbent, and Bill Nighy, do what they know best – make fools of themselves.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, and you're up for some slapstick, you will surely enjoy the Fuzz. It may push in 34 minutes more than Airplane!, but I encourage you to wait until the last 10. You'll be laughing over your next order of fish and chips!"
"axel-koch","6","1","2","20 April 2014"," Too silly for its own good, but still quite an amusing and entertaining follow-up to Shaun of the Dead
","Trading a zombie invasion with a small town killing spree, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are still the ones to save the day in the Brit comedians' follow-up to Shaun of the Dead. But though maintaining a steady rate of laughs, Hot Fuzz doesn't continue all of its predecessor's filmmaking virtues and is not all too much more than an average comedy.<br/><br/>It's most obvious over all of the film's exorbitant two hours of running time that its cast and crew were having a whale of a time shooting the ridiculous action and dialogue scenes, between which the buddy cop spoof alternates, and that fun is transmitted to the audience in most films. However, Hot Fuzz feels silly and over the top in right about every frame and, no matter how unserious Pegg, Frost, and co. were when on set, the picture shown on screen doesn't seem like a parody at all, but like a comedy using all the idiotic elements of bad action or crime films for their own project and one, that doesn't sarcastically comment the moronic events happening but acceptingly lets them go by. In a picture of regular length, the imbalance between actual jokes and unwitty physical humour wouldn't have carried that much weight, only Hot Fuzz isn't a picture of regular length and, without any exaggeration, spends its complete final half of an hour on the latter sort of comedic entertainment, of which I am the least bit fond of.<br/><br/>When it comes to the real gags though, the second part of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy highly pays off and likely (I didn't keep a list) induces more snorts of laughter than both of the other two. Each and every one of the innumerable cameos of famous British thespians is superb to see and the film's running gags and grotesquely gruesome homicides are easily one of the best of their sorts of all comedies out there, and thus fully making up for the storytelling flaws and enabling a perfectly entertaining and intelligently funny movie night – just not a very perfect or intelligent movie."
"skfla500","9","1","2","14 April 2011"," Great but a little tooooo LONG
","I love dry humor and this definitely has it. I started laughing immediately & kept laughing for quite a while. And I think most people will also see the humor. There are constant ongoing situations and lines that are keepers. But the movie really was 40-50 minutes to long. Too much of a good thing. If your viewing this for a guys night, try to break it up into 2 or 3 sittings/nites. If just renting, try to force yourself to stop after about 40-45 minutes. Catch the rest the next night. I think you'll enjoy the humor even more. This would have definitely worked as a two or three part BBC show but of course the budget probably exceeded most tele shows. I give the movie a 6 rating solely because by the middle/end I was almost numb to the humor-although it was still funny (""...nothing like some girl on girl action!""). Break the show up into two parts and I'd give it an solid 8 or more."
"NaiOni","10","1","2","4 April 2011"," One of the funniest, fastest and most thrilling comedies I have ever seen.
","Comedy often takes many different forms. Some comedies rely on ""slap- stick"" humour, where sounds and visual gags make up a large portion of the jokes. Other comedies rely on satire or irony, in which absurd situations and mocking parodies makes the fabric of its amusement.<br/><br/>Many say that one of the most important aspects of a joke is the timing, and this is exactly what director Edgar Wright uses to create his films.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is the second film in the planned trilogy; Blood and ice cream, directed by Edgar Wright, featuring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It is the follow up to 2004 film; Shaun of the dead, featuring primarily the same cast as Hot Fuzz, which is not strictly a sequel to Shaun of the dead, since the two films have completely different plots and characters.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a talented young police constable in London's metropolitan police service, who is very dedicated to his job. He gets called to the station one day, and is offered a promotion to sergeant, the downside being that he has to leave London, to take his sergeant post in the crime-free, idyllic country town of Sandford, Gloucestershire. When he declines the offer, stating that he enjoys his current job, it turns out that it is no offer after all. The reasoning behind this is that he is so good at what he does, that he is making the rest of the police look bad. He is left with no choice but to take the post and leave London.<br/><br/>In Sandford he is partnered with fellow police officer Danny Butterman, played by Nick frost, a childish and naïve man, with whom Pegg's character gradually builds a friendship with. Danny and Nicholas are polar opposites. Nicholas is a perfectionist and a workaholic, while Danny is a slacker who longs for a more cinematic, action filled life. Against all odds, their personality turns out to be a perfect fit, as Nicholas mentors Danny to become a better officer, while Danny teaches Nicholas to ""switch off"".<br/><br/>As the days go by, strange deaths starts to occur, and while Nicholas suspects murder, the rest of the force brushes it off as accidents. Maybe this town is not so crime-free after all.<br/><br/>This all leads up to a very satisfying climax, one that I do not wish to spoil. All that I can say is that it is action packed, hilarious and exquisitely put together.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright's comedies rely heavily on timing, and this film is no exception. The movie moves fast, and the jokes move along even faster. You can watch it over and over, and always find something new to laugh at. It is filled to the brim with jokes, each joke funnier than the last one.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright has a very distinct style of cutting, with fast scenes used as transitions or visual gags. These scenes are usually very clear and straight to the point, such as the scene when he travels to Sandford, a very fast sequence of clips, primarily highlighting the facts that not much is happening.<br/><br/>Edgar wright's other work consists of mostly amateur films and television programs. He has only directed two other feature length films with a theatrical release; Shaun of the dead, and Scott Pilgrim VS. the world, both of which were well received by critics. His upcoming works include The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn, which he is co- writing, as well as the third and final entry in the Blood and ice cream trilogy; The world's end.<br/><br/>Not new to the silver screen, is that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both great in their roles, delivering their dialogue perfectly. They are a perfect duo. The rest of the cast includes actors like Timothy Dalton, along with other great actors, whose screen presence is easily recognisable.<br/><br/>Pegg and Frost, as the duo is commonly referred as, have also starred together in the recent film Paul, where they once again play a duo of best friends.<br/><br/>The film is great, not a single joke falls flat, the timing is perfect, the pace is great and every character is played well. Few films can be viewed so many times without feeling old, but this one can, due to genius writing and a truly great sense of humour. If you like to laugh, if you are amused by the amusing, and think it is fun having fun, this is a film you absolutely have to see. You must be saltier than the see and colder than the permafrost of Antarctica to not enjoy this. I give it a perfect score, A+, 100%, 10/10 and six on a die. Go see it."
"bethanj","8","1","2","27 October 2010"," Brilliant
","This film made me laugh out loud from beginning to end. Great choice of actors - Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are just an awesome pair! I really didn't see the twist coming (who the actual killers were) although it was fun trying to figure out who was causing the deaths. Brilliant choice of setting - nice to see something other than London. Great to see some older actors - could shout at the TV ""where's he from!!"". Although the storyline is verging on ridiculous, it was strangely realistic! Really liked the fact that there was no love interest, as i feel the love stories included in some films tend to take over the storyline and ruin it. Only downside is that it should have been longer! Fantastic!"
"lewiskendell","8","1","2","12 August 2010"," An action/comedy gem from the other side of the pond.
","""Come on, Sergeant, you've got to accept that it was just another nasty accident.""<br/><br/>Absolutely hilarious. Every time I see this movie, I end up enjoying it even more. It simply doesn't get old, the jokes are razor sharp, and yes, it's even better than Shaun of the Dead. Seriously, I like this movie so much that I start grinning like a kid on Christmas morning if anyone even casually mentions it.  <br/><br/>Simon Pegg stars as Nicholas Angel, a super cop from London who is transferred to the idyllic small town Sandford, because quite frankly, he's making all the other officers look bad. The town initially appears to be just as safe and peaceful as its residents insist, but ,of course, there's a sinister secret behind the friendly facade. That's really all you need to know about the plot. Just trust me, it's great.    <br/><br/>Hot Fuzz has a supremely clever script, and the jokes never fall flat. If you're familiar with movies like Point Break, Bad Boys, the various references to those movies and others will have you giddy. But Hot Fuzz is an incredibly entertaining tongue-in-cheek cop flick, even if you've never seen any of the movies it pays homage to. I've already mentioned how funny it is, and the epic and ridiculously amazing action scenes are just brilliant. Nick Frost, Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Lucy Punch, and a host of other hilarious Brits join in on the fun and carnage, and the whole movie is just delightfully awesome. See it, prepare to love it, and prepare to have no doubts that Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright are geniuses."
"AustinLayne","10","1","2","14 May 2010"," Awesome, Awesome, Awesome
","To preface the following review I'm going to say that Edgar Wright is one of the best directors of our time. I'm not saying one of the best COMEDY directors. I'm saying one of the best directors PERIOD.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is amazing, the style is kinetic and wild, the dialogue outright hilarious, and the cartoonish violence (which, despite being cartoonish is gratuitous) is very, very entertaining. Honestly, I never think I've laughed at a guy's head being crushed by a huge piece of pointed marble from the top of a giant church, which I say not to condone violence, only to state that, like Quentin Tarantino, Edgar Wright has a way of making things that aren't funny in real life funny in the movies.<br/><br/>Seriously people, drop your pseudo-intellectual, film buff, well-read guard for an hour and forty minutes or so and just laugh at the violent acts committed in this film, because if you laugh at violent acts in a movie such as Hot Fuzz it is not because you want to commit them, it's because the director has made them FUNNY, and that's all there is to it. To sum it up: You laugh because the acts of violence are either so implausible or so stupidly committed and covered up that to see them treated in such a serious manner is funny.<br/><br/>But aside from all that about the violence, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost give excellent performances, and to see the relationship that develops between their characters is one of the finest qualities of this movie. The way it takes the conventions of the Buddy-Cop sub genre and subverts them is hilarious. It even gets to the point of them sitting down and watching action and buddy-cop movies like Point Blank and Bad Boyz II.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed how Simon Pegg didn't allow himself to be typecast and how Edgar Wright didn't want to typecast him anyway. Nicholas Angel is completely different from Shaun (of the Dead) in every way. He takes initiative, doesn't slack off, and is serious about nearly everything. And the amazing part is that Simon Pegg pulls this off astonishingly.<br/><br/>Finally, the standout scene of the movie, in which practically everybody in the village has a gun and engages into a gunfight with Simon Pegg's character Nicholas Angel, is one of the best gunfights I've ever seen in a movie, and to make a gunfight entertaining, engaging, and hilarious at the same time is quite a feat.<br/><br/>I would love to see Edgar Wright direct a serious movie one day, to take his style and put it in a different context, but if he commits himself to only making comedies, well, I'm perfectly happy and excited about that too.<br/><br/>Go see Hot Fuzz, if not for anything else, to see Simon Pegg jump through the air shooting guns."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","1","2","16 October 2009"," Actually outdoes Shaun of the Dead
","If you thought Wright's directorial debut(this may even outdo it for how much set up and payoff) was just a fluke, you gotta watch this. A pastiche of the action-flick and buddy comedy sub-genres(and this works as that type of picture, also), this is a perfect send-up of those Hollywood dime-a-dozen flashy movies that we've all seen more of than we're willing to admit. This is how you do parody. The humor is excellent, next to no gags or jokes fall flat, and so many different kinds... black, British, verbal, cleverness, satire, silliness, and some gross-out material. I would be lying if I claimed that, at any point in this, an extended period of time passed without me cracking up. The plot is marvelous, and the twists are incredible. While I did catch at least one thing coming, this still majorly surprised me. The direction is impeccable. Writing is brilliant, the script is packed with gold. The dialog is astounding, and the delivery is flawless. Every acting performance is spot-on, and the comic timing is beyond reproach. I've heard complaints that Simon's character is excessively ""supercop"", and that the audience can't relate to him. Honestly, I respectfully disagree. He has plenty of personality, and we can recognize the drive he has, and being a workaholic. The chemistry between him and Nick again adds a lot. I can't say enough positive things about the cast. This is packed and dense, and warrants(not to mention deserves) multiple viewings. Almost every single cliché is spoofed on. The pacing is extremely fast throughout. In fact, that is really the only negative thing I can think of to say. It's literally almost too stimulating. Maybe 120 minutes of this team is an overly generous dose. I started this review right when the credits began rolling, it's been an hour, and I'm still recuperating. However, I cannot in good conscience complain about that, and hey, maybe others possess a greater amount of... uhm... dopamine, I suppose. Or better capability of producing it... whatever. If you need to, take a break from it, rest afterward, split it into parts, but in the name of all that is holy, do not miss this for the world, unless you do not believe that you will enjoy this. There is infrequent strong language in this, as well as disturbing content, and brutal, bloody violence and gore. The DVD comes with a commentary track with Wright and Pegg(outspoken, so some may be offended) well worth the time, 22 deleted scenes with the option of hearing the thoughts behind them during, trailers, 'Hot Funk'(the censored version, with cussy scenes cut together, altered with the goofy dubbed over lines), storyboards, The Man Who Would Be Fuzz(the two leads doing impersonations of Michael Caine and Sean Connery), trailers and hilarious outtakes. I recommend this warmly to anyone who can imagine liking it. 10/10"

","What I think: Simon Pegg is a funny guy. I find him funny even he is trying to be serious. Well, I guess thats what the director was aiming for. Hot fuzz is hilarious. Simon Pegg and Nick frost together form a lethal funny combination. Edgar Wright popular for his offbeat story lines does it again. The story is different, but that doesn't matter. The movie is out and out Pegg and Frost. The cinematography is gives you the feeling of a fast paced action-thriller and Pegg and Frost make it the parody that it is.Put the three guys (Wright, Frost and Pegg) together and you get madness. Well that's what the movie is. Appears to be the perfect blend of action, suspense, comedy and thrill. Most unexpectedly hysterical."

The pace is unrelenting with action and jokes coming without any real breaks. The plot is silly but not stupid, there are a few surprises and some nice ideas.<br/><br/>The main thing in a comedy is the jokes and the film delivers. The slap-stick is well done and not overused and there are a fair few nice verbal gags and visual ones too and the action sequences are over the top silliness.<br/><br/>A nice entertaining comedy with no real bad points."

On the other, not too often do I laugh out loud at a movie several times, including at scenes where the joke is telegraphed well in advance (fascist............. hag!).

Both police officers are trying to uncover an bizarre conspiracy between the town's villagers are not what they seemed to be.<br/><br/>Directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) made an entertaining dark satirical comedy with terrific moments of humour and action sequences. Director Wright is certainly paying tribute to filmmakers like Michael Bay, John Woo and especially Tony Scott in the well staged action scenes.

Disc One has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5,1 Surround Sound. Disc one has five commentaries tracks from the cast & crew also including Oscar-Winner filmmaker:Quention Tarantino!

Every scene is set up to have a hilarious atmosphere. Every character is funny and likable in some way. Nicholas Angel is a righteous policeman, he is very good at what he does. He is a great contrast with the other village policemen, who are so lazy and mischievous. I enjoy watching the power struggle between Nicolas and Inspector Frank Butterman. The battles between them are clear, yet they do not come across as being malicious.<br/><br/>The plot is excellent. It manages to pack in so much fun, action and horror in just two hours. The plot twists are very unpredictable, and every twist leads to yet another adventure. Who would have thought a comedy would have full scale shootouts in a supermarkets and high speed car chases? ""Hot Fuzz"" also contains gore for the horror fans. These scenes are graphic, but appear almost comical. Maybe these scenes are comical, but I think it is more because of the whole hilarious atmosphere of the film that makes everything look entertaining. I truly enjoyed ""Hot Fuzz"", I can safely declare that this is a masterpiece of the comedy genre."

","THE PLOT: A very proficient police officer finds himself being relocated to a small English village that he has no interest going to. Here he finds the citizens to be endearingly quirky and the police force incompetently run. He also runs into a rash of grizzly murders committed by a strange hooded figure that looks almost like the grim reaper.<br/><br/>THE POSITIVE: The first hour of the film is fun and filled with a lot of dry British wit. The townspeople are amusing with all of their quirks and idiosyncrasies. It is also fun to see the main character (Pegg) who is so very rigid with his philosophy and approach to police work relate to these townspeople who have no problem bending the rules a little when it is convenient. His friendship with his police partner, who is the complete opposite of him, is nice as is there banter. You can tell there is a genuine bonding between the two actors. The massive shootout at the end, which involves just about the whole town, is outrageously hilarious. It is great to see old British pros given some nice juicy character bits including Whitelaw, Woodward, and most of all Dalton who does indeed still 'have it'.<br/><br/>THE NEGATIVE: The murders are extremely gory and seem more on par with an 80's slasher film. The production seems still locked into the formula of their earlier project SHAWN OF THE DEAD were gore and violence seemingly have to be infused into the story to make it funny even though it really isn't necessary. The second half takes a wildly over the top twist that blows everything out of proportion and loses much of its charm. The pace moves too quickly and doesn't allow the viewer any time to even catch their breath. The film also features one of those modern day 'double' endings that is both needless and pointless.<br/><br/>THE LOWDOWN: The humor has a nice mix to it so all ages should find it funny. Some of the action is crazy enough and over the top enough to stay with you afterwards.<br/><br/>THE RATING: 6 out of 10."
"t_balutz","Null","1","2","16 June 2008"," England Delivers !
","Genre parody is running rampant currently, probably because Hollywood is so out of ideas at this point that they've gone down to the level of making fun of their own crap with even more crap that basically every year we get another slew of pop culture regurgitation in the form of Genre Movie and kids films like Shrek, Happily N'Ever After, and Hoodwinked to make sure nothing worth seeing doesn't have its hilarious counterpart. That is why we need people like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>The thing about Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz is that both of them manage to make fun of, respect, AND transcend their own genres. Shaun of the Dead isn't just a funny reworking of zombie horror flicks, its a damn good zombie horror flick in its own right, and also breaks new ground with the genre. The exact same thing is true with Hot Fuzz. Where any sarcastic Hollywood genre satire would try to show how dumb a cliché is by making it even more outrageous, Edgar Wright simply has the characters say, ""But that would create a lot of paperwork."" Where a lesser parody would make an obvious twist as a nod to obvious twists, Simon Pegg finds out that the motivations for the recent crimes is really much simpler.<br/><br/>But beyond that, these films are good films, removed from genre, in their own right. Hot Fuzz uses a style of quick-cut editing to match the ridiculous quick-cut editing that's become popular in such ridiculous nonsensical films as Domino and Walking Tall, but they don't over extend it to show how ridiculous it can get... rather, they learn something about the form and most importantly make the editing extremely, extremely good. Hot Fuzz has quick saturated action film editing, but it does it in a way that leads the eye gracefully through the action, thus one upping every other bad action flick being ground out by Hollywood."

","After the genius work of Shaun of the Dead, I was excited to see Hot Fuzz, and took the opportunity to see this movie as soon as it came out.<br/><br/>Luckily I was not disappointed. The movie begins with PC Nick Angel (Pegg), a high-flying, intelligent London copper who is so successful that his superiors find him an embarrassment with his successes compared to them. When he leaves, he is sent to Sandford in the middle of the West Country (and miles from anywhere else), and finds himself with the job of re-capturing escaped swans, trying to cope with his new police team who usually seem to fail to take police work as seriously as he does, and working with his new partner Danny Butterman (Frost), who assumes that police work should be shooting up bad guys and car chases.<br/><br/>However, the bored city cop and the impressionable country bobby soon discover that their work is about to be cut out for them when several gruesome deaths begin to occur in Sandford, and that they may be linked.<br/><br/>It was great to see some of the people from Shaun of the Dead make a comeback (Bill Nighy for example in a bit part), and the different characters of Nick Angel and Danny Butterman make up for comedy gold, so before it all finally kicks off and bullets begin flying, you will not be bored. Added to this, the characters are brilliant, and the action scenes are hilarious, with spoofs from everything: From Hollywood action like Bad Boys 1 and 2, Point Break, and Lethal Weapon (even films like Wicker Man and The Omen) to British comedy such as the Vicar of Dibley. This is pure gold which shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>Who says we Brits aren't good at making movies?"

","Hot Fuzz is one of those movies that really grows on you. The first time I saw it, I was a little disappointed, as I was expecting something very much like Shaun Of The Dead and instead felt that this was even more of an ""homage"" to the films it built off of rather than a comedy. And really, it is. But upon repeated viewings, you'll likely notice a lot of jokes you had never noticed before, and even more, you'll come to appreciate the brilliant pacing of the movie.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Hot Fuzz starts out very slow. Despite it's obvious influences - including a couple of action movies mentioned during the film - it really stands out above all that it borrows from with some surprisingly smart writing. The movie's plot (and clever twist) won't blow your mind, but it's one of the best action movie story's ever to grace the screen if only because it never insults the viewer's intelligence. Hot Fuzz succeeds just as much as a mystery and suspense film as it does as an action movie, and thus ends up - like Shaun Of The Dead - combining several great genres of film into one, though in a much less obvious (and ultimately better) manner than its predecessor.<br/><br/>What really sets Hot Fuzz apart from the crowd is the pacing, though. It's funny to think of it, but in terms of pacing, it's can easily be compared to Kurosawa's classic The Seven Samurai. The film starts out slow, introducing the characters and including just a few brief, sporadic scenes of action. The first time you see it, it may even seem a bit boring (though, as I said, it becomes easier to watch upon repeated viewings as you begin to catch some of the better, more subtle jokes in the dialog). But it all culminates in a very long, nearly non-stop fight scene that seems simultaneously subdued and over-the-top. The entire movie strikes this sort of balance throughout, which is one of the main reasons it succeeds as being a genuinely great film. Since it also succeeds at being a genuinely entertaining movie - and since it only seems to get better the more times you watch it - I'd easily consider it one of the best movies I've ever seen."

","Hot Fuzz spoofs all the disgraced cop movies that you see. As the second of what Simon Peeg has called ""the Three Flavour Cornetto Trilogy"" (they haven't made a third film and all films are written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg and star Simon Pegg and Nick Frost along with a few of their mates), I actually prefer it to Shaun of the Dead. Simon Pegg is good as the too-good cop Nicholas Angel. The film slowly gets funnier and funnier. There is some strange British humour, but that's the kind of humour that I love. I'll admit, it is a tad silly, but you're going to get that with a spoof.<br/><br/>Well done, boys. Britain should be proud of this one."

","First of all, i REALLY enjoyed this film, it is the first Simon Pegg outing that i have seen and i thought he was absolutely brilliant, the film was well directed and the actors all did quite a good job. However, it was not a laugh-a-minute comedy that its portrayed to be, quite the opposite actually, the humour in it is VERY subtle and this i like but for some, it might seem a little boring.<br/><br/>The purposefully ridiculous storyline and over-the-top action and dialogue is what keeps this movie in the comedy genre and out of the crime/thriller genre. However, i think this is where the movie triumphed cause you don't see many movies quite like this one out there and the few obvious jokes in the dialogue were quite good and very British tongue-in-cheek. All in all, a very enjoyable movie but don't watch it expecting to be on the floor laughing cause you might be a little disappointed."

","Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is the finest police officer London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any officer on the force. He's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel's superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing -- the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.<br/><br/>With garden fêtes and neighborhood watch meetings replacing the action of the city, Angel struggles to adapt to his situation and finds himself partnered with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), an oafish but well meaning young Constable. Just as all seems lost, a series of grisly accidents motivates Angel into action. Convinced of foul play, Angel realizes that Sandford may not be as idyllic as it seems. With his faithful partner in tow, Angel fights to prove his instincts are correct and uncover the truth about Sandford. Is Angel simply losing his mind in the safest, sweetest village in Britain? Or is something far more sinister at work? A small village is about to get some big city justice. Hot Fuzz 10/10"

","Hot fuzz the film that proves the successful transition from small to big screen of the Edgar Davis / Simon Pegg partnership accompanied by Nick Frost was more than a one off hit and does so in style. Edgar Davis shows that he is a competent director playing with different genres and even though this is a comedy all the way down the line the action sequences are well enough done to suggest that he could churn out a great action pic. Simon Pegg is Nicholas Angel a high performing Police Officer who has to relocate to the country village of Sandford from London and in doing so the has to deal with more than a little culture shock at the same time as unearthing a few village secrets. The movie rattles along at a good pace with no scene wasted and at least one laugh in every scene. Pegg is ably supported once again by Nick Frost as his bumbling side kick Danny. Then as the movie unfolds we are treated to who's who of British comedy and drama filling supporting and cameo roles. I would give particular kudos to Timothy Dalton who steals pretty much every scene he is in as the magnificently sleazy Simon Skinner. The movie comes to it's inevitable conclusion that still had me laughing and certainly warrants repeated viewings."

","Taking ahold of the British Police force and using it to make an Americanized action film was genius. Pegg and Frost brought their on screen magic from Shaun of the Dead an used it once again to bring you Hot Fuzz. Moreover, they also demonstrated their acting capabilities by playing two completely different characters with great chemistry that makes the film funny from start to finish. The film is also supported by an all star cast, who strengthen the film in their own little way, including Dalton, Nighy, Coogan and Broadbent, to name but a few. The overall plot was simple, but entertaining and even shocking at times with a fair bit of violence and also included some amazing action sequences and stunts. The humour was also top form and original and even included the little subtle cornetto joke from Shaun of the Dead. Overall, this is the best of British and will remain a true classic."

So if you aren't well versed in the action movie genre (Such as Bad Boys II, or Top Gun) then you might not enjoy this film nearly as much as I did.

I had pretty low expectations, I thought there was no way he could compare this movie to Shaun of the Dead. Boy was I ever wrong. This movie was HILARIOUS! It was sort of like Shaun of the Dead, but in a different genre. And it worked very well. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost impressed me once again with this movie, Edgar Wright really wasn't trying to cash in on the success of Shaun of the Dead either. I think those are some of the reasons this movie was so special. That and the storyline: totally original in a parody-style. It was great. The characters were very good also, very clueless and stupidly funny. If you're looking for a good action comedy, Hot Fuzz is what you want to get. 10/10.

""The rules would not be rules unless being broken""-it was the idea of the article for me. The film transfers a great humour for those who prefer rather thoughtless jokes than intellectual ones ( before anyone would condemn me after this statement, let me say, I mean bloody-brains-blowing-jokes are the thoughtless ones in my dictionary). I think those who did not like Hot Fuzz that much, will be able to understand it. I belong to the the group who prefer thoughtful sort of comedies. Hot Fuzz is fun, though.

The script by Simon and Edgar is very witty and well thought out.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are great too with great, peculiar personalities that really confuse Angel when he first arrives in Sandford, Jim Broadbent especially comes to mind as he gives a great performance as Danny's father.<br/><br/>Overall the film is worth watching again and again as you miss loads the first time you watch it; the acting and direction is great and everyone works so well together.

I expected something much more jokey, more along the lines of a ""Naked Gun"" movie. I had no idea this was going to be so unpredictably crazy and so relentlessly clever.<br/><br/>Pegg plays a hard-core police officer married to his job who is assigned as sergeant to a wee, quaint English village that has absolutely no need for a police department. However, once there, he becomes convinced that a string of grisly deaths are not ""accidents,"" as the townspeople are convinced they are, but rather brutal murders. He concocts a complicated theory about the who and why, but the truth turns out to be far simpler, yet much loonier. This twist gives the movie its biggest jolt of energy, and from the moment the real truth is revealed and Pegg turns vigilante cop, the film becomes one of the funniest action movie spoofs I've ever seen.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about the film is that Pegg's character, cynical and suspicious of this perfect little village, is proved right in being both cynical and suspicious.<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" caught me completely off guard and ended up being one of the best movies I saw in 2007.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

This is how comedy films must be written. Comic but witty. The writer of this film has his distinct originality. The editing is great too, it somehow contributed for making some scenes really become so funny. Not to mention the directing which was also great. In some scenes the actors need not even deliver a dialogue for them to be funny."
"kurtdavies580","8","1","2","27 December 2007"," Slightly overrated...
","Whilst I am a big fan of Simon Peggs films (Shaun of the Dead, Run Fatboy Run), I must say that, in comparison to these other two titles, I was somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>The actors are brilliant, especially Pegg, he and Frost bring their rather unique sense of humour to this film, but is there enough of it? What I believe this film lacks is the comedy that the others have. Don't get me wrong, it has its fair share of humour, with witty comments and ironic moments, but nothing that would make you laugh aloud too much. It also has a rather slow start, the first hour or so is very much a slightly amusing build up to a terrific final 45 minutes.<br/><br/>The second half of this film is what makes it rather good, its action packed with unexpected comic violence, this makes the first dull hour worth watching. I do recommend this title, especially if you are a fan of Pegg and Frost, but I don't think you should expect it to be as good as Peggs other two major films."

","Many so called ""comedy"" films these days aren't funny, and are about people getting hit around the head with things etc and generally being of bad taste. I blame ""Family Guy"" for making people think this stuff is funny.<br/><br/>I never saw Spaced or Shaun of the Dead before I saw Hot Fuzz so I didn't know what to expect. But I wasn't expecting what I got. In the store I was choosing between this and Sin City and chose Hot Fuzz simply because I hadn't seen it and if I didn't like it I could get a refund. I'm glad I did, since it takes pride and place right at the top of the list of my favourite films, and has made me a huge fan of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's work together, including Spaced and SotD. It may not be the best film ever made, but it doesn't stop it from being my favourite. It's what a I call a ""clever comedy"". I've heard some people criticising it for not being funny, but they're the kind of people who find things like Norbet or Little Man funny and wouldn't know comedy if it was shoved up their arse. Hot Fuzz is witty, hilarious and is actually a pretty impressive action film as well. I've seen some reviews complaining about the editing in the action sequences but I really don't see anything wrong with it, but I can see why it may get annoying for some people after a while.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is filled with very entertaining music, giving me flashbacks to the 90s when bands like Supergrass were my favourites despite me being only 7 or 8, and newer bands like The Fratellis. The music always fits in with it's scene and is excellently done.<br/><br/>I won't give the plot away because then you'll know what happens before you see it, but I will say that if you've seen a lot of action films then you'll be able to guess the baddie straight away, but if you haven't then you'll be humming and ah-hing and changing your mind about people and is quite an entertaining mystery if you're a first-time viewer.<br/><br/>The film also has the cream of British actors in it, including Timothy Dalton who practically steals the show as supermarket manager Simon Skinner, having the lines in the film that make me laugh the most. Watch out for cameos from two Oscar winners as well.<br/><br/>Glad to see that there are far more people who find this funny - Hot Fuzz really does deserve it's 8.1/10 and let's hope it stays in the Top 250 where it belongs."

This film follows a by-the-book London police officer from the big city to a dismal post in a small village where no crime ever occurs. Or so it would seem.<br/><br/>Thus setting the stage for a comedy-mystery-actioner that is frequently charming in a ""Waking Ned Devine"" sort of way and occasionally falling into ""Beverly Hills Cop"" knock-off territory. Granted there's a running joke about our main character whose never once seen a police action film or likewise shot his gun outside a moving car (et al), but much like the American films it seems to be setting in a quaint English village this flick putters along into the dreaded action length of 130 minutes (possibly thanks to former James Bond Timothy Dalton's presence).

It is constantly filled with pop culture references that will make any 70s child laugh.<br/><br/>The director also knows how to put an action sequence together and even put in perfect comic timing. The plot is even well put as Nicholas Angel (the perfect cop played by Simon Pegg) is transferred to the lil' cute town of Sansford for making the London P.D look bad as he does his job a little too well. He is paired up with Danny Butterman and the two make a memorable cop duo.<br/><br/>But of course, as in most action movies, nothing is all kosher, and ""accidents"" begin to happen that Angel believes to be Murder and of course in this ""Perfect"" town, no one believes him.<br/><br/>Most people are upset that this is a comedy that runs over 2 hours but I like that because it gives you a little more time to laugh. And we need more of that in comedies. At least funny movies that is. I really had wished Epic Movie was only 15 minutes."

","I absolutely loved Shaun of the Dead and when I saw this movie was coming out I was just crazy to see it. Finally the DVD arrives in the mail and I sat with eager anticipation for another nearly 2 hours or dry wit and humor from the boys.<br/><br/>The premise itself is a little far fetched and does lend itself for an over the top comedy just like Shaun did. The problem is that Shaun was perfectly set up with the zombie portion to require gore and over the top blood splatter. In this movie, there are so many scenes of people getting things blown up, smashed to a pulp or cracked open that the blood becomes a second supporting actor. While that makes sense with zombies, it sure doesn't fit with a small town group of old cronies.<br/><br/>Now the ending is fantastic with massive amounts of bullets being fired, but it does drag on a bit long and the gags are a little too obvious to score as big surprises. Simon Pegg was good, but he was so serious it was hard to squeeze humor out of his character. If you want Shaun of the Dead humor, please, just pop Shaun of the Dead into the DVD player and forget this one. It'll disappoint for sure."

"Buddy-51","8","1","2","2 September 2007"," fantastic but falls apart in the home stretch
","From the makers of ""Shaun of the Dead"" comes ""Hot Fuzz,"" a takeoff on cop buddy/action movies that is hilarious for about the first hour-and-a-half or so of its two-hour-plus running time, until it falls victim to its own over-the-top excesses.<br/><br/>Nicholas Angel is a London police officer with the highest arrest rate on the force. Does this statistic earn him a round of applause, an increase in pay, or a promotion to a higher rank, as one might expect? Heavens no. In fact, Angel is so good at what he does that he has become something of an embarrassment to the far less highly-motivated cops who work with him. Thus, he is sent to serve and protect the good citizens of Sandford, which is, we are told, the village with the smallest crime rate in all of England. At first, Angel understandably balks at being such a big crime-fighting fish in such a small, seemingly crime-free pond. And, indeed, he begins his service to the community by arresting large swaths of the city's population for decidedly minor infractions. Soon, however, Angel finds himself embroiled in a far more pressing case when prominent citizens suddenly begin showing up dead, the victims of a possible serial killer who may recently have begun operating in the vicinity.<br/><br/>In its initial stages, ""Hot Fuzz"" is wickedly funny both as a parody of cop movie conventions and as a wry commentary on British rural values. The typically dry and subtle humor arises from the juxtaposition of the by-the-book stick-to-itness of Angel with the lackadaisical indifference of virtually everyone else with whom he comes in contact. It would have been very easy for director Edgar Wright and his co-scenarist, Simon Pegg (who also plays Angel) to have reduced the character to the level of a mere caricature or buffoon. Instead, Angel comes across as a man fully aware of his high-strung obsessiveness (he's lost at least one marriage over it) yet powerless to change it. Pegg is wonderfully restrained and deadpan as the highly focused, crime fighting Angel, while Nick Frost makes a perfect foil as his inept, but starry-eyed partner who thinks the life of a cop should be more in keeping with what he sees in movies like ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys II"" than what he regularly experiences on the job in Sandford. There are fine performances, too, from Timothy Dalton, Martin Freeman, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine, and many others. And I defy you to pick out Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan and Peter Jackson in their uncredited cameo appearances.<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" might have been a flawless, classic comedy had the filmmakers been able to refrain from over-indulging their very obvious fondness for large-scale action sequences. Indeed, it is not too long past the midway point that the movie begins to spiral out of control, as Wright and Pegg fall into the trap of mistaking parodies of tedious action scenes for tedious action scenes themselves.<br/><br/>Still, I choose to dwell not on the weaknesses of ""Hot Fuzz,"" but rather on its strengths, for here is a film that at least knows how to make us laugh for a good deal of the time that we are in its company. And that's saying quite a lot these days."

","Simon Pegg is perfect as Nicholas Angel, highly trained and perhaps over-achieving London Police Officer.

So he gets promoted and transferred to the sleepy country town, Sandford. He doesn't want to leave London, but has no choice.<br/><br/>In Sandford he finds a town that annually gets ""best town"" awards, and a police chief that never gets too excited by a little law-breaking, like underage drinking or his son, a fellow officer, driving while drunk. But as Angel arrives, townspeople suddenly begin to die, in apparent accidents. Everyone but he thinks they are just unfortunate accidents.<br/><br/>The most of the movie is Angel trying to track down the reasons for the deaths, all of which seem connected in some way. When he thinks he has finally figured it out, he finds that he is dead wrong.<br/><br/>A good, entertaining, different British dark comedy.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW: It turns out that Angel was correct, the deaths were indeed murders, but not for the reason he suspected -- real estate deals and greed. It turns out that all the town's officials, chief, vicar, etc were in a secret clique, and wear black hooded cloaks, and simply got rid of people they deemed not good for Sandford's image by killing them and making it look like an accident.

","Here we are again, reviewing yet another movie about cops & robbers. But ""Hot Fuzz"" isn't the usual cops & robbers stuff that we're used to seeing here in the United States. Instead, ""Hot Fuzz"" comes fresh off the boat from good old Great Britain, and satirizes American action movies with joyful glee.<br/><br/>Perhaps the reason the project is so successful is because it comes to us from the same happy-go-lucky British comedians who brought us the delightful ""Shaun of the Dead"" back in 2004 during what as an apparent peak in a craze for zombie movies at the cinemas. Yet, ""Hot Fuzz"" is being released in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, so some might say the filmmakers are being insensitive when it's all really just bad timing. Now we shouldn't let the actions of one individual allow us to put judgment upon one little action movie, should we?<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" was directed by ""Shaun of the Dead"" Edgar Wright, and features Sergeant Nicholas Angel (co-screenwriter ""Shaun"" Simon Pegg), a dedicated London police officer who is suddenly reassigned to a quiet little village called Sandford because he's making his fellow policemen look bad with his ridiculously high arrest record. Once there, he is slightly miffed by the lack of criminal activity that was apparent back in his native London (his biggest arrest happens to be on a bunch of underage drinkers), but later events threaten to change that.<br/><br/>A series of suspicious and grisly accidents has been rocking the Sandford area for some time now, and Angel and his bumbling new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) are hot on the case. Butterman's an adrenalin junkie, a young live-wire eager for some action reminiscent of his favorite American action movies like ""Point Break"" (1991), ""Bad Boys II"" (2003), and the ""Lethal Weapon"" films. Angel's deeper investigation into Sandford's public records shows a low crime rate, but an incredibly high accident rate. He suspects that these ""accidents"" are homicides made to conceal something greater.<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" isn't necessarily better than ""Shaun of the Dead"" but is smarter than it. ""Hot Fuzz"" is too self-conscious to be an out-right parody of American action movies but works best as a satire. The movie takes a look at America's obsession with gun culture and satirizes the hell out of it in several adrenalin-pumping action scenes. Though of course, not much happens during the course of the first hour as Angel and Butterman go through the usual buddy-cop movie motions and endure tedious non-action-related police-work, but things begin to pick up in the second hour once Angel and Butterman embark on their investigation to uncover the truth behind the strange events plaguing Sandford.<br/><br/>The film is hilarious in a lot of ways, and extremely deadpan in others. The humor is of the satirical variety apparent in ""Shaun of the Dead,"" but ""Hot Fuzz,"" at least on a technical level, is somewhat edgier and better-written and better-acted (could a sadistic movie villain played by Timothy Dalton possibly be any more over-the-top?). The action scenes are extremely violent and bloody, but is hardly ever really shocking in any way. Action movie fans will have a ball picking out the prods at American action films, which shows to us that the filmmakers certainly know their material quite well.<br/><br/>In the wake of the endlessly maddening cycle of violence plaguing the world at the present, ""Hot Fuzz"" could easily be accused of being insensitive to current events. But we're forgetting that it's just a movie released at an inconvenient time.<br/><br/>It's just a movie, folks.<br/><br/>10/10"

The cuts are done superbly and the sound effects are great.<br/><br/>This move which tells of Sargent Nicolas Angel (Simon Pegg) who is moved to a small town of Sandford. The movie looks into how this high ace police officer is getting used to rural life and nothing happening... but as the viewer will find out; all is not good and well in the town of Sandford.<br/><br/>The movie combines action, comedy and drama in a superb way and I recommend it to everyone who has enjoyed the movies I mentioned earlier."

","An instant classic, an interesting story with some memorable characters and a unique comedic style. While it wasn't hysterically funny, the slight references to just about every other cop film ever made and the intensity of Nick Angel are pretty good. When it comes to mystery movies I'm like Batman, I figure it out pretty early. It still kept me interested all the way though and the exact details of how everyone in the town was involved in the conspiracy surprised me. I think the best comedies are the ones that parody a particular genre like Kung Pow to martial arts films or Austin Powers to spy films. Hot Fuzz does a pretty good take on cop films."

","The most brilliant movie I've seen all year. The humor is both subtle and outrageous, a la Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. The rapid-fire editing style moves the scenes along and the equally rapid writing is engaging and hysterical. The chemistry between Pegg and Frost is simultaneously touching and genius. This movie begs, borrows and steals from other movies in the ""cop"" genre without apology, and to great effect.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, but I do not want to compare Hot Fuzz to Shaun of the Dead and Spaced. Hot Fuzz is brilliantly funny, ironic, subtle and well-crafted in its own right. I am sorry for the limited release in the US, as this movie deserves a wider audience.

","""Hot Fuzz"" is a wonderful film about people who take their matters very seriously in a world that doesn't, about them being imprisoned by their own goals and about the great liberation that comes with the opportunity to make their cause public and publicly fight for it in their own way.<br/><br/>As such an uplifting film and besides that very funny. The self reference here is ruthlessly choreographed, there's not one word of dialogue, not one name, that wouldn't be there for a reason, that wouldn't relate to another part of the film. And the actors do a superb job letting the characters become real life persons, no matter how weird they are, they are so intensely portrayed that they grow familiar inevitably, so that, all together, it is almost a theater play of great inner texture, from whose arbitrary inadequacies its humour is derived.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film, I already said so, a present day ""Arsenic and Old Lace"".

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","5 July 2007"," Hot Stuff (spoilers)
","The trouble with the British police is that they're not very sexy. Just compare them to the Americans. The Americans get guns; we get truncheons. The Americans wear caps; we wear helmets that resemble breasts. The Americans get NYPD Blue, Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice; we get Dixon of Dock Green, Z-Cars and The Bill. There's an imbalance there, one that Hot Fuzz fully recognises.<br/><br/>The beginning of Hot Fuzz presents us with a cop called Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) who has the best arrest record in his station (400% better to be exact). But while in America this would be a cause for admiration and pats on the back, here it's bad form. He's making everyone else look bad. So therefore he's sent to the country, to a place that has no crime and a place that has won the village of the year competition.<br/><br/>One of the funniest scenes occurs quite early on when Angel is new to the town. He goes to the pub and slowly realises that most of the drinkers are underage. Unable to switch off and let it pass, he begins to interrogate the kids. 'When's your birthday?' he asks one youth. '22nd February.' 'What year?' 'Every year.' 'Get out.' I love the kid's sarcasm and Angel's disgusted reaction. And then even better, he asks the same question to a geeky, bespectacled kid. Rather than make up a phoney date, the kid can only squeal in horror. He's then thrown out. It's silly humour, but it works.<br/><br/>Another silly piece of humour I enjoyed occurs even earlier than the pub scene. After being transferred, Angel visits his girlfriend, who's a crime scene investigator. Therefore, when he visits her as she's working, she's wearing a white jumpsuit and mask. 'Jeanine, I've been transferred,' he says. 'I'm moving away for a while.' 'I'm not Jeanine,' comes the reply, in a man's voice. And then Angel, after having the real Jeanine pointed out to him, repeats the dialogue. It's a piece of Naked Gun humour (a film that I love).<br/><br/>Even sillier, though, and generating an even bigger laugh from me, is a late scene between Angel and PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, funny as ever). It's an earnest turning point scene, a scene that happens in virtually every buddy cop film. In this case, Danny is trying to get his pal to leave the village so that he doesn't get hurt. 'Go back to Lond-on,' he says. Words just can't do it justice, but I honestly thought Frost's line delivery was the best thing in the film. I also love the line: 'He's not Judge Judy and executioner'.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some of the broader humour doesn't work quite as well. Fair enough, it's brilliant when Angel dropkicks a shotgun-wielding granny, but the shoot-out scenes lose their charm pretty quickly. Maybe it's because they're too similar to recent action films they're mimicking. I just can't stand that jerky, over-edited style of action. It gives me brain ache.<br/><br/>Having said this, the action does recover towards the end with one of the main villains (excellently played by Timothy Dalton) getting speared through the chin by the spire of a model church. It's magnificently over the top.<br/><br/>Also worthy of big laughs are the numerous killings. With people getting decapitated, stabbed in the throat with shears, and best of all, spiked in the head by church masonry, you have enough blood to fill a dozen horror films. But while it's a surprise how violent Hot Fuzz is (much more so than the current brand of watered down action flicks), it's a pleasant surprise. I'm personally all for heads being exploded in geysers of blood. There should be more masonry-related violence.<br/><br/>But back to the film's silly humour, just as funny as these blood-filled 'big' moments is a tiny moment when Angel and Danny are talking to their rivals in the CID. They're arguing and squabbling and the two detectives move out of frame, but then Paddy Considine moves his head back into the shot. It's one of those things that has to be seen, but it's one of the best bits in the film.<br/><br/>However, as good as the film is, I do have to say that there are sections where the film drags. Occasionally there are large gaps between laughs. Part of this is because the film actually has a plot  from time to time there's quite a bit of exposition - and part of it is because the film feels a little long. You feel it could have been tightened.<br/><br/>But none of this seriously affected my enjoyment of the film. And it's also worth noting that behind all the wonderfully dumb jokes and bad taste humour, there's a bit of social commentary. The village society in this film, after all, kills anyone that doesn't conform to their standards of behaviour  gypsies, teenagers and hoodies are popular targets. Therefore the film seems to be slyly attacking the parochial attitudes of middle class England. For all the overt violence of London you have a more insidious type of violence existing in certain parts of the country and amongst certain people. But whether this message makes an impact is debatable. There's too much other stuff going on, most of it involving guns, decapitation and silly one-liners...which is fine by me."

In Shaun of the dead he plays the hilarious role of lazy, waster and best friend to Shaun, Ed. In this film he takes on another much loved character of Danny, an action-film fanatic police man who can be remembered by many memorable phrases such as ""You mean you haven't watched Bad Boys Two!"" and ""Is it true that there's a point on a man's head where if you shoot it, it will blow up?.""<br/><br/>This film left me in stitches and left me hanging on the edge of my seat with none stop explosive action and over the top, side splittingly funny scenes and sketches!

In Shaun, Ed (Nick Frost) is said to have shot his sister in the foot with an air-rifle. In Hot Fuzz, Danny shoots Dr. Hatcher in the foot twice: the first time, accidentally with an air rifle; the second time, deliberately by 'surrendering' his shotgun.

","This movie is fantastic. It starts with a hilarious premise (that a London ""Supercop"" is transferred to the quiet countryside b/c he makes his colleagues look bad). Then, w/o giving away too much, it becomes unpredictable (amazingly so) and even manages some convincing action moments thatrival those from the flicks that it somehow manages both to parody and emulate at the same time. The cast is phenomenal. Even the minor players are funny and convincing. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are great. I've only seen them in ""Shaun of the Dead"" but they have pulled off incredibly different roles from one film to the next. Pegg successfully switched from the unassertive slacker who rose to the occasion in ""Shaun"" to the uptight, ultra straight-laced super cop who learns to lighten up without losing his edge in ""Hot Fuzz"". Frost's roles weren't quite as different but he transitioned well from a very likable (albeit crude) Ed in ""Shaun"" to a lovable and immature Danny in ""Hot Fuzz"" who finds a new hero and best friend in Pegg's character."

","HOT FUZZ A few years ago, I took a chance renting a movie, not sure whether it would hit with me or flop...SHAUN OF THE DEAD. The poster didn't attract me, and though it appeared to be a zombie horror-comedy, it was done on a small budget and I thought it would suck and resemble any of the multiple National Lampoon Straight to video shelves. But I was pleasantly surprised by that viewing and immediately bought it into my VHS collection. Although not yet available for DVD yet, I got that same feeling again with HOT FUZZ. I finally got to see this today, and I wished Rogue Pictures had more $ for advertising, cause this is the best pic I've seen this year yet. It's a true genre bender, with Monty Pythonesque humor, detective thriller/mystery, some gory horror scenes, and far, far, more entertaining and satisfying than another film I was hyping up earlier this month....GRINDHOUSE.<br/><br/>With all the director's these days giving deja-vu or references for film buffs, I would have to say I like director Edgar Wright's the best...very subtle. Kevin Smith, Tarantino I think are too blantly obvious..(especially Smith, just saw Clerks II also, and did like it, but I'm getting f***in' tired of the Star Wars crap) Also I think the director likes to throw in an occasional slam on other filmmakers. (Baz Luhrman). Plus, everything is balanced as it should be in a film, the acting, script, directing, editing, sound...all very well balanced. I think also I liked it better than GRINDHOUSE was because of the main character focus...male point of view, not female...no offense to the directors nor other gender intended. That's all I say about it for now, cause surprises shouldn't be ruined. And left for others to get the experience. So with HOT FUZZ, you won't walk away from the theater disappointed."
"EUyeshima","8","1","2","24 April 2007"," A Smart, Silly and Genuinely Exciting Tribute to All-American Testosterone in the Movies
","Having never seen 2004's ""Shaun of the Dead"", I didn't know what to expect from director/co-screenwriter Edgar Wright's latest movie, which plays out like an Ealing Studios only-in-Britain comedy amplified on Tarantino-level steroids. The 2007 action farce achieves the impressive feat of being silly and smart, quite often at the same time, as Wright and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pegg show themselves to be cineastes with a sharp eye and nimble ear for satire. There are lots of derivative plot turns to track in this fish-out-of-water story, which shifts into a blazing, gun-toting thriller as a tribute to testosterone-driven, Jerry Bruckheimer-genre buddy movies like ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys II"". Even the intentionally exploitative title fits the tone of this eminently enjoyable popcorn flick perfectly.<br/><br/>With laser-sharp precision, Pegg stars as a straight-arrow aptly named Nicholas Angel, inarguably the best police officer in London. However, he is so good that he makes the rest of the force look ineffectual, which leads to his unceremonious transfer to a sleepy hamlet named Sandford. There he carries his duties quite seriously, which naturally puts him at odds with the casual townsfolk. But then a suspicious car accident occurs, and the plot escalates into a wild ride of contrived but often hilarious developments leading to an ambitious, cartoon-like series of exciting finales. Angel naturally needs a partner to succeed, and Nick Frost (looking a lot like Mark Addy from ""The Full Monty"") winningly plays schlubby Danny, a wannabe action hero who happens to be the devoted son of Frank Butterman, the village police chief. Together they uncover a plot that upends the entire community.<br/><br/>There are lots of familiar faces in funny supporting turns - Timothy Dalton at his smarmy best (and looking well prepared to inherit Christopher Plummer's villain roles) as the suspicious supermarket owner; Jim Broadbent as the seemingly benevolent Frank; Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as a couple of sarcastic, mustachioed detectives; and in bit parts, Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan as a couple of London's befuddled finest and an uncredited Cate Blanchett as Angel's put-upon girlfriend Jeanine conveniently hidden by a forensic mask. The one-liners are funny enough, but what really resonate are the subtle, often throwaway shots that make fun of American movie conventions. Even though the film runs for over two hours, Wright and Pegg have paced the story with a dexterous mix of thrills, intelligence and laughs. Much of this successful hat trick is due to Chris Dickens' propulsive editing and a nifty combination of over-the-top stunts and visual effects. This film is quite an unexpected kick."
"ecko_47","8","1","2","23 April 2007"," 'Fuzzy Vice'
","The very best parodies don't only mock the things they make fun of; they also embody them.<br/><br/>Take ""Shaun of the Dead,"" the 2004 zombie movie from the team of writer-director Edgar Wright, writer-actor Simon Pegg and actor Nick Frost. It was a delicious comedy, a sharp satire of English manners, a spoof of zombie movies and a pretty brain-eater picture all in one. You couldn't help but love it.<br/><br/>Now the trio have taken on another hoary genre -- the Hollywood cop-buddy action movie (""Bad Boys,"" the ""Lethal Weapon"" films) -- and transported it, lovingly but with wicked, piercing humor, to the English countryside. The result is ""Hot Fuzz,"" a film that's terrific fun as a comedy if not quite taut as an instance of the genre it spoofs.<br/><br/>As in ""Shaun,"" ""Fuzz"" skewers movie clichés and lifeless verities of English life with merciless wit. Once again, the goings-on are only a slight distortion of the movie genre being sent up. And once again, the weakest portion of the film is the last, when plotting and the impulse toward a full-circle ending smother the script's vitality. It's delicious comedy overall, though, building on, if not exactly surpassing, the promise of ""Shaun."" Pegg is Sgt. Nicholas Angel, a London cop so gung-ho and effective that his superiors have to get rid of him: He simply makes everyone else look slack. Shunted off to the crime-free village of Sandford, Angel finds his resolve even more unwelcome, if that's possible. The cops are witless clowns, and they and the townsfolk care more about winning the ""village of the year"" contest than about what little harmless crimes occur. But then people start dying -- always by accident, always with plausible explanations -- and Angel just knows that something big is going on. With his only ally the particularly stupid officer Danny Butterman (Frost), he determines to ferret out the killer that he believes is afoot.<br/><br/>It sounds like your basic A-B-C police-fish-out-of-water picture, which, of course, is part of the point. Pegg and Wright explicitly introduce standard bits of the movies they're mocking, then ingeniously undermine them with humor while leaving them standing: hard-as-nails Angel is an absurd martinet with ludicrous devotion to duty, yet he really is tough and smart and good at his job; Danny is almost too stupid to credit, but his passion for the very movies that are being parodied fuels the satire even as he never truly overcomes his ineptitude.<br/><br/>Around his heroes, Wright has an embarrassment of swell English actors having a grand time: Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy as Angel's dismissive London bosses; Jim Broadbent as the village police chief (and Danny's father); small-town cops including the sneering detectives Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall; and a gallery of iconic village types including Timothy Dalton as the local grocery tycoon and lady-killer.<br/><br/>As in ""Shaun,"" the final act is overstuffed with action, and while some of it amuses, you feel that the film has fallen on the wrong side of the line separating parody from its object. Moreover, it doesn't make as much of the theme, shared with ""Shaun,"" of male bonding and maturity.<br/><br/>But it's smashing fun, nonetheless, made with razor wit and continual invention and far, far fresher than not only Hollywood buddy-cop movies but also Hollywood's own spoofs of them."

","Hot Fuzz - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's second film collaboration in which super-cop Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is reassigned (on account of making everyone else on the force look bad by comparison) to a sleepy town where the crime rate is near zero. Yet a hint of intrigue is in the air, in the guise of ex-007 Timothy Dalton (I give away nothing. The movie glaringly implies his malevolence half a dozen times.) who is finally given something of merit to do film-wise. Angel meets bumbling sidekick Danny Butterman (Nick Forst, lovable as ever), his new partner. Frost and Pegg have such wonderful chemistry and it doesn't really matter that Frost is really just rehashing his character from Shaun. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. There are numerous cameos that only the British or BBC America fans will notice, but you might recognize Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan and Steven Merchant.<br/><br/>This movie is off the f*cking chain! It lampoons quite possibly the easiest to parody of movie genres (perhps second to slashers), yet makes you remember the films with fondness. Where other parody films would just put down the film or, more likely, mimic a scene from the film with some fart joke or cartoon violence (Date/Epic/Scary Movie hacks, I'm thinking of you). The film has numerous take-offs like a stupid strongman with near invulnerability, a la James Bond of course, and also makes reference to films like Point Break, Bad Boys and many others.<br/><br/>Like Shaun of the Dead, A movie I love, this movie actually transcends comedy and willfully becomes a part of the genre it spoofs. I actually kinda want to go and watch Point Break now. Also like Shaun, it has incredible wit and numerous jokes that come to be prophetic and revealing about the plot. It's quite likely you'll miss a few jokes (sometimes because you laughed too hard at some part the first time, sometimes they're too subtle), making replay value of the film a bonus. The talks about one-liners are hysterical. There's also enough gun-play and explosions to satisfy any action movie junkie. And the movie has a heart to go with the laughs, due to the film's oh-so likable lead duo.<br/><br/>A wonderful comedy/action film. I know I'll buy it on DVD and watch it many times over. A's all the way. Now when'd the next one coming out?"
"mmilner-4","9","1","2","23 April 2007"," Buddy cop movie on speed meets Midsomer Murders - Hot Fuzz the Swan and the Mine
","The icons of hot fuzz are many and varied but are all attention-grabbing. Certainly, if they don't grab your attention during their first pass they quickly come to mind during the many ""oh, so that's why they did it that way"" moments that this film provides. It's unusual to derive humor from words like ""fascist"" and ""hag"" but Hot Fuzz has no problem with this at all.<br/><br/>The swan symbolizes all that is bucolic and rural in sleepy Sandford and is for a time, albeit short, the height of the crime wave, the mine the eccentricity of the farmer-arms dealer and the vignettes of destruction that splatter the second half of the work. But even the swan ""comes through"" in this wild and frenetic pastiche-laden comedy. The target of the send up: police movies and especially the buddy-buddy types. Instead of Turner and Hooch think Angel and Butterman. The movie starts in a peaceful Cabot Cove way but explodes towards the end in adrenaline-soaked mayhem but unlike some films that poke fun through a series of unrelated scenes in the style of Airplane, this film throughout retains a plot, even though it is at times a little incredulous, and sometimes a little hard to stomach. Even if you don't pick up the references to other action flicks there is a lot to enjoy in the film which at times swerves erratically between genres such as murder-mystery, partner cops action, horror and suspense and laugh-out loud comedy. Other commentators have referred to this as a roller coaster ride, which it surely is and one that leaves you feeling pretty breathless at the end of it. The super cop team of Nicholas Angel and Danny Butterman take us on a wild ride with laughter and suspense at every twist and the reasons behind the accident/murders are just so over-the-top that you just can't help laughing even though the dispatching is more than a little gory.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the best laughs I've had in the cinema for a long time. Go and see it!"
"AfroThunder242","9","1","2","23 April 2007"," One of the greatest cop films to parody other great cop films
","Hot Fuzz surpassed my expectations in so many ways. I never saw Shaun of the Dead, but after seeing this film I am exceptionally eager to see it. It is outrageously funny as well as suspenseful and action packed. I don't remember any comedies in recent years that had the total package like this one. I was also particularly excited to see Timothy Dalton in this film. The idea of 007 playing a creepy supermarket manager was just riotous. This film can be divided into thirds. The first third takes Nicholas away from London to the suburbs of Sanford. The incompetence of the police service is hilarious. The second third, the film seems to drag, and their incompetence begins to irritate me. The final third, Nicholas puts it all together and delivers justice to the perpetrators. The last third of this film takes such a dramatic turn and is completely worth it all! Trust me when I say this, you'll not find a comedy like this again for a long time!"
"guyver1","9","1","2","23 April 2007"," A very unique comedy
","I must admit that I've only seen bits and pieces of ""Shaun of the Dead"" so I was not sure what to expect from ""Hot Fuzz"". I expected the usual from a comedy, a few chuckles throughout. From the very beginning, I was sure that I was wrong. Instead of the usual serious guy in a strange situation plot that comedies tend to over use, we had elements of great storytelling throughout. Even when things tended to get silly, everything was still woven together and very much made sense. It wasn't until half the movie was gone that I had realized that I was laughing very hard and had been for most of the movie. It is a rare thing for me to experience at the movie theater.<br/><br/>Hopefully ""Hot Fuzz"" will not be subject to just the cult level of popularity as ""Shaun of the Dead"", which I'm sure it will have. This movie is better than that, if people give it the chance and see it. Far too often, movies will fall into that ""cult movie"" level that scares casual movie goers away.<br/><br/>It takes the rare and original form of comedy that was all over ""Hot Fuzz"" to get the kind of reaction it did from me. I don't know what the next movie type that the guys are going to go after next time, but I'll be sure to watch. Now it's time to go and rent ""Shaun of the Dead"" so I can truly appreciate what they can do."

","In every genre of movie i take a different approach that way i enjoy all film genres. This one is just simply hilarious for viewers. There are little jokes you have to catch so pay attention while watching it. Frost and Pegg work so well together in this film and the camera work reminds us a lot of Shaun of the Dead. The quick flashing film shots bnring back Shaun memories. Also the climactic scene delivers some great action which also is amusing. Wright is truly a genius for crafting this film and Shaun of the Dead, the content he incliudes reminds us a lot of hit comedy shows like family guy and others. The humor is so quick and witty it sometimes makes us think and those are usually the funniest jokes. The ""Oh i Get It"" type jokes. One great film."
"ferguson-6","8","1","2","22 April 2007"," The Greater Good
","Greetings again from the darkness. Brilliant comedy/spoof/homage co-written by rising star director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg ... yes, the team from ""Shaun of the Dead"". There are so many well written and deftly delivered punchlines here, one can hardly keep up.<br/><br/>Supercop Pegg (named Nick Angel ... same as the film's music director) is ""promoted"" off the London police squad and into a quaint little country village with no history of murder, but the world's highest ""accident"" rate. Pegg partners up with stereotypical pudgy cop played perfectly by Nick Frost, who also happens to be the police chief's (Jim Broadbent) son. While every town death is casually explained away by the latest ""accident"" report, Pegg continues to pursue the notion that evil retailer Timothy Dalton is behind it all. Not to give anything away, but Pegg's theories lead to some hilarious dialogue between all parties.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, the film combines ""The Stepford Wives"" with ""The Wicker Man"" and then proceeds to throw in numerous references to Mr. Wright's favorite U.S. cop film ""Bad Boys II"". Working equally well as an homage or a spoof, the film does a terrific job of jabbing U.S. buddy films and action films. The shoot-outs are a hoot and it is so amazing to see so few wounded with so many rounds fired at close range.<br/><br/>Other support work is provided by Paddy Considine, Bill Nighy and numerous other Wright favs. Don't miss a quick shot of LOTR director Peter Jackson as the slashing Santa or a masked Cate Blanchett as Pigg's ex.<br/><br/>Two other notes of interest: look for a quick scene involving a lost goose with Stephen Marchant (one of the masterminds behind ""The Office""); and Mr. Wright also directed the best of the fake trailers, ""Don't"", in the recent Tarantino/Rodriguez release ""Grindhouse""."
"ValianceInEnd","8","1","2","21 April 2007"," Fun movie with slick action
","Hot Fuzz is an action-comedy with great humor and, well, great action. At times it seems serious and slick enough to be a real action film. But then something down right silly and outrageous happens and you realize that it IS a comedy. Where Hot Fuzz triumphs is the way that they use all the gimmicks of action movies to give it the feel of an action movie (like quick camera angles, catchy noises, and awesome sound track). And though I would say it's a full blown comedy, sometimes it is to serious or slow and makes the viewer really want something funny to happen. But no worries, every scene somebody has something to say that has a harsh wit to it. When it all comes down to the last 20 or 30 minutes, Hot Fuzz then really brings out the humor. Lets just say it's one of the funniest and most intense action sequences I've ever seen. This movie is a MUST SEE for any fan of Spaced or Shaun of the Dead or Action movies. Good stuff."

"pianissimo_550","Null","1","2","19 April 2007"," Clever British Comedy
","""Hot Fuzz"" is a clever British comedy. Simon Pegg as Nick Angel is a policeman who is simply too good at his job.Sent by his superiors from his job in the city to the 'sleepy' village of Sanford .His new partner is Danny Butterman played by Nick Frost-- a policeman who has not seen much action in the force but has ideas about how it should be having seen films like 'Bad Boys 2' and 'Point Break'.What a great idea! Take the big budget 'Lethal Weapon'style actioner and mix it up with a 'Midsomer Murder' television serial.It works really well due to Edgar Wright's exciting and inventive direction. A first rate cast including Jim Broadbent as Danny's policeman Dad and Timothy Dalton as Simon Skinner the supermarket manager(He mocks, taunts and sneers in such a delightfully villainish way he steals every scene he is in ).What I also found effective was the 'Wicker Man' influence so that when the murders take place there is a threatening tension underlying all the moments of comedy.The climactic shoot out at the end brought to mind the harmless fun of 'Bugsy Malone'."

"Baldrick44","10","1","2","17 April 2007"," The best movie of the year so far
","Hot Fuzz is fun. Amazing fun. While Shaun of the Dead is a tribute movie to zombie films, Hot Fuzz is a tribute to the action genre while poking fun at Agatha Christie/Midsomer Murders.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Nicolas Angel ( Simon Pegg ), a top policeman whose record in the Met is becoming an embarrassment to the other policeman; so much so the the Chief Inspector ( Bill Nighy ) transfers him to the countryside village of Samford; where he meets; amongst others his new Inspector ( Jim Broadbent ), Sergeant Turner ( Bill Bailey ) and his new partner ( Nick Frost ). He also meets Simon Skinner ( Timothy Dalton ), a very devilish supermarket conveyor. This sleepy village however, is soon seen to be something more as a mysterious amount of 'accidents' lead Angel to believe that something is afoot at Samford.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is great with numerous comedians and seasoned British actors getting their two cents worth and looking like they're thoroughly enjoying themselves. The script is razor sharp and adds plenty of laughs and the last 45 minutes is fantastic.<br/><br/>Movies should, above all else, get you involved, and Hot Fuzz does that in spades. English comedy is ready to kick a** and take names."
"jdesando","Null","1","2","16 April 2007"," Bright Satire
","Most of the artists attached to Shaun of the Dead, that dead on spoof of zombie films, are responsible for the action, buddy-cop satire, Hot Fuzz. The wit in both is similar, straddling between irreverent takes of the genre while still providing a fast-paced, somewhat suspenseful story. Hot Fuzz isn't the classic Shaun has turned out to be, but it is an enjoyably humorous skewering of the US's Die Hard and Lethal Weapon franchises and UK police dramas, sharp enough to make Richard Donner, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Michael Bay uncomfortable.<br/><br/>London Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is reassigned to quiet hamlet Sanford because he's just too good a cop (400 percent better than anyone else). They need him to go so they don't look so bad by comparison. Angel is type A, left-brained obsessive compulsive on whom no clue or righteous arrest is lost. Pursuing a rogue swan is clearly beneath him in this quiet town, but soon he intrepidly investigates suspicious deaths related to the town's interest in the best- town-in-England prize.<br/><br/>His buddy cop, PC Danny Butterman ( Nick Frost) provides the dufus- with-a-heart laughs, allowing for plenty of yin/yang contrasts between the uptight sergeant and the loose patrolman. Underneath the sometimes absurd but amusing interchanges lies a dialogue about the need to make judgments about who should be jailed and who is no danger to society (such as teenage drinkers better off in jail than on the streets and street performers posing minimal threat to society).<br/><br/>Witticisms abound such as the names fitting the characters (cop as Angel, reporter as Messenger) and numerous borrowings from setups and dialogue in other films (Point Break, Dirty Harry, and Straw Dogs, etc.). The homoerotic subtext in many of these references is gently hinted at.<br/><br/>But all in all, it is a bright satire that somehow ends up being a minor sermon on the dangers of perfection and the joys of experiencing life in wholly different ways."

","I think that Hot Fuzz is by far the best Action / Comedy since Bad Boys (1995), and Bad Boys II (2003)! Hot Fuzz is a slamming action / comedy starring Simon Pegg who is the sort of guy who has wanted to be a cop since he was a kid, and suddenly has to get transferred to a little town in the countryside. Upon arriving he arrests a drunken man, who turns out to be his partner (Frost), whom's father is the Chief Inspector.<br/><br/>I think that Hot Fuzz is the sort of film that will make the film industry realise that Britain can come up with some brilliant, action films! Seeing as Britain usually does make Crime/Drama's such as Lock, Stock..., Snatch and The Long Good Friday, this film is like the Bad Boys of the UK or something, but its better than Bad Boys! I think that the cast couldn't be better, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who also worked together in Shaun of The Dead (2004), which was just an absolute rush! Hot Fuzz is a brilliant film in every aspect you try to look at it in. If you like the sort of Saturday Night, on the sofa with some popcorn, i VERY, VERY, VERY highly recommend this film!!

","Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, director/writers/actor respectively, struck gold with their previous film Shaun of the Dead, for what is a cult hit. Wright and Pegg, tapping the same source of Shaun, are far from bleeding their well dry. Spinning conventions of the zombie genre. Wright and Pegg give action it's due in the small village of Sandford, where death is more prone from an over indulgence of tea and cake at the local NWA.<br/><br/>The chemistry of Hot Fuzz lies upon Pegg and Frost. Perfectly complimenting each other, whether Pegg is stiff and robotic and Frost runs with the shenanigans, or both in action mode, there is a natural play off one another, never fighting for the punchline or spotlight. Writers Wright and Pegg, don't really reach the creative level of Shaun of the Dead, in retrospect the revelation of who's behind it all is rather esoteric, but that and plot holes are quickly filled with a 'who cares' mentality. The comedy is non stop, along with a constantly spiked energy level, with Wright showing of his flare as a talented director in one bombastic yet creative shoot out. Pegg and Wright have laced moments, heavily on Point Break and Bad Boys 2, with myriad of references to virtually every buddy cop film, cop show and other films and shows to spark the childhood memories.<br/><br/>Maybe a western next guys"

","This film, directed by Edgar Wright, is like an episode of ""Midsomer Murders"" or some Agatha Christie story directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is, of course, a take-off of police procedurals and action movies in general with enough references to other films to keep the buffs up all night. The cutting is truly amazing and the pace never flags. It's pretty gory but somehow good-humoured.<br/><br/>Sergeant Nick Angel (a wonderfully straight-faced Simon Pegg) is found to be so good at his job in the Metropolitan Police that he is an embarrassment, so his chief inspector (Bill Nighy) sends him to the country to cool his heels. He arrives in Sandford, Somerset (or thereabouts) and settles in well enough, but after a couple of suspicious deaths begins to realise that all is not well despite the surface calm. He teams up with one of the dimmer local cops and they investigate. Naturally the body count increases and it seems there is real evil about. The final shoot-out is something Clint Eastwood would be proud of.<br/><br/>One thing ""Midsomer Murders"", Poirot and the like share with this film is a great troupe of accomplished English character actors playing supporting roles. There's (rather surprisingly) Timothy Dalton, once a James Bond, playing a suspect supermarket owner, Anne Reid, Billie Whitelaw, Edward Woodward, and Stuart Wilson as other locals, Jim Broadbent as the avuncular Sandford police inspector and Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Bailey (a double act) as various police persons. Even Peter Jackson the director is in there somewhere though I didn't spot him. But Simon Pegg, by staying so straight-laced throughout, makes the whole thing work. Nick Frost as his sidekick blends in well, though it is not such a demanding part.<br/><br/>Obviously the movie was made by a bunch of young people having fun (their previous effort was ""Shaun of the Dead""). It might be bloody but there's not a dull moment, and the editing is worthy of a prize."

","hot fuzz is one of those films which is impossible not to enjoy, it manages to combine everything that is good about cop films (shoot outs, great partnerships and sinister villains.) adds British humour and stars and then tribute and mock them all in the name of a good night out. <br/><br/>The plot is as follows Nicholas Angel is a good cop, so good in fact that his superiors (Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy) conspire to get him sent away. Nicholas having just come out of hospital after being stabbed by a man dressed up as Father Christmas (a blink-and-you'll miss it cameo by Peter Jackson) Nicholas is then moved to the town of Sandford he meets up with well meaning police officer Danny Butterman (Nick Frost)and the rest of his new team (including Jim Broadbent, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall.) he soon discovers a series of murders and maybe Sandford isn't all that it seems.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz has been described as ""Bad Boys II meets Midsommer Murders."" and that is an apt description though thankfully without the formers crassness. Director Edgar Wright infuses the camera with a lot of energy as the camera zings around the town during the action sequences and seems content to stroll around Sandford during its quieter moments. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have infused the screenplay with a smattering of cop film references some obvious there is a running bit about Danny's love of Point Break, some not so Jim Broadbent's off hand remark about a Callahan park. there is also the teams customary wit ""Judge Judy and executioner."" <br/><br/>as Nicholas Angel Simon pegg is better during the scenes when he's character relaxes later in the film as while he is an excellent everyman his hard-as-nails Angel still has shades of Shaun poking through, though maybe that makes it easier for us to support Angel as he is shown to be a nice guy as well as a good cop. Nick Frost is still hilarious as Danny who while he may be an adult he seems much like a teenager who idolises Angel. Jim Broadbent one of Britains foremost character actors shows just how capable a comedian he is. Timoth Dalton is a revelation as Simon Skinner this has to be the most inspired piece of casting of the year he perfectly captures the moustache twirling gusto needed for his part. people often forget how hard it is to go-over-the-top and still be entertaining and malevolent Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall are also especially memorable among a supporting cast of British comedians.<br/><br/>and now I'm going to answer the question everyones been asking ""is it as good as Shaun of The Dead"" my answer is no. and you know what I don't care. when the end of the year comes and I look back I'll be surprised if I see anything more entertaining, the only thing that looks like it can rival this is Spider-man 3. and lets face it the web-slinger has got competition from Sandfords finest."
"seamo42","7","1","2","24 February 2007"," Perfectly Enjoyable...
","Hot Fuzz does exactly what it says on the tin. In interviews it was described as a high-octane, buddy cop action movie that's also a comedy and that's exactly what it is. It's got plenty of action that keeps going and doesn't disappoint and plenty of funny moments that are generally down to earth which is typical to the style of filmmakers' comedy.<br/><br/>That said there are a few small flaws to this film. Overall it is a great film and fans of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead will not be disappointed, however the movie moves too quickly. Edgar Wright gives a much more extreme version of his quick, fast cutting method as the film is intended to be much less laid back as his previous work. Though it fits the genre it becomes a bit irritating as it is almost constant throughout and the film doesn't quite sink in as a result of this.<br/><br/>The film's plot is of an excellent policeman, Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), who is moved to a calmer part of England, in the country. With a new partner, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), he must adjust to his surroundings. Though there is an engaging plot, and an obvious subplot about his settling into his new home and the relationship with his new partner, this doesn't quite fit with the high-octane style. Pegg and Frost's chemistry is excellent as usual however the script has to give a lot of the information that they are getting along.<br/><br/>Though there a some very small pieces missing to this movie, don't let that turn you away from seeing it. No one I know who has seen this film were significantly bothered by these problems and it is still well worth seeing. If you are a fan of Spaced or Shaun of the Dead you should definitely see it as it is another great piece of work from its makers. If you haven't seen these previous works you should still watch this as it is a refreshing action comedy."
"OllieZ","8","1","2","19 February 2007"," Kick Ass!
","Hot Fuzz is the new film from the Spaced trio and it is a great edition to their CV! The story is simple, an urban western of sorts, about corruption in a small English village. The film actually reminded me of Mangold's Copland, but it had numerous references to other high-octane actioners like Point Break and Bad Boys 2.<br/><br/>Pegg is Nick Angel, and this is probably his best performance yet. Finally breaking away from the cool slacker of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead, Pegg forms a character that isn't entirely likable. Again, the pairing of Pegg and Frost works wonders, with Frost giving a great Bristol accent. The duo are backed up by a great supporting cast, with Broadbent, Coogan, Dalton and Considine.<br/><br/>The action is great and Wright is clearly aiming to be an action director. All his work so far has had a trademark zip to it, but he could calm down just a little with the editing.<br/><br/>Don't try to compare this film to Shaun of the Dead, they are completely different films. Shaun has more jokes, but Hot Fuzz makes up for that with it's action. It's still hilarious, but I think people might expect the same blatant comedy of Shaun. It's structure is more Copland than Lethal Weapon, so it isn't the all-out stupid action fest people might have been expecting.<br/><br/>Minor quibbles aside, it is safe to say Hot Fuzz is a riot."

"stevenwithers","8","1","2","18 February 2007"," Very good, but is it two ideas bolted together?
","First let me say that I do think this is one of the best comedy films I have seen in a long time. It is well made, interesting and enjoyable, and I applaud what Pegg and Wright are doing for the British film industry. Pegg has made some great fresh TV, and is now transferring his talents well to the big screen.<br/><br/>However, no film is above criticism, and the unanimous barrage of praise that is flooding forward about this movie makes me worry that it is simply trendy to like it. Pegg himself admits that it has flaws and he and Wright spent a long time trying to get the logic of the film to work. In places that logic does fall down.<br/><br/>Firstly the Nick Angel character is not particularly likable, he is a jobsworth with no apparent human weaknesses, but we are supposed to identify with him as the hero. Danny is a more likable and human character.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes about country vs. city are a bit predictable and rely on stereotypes about backwards country types. I am sure that South Gloucestershire is not that backward! Then there is the sudden change of style and pace halfway through which is a bit jarring. The first half is a comedy of reality, that is the comedy comes from strange people in situations that could be real, and the laughs come from the character interactions.<br/><br/>I am surprised many people say they laughed hard all the way through the movie, because in the first half there are relatively few big laughs. It is a subtle style of comedy that brings a gentle smile rather than a laugh. I saw it on opening night in a packed cinema and was listening for audience reaction, and I counted only 2 or 3 big laughs in the first hour and a half.<br/><br/>Half way through the movie suddenly enters the world of surreal, slapstick, spoof comedy, and the pace takes off, and the big laughs come. The Angel character goes from being a serious character to a man spoofing the likes of Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson. Yes it is very funny and well observed, but does it fit with the first half of the movie? Most of us are intelligent enough to realise that the gun violence is meant to be cartoonish and ironic, but will everybody realise that? Is it right to get laughs from gun violence in the current political climate in the UK? Having said all that these are just nit-picking points, and the film is certainly miles better than a lot of other lame comedies around, and works on a lot of levels. I just wish they would have stuck to one style all the way through instead of bolting two ideas together."
"come2whereimfrom","7","1","2","18 February 2007"," A worthy follow up.
","When you have made a film like 'Shaun of the Dead' it is always going to be a tall order to follow it up but the team have done it with cop comedy 'Hot Fuzz'. Although not quite as good as Shaun (what could be?) the boys give rural policing the zombie treatment and give us a right laugh in the process. There are no punches pulled here and the laughs are often full on or simply gross outs. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost after living and working together for so long have built up a report that aids the comedic timing of both and they play off each other so well, Pegg makes a convincing if not quirky leading man of sorts and Frost is the source of much of the amusement as the bumbling buffoon. Elsewhere there is an amazing supporting cast and at times it is like spot the face, Coogan, Woodward, Nighy, Dalton, Freeman, Considine to name but a few, but not unlike 'The League of Gentlemen' there is an unseen element to the overall piece and that is writer/director Wright. Along with Pegg the script they have delivered is not just full of great lines but great action sequences and in the last quarter of the film it gives them licence to be exceptionally over the top. It is also one of those films you will have to see more than once to spot all the homage's to other films I spotted 'Leon' and 'Bad Boys' but I know there are more. If you liked 'Spaced' and 'Shaun' then you will no doubt love 'Hot Fuzz' it's well made, clever and damn right funny, plus you get to see Pegg kick a granny in the face what more can you ask for?"

","Hot Fuzz is a comedy that surprises. Seems to have a simple story, but has some quirky but interesting little twists. A laugh out loud comedy at various points, it parodies various action movies from the past which is part of its attraction. <br/><br/>It essentially is about a hot shot cop being forcibly sent to a small village where dastardly crimes begin to happen, and he has to convince everyone that they are not accidents. Supported by a slob of a partner, and surrounded by some eccentric police colleagues, the job is never easy. Add in many typecast village folk, with a wonderful performance by Timothy Dalton as a dastardly supermarket owner, and you have a colourful catalogue of characters.<br/><br/>Well worth a night out to watch, and will appeal to people of many ages, with great parodying, slick lines and all. Its not special, but its more than entertaining enough."

","Highly enjoyable follow-up to Shaun... genuinely funny and full of great cross-genre references for the anoraks. pegg almost underplays his role, which imo actually makes for a funnier film, and his ever-so-slightly too close buddy relationship with frost is really directed really well. the supporting cast are very funny, my personal favourite being tim dalton, who hams up the evil supermarket manager role to great effect. the only slight criticism might be that the film has the majority of the action and, highly bloodthirsty, (yet hilarious!) violence towards the final third, but then again it is the climax so... the best thing about the film is that it's a genuinely warm homage to action / buddy films; it's clear that the guys love those corny movies, and there are way too many references and 'isn't that..?' moments to note, just have fun spotting them! belly laugh funny, with some wicker man, bad boys, point break and spaced mixed in, no better way to spend your cinema-dosh! *insert quotable line here!*"

"teh_mode","7","1","2","16 February 2007"," Romping, laugh-a-minute ode to all the Stallones, Segals and Norris' of this world.
","Attempting to parody the work of such uber-cheesy former actionites as Steven Segal and Chuck Norris is, on paper, such a redundant task, since most of those so-bad-they're-actually-quite-good action shoot-em-ups of the late 80s and early 90s were already teetering on the brink of self-ridicule. So how then, does Hott Fuzz, the new film from the makers of Shaun Of The Dead (2004), overcome a potential damp squib?<br/><br/>The story goes like this: Dedicated London cop Nicholas Angell (Pegg), with a near perfect arrest record, is transferred to a small countryside village, where the crime rate is so excruciatingly low, that our hapless hero is reduced to being assigned to arresting the human statue in the town centre for loitering. All appears well, that is, until a series of grisly deaths appear to pile up around town, all of which are strangely linked to business entrepreneur Simon Skinner (Dalton). Although Angell continuously suspects the worst, that the town is being stalked by a vicious murderer, the rest of the rather apathetic police force choose to view the incidents as merely coincidences, taking both a blind eye and a lackadaisical approach to police detective work. Shaun Of The Dead managed to work, not so much by parodying the works of such horror auteurs as George A. Romero, but rather paying high tribute to the man, and his creations. The patented Pegg & Wright style of humour was there simply as an added bonus to hoards of zombies who roamed the rather mundane looking streets of suburban London. Hot Fuzz takes that cue, and pots in the very same way. But my affections for this film greatly outweighed their previous project for three simple reasons. Firstly, having a bottle-smashing, trolley-romping, gun-blazing shootout in the middle of a Somerfield supermarket is funny just passively thinking about it. Secondly, Simon Pegg fly-kicking the hell out of a shotgun-touting OAP is about the funniest thing you are likely to see all year. But the main reason is much more broad: Hot Fuzz is in love with the Chuck Norris' of this world. The fact that it shows this much passion and unapologetic enthusiasm for the over-muscled, hyper-realised cheese-infested beefcakes of latter 20th century Hollywood, is what provides this film with the icing on the cake. At the same time  Pegg and Wright do not let the laughs let up for one second. This is very much a case of if you missed that last gag, don't worry there will another one along shortly. <br/><br/>Timothy Dalton plays the villainous antagonist with so much evil suavity you kind of wait for him to start cackling and stroking his beard, but seeing him in this just made me realised how long it had been before he did anything actually worth noticing. And there are various cameos from a pick-em selection of Britain's finest comedy acts, ranging from Bill Bailey and Steve Coogan, to serious thesps like Edward Woodward, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine. <br/><br/>The final 25 minutes of Hot Fuzz is kind of what Midsummer Murders might look like if John Woo had directed an episode of it. And the grand old daddy of action cinema would be proud. This is top quality British comedy, and in my opinion, even surpasses the laughter ratio on Shaun Of The Dead."
"keithsterbestest","9","1","2","16 February 2007"," 'high octane' police buddy movie
","like Shaun of the Dead this is really a feature length Spaced special, but there's nothing wrong with that. Perhaps not as well paced as Shaun, Hot Fuzz is still a brilliant, action-packed, funny and engaging film. A great mixture of Hollywood blockbuster and English wit and irony. There are lots of references to other films and TV shows, half the fun is trying to spot them and the many famous actors in relatively small roles (was that Eric Idle as the amateur Romeo?). It also contains the best (if not only) use of a model village in any film I've seen. Redolent of the Wicker Man in places (not least for Edward Woodward's presence) but with less emphasis on the horror/suspense, the film is still relatively gory - lots of lingering shots of corpses and severed heads. Not sure whether this will be as big as Shaun was all over the world - the boys in blue probably don't translate as well as zombies do into the American consciousness - but it was heart warming to see a 'proper' film chase scene in British panda cars."

","Wow! OK I saw Shaun Of The Dead last year (I know I was a bit late) and loved it!

Then I saw the longer trailer and started to like the look of it more but still it didn't look like a must see for me.<br/><br/>Anyway skip forward a few months and the film is released, my friend invited me to go and see it at the cinema (we're both 14 but we got in :) ) Having nothing else to do I decided to go and watch it with him but I didn't really have very high expectations.<br/><br/>Two hours later I came out of the cinema with a huge smile on my face (as did my friend) The film was amazing! It ahd a slow start at first but as soon as Nick Angel gets to the village it all gets better. I haven't laughed so much at the cinema in a long time and I couldn't stop talking about it the rest of the night!<br/><br/>I cant recommend this film enough, it beats Shaun Of The Dead hands down!<br/><br/>10/10!"

Horror sub genre zombie I loved so Shaun of the Dead floated my boat and Action/Cop movies this time.<br/><br/>When the movie was 3 or so min's in I was thinking, hmm this doesn't seem as good as Shaun, where's the laughs. But the film does shift gears dramatically you never know what to expect from this film, just when you think it's a quite little comedy something extreme happens and you think WTF that was a bit much even for an action movie. You'll see, I mean Shaun of the Dead's gore/shock factor is topped.<br/><br/>Also if your like me already a fan of Spaced and SOTD. Plus a fan of Proper Cop Action films you'll have a blast.

","How must Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright be sitting quietly smug, currently waiting for the adulation to flow after their latest film, Hot Fuzz has just seared across our screens. They and the amazing crew of the much underrated 'Spaced' have delivered to us our wildest dreams, that is if one is a fan. Well I am, however without bias I can tell you that this is the most enjoyment i've had at the cinema in at least 5 years. <br/><br/>Sgnt. Nicholas Angel, played by Pegg, has outshone his peers with his excellance in every department, so they decide to demote him to a safe country town called Sanford. All is not how it seems among the carefully trimmed gardens and beautiful streets and Angel is on it, but not without his life partner 'Frost' who plays the eternally lovable PC Danny Butterman. <br/><br/>Together they're unique on screen chemistry sizzles at every crackle the script serves up.

Pegg and Frost obviously enjoy working with each other and its shown in the way they carry off the comedy together. Sometimes its like watching your mates mess about. Always great fun I'm sure you'll agree! Hot Fuzz isn't going to develop the cult following that Shaun of the Dead inspired but in its own way I'm sure that many will find it memorable. There are some great one liners and exchanges between the characters which fans will relish using at work or down the pub.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting to be mesmerised by the direction, cinematography or acting because you will be disappointed. This isn't a work of art. But, if like me, you want to be entertained for a couple of hours then this is a great way to do it. There are also some appearances by almost forgotten great actors which i found to be a nice touch.<br/><br/>If i was to point to one thing that detracted from the experience it would be to the way the film constantly changes scenes. In Shaun of the Dead there were a number of scene changes which used several rapid clips of events which would link to then next scene. In Hot Fuzz its done constantly - which i found a bit distracting. That aside i sat with a smile on my face in between the moments i was laughing out loud.<br/><br/>This is definitely one for the DVD collection when its released.<br/><br/>8/10"
"colinTheBarSteward","9","1","2","6 February 2007"," Scorching
","I feel compelled to put a comment in on this film. I am a big fan of the Wright/Pegg/Frost combination, and was hoping for something in the vein of ""Spaced"" or ""Shaun of the Dead"" - which i wouldn't call this. The homages to film and television are still there (i'm sure it will take three or four viewings to spot them all), but Simon Pegg and Nick Frost don't have the comfort of basically just playing themselves this time - they have characters to portray, and they both pull it off admirably (especially Pegg, who he has demonstrated his acting skills on a number of programmes previously in the UK).<br/><br/>This film is also more plot driven than ""Spaced"" or ""Shaun..."", and as such i think more accessible to audiences who maybe won't see or aren't interested in the *nudge-nudge* pop culture references. There are belly-laugh funny lines that don't require an intimate knowledge of George Lucas's universe, ""Resident Evil"" or electro music; (some lines WILL be much funnier if you've seen ""Shaun of the Dead"" first, though). The cameos alone (just glance through the cast list...) will be enough to satisfy those of us who would have appreciated an homage-o-meter to spot all the single shot or two-word references to films both classic and cheesy.<br/><br/>Anyway... skip to the end...<br/><br/>I do have reservations about the last two minutes or so, and it isn't the trickiest 'whodunnit' to work out (obviously i can't be specific - i'm not writing any spoilers in this one, but it isn't as blatant as i've made it sound either); but these points certainly weren't enough to ruin what was a top-notch piece of cinematic entertainment. Apart from an open air showing of ""Enter the Dragon"" at Glastonbury, it was the happiest, loudest, liveliest cinema audience i've ever been privileged to sit amongst."

","Having read so many rave reviews on this site I reckon a little balance is needed. My ears are still ringing from my viewing last night in Manchester, I don't think I've ever been so overwhelmed by the volume, wish I'd been watching this on DVD then I could've turned it down (or off, though I think I would've soldiered on to the end - it is a British film after all).<br/><br/>The fundamental flaw though is the script, way way too many tired gags, labouring of stereotypes which don't allow any of the characters to grow. Even Carry On films allowed some character development. Given the limitations of the script the acting is generally good, but given the abundance of British stars here one would jolly well hope so. Exceptions to this were Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan, who would've been better off phoning their lines in.<br/><br/>If you're a Pegg et al fan, this review won't stop you going to see this film.

","I wanted to like this movie having enjoyed ""Sean of the Dead"" but I was very much disappointed. The movie was incredibly loud and quite bad. The plot is explained elsewhere on this site and, in fairness, is woven quite well. But the noisy soundtrack and an excess of overacting, result in a thoroughly negative experience. Most of the best jokes are already spent in the trailers. There are a couple of moments that are surprising and, in one instance towards the end of the film, grossly funny, but the film is a huge waste of time and money; I can say that, having spent £13 in a Leicester Square cinema, where the experience should have been one of elation, I wasted my money. I could see where they wanted to go with this: a spoof on the Hollywood slam-bang cop/ buddy film, with a Brirish slant and location. To see the likes of Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward and others reduced to this level was laughable, but not funny. A neat idea wasted."

","The comedic activities of the police force has been portrayed through countless films, mostly with idiotic results. But what happens when you combine Lethal Weapon with Dirty Harry and Shaun of the Dead? You get an ingenious new look on the fuzz.<br/><br/>As the best police officer that London has to offer, Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is reassigned to the crime-free village of Sandford, because his amazing skills makes every other London police officer look really bad at their work. Once here, and partnered with the overeager Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the village begins experiencing a number of grisly accidents, and Angel believes that there is more to these accidents then meets the eye.<br/><br/>The story surrounding Hot Fuzz is initially simple which helps the viewer gets comfortable with the setting. Yet as events takes place, the film begins to become a little more complicated but it never reaches the point where a viewer would fail to understand what is happening. Instead the story is clever in execution, allowing for a mystery to finally be solved in the usual police fashion. Overall, the story is exceptionally told with its flowing pace that never slumps, and the humorous tendencies imposed within, luckily, do not go to make the story weaker in any way.<br/><br/>The film, as the comedy it is, is littered with the typical British comedy, black comedy and a couple of hilarious oddities. While not exactly a parody, as Hot Fuzz does not go out to make fun of particular movies, it is comprised of virtually minute-to-minute laughs and like any good comedy, has its share of serious moments.<br/><br/>What makes Hot Fuzz so much better then it already is, is the great standard of acting, not only by Pegg and Frost, but by the rest of the cast as well. Each actor/ actress plays their character with utmost realism, and the characters all fall into place with some awesome chemistry.<br/><br/>For a comedy, Hot Fuzz contains some gruesome deaths. While the gore factor is not on par with Shaun of the Dead, it does have its fair share of blood, be it being stabbing or shooting, and even one victim having his head smashed by a giant piece of concrete. Assisting the violent nature of the film ,there is a fair share of language. While sporadic at first, the films characters do begin to utter the F word quite frequently.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz brings the best elements of comedy, with the fine intervention of great storytelling and some down right good acting. If not for the violent nature of the murders and excessive language use, Hot Fuzz could have been more accessible, but nonetheless, the film proves that British comedy has not only the staying power, but the ability to be better then their American counterparts.<br/><br/>--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---"

That's not to say there aren't funny parts Point Break references are always welcome in my house but nonetheless charm can only go so far.<br/><br/>The film seems like the work of a person with multiple personality disorder at times constantly shifting with no warning from Action to Comedy to Murder Mystery(or was that supposed to be dark comedy?) unfortunately this makes the films feel like no genre in particular, I felt a bit alienated by the film to tell you the truth, though I stuck with it to the end to see how it turned out.<br/><br/>I was rewarded with a pretty awesome action sequence which I felt was the perfect way to deal with the characters situation. But then well, it turns out we've just had the wool pulled over our eyes. I wont spoil the movie but immediately after the epic sequence the Film just turns and sucker punches you, betrays the build up it spent almost an hour and a half making and then continues to a silly touching ending as if nothing had happened. This facet to the film(trust me you'll recognize what I'm talking about when you see it, it makes everything unsatisfying) really screwed it up for me, if they hadn't done that and just kept it going the way it was I probably would've rated it an 8.<br/><br/>As it stands ""Hot Fuzz"" is a humorous/weird film quite possibly one of the weirdest I've ever seen, that stirs around and aims for the stars but ultimately winds up finding itself very comfortable in mediocrity."

Two words here you might not like to read...it isn't. Lampoons,irony skits,parody,satire,call the genre whatever you wish but it is not easy to do well.Poor satire is a cheap and easy way of getting laughs on the back of other people's hard work and ""Hot Fuzz"" never veers from the obvious path for its whole length. Cop shows generally have become self - parodying,there's no point in taking the p*ss out of actors like Keanu Reeves who are already taking the p*ss out of earlier action movies in the first place. To the millions out there who clearly love seeing blood spilled in an ""ironic"" way I can only say ""duh?"" If ""Hot Fuzz"" really is funnier than ""Shaun of the dead"" then I would say my decision not to go and see the latter was - for me - the right one. And witless mugging is not great comic acting either. If you want to see a great genre parody watch ""Dead men don't wear plaid"".It has no gouts of blood,no bad language - but it has charm and wit by the shed load.Both of which are conspicuous by their absence in ""Hot Fuzz"" I'm afraid."

"moviesleuth2","6","1","3","17 January 2009"," Good, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing
","Let me start off by saying that British comedy is not my thing. On the whole, I don't care for Monty Python, and I didn't care for ""A Fish Called Wanda"" (though I loved ""Death at a Funeral""). And that's what ""Hot Fuzz"" is: a British comedy.<br/><br/>Nicholas Angel takes being a policeman very seriously (meaning he's obsessed with it). But he's so good that his superiors transfer him to a little village in the middle of nowhere. Of course, he's a fish out of water there, as no one there gives a damn. But when he starts shaking things up, some startling ""accidents"" arise...<br/><br/>Even if you're not a fan of British comedy, there's plenty of material worth a couple of grins, though not enough to warrant a viewing. One of the strange things about ""Hot Fuzz"" is that even though it's clearly a satire, Simon Pegg makes Nicholas Angel into a fully three-dimensional character. Satires exist for the sole purpose of poking fun at character types, which the film does, but Angel is someone who displays a full range of emotion. That makes him more interesting, and dare I say it, sympathetic.<br/><br/>Other name actors are on hand to add to the fun. Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, and in a one scene cameo, an unrecognizable Cate Blanchett (she's hidden in a biomedical suit). Nick Frost is Angel's dimwitted sidekick, who shows him the ropes, and again, he's a character we begin to care about as well.<br/><br/>As I'm not a fan of this type of humor, I can't really judge how well it succeeds. But director Edgar Wright knows what he's doing, except when it comes to the action sequences. The constantly moving camera isn't successful, and gets pretty annoying.<br/><br/>Still, I guess it warrants a viewing if you're into this sort of thing."
"CarlSolomon","8","1","3","20 August 2008"," That's entertainment!
","Hot Fuzz Directed by Edgar Wright<br/><br/>The puns and general playfulness of British comedy seem to permeate Hot Fuzz as well as a regard for popular culture well beyond most. But Edgar Wright who wrote the slight but entertaining Shaun of the Dead transplants the typical cop movie to Britain. This trip gives the movie an apparent sense of political awareness, I was not aware of going in. At first it struck me as a trifle of Monty Python pathos, but the underlying commentary on the genre and culture were too large to ignore. <br/><br/>A masterful cop, Nicholas Angel (played by Simon Pegg, in his second collaboration with Wright), is moved from the London Police Department to that of a small English town. He is told the reason is because ""you continue to be exceptional, and we can't have that. You make the others look bad."" In this seemingly idyllic town of Sandford, he uncovers a conspiracy, representing Suburban and cop movie's paranoia as much as an internal war to keep order that comes at great cost. It's a commentary that could reach up to the higher levels of our government.<br/><br/>Its violent big finish, coming mere weeks after Virginia Tech is more in the name of sending up human nature than for mere entertainment and Pegg's character insists that the cop's most powerful tool is his notebook. Still the sequence mocks our numbness to violence by accentuating it. The Virginia Tech non-issue should be viewed as such because of the network's own broadcast of much more harmful violence all week long.<br/><br/>It's not snobby or condescending to police films either, it pays tribute to Bad Boys 2 more than it needs too, but pays tribute to what is genuinely virtuous about these movies by showing people finding their place in a community and enforcing justice. The conspiracy complicates when the festively plump and incompetent son (Nick Frost) of the conspiracy's hooded leader and ironically also the town's police chief befriends Angel. The two are an odd pairing, but compelling nonetheless and can restore faith in the virtues of team work in the law force.<br/><br/>Contrasting all this with Best Picture winner The Departed whose own seriousness about internal affairs takes all the excitement and irony out of violence while representing a failure to expose it. It's own clockwork intensity and seriousness contrast with the relaxed brilliance and satiric edge of Hot Fuzz whose payoffs are dense and emotional not cold and necessary. <br/><br/>Its adoration for the action movie and by extension the Western, exposes our own ambivalence to cultural decay. But Fuzz proves that the best medicine for that is laughter and it's own political commentary more than disproves it's own possible ambivalence, but counters our own. Hot Fuzz while an irresistible satire including jokes on small town cops also manages to toy with the idea of a Utopian humor community where everything is give and take."

"billion_mucks","5","1","3","17 January 2008"," Not as Hot as I Thought
","""Hot Fuzz"" triumphs over it's structural shape: a simple and daring parody over today's Blockbusters and over the top action flicks. The triple army formed by Wright directing and Frost and Pegg in the acting couple led to a sensational Shaun of the Dead, product of a smart, poignant sense of humor. Maybe I was wrongly advised as this movie is shaded on it's humorous side by the policial- crime story told. A crime movie inflates the brain and doubles the attention rate and lateral thought, things that a comedy doesn't require.<br/><br/>This bizarre mix comes into mysterious crimes, multiple twists and shootings in a Dream City with a powerful and vivid image. It's funny moments are not few, many of them very good and ""laugh out loud"" hilarious, but its paradoxical relationship between genres doesn't end closing. It's a non-stop mix between relax and pay complete focus. It's not a mix of genres, but of intentions.<br/><br/>Besides that, HF has plenty of technical games, like a fast, modern editing and union of scenes with double meaning and plenty of innuendos. This movie is very smart, that's for sure, but maybe comparing it to Shaun of the Dead I can say they have lowered one step of the ladder and gone into a completely different one."
"dennisvansant","9","1","3","21 December 2007"," When comedy masterminds reunite...
","Wow. Just wow. That was my reaction the first time I had finished watching ""Shaun of the Dead"", the masterpiece that had put British comedy on the map again in a large scale. Perfect casting, extremely original storytelling resulted in the making of a one-of-a-kind ""rom zom com"", as it was affectionately called by its cast and crew.<br/><br/>When I first heard the cast and crew were going to reunite to make another film, my expectations were soring to previously unexplored heights. The thing that appeals to me most in Wright's work is that he doesn't make stale parodies, but actual homages to the genre he's focusing on at that particular time. ""Shaun"" was a great visual representation of how a five-star zombie movie scenario might take place in a London suburb, and in ""Hot Fuzz"" they try and figure out how a huge Hollywood action movie might look in the small countryside village of Stanford.<br/><br/>The movie starts off a bit slow for the first twenty-or-so minutes, but the same could very well be said for ""Shaun"". Wright takes his time to unfold the storyline and get all pieces set up for the actual events that shake the very foundations of the rustic little village. After the first half hour, the movie starts flying past your eyes at an incredible rate. The movie is just about two hours long, but it feels like half an hour, and in my book that's a very good sign, because time always flies when you're having fun.<br/><br/>The comic duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost once again do a great job, Bill Nighy (stepfather Philip in ""Shaun"" and of course Davy Jones in the latest installments of ""Pirates"") has a rather minor part as the Met Chief Inspector Kenneth, but pulls it off wonderfully. The characters in the movie are all very ""British"", by which I mean they are very extreme. Every character in ""Hot Fuzz"" is a stereotype of what these people look like in other movies. The pious vicar, the nervous gossip, the scary old landlady, and so on. This interesting mix of characters makes ""Hot Fuzz"" all the more fun to watch.<br/><br/>On top of all that, the film makers don't take themselves very seriously, and have added plenty of blatant references to ""Shaun of the Dead"" and other movies they admire.<br/><br/>I might not say this very often, but if these people are able to come up with a quality Britcom like this every three years or so, they can keep doing it as far as I'm concerned, there are plenty of different genres I'd like to see a homage of. Mafia movies perhaps? Or maybe even fantasy? 9/10 well earned, and the only reason I am not giving this a 10 is because I do not believe in perfection..."

","The best thing about this movie is in the extra features. By turning on the ""fuzz facts"", the viewer can read subtitles relaying minor errors, historical significance, and quirky edits, shots and story plots that are missed in the first viewing.

Thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>This feature definitely changes this title from an 8 (for being funny as the parody comedy it is) to a 9.<br/><br/>This movie is watchable twice (or more....) a very very hard comedic feat, making it an obvious A lister.<br/><br/>Up there with my favorite films, but not quite......"
"bsible","9","1","3","20 November 2007"," Highly Enjoyable
","Released in 2007, Hot Fuzz is written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, the same men who brought you Shaun of the Dead in 2004. The same director also directs it: Edgar Wright, and it headlines the same actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I was a little unsure of this film at first until I looked at the credits, and after seeing it in the theaters I am an avid fan. The film focuses on Nicholas Angel (Pegg), an overachieving police constable in London who is sent to a country post because he is outperforming all of his other officers. Upon arriving in the sleepy town of Sandford strange accidents start happening and Angel is the sole person believing something more sinister may be going on. Paired with the slightly dopey and often-hilarious police constable Danny Butterman (Frost), who is coincidentally the son of the local Inspector; Angel must perform his duties while trying to stay sane in a town where it seems everyone is mad but him.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best comedies I have seen in years. It is smart and quick witted, always keeping me on the edge of my feet. Much of the comedy is dry 'British"" humor so if that's not something you enjoy you might not be that thrilled with this movie until the second half. However if that is something you do enjoy, this film is certainly not lacking in it in any way. In addition to the humor, it does have its fair share of action and gore, much like Shaun of the Dead. For those of you who don't like gore, have no fear because it is all done in a humorous context. Hot Fuzz also has a lot of references to other films such as Bad Boys II and Point Break, so it might be a good idea to see those before you see this movie.<br/><br/>This is an excellently written movie with some great action sequences. Definitely check out the Trivia section on the IMDb page for some extra goodies to look out for. Also, keep your eye out for a couple of cameos in the movie (they're hard to spot). Ironically, I own the DVD and last week is the first time I noticed all of the bonus features, which are definitely worth checking out. Two features in particular are: Danny's Notebook- The Other Side, and Outtakes. Who ever was in charge of the notebook is very skilled with a pen and had a lot of time on their hands. The Outtakes section had me doubled over laughing, both from the obscenity of some of the scenes and seeing how much fun everyone had making the movie. So if you love comedy, violence and action, and gore you should not just see this movie but buy the DVD so you can enjoy the twisted minds of Wright and Pegg over and over again."

","Another masterpiece by Mr.Edgar Wright . The movie can not be categorized under any genre this is undoubtedly the mixture of feelings which makes you laugh hard and on the other hand scares the heck out of you meanwhile your romantic senses are tearing your heart out this movie is really something. While it takes you in very normal and calm village with normal people trying to convince the audience as if they are innocent and kind suddenly the movie changes the phase somehow that you can not believe it . I believe it is a work of art when a movie can make you laugh love and scared at the same time which is incredible. I'd really suggest this one to every one. Regards Vahid"

","Seemingly one of the very few who did not think 'Shaun of the Dead' particularly funny, I was not expecting too much from this. How wrong can you be? I won't go into my reservations about the earlier film but it struck me as a bit juvenile at times, whereas this, despite its slightly off putting title is a very fine piece of comic cinema. It barely puts a flat foot wrong, with its witty and effective soundtrack, its fine performances all round and its funniness. This is a most assured and knowing work. From the ferocious and daring opening, in which Simon Pegg's character is fully illustrated in a matter of seconds to the great effects and twists and turns, we are engaged throughout. For me the ending is just a little too drawn out but it is such fun I feel churlish to complain. Many have declared that if you like Shaun you'll like this and just for those very few out there like me I say, even if you didn't like Shaun, you will love this."

","Having loved 'Shaun of the Dead', the arrival of this film appeared as a bright light on the horizon during a time when my interest in films had reached an all time low. Having not seen any films for months the trip out to the cinema was tense with excitement - this film would either renew my enthusiasm for the film industry or cement my disinterest. Sitting as we did for Shaun of the Dead, my friend and I were not entirely sure what to expect from this film.<br/><br/>The light dimmed, and the sirens began to howl gradually opening to a beautifully composed opening shot - only cutting to begin one of the best edited opening sequences ever presented on film. That was it - everything else going on in my life at that time vanished from my mind as I was strapped in for 2 hours of pure entertainment. The initial pace of London is broken, as our protagonist Nicholas Angel is thrown into the country. The pace is initially slow in Sandford, but the film is very kinetic - with the energy of the film building throughout until reaching a crescendo with an extended shootout in town.<br/><br/>This film has so much going for it - superb directing, an excellent cast and well written script. Hot Fuzz is funny - I laughed (actually out loud) more times than I could count - but it also mounted the tension, and had me excitedly awaiting the action. Boy does the action deliver.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick frost are together again - the result? One of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Bring the noise!"

I once read an article in Empire film magazine that hes the English Robert De niro and if you watch Dead Mans Shoes or Stoned you will see hes a great British hope.Getting back to the film i thought everyone was performing out of their skins and it was so easy for Simon Pegg to get unnoticed playing the straight guy but his performance was disciplined and effective and Frost has to always always play along side him."

You think you are dealing with a comedy until the plot is revealed (I was trapped as I thought what the plot was until it caught me by surprise, I had not watched their source, which I will not tell here), which is great because at the beginning you are just laughing at the misfortunes of this big town policeman in a small peaceful village.

","After doing a good job and making other officers look bad, a detective is transferred to a sleepy village where everything is done for the greater good. Soon, he begins to clean up... but there's a killer on the loose! So this vacation gets a bit more exciting because this silt just got real.<br/><br/>As I write this, this film is ranked the 148th greatest film of all time. I'm sorry, it's not that good. ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a better film, I can name a dozen better comedies. This was good, but not that good. More often than not it just drags on and offers nothing original to the long list of movies it follows. I mean, it's primary gags rely on ripping off ""Bad Boys II"" and ""Point Break"" (see my review of this elsewhere). How is that clever? The beginning is funny, but stops after maybe ten minutes. One character is interesting -- the supposed killer (played by Timothy Dalton) who ""slashes prices"" and has deals that are ""criminal"". I think without him and his theme music the entire movie would have been a failure.<br/><br/>The basic plot is not unlike ""The Wicker Man"". The creators clearly acknowledge this by having the original actor from ""Wicker Man"" appear (I believe his name is Edward Woodward). And I'll tell you, I enjoyed the original film much better (though I think ""Hot Fuzz"" is better than the Nicolas Cage remake). This just doesn't have the timeless quality and weird musical undertones.<br/><br/>If you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"", you'll like this. Maybe you'll even like it better. Maybe you're like everyone else and think this is one of the greatest films ever. I don't get it, but if someone could clue me in I'd be happy to give the film a second chance. It runs too long, goes too slow and just doesn't hold my attention. At least it has some good murder scenes."
"bjmartin21","9","1","3","8 August 2007"," Brilliant once again
","It's no secret that film parodies tend to be boring and disposable, partly because they don't have any ideas of their own and partly because they lack any true familiarity with or affection for their source material. Coming from a style that generally has so little to offer, the visually and verbally brilliant movies of the English creative team of Simon Pegg (writer-actor) and Edgar Wright (writer-director), along with actor Nick Frost, are a glorious exception to the rule. And coming off the underground success of the wildly enjoyable zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead, Pegg, Wright, and Frost are back with Hot Fuzz, a more conventionally action-oriented romp that still manages to be every bit as hilarious, innovative, and bloody as its predecessor.<br/><br/>Much like Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz is as much homage as parody, drawing inspiration from buddy comedies, Hollywood action schlock, and mystery thrillers without ever descending into a tired rehash of any of those genres. Sure, the clichés of the styles it sends up are lovingly embraced throughout, but always with a wink and a nod, along with an obvious knowledge of the conventions the movie is drawing from. Even more impressive is the way the movie effortlessly maintains its momentum through constant shifts in tone. Slapstick, dry British wit, high-speed action and (moderately) heavy drama are all commingled so seamlessly it's easy not to notice, and even in the movie's most dramatic moments Pegg and Wright prove masterful at throwing in a joke to keep things from getting too serious.<br/><br/>While its twist-laden plot is pretty interesting, Hot Fuzz is driven mainly by the pitch-perfect chemistry (both comedic and dramatic) of Pegg and Frost in the lead roles as Nick Angel and Danny Butterman, an odd-couple pairing of cops who get partnered up in a bucolic English village. Pegg makes a brilliant straight man as the initially humorless and straight-laced Nick, while Frost provides comic relief as the overweight, arrested development-gripped buffoon, but one of the most impressive aspects of the movie is how its two principals manage to transcend one-dimensional types and emerge as fully fleshed-out characters. Even with all the mayhem and hilarity going on around them, the offbeat relationship between Nick and Danny keeps the proceedings firmly grounded in reality.<br/><br/>Aside from a few madcap set pieces, the movie's pacing is actually rather drawn-out and deliberate, but Wright still directs it with his signature high style, filled with jarring edits, repetitive tics, and some gory money shots that must be seen to be believed. There aren't a lot of directors out there whose work is instantly recognizable--Wes Anderson is a notable exception, and David Fincher comes pretty close--but Wright is quickly forcing his way into that club. The combination of Wright's directorial flair and the intelligence of the script is more than enough to make Hot Fuzz a worthy successor to Shaun of the Dead in the Pegg-Wright-Frost catalogue. I'm already joyfully anticipating their next effort."
"hereontheoutside","8","1","3","4 August 2007"," Wright, Pegg and Frost are the future of comedy cinema...
","The Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost teams' second feature film brings equal amounts of parody and gore from their first venture 'shaun of the Dead.' Their parody of the cop/buddy film constantly quotes and lifts from films like 'Chinatown' and 'Bad Boys 2.' Perfectly ripping the common conventions like the cop who can't pick up a gun again, the mismatched police beat team and others, but manages to combine them into a screenplay that is not only hilarious but a clever murder mystery as well. The pace never slows as overachiever Sgt. Angel (Simon Pegg) is relocated from London's Met to England's ""safest village,"" Sandford, and he begins to discover that all of the accidents that Sanford reports may not be so accidental after all. The film only increases in vigilantism and knotted detective work as the film progresses. Expertly executed action montages keep the pace and faux-action flowing, even in the paperwork sequences which inevitably follow all arrests. Something Sgt. Angel points out as flaws in cop films like 'Point Break' that his partner Danny (Nick Frost) admires. The film is engaging as both comedy and detective film, culminating in an epic fistfight at a miniature model of the Sandford. Sgt. Angel and Danny stand at the edge of the model village, as the battle seems to be over, ""I feel like I should say something smart,"" Angel says. ""You don't have to say anything at all,"" Danny replies. The film is a near perfect parody that can only make filmgoers excited for the possibilities of futures Wright/Pegg/Frost ventures."

","The best comedy I have seen this year or probably the last couple of years this movie had me laughing and cheering on our heroes. In this movie we have a super cop who has gotten numerous awards for his excellent service, top of his class, and smart too. Unfortunately, he is to good in that he makes the other officers in London look bad so he is promoted to Sergent in a very small and quaint little town. Once there he quickly makes his presence known and we get to see him adjust to his new life and even a new partner. Well not really a new partner as he is more of a guy who really looks up to the officer for all he has done. However, all is not as it seems in this nice little town as something sinister seems to be at play. This movie is just great. Funny, and it has loads of action and blood too. It is sort of nice to see a rated R action cop movie again. Throw in a plot that actually surprised me a bit and it a nice change of pace from the the computer terrorist plots so many movies are employing and you have one of the great films of the year. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are great here as they were in Shaun of the Dead, they are also likable as it is like joining a couple of friends at a day on the job. Also in the cast is a former James Bond, Timothy Dalton so that was interesting as well. Still even with the cool action scenes what I was looking for here was laughs and I got plenty, from the opening scenes to the final ones the jokes flew fast and furious with a few sentimental touches as well, however, they added to the movie and worked quite nicely too. So for a super funny cop buddy flick this should be on your list of one of the best."

It's a tale about a transfered city cop out of his element in a country village where a gallery of quirky characters aren't what they seem. A series of deaths has the new cop in town figuring out that there must be some kind of conspiracy. The townsfolk are pleasant enough but something isn't quite right.

"twistedmetal1412","9","1","3","12 May 2007"," laugh riot of this year. for me forever! :)
","I guess i could watch this movie again and again. It's been a while since i watched a movie which helped me to laugh out loud, but god help me i was laughing almost every moment of this movie when every joke jumped out at me and how Sergeant Angel tries to adjust to his village life. The whole storyline's quite ridiculous, but frankly, that's what makes it so funny! I guess everyone should try to understand that nothing is what it seems, probably, at the end of the film, but the jokes that jump out at your face are pacey and it'll take sometime to recover from the blow.Direction by Edgar Wright is superb - for example,the fake knife wound by Danny, is prolonged. You'll see what i mean. Acting by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg is brilliant. Simon Pegg is perfect as the law abiding, dedicated officer and Nick Frost is just as fitting for his role of the bumbling and totally useless assistant to Sergeant Angel.<br/><br/>However,for such a comedy movie, it's pretty gory, which some viewers may not stand. There are several scenes which are pretty much bloody, and it could have qualified as a thriller as well, had there not been so much levity. But who cares? Hot Fuzz is worthy of the rating i'm giving it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants - basically - to have a good laugh. Humour,here,however,is pretty high level.So don't miss out on anything, or you'd be left reeling in the cinema, asking ""What did he say? What did he say?"" to a disgruntled companion.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up. Watch it. And recommend it. And own it. :)"
"Bob Pr.","8","1","3","10 May 2007"," A parody of movie/TV shows about cops & bad guys
","The ""Inspector Morse"" or Helen Mirren's series on PBS is about as far as I go in this police genre but ""Hot Fuzz"" is a good parody of all cop films, clashes between the cops and bad guys. Having seen few of them, I missed the many scene quotes but could readily believe there were hundreds. The film is like a Saturday Night Live or Monty Python view of the genre.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, the first third sets up the viewer for the following two-thirds.<br/><br/>While there is considerable violence, it's so over the top it creates no flinching. Guns blaze, hundreds of rounds of ammo are fired, and no one drops.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the subtle(?) twitting of a particular social group about their desire to have everything ""nice and in good taste"" so it's a cardinal sin to depart from that. That segment of English society has no monopoly on such a view, of course, but here they represent that attitude in cultures other than just the UK.<br/><br/>Good fun."

","When I heard the SOTD team was making another movie, I was like OMG I HAVE to see it! I went out and seen it at the theatre, and I must admit, I was pretty amused. It's some pretty funny stuff. It had a solid story line, good actors and moved along quite nicely. It is basically about this awesome cop, who goes above and beyond the call of duty. He is the best of the best, and it makes his comrades, and superiors look bad. So, they bump him of the city beat, to a hick town with no action so that he can't make everyone look so bad. While in town his first night, he seems to enforce the law to the extent. He about arrests the entire town from underage drinking to looking at people the wrong way. He even arrested his partner - not knowing it was his partner until the next day. It is a pretty good flick, and my hat is off to the SOTD team, they got past the first movie, and I think we'll see more of the SOTD team's movies in the future!"
"BA_Harrison","7","1","3","7 May 2007"," Silly, dumb, stupid, daftand quite a lot of fun.
","Over-hyped. Yes! Over-rated. Probably.<br/><br/>But, for those with a quirky sense of humour (and an appreciation of small town mentality), Hot Fuzz is still loads of fun.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, the creators of the hugely successful zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead, reunite for this rather silly, but still enjoyable tale which sees a top Met police officer, Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg), transferred (thanks to his jealous colleagues) to the sleepy country town of Sandford.<br/><br/>At first Angel is bored by the lack of action, but he is soon back in his element after several of the town-folk are killed in mysterious circumstances. Aided by PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), he sets out to discover who is responsible for the gruesome slayings.<br/><br/>Utilising the offbeat, quick-fire comic style of Wright and Pegg's TV series Spaced, blended with the flashy editing techniques prevalent in much of today's Hollywood action movie output (which gets mercilessly mocked), Hot Fuzz is always amusing, occasionally hilarious, and eventually extremely daft.<br/><br/>Referencing an endless array of other movies (movie geeks will have a field day spotting these) and featuring some enjoyable scenes of OTT gore and the occasional hi-octane gunfight, Wright and Co. are obviously having a great time lampooning a genre they love. Only occasionally does the humour miss the target; most of the time it hits dead centre.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film takes a little too long to get going, but it eventually slips into gear and becomes much more enjoyable. Then, just as you think it has come to a satisfactory ending (at a point which is reminiscent of The Wicker Man), it becomes an all out OTT action flick, completely dispensing with reality and delivering one of the most ridiculous shoot-outs ever committed to film. How you process this part of the film depends entirely on your particular sense of humour (and, perhaps on your nationalityI think it helps to be English), but fans of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead are the most likely to 'get it'.<br/><br/>Initially, I am going to rate Hot Fuzz 7/10, which I imagine many might say is not high enough. Perhaps after another viewing, with my expectations not quite so ridiculously high (thanks to the hype), my rating might go up."

","So the other day I saw the newest creation of the ingenious writers of Shaun of the Dead and Spaced. Now, my expectations were high (Pegg and Frost are two of my favorite actors), they weren't that big because many people claimed that Shaun was still funnier.<br/><br/>They were extremely wrong.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz, while still managing to be very serious a lot of the time, is one of the funniest movies I've seen in my life (not an exaggeration). Seeing it opening day, the audience I was with applauded for at least 4 different one-liners that the comic geniuses said on-screen.<br/><br/>Now, the acting here is seriously the best ensemble I've seen in a many in a long time. Each and every character is amazingly well-played, they all interact phenomenally...the cast was simply perfect. Of course, it goes without saying that Simon and Nick were fantastic as Angel and Butterman.<br/><br/>The action was, without doubt, the best part of this movie. If you think that, because it's a comedy, the epicness will be toned down, then you are insanely mistaken. Think every single gun imaginable, high speed car chases, a series of brutal murders (one of them being so intense, in fact, that our audience was in a state of shock and awe at the same time...one of the most brilliant deaths I've ever seen on-screen), explosions, fist fights, stabs, blood, martial arts, and a final fight scene so action-packed that it will leave your jaw hanging...and your gut laughing.<br/><br/>I won't give too much away (seriously, this movie surprised me so many times), but this is a MUST-SEE for ANY fan of comedy movies or action movies. I know many people loved this year's earlier blockbuster 300 (myself included). But Hot Fuzz made 300 look like a Disney cartoon and made the deaths in Saw look comfortable.<br/><br/>10 outta 10 freakin action packed hot-fuzzy stars!"

","wow, was my first words after seeing Shawn and his buddy from Shawn of the Dead, and knowing that these two English comedians were going to be in yet another film, but none other then Rogue pictures, I knew I was in for a ride. But a ride is an understatement, as its more of a Huge roller coaster trip while being on Morphine (though I've never had it im pretty sure this is what it would feel like). Now, to continue it starts of like OK, wheres his buddy, for a while, but gives you some good laughs, only to find you the next ten seconds with even greater laughs, et cetra et cetra. The pure gold between this is the cinematography, in which the continuous fresh guns and active reloads, only to be surpassed by the surprising element, that only fight club and resiviour dogs could even come to par. Now with that being said, is this the greatest movie beating Fight Club, Resiviour dogs, the Good the bad, and the Ugly, No. but it is a must see, and a movie that you can watch over with friends of all sort and get probably one of the biggest laughs this year, and many to come. and i went to a 42 cinema, so i went to a big theater and Dallas, and the place was packed, i guarantee you once the movie ended nobody wanted it to, and it got a standing ovation that I haven't seen since Lord of the Rings the Return of the King, and it beat it.

"jilliangreene","10","1","3","20 April 2007"," Hot Fuzz is Naked Gun funny, but it's also an homage ala Pulp Fiction
","Hot Fuzz is great fun. I went with as few expectations as possible, since I loved Shaun of the Dead and I didn't want to be disappointed. Well, not to worry as Hot Fuzz is easily as well done as Shaun. The plot and characters are so well written that I got caught up from the first. The film is meant to be an homage to buddy action films that have gone before, and truth be told it's a straight guy love story. It is so well done, with no real question of ""are they gay?"", but definitely played for laughs. Simon and Nick's on screen relationship is so well developed, and they make it all seem so effortless, that I wonder how much acting they really do? They obviously were having a blast, which lends itself to the film. Everything was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. I mean I was actually laughing part of the time at nothing more than the timing of scene cuts. But they were brilliant cuts! <br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see the film on opening day, and then to hear a talk with director Edgar Wright, and actors Simon Pegg & Nick Frost. They were introduced by Quentin Tarantino who is the most fitting person for that job, as Edgar Wright is the Brit's version of him. Edgar spoke about his love of old movies and how important the process of writing character and plot comes first, and then adding the comedy is the gravy. I think that's also why Shaun is so good. <br/><br/>Simon said he never for one moment forgot that he was kicking 007's ass. Tim Dalton told him he'd never had so much fun making a film, to which Simon replied, ""Even more than James Bond?"" and Tim said, ""Oh, yeah."" <br/><br/>I'm not going to go on, except to say, Go See It! You'll be glad you did."

The gunfight between the old people (who are actually the bad guys) of the town of Sanford and Pegg/Frost at the end is hysterical. <br/><br/>You can't understand a single word Timothy Dalton says, but who gives a rip?

"jon2005","8","1","3","4 April 2007"," Hot Fuzz
","With Shaun of the Dead, the Edgar Wright-Simon Pegg team created a wonderfully funny fantasy that was universally loved. The big question was, could they follow it up with another hit? And the answer is: of course they can. Hot Fuzz is extremely witty and action packed, and although it may not be quite as high as Shaun of the Dead in the realms of action-comedy, it is certainly not far off.<br/><br/>This time around Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, the antithesis of Shaun; a London policeman that is so good at his job it makes everyone else look bad. Because of this, his superiors decide to relocate him to the village of Sandford in Somerset. There he meets the bumbling but well-meaning Danny (Frost), and after a series of accidents, soon begins to suspect that the village is hiding something. <br/><br/>As always, the humour is in the writing instead of just in visual gags and, like Shaun, it is very well written. However, the buck has passed from Simon Pegg onto Nicholas Frost  this is because Angel is such a serious, straight-faced guy that the humour relies on other people to play off him, rather than let him be part of it. But Frost succeeds admirably, proving himself as a vital member of the creative trio. Danny is naïve but constantly trying to prove himself, his good nature often conflicting with Angel; he is always asking about the city life: ""Have you ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?"" he asks. ""No"" deadpans Angel. ""Have you ever fired one gun whilst jumping through the air?"" As such, Pegg has little to do other than be the butt of the jokes but, like any good buddy film, he lightens up soon enough to get back to the Pegg we all recognise. <br/><br/>The action scenes are well handled in the capable hands of Edgar Wright, but they do lack the sophistication of the best action films that really make you want to be there shooting the hell out of stuff along side the good guys. Also, when the action kicks in towards the end, the comedy gets sidelined, the laughter stemming from the extremes of action violence rather than the clever writing, and this makes the tone feel slightly uneven, the film unable to balance all its elements as effectively as we would hope.<br/><br/>Still, the reason why Hot Fuzz is so much better than most other parodies/homages is because it doesn't need to drill in any aspect of its references. Whilst it openly refers to action film such as Bad Boys II and Point Break (Danny shows these films to Angel during the film), the cleverness results in not heavy-handedly referencing its sources, instead making them a more subtle 'guess-the-movie' style of parody (notice the Tony Scott editing style during the processing of arresting youths, for example). <br/><br/>Some fine cameos from some of our best comedians and TV stars, along with a great pantomime performance from Timothy Dalton as the obvious bad guy, adds to the mix with great charm, and along with some great set pieces will ensure that Hot Fuzz, although not quite as creative as Shaun of the Dead, will still become one of the finest comedies of recent times.<br/><br/>Rated: 8/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Hot Fuzz comes to us from the genius's behind ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg). It stars Pegg as Nicholas Angel, a London Policeman Officer whos arrest rate is 200% above anyone else. So the Chief Constable (Bill Nighy) sends him to be a Sargeant in the sleepy little village of Sandford - The safest village in Britain. There he meets Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) who is a policeman. Danny is an action fanatic who, when he learns about Angels stabbing, starts to look upto him. When strange things start to happen in Sandford, Nick decides he has got to bust things wide open. This film has an all-star British cast: Jim Broadbent(Only Fools And Horses, The Borrowers), Steve Coogan(Alan Partridge, Saxondale), Paddy Considine(24 Hour Party People, Stoned), Edwood Woodward(The Wicker Man), Martin Freeman(Confetti, The Office), Rafe Spall(Shaun Of The Dead, Green Street) and Ex James Bond Timothy Dalton as an amazing baddie.

"monk_e_fish","8","1","3","27 March 2007"," It's no Shaun but it's pretty great
","Everybody loves zombies, not that many people love the police, and this is the problem with Hot Fuzz, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's latest. The constant film references don't inspire the same feelings of fond reminiscence that their earlier love letter to George Romero achieved. Quite frankly, a love letter to Michael Bay is not going to appeal on the same level. Furthermore, while the going nowhere lives of 20 somethings Tim, Daisy and Mike and, later, Shaun and Ed, were something that everyone could relate to even when faced with a zombie invasion, London supercop Nicholas Angel offers little to empathise with, meaning the early scenes suffer. Even the film's dazzling cast and cameos cause problems in these early stages, spotting an A-list actress behind the forensic mask as Angel's ex-girlfriend is entertaining but Bill Nighy, in particular, so excellent in Shaun of the Dead, is criminally underused. In fact, Hot Fuzz seems a bit over bloated in general, while Shaun was taut and tightly plotted, effectively gripping all the way through, Fuzz seems to run for a bit too long. Having got the complaints out of the way, it only comes now to say that Hot Fuzz is a hilariously entertaining film with a number of memorably great moments. Once you get beyond the fact that it is in no sense perfect and is, and could never be, as good as Shaun of the Dead, you will be in for a great night of fun. While most publicity and reviews have dwelt on the film as a British parody of the Bay-Bruckheimer style of action film-making, this is only really true of the final twenty minutes and even then it is hardly a balls-out action fest. If you're looking for a great Bruckheimer parody then look no further than Team America. For the most part, Hot Fuzz instead comes across as an episode of Midsomer Murders directed by Sam Raimi. Fortunately, this turns out to be quite a brilliant move as it manages to make the central portion of the movie into a silly, bloody murder mystery, playing brilliantly on the creepiness of small communities (The Wicker Man's Edward Woodward even appears as the meddling, petty head of the local neighbourhood watch). Hot Fuzz does nothing to tone down the gore of the boy's previous effort, either, with some truly entertaining deaths including one in which a local journalist is impaled by a spike from the church spire at the village fête. Yes, all the rural England clichés are intact and that is part of the joy of the film, that despite all of the Bad Boys references it is a resolutely British film and, like Shaun, much of it centres on the pub building once again to a shoot-out there. Meanwhile, quite possibly the finest of the film's many mixtures of cringeworthy rural life and big American movies involves no horror or action staple but is instead a horribly accurate am dram production of Romeo and Juliet, that's Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet complete with Juliet's angel wings, neon crucifixes and a musical performance of The Cardigans' Love Fool. Woodward is not the only high profile actor populating this small village with ex-Bond Timothy Dalton giving a delightfully fruity performance as the sinister manager of the local Somerfield. Meanwhile, the police force, composed of respected film actors and British comedy stars provide amusing support. In particular Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as the detectives who really don't want to do any detecting, their matching looks down to their facial hair is funny in itself and provides a great moment with a top lip covered in the head of a pint (""You've got a moustache"", ""I know""). In their sarcastic treatment of Angel's supercop eagerness, they also get to deliver the film's finest line. Of course, the film really revolves around the central pairing of Pegg and Nick Frost's PC Danny Butterman, the bumbling, naive and faintly childish son of Jim Broadbent's Inspector. After years of these best friends playing on screen best friends, here comes a film where they do not know each other at the start. Of course, the mismatched partners are quickly given the opportunity to slip into their old chemistry. This allows a little more humanity into Pegg's character as Angel lets up a bit in the face of Butterman's endearingly puppy dog enthusiasm (""What made you want to be a policeman?"", ""Officer"", ""What made you want to be a policeman, officer?""). Their pairing not just generating great dialogue but physical and visual comedy like their hamfisted attempts to catch a swan and the through garden chase that sees Butterman not quite capable of replicating Angel's athletic fence jumping technique. Frost is the film's heart and soul, his enthusiasm for action pictures and desire to be like the heroes in them is both charming and exasperating (""Have you ever fired two guns while jumping through the air?"", ""Have you ever fired one gun while jumping through the air?"", ""Is it true that there's a point on a man's head where if you shoot it, it will blow up?""), working especially well when he perceives Angel as like those heroes and tries to induct him into the ways of buddy cop action movies. Naturally, in the end the ""shit gets real"" and the film descends into car chases and shoot outs as promised on all the posters and trailers, frankly there are a little too many of these although the Somerfield shoot-out and the final moments in the model village are both great. Even though it's not Shaun of the Dead, you should certainly leave the cinema with a smile on your face and will no doubt be quoting for weeks afterwards. And quite rightly so, ""You wanna be a big cop in a small town? F*ck off to the model village!"" may be the best line you'll hear all year. ****"
"Nick1000","10","1","3","25 March 2007"," Better than Shaun of the Dead
","I wasn't expecting too much from this film which is why it's taken me this long to get to see it - I thought Shaun of the Dead was good but not great and I was expecting more of the same.<br/><br/>What a great surprise! After a slightly slow, scene setting, start the jokes just kept coming in a steady flow that kept a smile on my face throughout the entire film that was broken only by several moments of outright belly laughter and a few cringes at some gratuitously icky murders. IMHO what makes a great comedy is not a few great jokes but a sustained momentum as achieved in this film.<br/><br/>Towards the end you start suspecting the usual, rather anticlimactic sort of ending; But NO! Suddenly the film lurches into a new gear and your rushed through a roller-coaster ride of action that keeps you engrossed until the closing credits and everyone walks out arguing over which was the best bit.<br/><br/>For me the gag the got the biggest laugh was Frost's notebook - Typically for the film it just wouldn't be very funny describing it but the timing and presentation were perfect.<br/><br/>What I can't understand is why Pegg gets all the credit when Frost is the real funny-man.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the next one."

","English quintessence is nothing if not the humble country village  that non-threatening, twee piece of rural idyll where everyone and everything has been unmoved by the monstrous engine of industrial and sociological change. In Britain, where programmes are commissioned for an imaginary constituency of women, old women and the very old who can't leave the house, such pastures have become of staple of popular drama, enlivened by the occasionally grim but statistically improbable murder. So what if they drag like sin, are 'gentle' to the point of coma and less slick than a camcorder movie made by a person with Parkinson's who broke the image stabiliser  there will always be an England and we must look at it whether we want to or not.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is what happens when English people brought up on American Action blockbusters and buddy cop gunfests but lacking any manifest gun culture of their own, mine the very funny conceit of recasting a plodding Sunday tea time rural murder mystery as a Michael Bay-style actioner. A great idea because what could be further away from the world of Tony Scott, Bay and co than Gloustershire and the St. Mary Mead-esquire village green? Its been done before  the comic strip made two very funny 'action' versions of the fall of the GLC and the Miners Strike in the American mould, but those were parodies  Fuzz in contrast is more a valentine to the Bruckheimer stable, played for laughs but not the self-referential bore it might have been. That it has to be a movie in its own right is apparent from the off because the frantic, machine gun style of Wright would be hard to live with for two hours if there was no story per say, just the ticking of cliché boxes. His crash zooms, whip pans and fitting camera operators are like someone shouting ""I WENT TO FILM SCHOOL"" in your ear for 2 hours but it's a love for the b-movie form that puts a big silly grin all over your face. That said it's pure fan-boy masturbation, conflating everything from the Wicker Man to Straw Dogs along with numerous other movie and T.V references. It stays on the right side of affectionate however and rather than simply jumping in with exchanges of fire and explosions, the clever script builds the story to a point where you can suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy the terrifically overwrought, 12 gauge climax. 30 minutes of pure joy which is impossible to describe without using the tired cliché of 'its X meets Y' but that, in essence, is the formula for the whole movie.<br/><br/>Wright's direction plugs the gap left by the relatively sparse sprinkling of jokes as its OTT hyperactivity is part of the gag and complimented perfectly by some ludicrously rat a tat tat editing. The kind that makes it look as though the editor was buggering the AVID. This, plus the likable leads and spate of intrusive cameos from jobbing comedians keeps things buoyant but in keeping with its parent pictures  Bad Boys 2 and the like  its too long and the second act though never dull, starts to draw attention to its length so that the final half hour acts as a welcome corrective. Pegg mentioned on T.V that length was a problem for these pictures but seemed to think 2 hours was the optimum running time for such things. As a geek brought up on Eighties genre flicks he should know that most were about 20 minutes shorter than that and for good reason  you set it up, do the minimum to get the denouement and get out. See Back to the Future's perfectly judged 100 odd minutes for a masterclass in how to do this. If it were made today it'd be 2 and half hours long  have we all gone crazy or have filmmakers just become more self-indulgent? There's just 100 minutes of good material here but if you can forgive the padding Hot Fuzz is nicely judged, slam bang entertainment. Wright is terrific but it would be interesting to see what a pure Edgar looked like by which I mean a picture he envisioned without an all night trawl through his DVD collection....good as it undoubtedly is."

","Q - How much was I looking forward to watching this film?<br/><br/>A - A lot.<br/><br/>This film has been the most hyped up film in British history, I think this kind of spoiled it for me. Saying that, I don't want to put any of you off - it was great.<br/><br/>The film was not as fast paced as I expected during the first hour, however the funny one liners between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were brilliant.<br/><br/>The brutally gory killings held my interest ten fold. If at any point in this film you want to stop watching, you would be a fool to do so.<br/><br/>The explosive climax to this film beats any Hollywood blockbuster hands down. Can't wait for another collaboration from these guys.<br/><br/>P.S. - If you get the chance, check out Nick Frost in Danger 50,000 Volts, a mockumentry TV show."

","I don't want to say too much, as there is some brilliant comic timing in the film and as always is well written and contains a couple of sly references to old jokes. Of course, the film is riffing on action/cop films and creates a fantastic running joke around the ""cop whos dedicated to his job"".<br/><br/>Containing just about every British comic working in the business, as well as an amazingly dastardly turn by Timothy Dalton, this is a must see for any fans of spaced of shaun (obviously) but manages to make the film more consistent that shaun, and overall is a better film. THe only slight reserve i have is the action, as it is stamped ""action/comedy"" you'd expect more, i wasn't disappointed at all just recognised that this wasn't going to be an actioner!: so don't go expecting lots of action, because this is essentially just a (gory) comedy. There are a couple of throwaway sequences towards the end but while slapstick and humorous i feel the films merits lie in the amazing writing and comic timing, as well as the performances. Oh and the fact that it is very refreshingly British as well.<br/><br/>Surprisingly the story itself is a twisting tale, and a few surprises along the way. Overall this is a fantastic film, that id gladly go and see again. Keep it up is all id say!!"

"gsygsy","7","1","3","24 February 2007"," enormous fun
","What is particularly clever about this excellent movie is that it brings two genres together with such skill that if you are unread in one, you can still enjoy the other. The genres are 1) the tough city cop (Dirty Harry, etc), and 2) the Agatha Christie death-in-a-quiet-English-village. I know almost nothing about the former, but I've seen loads of the latter, and still loved Hot Fuzz - so people who know the tough-cop movies will have got all the jokes I missed, adding to their enjoyment.<br/><br/>Superb script, full of laughs but also endearing observation. The central performances by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are terrific, particularly Pegg's, who shows a really wide range here: if it weren't couched in a parodic comedy, his performance might well be recognised as award-worthy.<br/><br/>For an UK audience there is much delight in watching some wonderful character actors at work, led by Jim Broadbent, Billie Whitelaw and Anne Reid, their ranks joined by former dashing leading men Edward Woodward and Timothy Dalton, who are both excellent, especially Dalton, parodying his most famous role, which makes it all the funnier. There is also terrific double-act support from Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall.<br/><br/>Enormous fun."

"Eyke87","9","1","3","23 February 2007"," Fuzztastic!
","The Shaun of the Dead team are back with another quote-tastic homage to another much loved cinema genre. Last time round zombies were given the romantic comedy spin. This time we see straight-laced, city cop, Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg) transferred out to the country to team up alongside the lovable, well meaning Constable Danny Butterman (Frost) in this gloriously hilarious action-comedy romp.<br/><br/>As in 'Shaun', where such classics as the 'Dawn of the Dead' trilogy were regularly referenced, here we find the boys nodding their heads towards such pure popcorn classics as 'Bad Boys II' and 'Point Break'. Ridiculously overblown explosions and cheesy one-liners are all present and correct but this is not a simple mickey-take. Pegg (who also co-wrote the screenplay) and Frost obviously have a loving affection for the genre and considering the budget some of the more complex action sequences are handled expertly.<br/><br/>However, the film could be considered slightly overlong for a comedy with a relatively weak plot and it does take a little while for the gags to start flowing. The distinctly British humor that you'll be quoting for weeks and the great on screen chemistry between Pegg and Frost carry the picture and dismiss any minor quibbles, ensuring Hot Fuzz will turn out to be one of the funniest, most inventive comedies of 2007. Oh, and Timothy Dalton's in it if that's not already enough!"

","I don't know one person who has made a bad comment about this film. I am a huge fan of all Simon Pegg's and Nick Frost's work but Hot fuzz doesn't just take it to the next level, it takes it to the next several levels. It's still got the original feel to Simon and Nick's humour but managed to evolve into more epic, speedy action and even more jokes. Hot Fuzz also provides an impressive cast involving classic British comedians. I think Paddy Considine played his character very well and made a good partner with Rafe Spall who i thought performed better than i expected. I would of liked to seen more of Steve Coogan, Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy. Obviously the stars of the film showed out the most. The work of Edgar wright, Simon and nick keeps getting better and hasn't shown a sign of getting worse, i hope they make more films, programmes, anything!! top notch stuff lads"

It is a good story which is easy to follow and lets you concentrate on how well the film is put together.

"Neenee-b","10","1","3","17 February 2007"," Americas make the Action. The British make fun-and do it better
","I discovered Shaun of the Dead a few years after it was released and it is one of my favourite films so I had very high hopes for this film. I have a habit of getting so excited about a film it turns out to be such a let down in the cinema - see X3 and Eragon for a reference so as much as I was excited about Hot Fuzz to be honest I was expecting to be let down badly.<br/><br/>How wrong was I.<br/><br/>This film deserves to be more of a cult classic than Shaun of the Dead. It is def one of the best comedies that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It is hard to know where to start when you are reviewing a film that you have to look really hard to find a flaw in........<br/><br/>It took almost every action movie cliché, and completely took the mickey clean out of it, and what made it funnier is that they played it straight.<br/><br/>There are so many lines and scenes that will be memorable for a long time, the fence scene, the cornetto scene (both parodying their last film), anything involving the swan, the Andies and the rest of the police staff. I thought that the cast singing The Cardigans ""Love Me"" at the end of Romeo and Juliet was priceless. One of the biggest laughs came from the Bill Baily revelation at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The gun fight in the supermarket was fantastic. Andy yelling in pain because he got the dolmio sauce on him and the other Andy got mad as he thought he got shot was hilarious. The whole did you say anything conversation between Danny & Angel when Angel put Lurch in the freezer was probably the best exchange between the two and completely mocks crappy cheesy one liners after a battle, although it could never beat Ripleys ""Stay away from her you b*tch!"" from Aliens The ""backdraft"" line has got to be the funniest off screen line since Bill Murray in Ghostbusters yelling ""the flowers are still standing!"" when he was messing around with the table clothes in the hotel whilst the others were trying to capture slimer The homo erotic subtext through out the film ""I won it for you"" was probably the funniest thing throughout the whole movie. Michael Bay will probably wishes that he had played the relationship between the cops in Bad Boys 2 in an ironic way.<br/><br/>I loved the product placement of vodafone when Angel was travlleling to the village. Nomally in American films it is the latest flashy car or watch but here apart from vodafone we had cornetto (if you would call that product placement), special K and Dolmeo.<br/><br/>I have never felt the need to comment on the lighting of a movie before but I though that the way Danny & Angels faces were light up bright red during the opening the boot scene was like the scene from Road Kill where the brothers and Venna open the boot to find the CB radio - although most people will say that it is a Tarintino moment. Also Angel going into the shop and setting the cash down on the table also reminded me of Road Kill to. The other brilliant lighting moment was when the neighbourhood watch people were sitting around with their torches and they all turned and shined them on Angel, and he was perfectly lit up. I think that this is making fun of scenes in movies where candles can light up a whole room.<br/><br/>I also loved the fact that there was a dramatic montage of the police officers filling up the evidence room with all the but guns etc only to have the usual lets get the big guns out montage which is usually found in cop movies - see Bad Boys and Miami Vice.<br/><br/>There was one overly gross out killing (reporter) and one jump out of your seat moment (danny suddenly appearing after the hotel fight with Lurch) but because these were so unexpected they were brilliant.<br/><br/>If i had to pick a flaw, it would be the overly loud slamming of doors etc. This was annoying the first few times but you got used to it.<br/><br/>Although it mocked action movies the action in it was nothing to be ashamed of and was probably more exciting the anything Michar Bay could come up with. I think that because Pegg and Frost are not big, fit, over muscled, American cops it made the shoot out so much better.<br/><br/>Anyway this is clearly an overlong and rambling review so I would give it a 10/10. Americans bring the action. The British take the P!ss and come out on top."

","I entered the cinema to see ""Hot Fuzz"" with fairly average expectations. Although having adored Simon Pegg's and Nick Frost's ""rom-zom-com"", ""Shaun of the Dead"" the trailer for ""Hot Fuzz"" did not seem as original and fresh and their first full length film together. However I left the cinema with my jaw muscles literally aching with laughter.<br/><br/>For me, ""Hot Fuzz"" was far better than ""Shaun of the Dead"" in almost every way. An almost perfect mixture of witty one liners, slapstick genius, action and drama filled the 2 hours and 1 minute with almost no lag at all. Personally, as a country lad, it was the host of golden minor character standing in as the villagers of Stanford that had my sides nearly splitting with mirth. I can honestly recommend no better satire of the mundane but ludicrous aspects of country life. However don't be put off by this if you are towns dweller as the action spoofs and instantly quotable one-liner make this film nearly universally enjoyable as long are you are not too put off by some levels of swearing or gore.<br/><br/>The only possible flaw to the film was that after having some hilarious lines delivered by Pegg in ""Shaun of the Dead"" we have to adjust to him being the ""sensible one"" amidst the absurdity. Although this is slightly regrettable it gives his sidekick Frost a real chance to shine as a comic actor and his portrayal of Danny far surpasses his role in ""Shaun of the Dead"" in comedy and in lovability.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Hot Fuzz"" provides comedy on so many levels it's very hard not to enjoy it no matter what your taste in humour. Although it is likely people will funny very different bits funny depending on upbringing or culture it is hard to deny that it IS very, very funny. You will leave the cinema with hurting sides and on an action-induced high."

Pegg creates a completely new character from his usual Tim/Shaun goofy loser persona, and had me rooting for Nick Angel all the way, despite his apparent shortcomings.

","OK for a start, those of you who loved Shaun of the dead and wonder if this is any good...well let me tell you....Of course it F***in' is! This movie is a hilarious homage to the late cop movies of Clint Eastwood and other more recent Hollywood one like Point Break and Bad Boys. Pegg is brilliant as Nick Angel, the cop who was transferred from his town station just for being far too good. But when he reaches the sleepy village of Sandford he starts to discover that things aren't quite what they seem and soon death upon death start to happen in the village and it's up to Angel to find who it is as the rest of the Sandford division don't really give a toss. Nick Frost excels as Danny Butterman, Angel's new and very dim witted partner of the Sanford Constabulary. He usually does with absolute precision and here he does it again and come off a master of tomfoolery. Is he stupid or is he just playing dumb until the right moment arrives? Will he ever find the killer of Sandford? And the town people were the cream of British Greats Like Billie Whitelaw as the hotel landlady, Stuart Wilson (best known for Lethal Weapon 3 and No Escape)is well cast as a doctor who has a bit of a sinister sense of humour, Edward Woodward (from the Equalizer and the horrifying The Wicker man) play a neighbourhood watch clerk who works at the station, Paul Freeman (Raiders of the Lost Ark)is the town vicar, David Threlfall as the hopelessly talented actor/solicitor and Timothy (James Bond) Dalton as the manager of the local Somerfield market and quite happy to share a biscuit or two. And so is the police staff are the best of comedy and dram talents ranging from Jim (the Borrowers) Broadbent is the naive chief of the Sandford coppers, Kevin Eldon (Nightly Night, Big train)is the dim witted sergeant, Olivia Colman is the over friendly police ""person"" who's been round the station more times then anyone care to remember, Bill Bayley as the reception clerk who's always in the dark over matter involving Sandford and lastly the roguish Paddy Considine (Dead Man's shoes) as the top CIA detective and the great Rafe Spall (shaun of the dead and Green street) as the sarcastic other CIA detective of the Sandford division.<br/><br/>All in all the characters are brilliant and some of them you can't help but find so funny you nearly end up in stitches. They all drive this hard hitting unflinching but bloody (bloody being the proper word) funny as fuzz buddy cop/black comedy that simply cannot be missed. The best British movie of 2007.

"chrisgregory05-1","9","1","3","17 February 2007"," A fresh change to the mainstream we see nowadays - 8.7/10
","Hot Fuzz is the latest film from comedy genius' Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright. Their first big screen foray, Shaun of the Dead, prove to be an instant hit, especially to fans of their cult classic TV series Spaced. Shaun of the Dead got it right in so many ways; it had a decent storyline, great comedy, and enough action to keep you interested throughout, even throwing in some 'jump' scary moments. It would be hard for the trio to top this, and I think Shaun of the Dead set the expectations a little high.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz's opening half hour or so is quite bland; the cameo roles from actors like Steve Coogan didn't quite use up the full potential that they could have, and the introduction to Sandford was basically what we'd seen in the trailers. However, this worked to their advantage; they managed to avoid showing the truly great parts of the film in the trailers, like so many films do nowadays. This meant that we were oblivious to most of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>As Angel settles into sleepy Sandford, he discovers that things are amiss; the quirky misfits of Sandford Police 'Force' take life at a dawdle, and his partner in crime is quite incompetent with his job.<br/><br/>As the film lifts off, fans of the previous work of the comedians will chuckle as references are made, and jokes re-used in a new manner, adding to the wealth of new material that was written for the film.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, we see our main protagonist riding into a seemingly empty Sandford aboard a white stallion, armed to the teeth with guns. Made me laugh anyway.<br/><br/>All in all, Hot Fuzz was a well put together film; the plot was good enough, the jokes were better, and the acting was top notch. I still think the film didn't live up to it's full potential though, and just falls short of Shaun in my collection. Maybe after a few more viewings I might change my opinion.<br/><br/>8.7/10 - I couldn't give it a 9, but 8 was too low."

","I watched this film at the Sandford premiere. Yes i watched it in the town (actually its a city) of Wells, where most of this film is shot. Simon, Nick and Edgar were all there to introduce it and come to the after party. I then was able to have a long chat with Edgar about the film and his career which was a great and unexpected extra.<br/><br/>But most importantly... the film: This is an intense, action packed comedy with strange ideas flying through it at every turn. There is an amazing amount of detail put into this film and every min of it is worthwhile. The director, who went to school and lived in Wells has pulled everything out of the bag here, and even though it is not as revolutionary as SOTD it is without a doubt a perfect partner to it without it being the same in many ways. Of course there is a lot of references to SOTD which makes it an even more thrilling movie to see. After picking up just under 1million at the box office on its premiere opening just let the numbers show you that this film is one not to miss.<br/><br/>Go out and see it.

Fact.<br/><br/>Surprisingly maybe, I have to admit Shaun of the Dead really disappointed me in 2004, and also again when I re-watched it not six months ago. So as you can perhaps imagine it took a little persuasion from my Girlfriend to get me to see the latest incarnation from Penn, Frost and Wright...<br/><br/>... But, I'm really glad she did.<br/><br/>The composition was excellent. Comedy, gore, direction and CGI are all integrated fantastically to create a cleverly unpredictable plot. It's not often I enthuse as much as this about a film, and I didn't think I would be doing so about this one, but I am.<br/><br/>The wealth of acting talent involved was staggering, with names such as Broadbent, Nighy, Bailey and Dalton occupying slots on the roster. Not only that, but all of the other roles were portrayed in remarkable fashion, and one can be proud of one's Britishness for it.<br/><br/>The CGI was fabulous, really good. With it, the film had that Hollywood touch, but with spades of Britishness. It worked fabulously as a parody more than anything.<br/><br/>Very good idea, very good plot, very good film. At last something which satisfies."

","Firstly I must say I do in fact hail from Gloucester and I hope I don't offend too many people when I say I have met many people like the characters in this, believe it or not thats what people from 'The Forest' are like! especially lurch! I think this film was excellent. To be honest I went in thinking it was going to be rubbish, I didn't really expect that much because even though I thought Shawn of the dead was great I forgot it instantly after seeing it. This film had everything, u like comedy? U got it! u like action? u have to wait till the last half hour, but hell yeah u got it! I really do love the fact that I thought it wasn't going to be any good, because it made me love it more, excellent film, great story, I view this as a big F**k U to Hollywood blockbusters, we do films better than you for a tenth of the budget! Go see it!!!"
"bopdog","10","1","3","16 February 2007"," VERY subtle! It builds and builds. Gets weirder and funnier--an exquisite crescendo of thrilling humour!
","'Hot Fuzz' was not at all what I expected from the trailers--- but I LOVED this movie! It is quintessentially British, goofy and charming, with enough dead-pan 'serious' bits to set yo up for the absurd and hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. A hot-dog London Met super-cop gets on everyone's nerves in his London cop precinct. They transfer him out because he 'makes us all look bad'. He gets sent, with a promotion to Sargent, to a peaceful village called Sandford. As it happens, my house-mates are all coppers (really). They tell me that Sandford is used in UK police training, and amongst British coppers, as a clichÃ© for the stereotype peaceful English village. Similar, in American jargon, to 'Anytown, USA', or perhaps 'Mayberry', fictional home of TV's Sheriff Andy Taylor and goofy over-eager nerd Deputy Barny Fife.<br/><br/>Anyway--- the situations are never presented as slap-stick, which surprised me. They are KIND OF played 'straight'--- except they develop, scene by scene, into situations so surreal and so silly and funny and thrilling--- I can't say more without giving away the plot. But I can say that in an odd way, this movie is more realistic in its depiction of English country life than many so-called 'straight' dramas.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a masterful build up--- a crescendo that builds and builds for the entire two hours, culminating in some of the charmingest and funniest and excitingest scenes in any comedy I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This is a great good time. I saw it in a packed theatre tonight--- and while there weren't the kind of huge belly-laughs and raucous laughter one enjoys in some types of wacky comedy, the audience did laugh a LOT, did not squirm--- no one slipped out to loo during the entire time, and during the credits the bulk of the audience stayed in their seats for quite a while. I, and I think they, seemed to enjoy simply basking in the glow of this wonderful and lovingly made, silly, goofy, wild, and oddly touching British comedy. Thank you, American studio Universal, for producing it, and evidently paying for it. I LOVED this movie!!! I gave it a 10 out of 10."
"masterspy30","10","1","3","16 February 2007"," Hot Fuzz.......WHAT A FILM!!!!
","Yes 10 out of 10!! I think the last time I gave a film that it was the Matrix.<br/><br/>Having been a huge huge fan of every series of Spaced and after watching Shaun of the Dead until my eyes bled I was overjoyed to hear the duo were making another film. Then when I heard the plot I was even more excited! With all the hype, media coverage and everything they'd made before I was left with such high expectations I really thought there was no way the film could live up to what I hoped for. I went into the cinema with high hopes and still the film blew me away!! The first hour and a half is basically an excellent comedy, with all too short appearances by Bill Bailey, Steve Coogan, Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy. All actors stand out in this perfectly cast film especially Paddy Considine & Rafe Spall (the Andys) but as always its Pegg & Frost who steal the show... Add the excellent writing, impeccable directing and you've got a great film so far, but the best is yet to come in the form of probably the greatest action sequence ever filmed in Britain, a 30 minute non-stop action sequence of crazy shootouts, car chases, fights scenes and explosions intertwined with the usual comedy & snappy directing we've come to expect from Pegg & Wright.<br/><br/>I dare you not to enjoy this one..."
"The_Void","8","1","3","16 February 2007"," Fighting big criminals in a small country village!
","Well, the Spaced crew had a lot to follow up on with Shaun of the Dead being such a massive hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and after seeing this film I would say they've just about done it! This time round, they've decided to spoof cop buddy films - although there's plenty of other stuff thrown in for good measure! I went into this film expecting it to be about British policemen (sorry, British police officers), and that's the best way to go into it. I really don't want to spoil this film too much as giving potential viewers any sort of idea of where the film goes from its base plot would seriously hinder their enjoyment. The film focuses on Nicholas Angel; a London police officer with a long line of decoration. He's called into the sergeant's office one day to find that he's been promoted! However, that's not good news as he's been given a job in the small country village of Sandford, away from the busy streets of London as his arrest record is making the rest of the force (sorry, service) look bad. However, he soon finds that life in sleepy Sandford isn't so sleepy after all...<br/><br/>What's great about this film, for me anyway, is that it's completely British! It's obvious where Pegg and Wright were coming from as they've taken the style of the big Hollywood cop buddy blockbuster and applied it to a rural English setting. It's refreshing to see, to say the least and the fact that most of the satire in the film is right on cue means the overall effect is even better. The film features a strong British cast, with numerous familiar faces such as Bill Bailey, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton (in an excellent role!), Martin Freedman, Paddy Considine, Steve Coogan and even the Wicker Man star Edward Woodward popping up alongside main stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The way that the plot works is excellent, as the writers exhaust one point and then the film quickly changes direction, meaning it never grows stale. It can feel a bit inconsistent, and the final third isn't as good as the first two; but in a movie this entertaining, it isn't a big problem. One thing I definitely wasn't expecting was this level of gore! Wright and Pegg are clearly and obviously horror fans at heart, and this is well felt in this movie with the 'Giallo' themed plot line that runs through the middle section. Overall, Hot Fuzz both lives up to Shaun of the Dead and my high expectations, and it comes highly recommended!"
"darrell-19","9","1","3","16 February 2007"," Genius!! You have to see this movie!!
","British films are often criticised for low budgets and their focus on small-town misery. Actually, the latter is probably a necessity of the former, but none of this is the case with 'Hot Fuzz'. Comedies don't need to rely on expensive production values, but Simon Pegg & co. have a brilliant knack of fusing a series of mismatching styles and on Hot Fuzz they intersperse the rural village storyline with all the high-octane thrills and gore of big budget action flicks. Fans of Pegg's brilliant nineties TV comedy 'Spaced' won't be surprised when they are spontaneously jerked out of a scene in a sleepy village police station and thrown into a montage of psychedelic imagery coupled with a drum and bass soundtrack.<br/><br/>But this film is far from 'cult' only, and will not disappoint anyone looking for laughs. It's not just a 'spoof' of cop films; it is more of a pastiche. Think more 'Scream' and less 'Scary Movie' (thank the maker) in that it references other cop/buddy movies as part of its plot line. 'Shaun of The Dead' fans will also be pleased with the movies moments of gore. Aside from one dodgy CGI moment involving some garden shears, the special effects are spot on and make you proud to be British.<br/><br/>Get over any fears you have of seeing British films at the cinema, and go see this movie. It is a work of genius. Encore, Mr Pegg!!"
"james-965","8","1","3","16 February 2007"," Another great production from Wright/Pegg
","I had extremely high expectations when sitting down for Hot Fuzz at the local cinema. My expectations were not *quite* met, however, but they were not far off - it *really* demands to be re-watched to catch all the jokes which come at you both fast and slow, with plenty attention to detail. Lets get onto the checklist:<br/><br/>Star studded cast, firing on all cylinders? Check. Pegg and Frost with awesome interplay? Check. OTT gore? Check. Parody and references galore? Check. Quotability? Check. Tim Dalton / Bill Bailey stealing their scenes? Check. Lots of action? Not really, but a final showdown that will utterly blow you away!<br/><br/>My view is you will love it. Pegg, Frost and Wright aficionados will be in their element. Try to catch it in full digital - 1080p on the big screen looks so sharp."

","the best film i've seen so far!!! reminds me of final destination with the gore but it balances in with the jokes!!! what an amazing plot and perfect acting from all!!! well done!!! want to see it again!!! the film has all the action of a blockbuster and keeps you interested all the way through, just when you think things are over and quiet, something else happens to grab your attention, it is creepy like a horror and yet almost a spoof with scenes that reflect The Matrix and James Bond. A definite Must See!! The contrast between the city and the countryside is captured and the film definitely highlights the way humans are often ""scared"" of change, be it an image, reflected in the hooded youths or by newcomers to a small community.<br/><br/>By Poppy Rose"

","What is there to say about ""Hot Fuzz"" when comparing to ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Spaced"".<br/><br/>Firstly, it's a little slow in the beginning, but I liked this. I liked the build up and the character introductions. It's your typical ""fish out of water"" set up. Think John McClane arrives in Dibley. When Nicholas Angel is promoted and transfered to Sandford, it's your typical Wiltshire/Somerset village, complete with all the village life that you would expect. You're introduced to all manner of characters. There's the underage drinker tolerant pub owners, Simon Skinner, the sinister manager of Somerfield (played and hammed up by the wonderful Timothy Dalton), Jim Broadbent's Detective Inspector Frank Butterman, who gives the impression wanting a quiet life, Neighbourhood Watch chief Tom Weaver who is all about preserving the idyllic mirage that is the village, played by none other than Edward Woodward, and (of course) Nick Frost's PC Danny Butterman, who's extremely eager to be just like his Hollywood heroes.<br/><br/>However, not is all it appears in Sandford and there are a spate of gruesome deaths, with all the gore and humour that you'd expect from the Shaun creators. Angel begins to suspect that Skinner is responsible, as he seems to make all kinds of suggestive comments. And after an uneasy start, Danny Butterman and Nicholas Angel investigate, despite the assurances that all is well and ""accidents happen"".<br/><br/>Without giving too much away about the subsequent plot, it is safe to say that it picks up and the violence and humour is relentless once it starts. There are great homages to Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hollywood in general that only Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright can pull off. Spaced fans can watch for the nod to the paint-ball episode! I loved this film... Whilst not quite as consistent as Shaun, it still did not fail to deliver and I would recommend this to anyone!!!"
"alexe-3","9","1","3","16 February 2007"," The best action movie homage ever
","The trailer for hot fuzz did get me intrigued but didn't totally grab me, it showed hints of funny moments and some action but didn't convince me it had it in abundance. But as i have seen and loved the TV show spaced and the film Shaun of the dead i went along to see the latest Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg & Nick Frost collaboration and I'm very glad i did. Hot Fuzz is a delight, very funny, lots of action and has so many movie references that I'm sure i will still be finding new ones on my 2nd and 3rd viewing. It has some brilliantly executed jokes that run the length of the film as well as short quick ones that will be quoted around the country for quiet sometime. This film will rate in my top ten funniest films of all time as I'm sure it will for many other people."

","What can be said apart from WOW! <br/><br/>This masterpiece in comedy/action (ComTion?) has reaffirmed my belief that people can make films that will make you laugh out loud, entertain you and make you beg for more. <br/><br/>The characters seem almost perfectly cast and nobody was unbelievable in their roles.<br/><br/>This is a turbulent ride, as you never quite are sure where you will be turning next, I was second guessing any predictions I made almost as soon as I made them.<br/><br/>The jokes are so well written that they would not have required delivery, but Pegg once again excels at this regardless, as do the rest of the cast. ""By the Power of Greyskull!"" had me spit popcorn over the person sat in front of me!<br/><br/>I maybe biased, but the person that came with me has not seen Shaun of the Dead or Spaced and was underwhelmed by The Big Nothing.

It's hard to pinpoint individual moments that stand out, but there are so many little touches and funny moments that all add up to make this a genuinely great movie. Simon Pegg and nick Frost again prove to be one of the best cinema pairings around with both showing they are talented actors and not just two funny guys going through the motions.

","For all fans of Shaun of the Dead, or even just British comedy, this is a hilarious must see! I started out thinking to myself ""i knew they couldn't make something as funny as ""Shaun of the Dead"", i ended the movie thinking ""Awsome!"" Yet again Simon Pegg and Nick Frost make up an incredibly funny pair who have serious differences but somehow form a bond, with very funny consequences.The film has a lot of the same humour and gory violence as the first. The story is written about a top city cop who is sent into the so-called quiet country to be a SGT. However, when he arrives he finds the force (or should i say ""service"") a complete disaster and some very mysterious characters. Then after a pair of very suspicious deaths take place the story comes to life. Its true that you have to be patient with the first 10-20 minutes of the film as the jokes are not exactly coming thick and fast, and then after a promising plot, the ending is hugely ridiculous, but so ridiculous that you will find yourself in stitches laughing at the explosive finish! One slight criticism is that it was probably a bit long and seemed to drag on a bit towards the end, but this is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time and very much worth the watch!

Hot Fuzz has a deep love of action movies which makes it truly excellent and not some godawful parody movie.<br/><br/>The over the top sound dub, the shaky cam, the pointless gymnastics, the gun fights and car chases are all done seriously which increases the absurdity and this the comedy.<br/><br/>It is what they set out to make the Midsomer murders directed by Michael Bay."

","With the Critical acclaim the film 'Shaun Of The Dead' arose, the team (consisting of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright among other countless stars) are back with there new film 'Hot Fuzz'. And this time...they have BIGGER GUNS! 'Shaun Of The Dead' saw British comedy placed back on the Film-o-pedic map with a Zombielicious bang (and a little biting)! And it was going to take a lot for the team behind this Rom-Zom-Com to rival this beautiful piece of British film-making, however with spending countless hours behind the scenes watching 'Bad Boys 2' and 'Point Break' over and over again, Edgar Wright and the boys have done it. 'Hot Fuzz' is a roller-coaster ride of witty jokes, violence and a seasoning of sexual innuendo all rolled into one fantastic film that'll keep you hooked for the whole two hours.<br/><br/>Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a top Cop in the Metropolitan Police Force, err I mean Police Service in the heart of London, however his expertise in every available area ranging from hand-to-hand combat to high-speed pursuits and his perfect arrest figures are making everybody else in the MET look bad! So to curb the embarrassment, the Force ship him off to normal ol' Sandford where nothing out of the ordinary ever happens, however Angel along with his partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) start to notice that something eerie's going on when everything seems to be a simple, ol' accident! This leads Angel and Butterman down a path of guns, explosions and mind-excessive-Hollywood-style violence till they reach the truth.<br/><br/>The cast is full of famous faces, from Jim Broadbent, to Bill Bailey, to the 'forgotten Bond' Timothy Dalton. And while there's an extensive list of characters, each has there own quirky feature that makes them stand out in a distinctive and varied cast. However it's the witty and hilarious script written by Pegg and Wright that carries this film. There's miniature jokes everywhere that'll take you a second viewing to just notice half of them and the many references to the action genre (from the Bad Boys 2, to Point Break, to Dirty Harry), like 'Shaun Of The Dead' Wright and Pegg have written a script to accommodate for all the characters personalities and in-particular the miss-match partnership of bumbling PC Daniel Butterman and the courageous Sergeant Nicholas Angel.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is a non-stop thrill ride of blue and while aggression, and while the jokes may thin out at times due to the two hour running time, you'll be hooked from start to finish with the over-the-top Hollywood style violence mixed with the hilariously addictive humour of Wright, Pegg and Frost. A must see film that'll make you want to scream at the top of your voice every time you see a Police car 'HERE COMES THE FUZZ' before running away like a little girl.<br/><br/>9/10 By Jordan Winter"
"bobh99","10","1","3","15 February 2007"," Midsummer Murders meets Bad Boys 2
","I saw the film on the opening night yesterday. It was excellent. It is fast paced, the humour is continuous and the audience loved it. Most of the filming was on location in Wells, a small medieval city in Somerset where a lost Swan is a major incident. Much of the heavy action takes place in the centre by the Bishop's Palace, which for the purposes of the film represents a castle. The location is real, the buildings are real so mixing this all up with enough fire power to start your own revolution is amazing to watch. It is difficult to keep up with all the film references as they come fast and furious. The cast is full of English character actors and comedians who have had film leads and headed comedy programmes in their own right. This was not just an excuse for a few sight gags and a few jokes. The plot was good, the timing great and if you want a good belly laugh this is the one to see."

","Wow, I have been eagerly anticipating this film for weeks and I wasn't disappointed even though the Cinema in Aylesbury forgot to turn up the sound for the first couple of minutes of the film, well, if you pay peanuts you get monkeys.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film follows the instantly recognisable humour of writer and actor Simon Pegg and co writer and director Edgar Wright, who follow the winning formula of comedy writing and painstaking direction from the series Spaced and more recently Shaun of the dead.<br/><br/>Pegg pairs up with on screen comedy partner Nick Frost who has been the Robin to Pegg's Batman since he played Mike in Spaced. The comedy duo predictably work fantastically well together largely because they are genuine mates off screen and this certainly shows on-screen.<br/><br/>For fans of Pegg and Wright's work you'll be delighted with little gems the pair throw in to remind you of previous work and even integrate several well known scenes of a couple of well known Hollywood blockbusters.<br/><br/>For those that haven't come across this pair before you'll find this film damn funny whichever way you look at it but If you do have time to watch a couple of episodes of Spaced or Shaun of the dead before you see this film it will definitely get you into gear.<br/><br/>Oh and look out for cameos from the likes of Bill Bailey, Timothy Dalton, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy.<br/><br/>Go and see this film it's absolutely brilliant!"

","Awesome film. Loads of well worked homages to action classics. Fantastic character work from a host of familiar faces; The actor Kevin Eldon, Bill Bailey, Olivia Colman, Paddy Considine, and Rafe Spall were particularly good. Some dodgy accents - Frost, you know who you are, and you wore a Bristol Rovers shirt -how could you! ;), but some very clever observations on the local mindset - Don't mess with a farmer's mother, you've been warned!<br/><br/>Pegg, Frost & Wright have continued in the same strong vein as Shaun of the Dead. Even stronger in fact, my girlfriend hates Shaun of the Dead but loved this. It was fast paced but still managed to establish good story continuity and a great plot - in fact its 2hr duration is balanced extremely well with gags and action a'plenty.<br/><br/>It was a real bonus to get to the advanced screening - free tickets, free popcorn, thanks to SeeFilmFirst - it was damn annoying we were so early in the queue but got funnelled into seats right at the front. Yes, we were three rows back from Pegg & Frost during the Q&A which was great, but we had cricks in our necks for the rest of the night..... stupid Vue cinemas.... Anyway, the guys really took the time to indulge the fans and it was much appreciated.<br/><br/>In many ways its a great shame that there will be no Spaced 3 but I for one was glad to hear they are staying away from the This Life +10 format, great comedies finish in their prime leaving you wanting more. What is a bigger shame is that ""La Triviata"" seems to have been shelved due to creative differences between Pegg & Frost and C4, and their now busy movie schedule - but if they keep turning out films of this quality the fans should still be kept happy, even if we don't see them on the small screen quite as often."
"fuzileer","9","1","3","15 February 2007"," A comedy worthy of praise!
","PREDICTION:<br/><br/>""This is going to top Shaun of the Dead, HANDS DOWN! Action, violence, and cornettos!"" Even though I thought this, I still had no idea what to expect. I was particularly excited about watching this as I had gone to the Premier of Hot Fuzz the day before, and met Nick Frost, Edgar Wright and more, I SHOOK THEIR HANDS!!! ARRR!!!<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE:<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is the star of the show, a dramatic difference from his Shaun of the Dead (SOTD) character to his Hot Fuzz one, Nicholas Angel. In SOTD, he was a lazy, but trying-his-best individual, chasing after his girlfriend in a zombie infested town. In Hot Fuzz, he plays a serious, hard working, athletic top-cop moved to a quiet little village. He portrays his characters emotions particularly well, and yet still putting across the movie's comedy theme. Nick Frost is pretty much the same type of character in Hot Fuzz as he played in SOTD. He plays Danny Butterman, a policeman who doesn't do much at all but eat cake and cornettos. This character is funny all the way through, showing his emotions well and yet his eyes windows a secret world of pain within him, which is essential later on in the storyline. Timothy Dalton plays the main suspect of the movie, and he is a good at portraying the easy-going ""bad-guy"". Guest Appearance includes Bill Nighy, who made a longer appearance in SOTD and the hilarious Bill Bailey.<br/><br/>BASIC STORYLINE:<br/><br/>Nicholas Angel, (Simon Pegg) is the top-cop in London, making all the other cops look bad. To stop themselves from looking lazy, the police department, as you do, sends the top-cop to a sleepy village away from London. He meet the police dept. he will be working with and PC.Danny Butterman (Nick Frost)and is told that the village is the safest and most friendly village in the country. However, Angel begins to suspect otherwise. After 4 ""accidents"" occur during his stay, Angel immediately suspects Murder, and the police force there just laugh at him, stating that ""everyone has their accidents.""<br/><br/>From there, the movie soon spirals into a theme much like ""The Wicker Man"", where the neighbourhood watch (including Timothy Dalton) are basically the murderers, and its up to the police (and the local youths) to take them down. <br/><br/>As soon as I saw Simon Pegg equip himself with a hell of a lot of ammo and guns, I was laughing with anticipation, excitement and humour at the ridiculousness of the events that were going on before my eyes! I will not spoil the ending, but I will say one word that makes me smile just thinking about it: Swan.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: <br/><br/>Okay, it did not meet up to my high expectations, but then again, no movies do when I anticipate them for ages. It is a hilarious movie that definitely deserves your cinema ticket money. If you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, you will love this movie. If you have seen Bad Boys 2, you will love this movie. If you like detective/police/action movies, you will love this movie. I love the fact that both Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead was focused on the suburbs or London like Surrey, for instance, instead of America or cities or countrysides. I hope they keep making movies in the same location, so people can connect with movies more unlike todays typical trash.<br/><br/>God bless you, Edgar Wright (director), keep making films like these and you will be a millionaire in no time!"

But after two hours of non-stop entertainment I was completely blown away.<br/><br/>Once again Pegg and Frost show their comic qualities as a double act in this laugh out loud gem. Timothy Dalton is perfectly cast as the villainous Simon Skinner.<br/><br/>Think of Bad Boys 2 with a better script, set in the countryside and a hundred times better then most Hollywood blockbusters and then you go some way of defining Hot Fuzz. It's hot stuff. Don't miss it; it would be criminal."
"NotWar","10","1","3","15 February 2007"," Worth going to see
","This film is just as I expected it to be and more. My boyfriend, our friend and I managed to get in for the previews yesterday in Cardiff, and it was definitely worth the wait and worth listening to the people talking loudly behind us.<br/><br/>Although a lot of people may think ""not as good as Shaun of the Dead"" or ""they should have done ""From Dusk Til Shaun"" that is entirely untrue, the film seems like it had a bigger budget, but even so I think both films were just as good as one another, with Hot Fuzz proving Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are good in anything they do, such as Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and now Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>When it is out tomorrow (16th) I definitely advise you to see it, and I am sure the vast majority will not be disappointed."

","As i sat in the crowded, dark theater, i felt a warm feeling creeping up my spine. It was enjoyment! Not only is this the first film in a while that i have really enjoyed it is the first film i have seen to have more peeks than troughs.<br/><br/>I couldn't control the laughter, the excitement or the giddy joy i felt as i watched Simon Pegg and Nick Frost jump through the air, pistols blazing. I felt that it was the best use of time, i'd gladly give up two more hours to watch it again.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it go see it - If you like Shaun of the Dead, go see it - If you like action films, go see it - If you like FILM go see it - And more importantly, if you like anything at all, be it soft furnishings or frozen yogurt GO AND SEE THIS FILM!

"ul90","8","1","3","14 February 2007"," Better than Shaun of the Dead? Quite possibly.
","This film was always going to be compared to Shaun of the Dead, sorry but it was inevitable. Considering the obvious similarities with the casting and directing, some people may have been under the illusion it was going to be Shaun of the Dead Mark II. It certainly wasn't, as you can guess there are more similarities than just the casting but by no means does this have any negative effect. Fans of Spaced could instantly relate to Shaun of the Dead, it had all the hallmarks of the series in a feature length film, with free added zombies. This film goes a step further, and it may be a shock to some fans of Pegg, Wright and Frost. I can certainly say this with great authority being a member of their fan base.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, they haven't completely commercialised the film, far from it. You still have all the components that made Shaun of the Dead great, the film references are there, the subtle (and not so subtle) references to former work, there are the instances where the same jokes are used through the film with twists to keep them as fresh as they were and there jokes in the background that only the observant will notice. There are of course the parodies of rural life that you expect from this film considering it's setting, and the carefully chosen soundtrack and background sounds.<br/><br/>Then add to this the kind of slapstick you may see in a Ben Stiller or Will Ferrell film, thankfully it's done with the precision timing and sheer class you'd expect from the team. There are far more scenes in the film that will appeal to the wider British audience, but they've managed to do this without 'dumbing down' or compromising the film. Oddly quite the opposite, it will take all your mental cunning (or perhaps the multiple viewings you'll have of the DVD) to take in the multitude of humour.<br/><br/>Another aspect I appreciated was the trailer, it does not give away the entire plot, and it does not give away all the best gags which is refreshing compared to a lot of new 'comedies' do. Although from the trailer I was dubious as to whether it could live up to the expectations Shaun of the Dead had set for it... if you're worried, as I was, don't be. I can't say for definite, as I have yet to test it's durability for multiple viewings to the extent I have Shaun of the Dead, but as it stands I prefer Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>It has everything Shaun of the Dead has and more, you'll find it hard to stop laughing from start to finish, and there are more points that will cause hysterics. The best feature of the film for me, is that even though it's excellent from the start, it actually picks up as the film goes on leaving you in a state of comedy bliss by the end. Unfortunately I can see it falling somewhat flat in America with it's very British humour, but I hope not for it deserves as much praise as anyone can heap on it. In a time when films like 'Norbit' and 'Epic Movie' are billed as comedies, it's wonderful that someone has dared to be clever. <br/><br/>I can't imagine a better comedy, or perhaps even film, being released this year."
"hanke666","9","1","3","14 February 2007"," another classic from the team...
","went out last night with my lady and we both wanted to see this film as we are big fans of Shaun of the dead, spaced and action films...so this was like a dream. personally i have been waiting for this film to come out from the day it was announced and boy what a film! full of gags and over the top action it really was like nothing i'd ever seen before. a classic fish out of water tale with a dynamic twist... the film made me laugh, feel emotion and also made me remember why British cinema is coming back! if you like Shaun of the dead, spaced or even die hard type action films or films like lethal weapon go see this film! it really is pretty damn awesome. with great performances and great action, the visual style and one liners make it a film to see with anyone...just don't take your grannies...one for people who like guns,blood,jumping around with guns,action,giggles and classic one liners such as ""play times over"" ha-ha. go see!!!"
"bakerowen3","8","1","3","14 February 2007"," I laughed a fair bit.
","I went to this film on release day not because I was desperate to see it but because it was this or music and lyrics.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and laughed a lot I did have quite high hopes for the follow up film by the same funny folks.<br/><br/>Whilst it's not Citizen Kane (if your looking for Citizen Kane 2 what the hell are you doing at a film with 'fuzz' in the title) I did laugh out loud at least 5 or 6 times and spent the rest of the 2 hours with a smile on my face and generally chuckling, which CAN'T be a bad thing I don't reckon.<br/><br/>Go see it it's a bit of a laugh."
"Phrage","10","1","3","14 February 2007"," Best feffing movie EVER
","I don't do this often. I've never commented on a movie before. I'm not the kind of person who says, ""hey, this is my favourite film ever!"" every time they leave the cinema. However this time I did.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead but this film surpasses it. Knowledge of cop buddy movies (Bad Boys, Point Break) is recommended for the genius satire to be fully appreciated, but it wasn't just the jokes that made this film brilliant. This movie made me want to stand up in the cinema and say ""f**k yeah!!!"" (However it is Valentines Day and my girlfriend would not approve). <br/><br/>The jokes are very similar to those in Shaun of the Dead so if you didn't find that funny you probably won't find Fuzz amusing. You have to remain constantly focused to catch the background tricks that are constantly alluding to what is going on in the main action. There are constant references to previous jokes and other movies in typical Pegg/Wright style.<br/><br/>The special effects are gruesomely awesome and certain scenes are certainly not for the faint hearted.<br/><br/>However the true genius was in the gradual transition from ""Inspector Morse"" to ""Bad Boys II"" (but set in an English village). The acting was brilliant and it is obvious that a lot of heart went into this film. This is Pegg, Frost and Wright on top form and I can't wait for their next instalment (and the DVD of Hot Fuzz).<br/><br/>GO see this movie You WILL love it"
"purplestickydemon","10","1","3","14 February 2007"," Now thats what i call an ACTION COMEDY!!!!
","From start to finish this is just 100% Brilliant i had been super excited about this film and the build up to release for me was kinda like back in 1999 when i was waiting for Episode 1 to come out. so i was excited yet nervous that this could turn out to be a disappointment but thankfully the worries over this is 2hours of really funny comedy some intense action and a really good PLOT!! it's very well thought out and although it's got some over the top comedy the story stays tight and enjoyable with some really good Thriller elements and the odd bit of Gore all in all this is the perfect follow up movie to Shaun Of The Dead and it proves once again that PEGG,WRIGHT and FROST are Geniuses!"
"ohhhmatron2006","10","1","3","14 February 2007"," Excellent
","I liked Shaun of the Dead, but didn't really fancy Hot Fuzz, however i watched it today and thought it was amazing, the cast was brilliant with the likes of Kenneth Cranham, Edward Woodwood, Bill Nighy, Bill Bailey, Timothy Dalton, Stuart Wilson, Paul Freeman, Steve Coogan supporting Nick Frost and Simon Pegg, really made the film something special. It was the best comedy for a long time. I watch a film at the cinema twice a week and it was the best of 2007 so far. <br/><br/>There were too many stand-out funny moments to mention. The cinema was full and people stayed behind after talking about it, thats something I haven't seen in a long time at the cinema.<br/><br/>Well done Simon Pegg for making a really outstanding funny movie 10/10"
"jbranch-1","10","1","3","14 February 2007"," Wow! good work!
","Just saw it and it's absolutely brilliant! laughed my ass off, superb last half hour and full of great characters, parodies, jokes, gore and music.<br/><br/>Being a Spaced fan I suppose I'm biased. I love zombie movies so I thought Shaun of the Dead was just superb but I really do think this tops it. All it was missing was some undead! Not much more I can say without giving anything away but take my advice and SEE THIS FILM, you won't be sorry.<br/><br/>Edgar, Simon and Nick: Cheers very much and keep 'em coming! Can't wait to see what you've got for us next (Spaced 3 if you don't mind!! :) Go and see it and then buy it on DVD, you know it makes sense!"
"nobanenogain","8","1","3","14 February 2007"," Genius!
","Move over Murtaugh, Riggs, McClane, Delfino, Johnny Utah, Jack Travis and every other memorable US Cop. Angel and Butterman are the real deal! I knew Hot Fuzz would be great and it was. The team behind Spaced and Shaun maintain their trademarks and have far from sold out. Wright's direction, especially for an action movie, is unnervingly palpable and break-neck! The last half hour arguably the most entertaining tail end to a movie you'll ever come across! In the lead up to it, the humour is brill with Considine and Rafe Spall providing great Country accents to spew over Angel's vacicious nature! Just see the film for the comedy and action-the greatest action movie ever made in Britain by Brits-American's should love it and the Brits already do. Roll on the next Pegg-Frost-Wright project!!"
"MisterMarston","10","1","3","14 February 2007"," Just as good as Shaun of the Dead - and really quite original!
","Now i was really looking forward to this film - although seeing all the trailers i thought it didn't look as good as Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong! Just when you thought Shaun of the Dead covered everything British, such as 'It's perfectly alright - i ran it under a cold tap' or 'Oh sorry dear - i was miles away!', Hot Fuzz comes back with more quotes such as 'She's ever so good' and 'It's just an accident'.<br/><br/>The writing is brilliant yet again. Pegg and Frost work fantastically again. Pegg acting the hard man and Frost acting the light hearted one really make this movie shine.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know the story: 'Pegg plays Nicholas Angel - a top cop who gets moved to a quiet village because of his jealous colleagues. A village where everyone knows your name. Frost plays his associate - who really admires all the cool stuff Pegg has done back in his big city of London. Together - they uncover a conspiracy regarding the village and the 'safest village of the year' competition.<br/><br/>Those who haven't seen Shaun of the Dead will not get some of the jokes, but still - it's a fantastic film none the less. What other film might you see 80 year olds with machine guns shooting the hell out of everything! A true gem - and not a film to be missed. Just as good as Shaun of the Dead - and maybe better in some cases. They strike gold again. I urge you to see this film.<br/><br/>Custard x"
"orangelamppost","10","1","3","14 February 2007"," think Shaun of the dead plus the police, substitute the zombies for elderly people and add more guns = Hot Fuzz
","Best film I have personally seen for 2007.... 2006, 2005 you get the idea. Like other people have commented Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and not forgetting Nicholas Frost, Have managed to do the possible, what many people thought was the impossible, and that was out do Shaun of the dead. I was also rather chuffed to see Bill Bailey as the custody sergeant in his usual ""glass eye"" comedy stint.<br/><br/>Now question is, they have to do something better next time than Shaun of the dead and hot fuzz, to make outstanding films, if they decide to carry on their successful comedy duo. I await in pleasure and ancipitation for Edgar wright and Simon pegg's next delight.<br/><br/>Remember this is Best action comedy you will see in 2007, don't waste the next couple months watch it now!"

","Just been to to see this film. Went in with high expectations, due to the inspired brilliance that was Shaun of the Dead and being a big Spaced fan...AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! One can ignore the somewhat slap stick humour almost solely advertised on TV; this really is a well done film! With a nice blend of visual gags, situation comedy (obviously), action, murder mystery and ""buddy movie"" styles, Hot Fuzz is as brilliant in everyway as Shaun of the Dead was.Additionally ( and if you're like me you'll smirk in recognition at these bits) the typical nods to the days of Spaced that seem to crop up in these films are there too (With Julia Deakin as the Pub landlady in Hotfuzz and flat land lady in Spaced).Not only that but there are a host of familiar faces, including Bill Bailey (in quite funny part,or should I say parts! ;-) ) and Bill Nighy (Perhaps a bigger part would have been better!)<br/><br/>Think Wicker Man meets Bad Boys meets the best damned English Comic talent in years.

","Well what can i say? They've nailed it again! Feeling privileged to say i caught the very first screening of this film in Cardiff at 12:20am tonight with high expectations for it and needless to say i haven't felt this satisfied since losing my virginity...Rather than focusing on a particular genre (horror for Shaun) Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg utilise every aspect of comedy they possibly can in the most mature AND immature ways possible...I feel this movie can attract a much larger audience than Shaun of the dead in that you don't need to know you're Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead quotes to have a chuckle at this movie...Full-O-surprises (but not gonna even begin to say what they are) i must say fan of there's or not this movie is a total knockout for movie-goers. I feel it will be one of the biggest high-lights for 2007, most definitely in the comedy genre....so why wait round pondering what to see and go see this expertly made creation and tell me that you don't find at least 5 things funny in it cause believe you me you will.....and that is a total guarantee"
"aislinnprior","10","1","3","11 February 2007"," Fried Gold!
","I saw this movie ten days before the UK release date and I thought it was amazing. Being a big fan of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead, however, I may have been slightly biased.<br/><br/>Seeing as the film was made in vein of the success of SOTD, I liked how some aspects were kept the same (Nick Frost playing quite a slow, 'useless' character, references to SOTD and other films) yet some parts were changed. Simon Pegg's character (Nicholas Angel) is completely different to Tim Bisley in Spaced and Shaun in SOTD.<br/><br/>The film has a great cast, all top British comedy actors - and in almost every new scene that comes up, there's someone there that makes you think 'Now what have I seen them in before?!' The film is both very funny and a serious cop film at the same time - with a LOT of gore, surprisingly! It was, perhaps, slightly long - it lasted 2 hours - which meant that towards the end I did find myself checking my watch... but it was more than worth it.<br/><br/>If you are considering going to watch this film, I would say definitely go and see it!"
"deg200","9","1","3","10 February 2007"," Here comes the Fuzz!
","I was lucky enough to catch this at a preview screening. Let me back up a moment: I was a huge fan of 'Spaced' when it aired in the UK and 'Shaun of the Dead' instantly leapt into my Top 10 Movies of all time, so I think it would be fair to say my anticipation of 'Hot Fuzz' was pretty high.<br/><br/>The film opens with a blisteringly quick - and brilliant - montage of sequences showcasing the quality of city cop Nicholas Angel's policing skills. He soon finds himself relocated to a small village because he's making the rest of the force ""look bad"" and it's at this point that the movie kicks in.<br/><br/>For those of us who love the comedy tag-team that is Pegg & Frost, Hot Fuzz is an absolute dream. There are so many quotes destined for greatness and featuring some wonderful cameos from the cream of cult British talent - look out for Steve Coogan, Martin Freeman & Bill Nighy as Angel's police peers. Fans of 'Big Train' & 'Jam' will spot Kevin Eldon straight away, and Bill Bailey also has a wonderful role.<br/><br/>'Hot Fuzz' has got a bit of everything - for fans of 'Spaced' & 'Shaun...', you'll eat this up and the laughs are plentiful and brilliant. The only disappointment was the absence of a Jessica Stephenson cameo.<br/><br/>Action junkies will get kicks out of the *many* in-jokes and references and there's even a couple of inventive death scenes for the gore-hounds out there.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. :)"
"big_matt38","10","1","3","9 February 2007"," A heck of a good time :)
","Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have teamed up to make, in my mind, some of the funniest most original comedies that have been seen in recent years. Firstly Spaced, and then Shaun of the Dead, and now Hot Fuzz all amazing shows that should be on everyone's to watch list. Hot Fuzz is along the same lines of comedy, with plenty of references to other films and shows mixed into a fantastic script. <br/><br/>The plot is fairly straight forward, overachieving workaholic officer in the London Police (Simon Pegg) is making the rest of the force (or service) look bad so they decide to sweep him under the rug into the countryside ... where nothing supposedly happens. He is met there by what appears to be a bungling inefficient local police force, and he is partnered up brilliantly with Nick Frost's character a complete slob for lack of a better word (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were best friends in both Spaced and Shaun of the Dead and they have a brilliant repartee together).Then the fun really begins ...<br/><br/>I did feel it was a bit slow moving to begin with, but then the finale is incredible certain elements of which are borderline genius. I will say this though watch out if showing the movie to younger viewer some parts are a tad graphic. So there you have it; another amazing movie from the driving force behind Spaced and Shaun of the Dead. PLEASE PLEASE MAKE MORE MOVIES GUYS (I think a Sci Fi spoof should be the next one :-) )"
"OllyBishop","10","1","3","10 February 2007"," wow, wow, wow.
","OK, i'm as biased as they come. i love these guys and everything they do, so it's gonna be no surprise that i loved it. Even a day later i still think it's better than Shaun! And no matter how much i love zombies, this one was more consistently funny, had a load of cool action, and even better gore and deaths than SOTD. The acting was as you would expect from such a top notch cast, top class. And the fine line between playing it straight and homage was perfect. The references, even when blatant, are not forced or shoe horned in. They fit in perfectly with the tone of the movie. And wait until you see old people with guns, hilarious!"
"captainanorak","10","1","3","9 February 2007"," See this film. Now.

I spent the last fifteen minutes of it in pain because I need to go to the toilet so badly but I just couldn't tear myself away from the screen. <br/><br/>I loved SotD, but I have to say that I think that this tops it. All of the acting is excellent, but special credit must go to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (obviously) but also to Timothy Dalton in possibly his most entertaining role ever. The supporting cast is excellent as well, with some of the most memorable lines being delivered by them. <br/><br/>I will be seeing this one again, and I'm already impatient for the DVD release.<br/><br/>See it now - you know you want to."
"cousinolaf","10","1","3","9 February 2007"," A great leap forward for the Spaced boys
","As much as I loved 'Shaun Of The Dead', something about it always felt like a TV in-joke on the big screen. An extended episode of 'Spaced' with slightly different characters, a bigger budget and zombies. Maybe not made directly for the fans, but certainly appealing to an pre-existing core audience. 'Hot Fuzz' on the other hand is so much more a genuine new product. Still driven by the same sense of humour, but driven at a different speed, and in a new direction. Characters, scenarios all feel new, and Edgar Wright's direction is taken to a new level, really complimenting the action, and at times adding whole new levels of humour with framing and editing alone. The cast is superb. All in all, this really feels like 'Shaun' was a taster, a dip in the water of moviedom with one eye on its roots. 'Hot Fuzz' marks the boys real start in the movie world. This is A Movie. And a damned good one. And, most importantly, funny as all hell. And if you don't agree.... Ttthhhhbbppppp....Jog on...."
"rickgreer_uk","10","1","3","9 February 2007"," What a film!!!
","From the makers of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz. I was lucky enough to have watched an early preview yesterday. This film does not disappoint. It's extremely funny, even the characters i thought i wouldn't like turned out to be quite funny. The plot isn't overly complicated, but there enough twists and to be honest the film is too funny to get bogged down in it.<br/><br/>It does have a few scary moments, the ""murderer"" has a slightly scream-esquire feel, enough to make you stop laughing for a minute anyway..<br/><br/>Overall, the film is excellent, it goes above and beyond Shaun of the Dead making it the funniest British film i've ever watched. I implore you all to go see it, you won't be disappointed. Trust me."

","I was lucky enough last night to meet Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright at an exclusive screening of HOT FUZZ. Now, Shaun of the Dead is my favourite film of all time and I loved SPACED, so I was buzzing with excitement when I plumped down in my seat and the three aforementioned legends introduced the film. My brief summary? Go see it. Now. It. Is. AWESOME.<br/><br/>Now, I do not wish to spoil what WILL be the film of 2007. It is absolutely hilarious and the last half an hour moves at a breathless pace. I cried with laughter several times and the sheer absurd brilliance of the action keeps you on the edge of your seat. The guys have pulled it off with APLOMB and look forward to attempting to break my own record of having seen SOTD 7 times in a cinema!! However, I will say that it isn't as good as SOTD. But without a doubt its up there. It hasn't shattered the barrier SOTD set, but at the very least its pushing very hard against it, cracking and denting it slightly!"
"sion-phillips","9","1","3","7 February 2007"," Good but not perfect
","I was this at a preview screening last night. If you liked Shaun of the Dead or Spaced you'll like Hot Fuzz as it's very much in the same vein of humour.<br/><br/>It was great to see a British film given a proper budget to be able to produce a high quality movie with good quality special effects. The humour is typical of British movies and no doubt will lead to the film being a success.<br/><br/>The film is a little slow to start with (much like Shaun of the Dead) but the story quickly develops before degenerating into a Bad Boys II style gun-fest with massive gun fights in a village setting.<br/><br/>I wonder how many more films Simon and Edgar can do together before the style of script and shooting start to get repetitive."
"jimbotfu-1","10","1","3","7 February 2007"," Superb
","I saw Hot Fuzz at a gala preview screening and cannot recommend it highly enough.<br/><br/>I was a little sceptical having seen the trailers... I feared that the team that brought us Shaun of the Dead were to be resting on the laurels after the success of their previous film. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, if you liked Shaun of the Dead or the TV series Spaced, you will love Hot Fuzz. Simon Pegg is brilliant in a surprisingly straight role as the hot-shot cop whose proficiency on the force (or ""service"" as he repeatedly refers to it) sees him relocated to a sleepy countryside village for making his co-workers look bad in comparison.<br/><br/>The first 20 mins are a little bit laugh-free, but once Nick Frost's wonderfully naive village policeman enters the picture, things pick up immensely. The film gathers pace all the way through and leads to an amazingly action-packed and hilarious finale which manages to mix extreme violence, tension and laughs to an even greater genre-defying degree than Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>This movie subverts the cop buddy action movie in a very similar way to the way in which Shaun of the Dead put a new spin on the zombie genre. If you're familiar with British comedy, you will recognise a slew of cameos and supporting roles from some of the best in the business - including Steve Coogan and Bill Bailey whose role is revealed in one hilarious moment to be not all that it initially seemed!<br/><br/>Timothy Dalton is also wonderful as a shamelessly panto-style villain.<br/><br/>I must also mention one of the most hilariously graphic on-screen deaths I've ever seen, simply because it is so unexpectedly grizzly. You'll know it when you see it...but prepare yourself from the moment that the church fÃªte begins! And also some extreme violence in and around a Somerfield supermarket, which really underlines the comedic success of the film - the mixing of the action-packed and visceral with the quaint and mundane.<br/><br/>By the power of grayskull, you must see this film!"

","I managed to catch this movie last night at my local cinema (advanced gala Performance) and it could not have been a better end to a bad day at work. The humour is still there for you who thought shaun of the dead was a fluke. Now they have spread there wings into the world of a small English village and there crack police force crime is bubbling in the village and its down to Pegg and Frost to sort it all out. this movie is a laugh a minute but I would recommend taking a refresher course of shaun of the dead before watching this as it will allow the in jokes to jump out at you. Cameo's from pure British talent like bill bailey steve coogan martin freeman bill nighy and steve merchant. I will be back at the cinema in a couple of weeks to watch this again just for the great on screen genius shown between pegg and frost a legendary double act in the making. if you are watching guys i am free for the premiere if you have a couple of tickets knocking around"
"sifly1","10","1","3","6 February 2007"," One of the funniest films I've ever seen
","Managed to see this at an advanced screening at one of the Vue cinemas in London, and can honestly say I have not laughed so much at a film in a long, long time.<br/><br/>It is hard not to compare this to Shaun of the Dead, lot's of the same actors appear and Edgar Wright's style is very much present, but let me say that it is much funnier. I'm not sure how every joke will work in other countries, as spoofing Bad Boys using English policemen is something you just don't see in England. English police aren't really portrayed as 'cool' very often. But they really pull it off. The characters, just as in SOTD, are brilliantly written and Simon Pegg really pulls off being a straight faced super cop.<br/><br/>If you like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's type of humour then this will probably be one of your favourite films, it's certainly one of mine. Highly recommended."
"mary3972","10","1","3","6 February 2007"," Hot Fuzz Advance Screening at Vue Cinema, Inverness
","On the back of their success with Shaun of the Dead, the creative team of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have struck comic gold again with Hot Fuzz. Their inspired pairing, since the mid 90s, has created an inspired comic look at British Policemen, sorry Officers, and made the Met cool again. Hot Fuzz references Shaun in both dialogue and the short-cut editing style, feeling like a welcome return for its audience.<br/><br/>They simultaneously pay homage to and make fun of cop films, particularly buddy movies like Point Break and Bad Boys 2, pairing Simon's Sgt. Nicholas Angel with Nick Frost's PC Danny Butterman. As their characters become partners and, eventually, buddies they reflect at first the audience's own outsider feelings towards the rural community in which they find themselves, then a genuine friendship which allows both to find their place; that's after they've shot-up and destroyed everything first, of course.<br/><br/>It is very, very funny, both on initial viewing and in the memory on the car drive home, that goes way beyond the jokes from the trailers. Its' cracking script and well told story is a joy to behold, as are the wonderfully created characters who are sometimes self-aware enough to know how silly it all is.<br/><br/>If you see no other films this year, see this one.

","I saw this last night at my local VUE cinema on a preview. They were searching peoples' bags on the way in probs to stop people filming it I guess. Anyway, they gave us a little white goodie bag with a brand new copy of SOTD, a poster and some pop and popcorn which was nice. Onto the film, well let me start by saying that is surpasses SOTD for humour. It does take a little while to warm up but when it does, boy are you people in for a treat. It has amazing gore, better than SOTD by miles (Look out for the spike through the chin scene and the masonry falling from the church), great humour with Ed the real start hear delivering gag after gag (jog on) in has part as a dummy yokel copper. Simon Pegg is convincing as the supercop farmed out to Sandford so as not to make his colleagues look bad because of his amazing record and the story will surprise you as it moves to its conclusion. I am trying not to give anything away here but a clue for you as to the conclusion and this is a rather obtuse one is that Edward Woodward stars. That is all!<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","I've just got home from seeing an advance preview of the 'eagerly awaited film 'Hot Fuzz'. I've been waiting to see this film ever since I first watched 'Shaun of the Dead', and whilst reading a film magazine in the foyer, I read an article saying they would be making the ultimate English action movie next. <br/><br/>Well... did they? Not 'arf!!!<br/><br/>Its no hidden secret, but I am a Simon Pegg groupie! I think he is a genius. Along side the talents of Edgar Wright and Nick Frost... this team can do no wrong. Having brought to us the unbeatably funny TV Sitcom 'Spaced', and the hilarious and cult hit 'Shaun of the Dead', these guys are just the dogs!<br/><br/>'Hot Fuzz' is about a super city cop (Simon Pegg as Nick Angel), who gets promoted to a quiet little village in the middle of nowhere because his amazing track record is making the rest of the department look bad. Often used to car chases, and the use of fire arms, Nick gets frustrated having to handle this quiet little village... but not all is what it seems. <br/><br/>The story rolls along at a really nice pace, utilising the beautiful mix of editing and sound effects that have become common place in Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg collaborations. The plot is set out in a very similar way to their previous film 'SOTD', and has similar plot twists, but what ain't broken doesn't need fixing! The script is laden with beautiful one liners to tell your mates about, and are real crowd pleaser's. I guarantee you'll be quoting this film to death!<br/><br/>The technical side to this film is all what you would expect from the team, good cinematography, great special f/x, unbelievable sound effects, fast and beautifully handled editing. The score by David Arnold is just fantastic, and does this film some real good!<br/><br/>The acting is, as always, spot on from the two leads Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Simon plays it cold and tough, whilst Nick basically recreates a similar character to that of 'SOTD', whom he was born to play. The rest of the film is crammed full of the best of British comedy acting including Jim Broadbent, Paddy Considine, and Adam Buxton. In the same breath you also have some fantastic actors like Timothy Dalton, Billy Whitelaw, and Edward Woodward all playing wonderful roles. <br/><br/>This film has just so much going on! Its teeming with homage's to some of the greatest action movies ever made, and will need repeat viewing to find them all. They especially love to lampoon their previous film 'SOTD', and these are some of the films funniest moments. You also have some really tense and exciting chase sequences, as well gun battles! The sound effects are just so spot on! You will feel every bullet! What also surprised me about this film was the level of violence and gore! These guys don't hold back! In some cases... this film is gorier than their previous film, and certainly contains more guns! <br/><br/>I can't stop grinning as I write this... its been a long time since a film 'hit the spot' for me, and these boys have done it! Its also been a long time that I have seen a film where everyone laughed, whooped and cheered! It even got a standing ovation at the end! I cant believe I have to wait a whole ten days before I can get back in line to see this again when it opens on the 16th Feb! I would say this film is a cross between 'The Wicker Man' and 'Die Hard', so if that appeals in a weird way... then you can do no wrong seeing this movie. <br/><br/>This really is the film of the year for me, I know that's a little premature... but I would also say it's one of the best films I have ever seen! Don't believe me? Go see this for yourself to decide! This really is the Ultimate English Action Movie!"

","This film was absolutely FANTASTIC!!! The Cineworld Cinema in Glasgow showed a preview before the Premier itself with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost introducing the film and having a question and answer afterwards. The atmosphere in the cinema hall was superb and the film left you in stitches and on a high. It was filled with great comedy, amazing action and some rather stomach twisting scenes.<br/><br/>Overall I give it the two thumbs up and I definitely would recommend this film as a MUST SEE when it hits the cinemas on the 16th of Feb.<br/><br/>Hopefully we can see more from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in the near future."

","I caught this movie at an advanced screening and this is now possibly my favourite movie ever. being a film student I am really judgemental over what I see but Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are the masters of comedy without a shadow of doubt.<br/><br/>The film is a laugh a second from start to finish and cannot be described in any way sort or form. If you think Shaun Of The Dead was good, this film will make it look like Saturday morning cartoons in comparison.<br/><br/>There are moments where the jokes look to come from their previous work such as Shaun and Spaced but are completely re-vamped to bring humour to a new audience.<br/><br/>The source material is unbelievably researched and it shows as Pegg and Frost deliver to the audience some of the most outrageous and down right crazy nods to Hollywood action movies."

Good thing I was in a cinema and quite comfortable. <br/><br/>They could have easily trimmed the first hour of the film by about 30-40 minutes, which would have made it much better IMO."

The problem i found was that, although the idea for the recipe of this film was great they went too heavy on the action I found the seriousness that Peggs character brought to this film dominated all Nick Frosts attempts at being funny. This problem especially comes into play at the end of the movie which i will not spoil. <br/><br/>So to sum up i believe this film is too serious and not funny enough."

","Somehow the 20 min epic featured within an episode of The Office, was a funnier action movie parody than the 2hr Hot Fuzz. On the other hand the Torrente series, even the later ones, were funnier. 20 min or 10 hrs? Perhaps it isn't really that hard to make fun of Hollywood unless you're pandering and being self indulgent in you're attempt to make fun of pandering and self indulgence. Angel unlike Torrente is the straight arrow and just about everyone else is corrupt and weird. Pegg is playing primarily a straight man. And he's onscreen at least 90% of the time. Does anyone see a problem? Jack Benny was the best straight man ever and he logged less screen time in To Be or Not To Be. Pegg is no Jack Benny."

","Let me preface my remarks by saying how genius I thought Shaun of the Dead was, by far, one of the best films the year it came out. That is why I was so anxious to see this film, which starred the two main characters from that film (and others). But how let down I was at the result of their next product. And let me tell you something, all of these 10 ratings you are seeing, those were ratings that people decided to give this film before they even saw it, I assure you. Because this film was not very good. The first hour drags like you would not believe. There are practically no good supporting roles in it, which is what separates it so much from Shaun of the Dead. I just thought the film was so tedious and I was checking my clock numerous times. The writing was just not there. Yes, I know, it was a parody of other cop movies (wow, what an innovative idea, have not ever seen that), but there was just nothing that amusing. Of course, at the end, they tack on the obligatory shoot-out scene, but it was tedious as well. Moreover, with recent events at Virginia Tech, it was more than a bit uncomfortable. There is a lot of hype on this movie right now because of how good Shaun of the Dead was, but this film is not Shaun of the Dead, not even close."

Overall Hot Fuzz isn't as funny as it has been praised, though it is quite interesting at a certain point. The film has a slow build but within its second act it does get better. Not as great in terms of originality and some of the jokes feel forced. Many of the characters accents are at times hard to hear, and is a reason why the film isn't as great. Had this been done with typical american actors and not portrayed in London, it most certainly would have been better."

But I can't really believe that someone laughed at any time of this movie. The concept is good, but it would be a better movie if they tried to make it action and not comedy. Can't believe it. I totally don't recommend it. The only time I laughed was when a fat guy destroyed a fence, trying to jump over it. 7.9? It's to high for this. I could give it 4. OK. Not 8!

","I propose that if Quentin Tarentino made comedies, his name would be Edgar Wright: Both filmmakers share a cult sensibility, a smartly allusionary approach, and a load of talent. All of these elements are at play in Hot Fuzz, stylistically notable for its sequences of intense montage--its best moments invoke artful synthesis and Michael Bay chaos in equal measure-- and for Wrights's keen sense of visual irony, particularly when drawing on the hilariously stoic Simon Pegg. Wright makes great films, his distinctly filmic sense of humor is a much-needed departure from Hollywood jokiness, Hot Fuzz is awesome and you really should have seen Scott Pilgrim."

","I honestly can't understand what all the fuss is about. Simon Pegg's many fans seem to approach his films in the same way that 70's teenyboppers listened to the latest Donny Osmond single. He's a Channel 4 comedy actor, not a film actor. The script is a mild-mannered pastiche which should be in a Channel 4 comedy sketch show. There are no real characters, no real emotions, nothing at stake. If any real screenwriter approached a producer with this script, it would go straight in the bin. Pastiche has to be cheap, cheerful and short. This isn't any of those. I watched this in the cinema. No-one laughed. It was mildly amusing. It was too long and there was plenty of fidgeting going on by the end. It belongs in the same category as all those other consumer goods that lots of people buy even though they aren't very good. If you want the same basic story made into a proper comedy film, go and see Oh! Mr Porter."
"extravaluejotter","8","1","4","4 August 2007"," Bloody Brilliant
","No-one can doubt the huge cultural impact of ""Hot Fuzz"". My work colleagues and I frequently blow raspberries, flick the Vees and invite each other to ""Jog On"". <br/><br/>Just as they did with ""Shaun of the Dead"", Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have taken a fairly stale movie sub-genre, fed it a few drinks and filmed it making an ass of itself in public. People expect UK comedy movies to be gently mocking, middle-class tales about Hugh Grant falling for an unattainable American or a bunch of Northerners who form the world's only nude brass band. ""Hot Fuzz"" manages to combine traditional British whimsy with a healthy dose of American Action Steroids and the result doesn't so much break the mould as blow up the mould factory.<br/><br/>Is it any good? You bet. ""Hot Fuzz"" is a high-octane blend of running gags, snappy one-liners, clever observational comedy, fine acting, gunplay and messy murder scenes. ""Hot Fuzz"" is the perfect antidote for anyone who's overdosed on one-too-many Brit gangster flicks, American cop-buddy movies or Richard Curtis's so-called comedies."

","It's February 2007 and Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright are back from the undead and bringing in the new year with Hot Fuzz, a crime caper, a rural whodunnit and a Charles Bronson revenge flick all in one neat two hour package.<br/><br/>Sounds too good to be true? It almost is. After the huge success of Shaun of the Dead, the filmgoing community have been hanging on tenterhooks, with little information to go on. And it seems that anyone who doesn't want to watch Hot Fuzz simply wants to appear in it - the film includes some of the UK's most seasoned comedians and RSC actors.<br/><br/>Once again, the movie is expertly made, stretching out what one can only assume was a comparatively small budget. There are funny lines and an involving and amusing relationship between the two leads, Angel and Danny. However, the extra glamour tacked on to the film, in the shape of Hong Kong-style gunfights and heavyweight actors like Timothy Dalton and Jim Broadbent adds very little to the film. The most enjoyable part of all of Pegg and Wright's work has been the interaction between the characters. The complex 'whodunnit' plot is as perfunctory as anything penned by the writers of Midsomer Murders, and merely a distraction from the comedy. And when the final set-piece arrives, it is too late in the film, and possibly too daft to be wholly compelling.<br/><br/>The principal problem with the film however, other than its generous length, is that Pegg and pals have created a product equally disposable as the films they have lampooned. Did they mean to achieve this? Who can say?"

","First off, Hot Fuzz is a funny film... most of the time. It\\\\\\\'s also a great action film... some of the time. Pegg and Frost are good as the leads, but the show is stolen by sneering villain Timothy Dalton who seems to be really enjoying himself.<br/><br/>The problem with Fuzz is the running time. Instead of thinking about pace and plot, the film was written deliberately to last 2 hours exactly which is risky for a comedy. There are some great gags in Fuzz, but also a lot of empty space, uninspiring characterisation and wasted cameos.<br/><br/>The action is fairly light, consisting of foot chases until... the final shootout which is the most fun I've had in a cinema since... well, Rocky Balboa. But the point is, it's a great sequence that ranks up there with Shaun of the dead.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is very much a hit and miss film. It misses an awful lot, but when it hits, it hits you with a shotgun to the head and a spinning kick out the window.<br/><br/>3/5"

Alright, I think I have made my point, but you can never be to certain, so, here we go again. This movie was awful, crappy and indescribably full of s***! Just see at the things I have already mentioned and if you see or have just seen the movie, think about it, think about it and you will see, it will appear in your head thoughts of how incredibly sh***y this movie actually is.<br/><br/>My final point before I wrap this up is formed as a question: ""What is the moral of this movie?"" oh, and if you want the answer I will give it to you right here, right now. The answer is: There is no moral! This movie is simply a film packed with unreal action, bad scenery, crappy script or plot if you will, without any meaning or point or moral at all! It is crap, nothing else, just crap! Even though it is crap, it still had some good points, not enough to get a good rating, obviously, but it gets not one, but two or three stars. You know, out of ten. I think I will go with three this time, because I liked the ending. I have seen it more than one time before, but I will not see it again, not if I can help it.<br/><br/>Just to be clear this movie, ""Hot Fuzz"", starring Simon Pegg (from Shaun of the dead) did not really deserve 3 stars, but because of its good final scene, gets 3/10 stars from me, Shevy.<br/><br/>This was your always trustworthy, honest and reliable writer, J.J. Shevy. And I say goodnight and sleep tight to all of you and I thank you for reading my review of ""Hot Fuzz"".<br/><br/>Peace & Love God Bless THE END"

","After Sean of the Dead, there were many of us excited to hear that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had done another feature with their brand of humor. I thought part of Sean's charm was it low-key simplicity. Here, we take a fine concept, a successful London cop assigned to a sleepy country town, and blow it into a full-on action movie. There are still lots of funny moments, and Bill Nighy is pure gold for the 2.398 minutes of screen time he gets. However, it ended up feeling very by-the-numbers by the end, with all the plot reveals, chase sequences, and tidy resolutions. He may as well have gone Hollywood--there are so many generic moments that they cancel out the original ideas. Why put in the effort and waste your talent on something that's been done so many times as the buddy cop format? Then again, I've heard some bad things about the Simon Pegg movie that came out after this one, so maybe he had already used up all his good ideas when he finished Sean."

","'Hot Fuzz' is a satirical story about a police officer from London who is moved to a quiet village. Along the way, he tries to uncover the truths about some abnormal deaths in the village. The film pokes fun at small British village life in Gloucestershire, the police, and at itself. Simon Pegg (and some of his Spaced co-stars) makes his come-back with this satirical, dark-humored film. There's plenty of action and humour and school-child events (like creative ways in which people meet their ends). This film appeals to the inner child, so it cannot be taken seriously, and the action/suspense/comedy keep it interesting. In my opinion, 'Hot Fuzz' is a better film than 'Sean of the Dead'. The pitfalls of 'Sean of the Dead' (which was not too bad of a film) were overcome in 'Hot Fuzz' to create a more entertaining film."

","Edgar Wright's follow-up to SHAUN OF THE DEAD reunites that film's tale of two stars for an action movie parody with a distinctly British feel. It's a film played for laughs and packed with humour throughout, but as with any comedy, whether you like it or not depends on your sense of humour. I was rather indifferent; I felt that some of the scenes were genuinely running, while plenty of others fell flat and the two-hour running time made the second half really drag.<br/><br/>The film IS worth watching for the cast alone, as assembled are many British heavyweights including Billie Whitelaw, Edward Woodward, and more; best of all is Timothy Dalton, away from our screens for far too long and putting in an excellent turn. This time around, Simon Pegg is the lean, straight hero, and he gives his supporting characters all of the best lines. Nick Frost once again steals the limelight as the dim-witted village policeman and personally I found him to be the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>The film is undoubtedly well made and, as a pastiche of action cinema, there are plenty of references to be enjoyed by movie fans amid the humour. Unfortunately a lot of the secondary characters are sweary, unlikeable people who I didn't particularly want to have much screen time (Paddy Considine is my main consideration here). The bombastic nature of the production is done on purpose for laughs (imagine the mock-seriousness/earnestness of Michael Bay transported to rural England) but I found it to be severely grating and the shoot-outs that pepper the latter stages of the film are so unremarkable as to be dull. The CGI gore effects are in-your-face and gratuitous, and, I guess, played for laughs again, but I guess I missed the joke. This is one comedy that I definitely won't be returning to!"

","A promising start to the film eventually develops into long winded slap-stick action sequences.<br/><br/>There is some good comedy in the first half of the film and another Shaun of the dead type triumph seems to be on the cards with the dark British humour and interesting scenario.<br/><br/>However action sequences of this ""action-comedy"" become tiresome with any tension in the chases or gun fights shattered by the cartoon style jokes. By the end of the film any comedy element is virtually non existent and not helped by the drawn out scenes.<br/><br/>The UK advertising campaign for Hot Fuzz claimed ""best action-comedy of 2007"". I watched this film in mid February and as far as I know it was the only action-comedy of the year so far.<br/><br/>A missed opportunity to build on the good work done with Shaun of the dead although it somehow seems inevitable that Hot Fuzz will be more successful."
"agmoldham","5","1","6","9 March 2007"," A bit of a disappointment
","This is a comedy from the team that made ""Shaun of the Dead"" with lots of the cast also appearing in both films. The film follows ""police officer"" Nicholas Angel who is too successful in London. He is given a promotion and a relocation into leafy England. The film follows Angel as he settles into his new role.<br/><br/>The film doesn't really have the same zest as Shaun of the Dead and the producer could have been a bit more ruthless with the final cut and chopped 30 minutes from the running time. It's not really that the film is too long, it's just not got enough material for 2 hours. It's pleasant enough, but not in the same league as Shaun."

","I had many problems with this picture. Being a brit myself i expected a funny, gory, bubbly romp like Shaun of the dead. Instead i got an overlong, half-baked, marginally funny movie that wasn't much fun. A boring spoof on the buddy cop genre.<br/><br/>The film stars simon pegg as a cop who has been moved to sanford to work. He makes friends with a fellow cop, but is suspicious about the towns lack of crime and high levels of ""accidents"". He then finds out what the cause is.<br/><br/>In the area of faint praise, Hot fuzz has a decent finale. The gun fight between the villagers and the cops is well staged and pretty funny. It's a shame we have to sit through a lot of sappy, wooden rubbish before we get to this point.<br/><br/>Hot fuzz is no where near as good as the reviews suggest. But it's not awful either."
"Bocklocke","4","1","7","10 September 2007"," Looks and Sounds Good, Unfortunately It's Not
","I really thought a British spoof on police life would be funny. I also though Hot Fuzz would deliver that kind of funny I was expecting from the same people as ""Shaun of the Dead."" Instead I get this diluted and brainless rendition of British police life. Nick Angel, who goes to a small town to work, has an idiotically unfunny sidekick, and tries to solve a number of grisly, gruesome murders. There are some funny parts, though they are too far between and pretty lame when they occur. You'll find yourself laughing-- a little. Often Angel's sidekick make some idiotic remark or tries to copy Angel with moronic results. You may giggle a little when a man is seen urinating in a pub. Humorous instances are too broad apart and when they do occur it's like, ""Okay. Big deal."" The movie is described as an ""action-comedy"", but a better description for this would be a ""mild action-lame comedy"" movie. To be quite honest, I didn't even finish the movie. I have better things to do with my time than spend two hours and one minute waiting for the action to heat up in Hot Fuzz or the humor to be more humorous."
"oneloveall","6","1","7","28 July 2007"," Surprisingly overrated
","By no means a dud, Hot Fuzz tries a little too hard but does not necessarily capture all the magic that came with skewing zombie flicks. This time around the Wright/Pegg alliance dish out an overly long police parody and while there are still quite a lot of hits, the misses are there as well. Many of the jokes are not so much funny as they are intelligent, as has always been the plight of those damn smart Brits and their attempts at tickling our funny-bones.<br/><br/>So, while you may find yourself with a consistently warped smirk across your face, indulging in all the tiny witticisms, mediocre (disguised as brilliant) comedic timing, and half-baked pop references, seldom do the rip-roaring laughs come fast and furious. All the excessive hyper-edits might have given this rural English laugher a fresh sheen but really did nothing to compliment the little hilarity present, and instead became a tad repetitious and distracting, as if the technical competency seemed over-excessive to disguise a lack of gut-busting material found in the script.<br/><br/>Fans of the cult fave Shaun of the Dead will not question any of these inconsistencies for a second, gleefully eating it up with a knife and fork (as the thunderous chorus of hallowed praise for this film has indicated) but for those going in completely unbiased, exercise caution. Heck, it's not like we are flooded with quality comedies all the time, but Hot Fuzz certainly only felt lukewarm at best."

","I finally saw Hot Fuzz yesterday.<br/><br/>As the HF filmmakers want to point out ""from the guys who created Shaun of the Dead"", audiences and critics will naturally compare and critique against the success of SOTD. I love SOTD, preach and advocate it, and often carry a copy (to lend to others who haven't seen it of course). As a fan I had high expectations for Fuzz, maybe too high as Fuzz misses the bar. Reasons: the Fuzz homage seemed more like a tribute/reunion to SOTD than to the police/buddy cop genre (unsure why gore needs to be in a comedy cop movie...unnecessary excess), too many characters that weren't that interesting, weak storyline, the overall pacing was too slow, to the point that even the few funny parts wheren't all that funny (I found myself hoping that Simon/Nick would get funnier), and the big climatic gunfight was pure fromage.<br/><br/>It was interesting that ""the guys who created SOTD"" chose to reference Point Break and Bad Boys 2. Royalties...hmm? Nevertheless the references were so played up that the upcoming scenes became predictable (keanu shooting/emptying his gun in the air when he couldn't fire on fleeing swayze...actually watching Nick in this scene was kinda funny).<br/><br/>I wanted to like Fuzz and although it was good to see the chemistry of Simon and Nick together again on the big screen, that only gets you a 5 rating.

","This is watchable yet generally unfunny and way tired. It's a spoof but it's weak on humor and the script is is simply a mish mash of their take on other movies with a few minor comedic twists here and there by the duo of ""Shaun of the Dead"". The blood and gore factor is nice solid punch in between the jokes- I respect them for that- and I like these guys as a comedic team, it's just that it's silly and tired to do a cop farce at this point.. it's such well trodden ground it's bound to come up extremely lacking and this script comes up short in laughs and excitement.<br/><br/>Go watch supertroopers or police academy one or Shaun of the Dead instead.<br/><br/>PLOT: An English cop is transferred to a remote village where everything seems a bit too perfect and sleepy to be real. Then he starts to uncover that things are not quite what they seem, something foul is afoot decent gore effects meet a retarded plot that is a comedic vehicle from the duo that starred in Shaun of the Dead - the fat guy and the skinny guy.<br/><br/>This is a situation gag comedy from the same team that stars in ""Shaun of the Dead"".

","I'm a fan of British comedy, and quite honestly i'm not really a gourmet when it comes to comedy in the first place. I don't have a problem with laughing at both high and low. So i expected this movie to offer some serious laughs. Especially considering the hype. But i was disappointed.<br/><br/>We see this kind of comedy now and again. It's an attempt to mix old-fashioned small-town gag comedy with something cool and new. And it rarely works. The result is almost always too slow-paced, teeth-less and lacking any serious bite. Hot Fuzz has a few funny moments, but in general it's found wanting. The beginning is rather funny and i did see the potential in the whole set-up. But it's very poorly executed. Much of the movie just drags on with jokes few and far-between. The film-makers try to create a sense of action by some quick editing, which makes the movie seem even slower. Then, in the end, when we finally have our showdown... Well, it's a big anticlimax. Somehow it seems that they never really wanted to go all the way. Instead of going 100% in the end and make it the crazy shootout it needed to be, we instead have a mellow fight that never reaches more than 60%. This movie is not so bad that a huge blowout in the end couldn't have saved it, but that never happens.<br/><br/>In the end this movie warrants a few smiles and the occasional laugh. But it's far from great. Great actors are thrown away on small parts and Simon Pegg honestly isn't that funny. I don't know why they decided to make the whole affair so lame, there is certainly enough gore to make this movie appropriate for adults only... So why tone down the violence and the more no-holds-barred comedy? No, this won't do."

To my mind it shows a lack of development from the team - hopefully the next project will be a tad more ambitious. After the excellence of Spaced, and the highly enjoyable Shaun of the Dead, this film is a definite disappointment, comparatively speaking.

","I absolutely LOVED ""Hot Fuzz"", it's reminiscent of the quaint afternoon dramas that OAPs watch (such as ""Heartbeat"", ""Midsomer Murders"" and ""Inspector Morse"") but with insane action, comically over-the-top violence and curse words a-plenty thrown into the mix. The film is chock-full of fantastic British actors who all give hysterically funny performances, the script is surprisingly intelligent for a film that's this hilarious and the action sequences are both bonkers and thrilling. ""Hot Fuzz"" is more than a silly buddy comedy, it's one of my all-time favourite films!<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" is the first film directed by Edgar Wright that I saw and I still believe that it's his best one. Wright's direction here is excellent, the movie moves at a break-neck pace, meaning that there is never a dull or unentertaining moment. It explodes off the screen with an energetic personality that perfectly blends the setting of a relaxing evening drama with uproariously gory action set-pieces.<br/><br/>Calling the cast in ""Hot Fuzz"" star-studded is a massive understatement. Simon Pegg (who's one of my favourite actors) is as phenomenal as ever in the role of determined police officer, Nicolas Angle, I'm sorry ANGEL. Nick Frost is equally likeable as Angel's partner on the Sandford police service, Danny Butterman, who provides many of the movie's best references and one-liners.<br/><br/>It's staggering how many great actors are in the supporting cast in ""Hot Fuzz"", I would like to praise them all individually, but if I did, this review would be 7,000 words long, so I'll just list some of them. Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, Timothy Dalton, Olivia Colman, Steve Coogan, Paul Freeman, Stephen Merchant and David Bradley all appear in this film (wow, the casting director deserves a round of applause!) But that's not all, Cate Blanchett and Peter Jackson even make cameo appearances here!<br/><br/>From deadpan deliveries to riotous mockeries of action movie tropes, ""Hot Fuzz"" excels in every area of comedy. Not a single joke fell flat and even if you find one gag annoying, the movie barrels along so quickly that you'll probably being laughing at the next joke almost immediately. ""Hot Fuzz"" is probably the smartest comedy I've ever seen, almost every line of dialogue has an amusing and satisfying pay-off later on in the film (meaning that I'll need to re-watch it quite a lot to pick up on all of the clever gags.)<br/><br/>Some action-comedies pride themselves on their comedic moments but lack noteworthy action sequences, thankfully ""Hot Fuzz"" isn't one of those films. Despite some intentional shaky-cam, the action in ""Hot Fuzz"" is a joy to behold, it's stylised, captivating and very, very bloody! What makes the action here even more incredible is that most of the first two-thirds of this movie is very light on traditional action, but then the film goes completely bonkers in the third act and becomes a non-stop adrenaline ride in which the two leads are thrown into an all-out battle with the villains. I don't want to spoil who the antagonists are, but let me just say, the hilarity increases exponentially when they appear on screen!<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Hot Fuzz"" is simply amazing! It's an ingenious lampoon of blow-out action spectaculars and murder mysteries told in a side-splitting and immensely enjoyable way. I loved every single second of it!"

"DwightLynn","10","0","1","23 January 2020"," A Film with Personality
","With Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright has managed to make a perfect movie. The screenplay, acting, directing and editing all work in tandem to deliver a sweet, satisfying experience that leaves one feeling exhilarated. What makes this film so good is the consistency; the beginning of the movie establishes this break-neck pace that follows the film through every scene. Even quiet scenes still have lots of energy to them, and it really gives the film a personality.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially a parody of over-the-top action movies, and it captures all that make these films appealing, while ditching all the baggage these films carry. This film has a tongue-in-cheek quality to it, but it never treats its characters as lesser-than. The characters all take their world seriously, which makes the ridiculous plot even funnier and makes it easier for audiences to stay connected to what they're watching.<br/><br/>Too many parodies make the mistake of being immature nonsense, making it difficult for the audience to connect at all emotionally to the film. Hot Fuzz however manages to ride the line between dumb and sincere, and so you're left not only laughing constantly at the witty dialogue and editing, but you also feel connected to the characters; a testament to the wonderful screenplay by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>Like other fantastic movies, every scene matters and leads to the next scene. Even the dialogue is critically important; on a second watch it becomes apparent just how much reincorporation of certain elements there are. What might sound like a silly throwaway line ends up coming back later to impact the plot. The characters are also hugely memorable. There are characters who show up for 2 minutes and yet they somehow manage to make a huge impression. This is not only due to the actors being naturally good at what they're doing, but it is also proof of the stellar direction. Edgar Wright knows exactly what he is doing every frame of this film. The entire thing feels so perfectly orchestrated that by the end you can't help but smile at how everything came together.<br/><br/>This really is a wonderful experience and it leaves you awestruck at the power film can have. The editing is so hard to describe but it adds so much to the experience and makes Edgar Wright stand out as a director. It's no wonder he has become a household name among film-fans!"

But, that's like 30 minutes in, and we still have 90 more minutes to go! And that's my biggest problem with this movie. How incredibly long it is for a ""comedy.""<br/><br/>But, that's the catch...22. I really would NOT consider this a comedy. This is 100% a mystery-action FIRST and comedy third. Now, don't get me wrong; this movie is hilarious. MANY times did I LAUGH OUT LOUD at its brilliant humor, but for the most part, it's a mystery with just a tad more action than humor. Like half a percent.<br/><br/>London's got a Supercop. No, not the Jackie Chan one actually referenced here.

So, they ship him to a small, crimeless country town and when unique and horrific ""accidents"" begin to happen, ""Hot Fuzz,"" himself, is on the case.<br/><br/>I will praise myself a bit. Once I started to try and think of this more of a mystery than comedy, I pegged the bad guy(s.) And I was right! So, way to go, Steve! Despite how many movies I see, I'm usually terrible at guessing the murder-mystery villains. Ok, that all said...I was only partially right.<br/><br/>Helps my memory on this was 90% wiped. And that's a good feeling. I love forgetting great movies and rediscovering them a decade or more later. It's like getting the same feeling all over again.<br/><br/>They call this movie part of a trilogy despite none of the same characters appear in any of the three films: Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End. While I totally dug this movie, I would absolutely rank these three films in the exact order of the supposed trilogy.<br/><br/>This movie, again, was unquestionably hilarious and I loved the mystery and plight of Simon Pegg's character, alongside non-sexual partner Nick Frost. But, given the chance to see this again or Shaun of the Dead, I would 100% make it a double feature night!<br/><br/>Much like 1991's Point Break and Bad Boys II.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Speaking of which - while not a huge fan of Bad Boys 1, I thought it was just OK having just seen it for the first and ONLY time on 2/26/12. (Can't believe it's been that long!) Since this movie referenced the sequel and long-delayed Part III is scheduled to come out soon, perhaps I need to finally see that for the first time.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts II: Speaking of Sequels - while Nick Frost wasn't wildly out of character or really anything in this film but a great friend and emotional misdirect in the finale (I really did tear up a bit!!!,) it was so odd seeing Pegg as the Straight Man. That took SUCH a long time to peg Simon as the ""normal"" one. It's like seeing James Bond as a Supermarket Owner.<br/><br/>This film was no holds barred! As they said. For the greater good."

","Hot Fuzz is an amazingly funny film. It is about two police officers on the trail of a murderer. It is very gruesome, but it is gory in a funny way. Hot Fuzz has great actors playing funny parts. There are innuendos along the way but those are not harmful. Hot Fuzz will give you constant laughs, but it is DEFINITELY not for children.

","Despite having seen the first and third films in the trilogy a number of times,I've somehow never got round to tasting the second Cornetto flavour.

Opening up the secrets of the town, Wright joyfully sends Angel and Danny into a breakneck Slasher Comedy, slashing Action movie whip-pans onto gloriously gory visual sight-gags chopping at the murders taking place.<br/><br/>Reuniting together, the screenplay by Wright and Pegg inventively continues to expand on the themes of Shaun, with the strongly individual Angel uncomfortable over becoming a buddy to those in his newly joined force, having to face off against a zombie-like cult, who follow the group mantra that their murders are for ""The Greater Good.""<br/><br/>Becoming buddies as they patrol the streets, the writers make the buddy cop friendship between Danny and Angel one which pays loving tribute to Action movies with a warm comedic steak, via Danny's fandom of cop films hilariously spilling over to him treating doing tasks with Angle such as searching for a missing goose as if it is a precursor to a Action set-piece. Hanging out on the big screen for a second time, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg give terrific turns as Danny and Angel, thanks to the dead-pan side Pegg gives Angel being matched by the eager enthusiasm Frost powers Danny's excitement over the hot fuzz becoming bad boys."

"fedor8","Null","0","1","11 December 2014"," The ""plot virus"" strikes again – in yet another comedy with great potential.
","HF could have been one of the Top Ten comedies of all time, if only it had continued the style and pace of the first 40 minutes or so. Unfortunately, its writers fell into a standard trap that has ruined or at least lessened countless comedies. I refer, of course, to comedies with potential, not garbage that didn't have potential to begin with: all those Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer duds.<br/><br/>Movies such as HF remind me why I'm a proponent of the ZAZ, Monty Python, Jerry Seinfeld and Sascha Baron Cohen schools of comedy, i.e. types of writing in which gags are always the priority with no room for sentimentality or preaching (neither of which are a major problem in HZ, BTW), and where the plot is only secondary, or preferably even in 100th place. People watch comedies to have a laugh; only morons watch them for the action scenes or to follow a story closely.<br/><br/>HF starts off wonderfully, with its impeccable first half-hour brimming with laughs and perfect comedic timing. Meanwhile, a grain of doubt started creeping up: ""this can't go on for the duration; I bet the movie dissolves in a needless crime plot and then finishes off with standard, mindless, unfunny action scenes"". Unfortunately, I was mostly right. Just as I'd feared, in this so-called ""crime comedy"" the plot eventually wins over the gags. During the first half-hour, HF is 99% comedy, but by the half-way mark, it's 90% crime/action, 10% (good) gags. In other words, the crime takes over the laughs and we're left with just another episode of ""Midsummer Murders"" instead of a constantly funny movie that's supposed to provide a continual barrage of gags. <br/><br/>Most Hollywood comedies have a very weak last quarter, or even half, simply because the formulaic/commercial school of comedy demands that the plot has a beginning, a development, and a conclusion - meaning that there is no place for humour (or very little space for it) once the plot comes near or exactly at its point of conclusion. Indeed, the second half of the movie is a mystery flick, which then predictably switches gears to even more pointless action scenes, which are predictably not funny.<br/><br/>Show me an extended action segment that's funny – in any comedy ever made - and I will show you Sean Penn writing an essay without 280 spelling mistakes and over 100 grammatical errors. The shoot-out in the shopping center wasn't funny; it was merely formulaic kiddie stuff. Slightly original, I'll give them that, but ultimately pathetic compared to what the movie promised in its first half-hour, with its clever dialogue and fun parody. The outdoor chases and shootouts are no better; this was a cop-out: it is far easier to the predictable - unfunny – easy-to-write thing than to actually roll up your sleeves and make a true effort to conclude the film with a bunch of laughs rather than fairly corny sight-gags.<br/><br/>A far better idea would have been to outright spoof the entire cop genre – sort of in the ""Naked Gun"" vein – i.e. WITHOUT succumbing to the ""plot trap"" that so many comedy writers fall into. Simon Pegg is a very good comedian and even better writer, but he will become a movie great only if he learns that comedies need to consist of 100% pure, unadulterated, undistilled, unschmaltzified humour and that a comedy needs to be a non-interrupted barrage of gags devoid of ""serious"" moments not to mention sentimentality, even if only very brief. Only this kind of approach works, usually. HF does have a brief moment or two when it gets slightly soppy or whatever. Sorry, Pegg, but you can't set us up with cartoon characters and then expect us to take them seriously in a dramatic way, as well. You just can't have your cake and eat it too.<br/><br/>Besides, nearly every (commercial) comedy overstays its welcome after 90 minutes. 2 hours is simply too long. They could have made a tight 90-minute collection of great sight gags and one-liners, but instead they had to ""pepper"" it up i.e. dilute it with unnecessary plot crap. I laughed my ass off during the first quarter, but after that I watched the movie with a mostly straight face – and my face is the ultimate judge of how good a comedy is; I trust it implicitly.<br/><br/>You know how you deal with the ""comedy-movie plot trap""? You're writing a comedy and want to focus on the gags rather than have to worry how you'll wrap up the movie? Well, you do what the Pythons did in ""Holy Grail"" and ""Life of Brian"": you suddenly end the movie with a totally absurd scene. THAT'S the way to go; you get to keep the laughs at a steady pace right up until the end, while still providing a good ending. Unfortunately, not many comedians understand this, or think far too conventionally (when it comes to structure, at least) to be able to make such adventurous leaps of imagination in their writing.<br/><br/>HF excels in its casting. These days it is rare to come across a comedy that has such a strong cast, and so many familiar and competent faces rather than a bunch of half-wit, in-bred nepotists."

","However, that's not to say that Hot Fuzz is non-stop comic action. The first half an hour or so seems a little slow, but there's no reason to worry; the cast are simply setting up jokes to be knocked down later on, and it is definitely worth the brief wait for the well-paced comic-action masterpiece that's lying just around the corner. As with Shaun of the Dead, the people behind Hot Fuzz are affectionately poking fun at a genre that they clearly love, creating a film that embraces its genre's inherent ridiculousness, and is all the better for it. THE THING I LOVE THE MOST IS NICK FROST AND SIMON PEGG. They are my favourite since Shaun of the dead. Watch it and laugh."

Then, you get a killer's story, much beer, beautiful village views, some very daft jokes, much bad language, many very silly allusions to Pointbreak as well as some more US detective movies. Is this a poor film? Nay, it is OK, but still, bland and overtly banal at places, often naive and often bland.

The plot is ridiculously strange and yet so fun-filled: it has action, mystery, comedy, slapstick & most of all, brilliant performers and characters. Since the beginning, the serious character of Simon Pegg continues to charm and induce humor with his dialogs and conversations.

There's a lot of heavy resonant thwangs and shooops and zwings for simple things like a coat being put on or taken off a hook or a locker door opened. I know it's ""silly"" comedy, but these cartoon effects drew attention to themselves and broke the spell that I willingly put myself under when I suspend disbelief for the duration of a movie. Also there were jarring snatches of music or sound effects that didn't seem to fit the action or mood. Just simple editing stuff that should support the (excellent) performances instead of undermining them.<br/><br/>The second thing that forced itself into my consciousness was the very busy script, which I felt was over-written. The basic story-line was fine, and there were plenty of clever touches I appreciated, but I felt like the basic structure was overloaded with every gag, both verbal and visual, that the makers could think of. I guess they were trying to give me a lot of comedy for the money, but sometimes, as the saying goes, less is more.<br/><br/>No complaints about the acting or casting or cinematography, all of which were exemplary.

Hot Fuzz is full of hilarious jokes and impeccably timed gags .

","PC Nicolas Angel is the Met's most successful police officer so it isn't surprising that he gets a promotion; however he would rather that it didn't mean a transfer as well. His superiors and colleagues, worried that he is making them look bad, have him transferred to the Gloucestershire market town of Sandford; the town with the lowest reported crime rate in England. When he gets there he quickly learns that something isn't quite right; the pub is full of under-aged drinkers and the man he arrests for drunk driving turns out to be his new partner PC Danny Butterman. Most of his fellow officers resent having somebody sent in from London as they think he will just try to show them how to do their jobs and Danny just wants to know what sort of action Nick has seen. He hasn't been there long when two people are found decapitated on the road into town; everybody seems to think it is a tragic accident but Sgt. Angel isn't so sure; as further 'accidents' occur he becomes convinced that there is a murderer on the loose... is he just paranoid or is there something rotten in this sleepy market town?<br/><br/>Having enjoyed 'Shaun of the Dead' I was keen to see what Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright would come up with next... while I don't think this is quite as good it still has plenty of laughs; including some genuine laugh out loud moments; who couldn't laugh at the sight of a shotgun wielding granny being kicked in the face?! The story nicely combines the typical English country mystery anybody who watches 'Midsomer Murders' will be used to with the action of an American action cop movie; spoofing both genres as it does so. The action is deliberately over the top as it references a variety of well known films; if you don't get all the references it doesn't matter as most of the scenes are funny anyway. The cast does a fine job and is packed with well known British actors including Edward Woodward and Timothy Dalton; the latter is particularly entertaining as the slimy supermarket manager Angel initially suspects of being the killer. While this is a comedy first and foremost there are a few wince inducing moments when we see a few fairly horrific injuries; this and the frequent swearing make it unsuitable for younger viewers but older viewers who want a good laugh should enjoy it."

","Director / co-writer Edgar Wright, star / co-writer Simon Pegg, and co-star Nick Frost turn their attention to a new series of genres with this similarly engaging send-up: mostly, the buddy-cop movie, although it also functions as a murder mystery and even has a feel of the slasher movie at times. Pegg is wonderful as Nicholas Angel, a young man fiercely dedicated to law and order, even when it has cost him the love of a woman. His bosses tire of him, realizing he's so damn good he makes everyone else look bad, so they pack him off to a small country village named Sandford. Angel's keen eye for suspicious detail leads him to believe that there's a mad plot underneath the tranquil surface of this supposedly peaceable community. He makes friends with local officer Danny Butterman (Frost), who becomes his partner through thick and thin as the bodies pile up and the blood splatters everywhere. Wright gives the movie a great over the top feeling, what with the various gruesome and outrageous methods devised to knock off characters. Now, the movie does go on just a bit long, and ""ends"" more than once. This prevents it from being as much fun as it could and should have been, but it's impossible to dislike a movie that pays such earnest homage to the classic corpse littered action escapism of the 1980's and 1990's, with references to ""Supercop"", ""Silent Rage"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Die Hard"", etc., and points out the joys of jumping sideways while firing a gun with each hand. The references to ""Point Break"" are particularly delicious. And that's not to mention the absolute necessity of coming up with a witticism when messily dispatching a bad guy. There's another absolute joy to the proceedings, in seeing scores of people who aren't exactly young handling all manner of weapons. Also, if you've ever thrilled to scenes of ""preparing for battle"" seen in favourites like ""Commando"", you get treated to that sort of thing here. Pegg is both hilarious & endearing in the lead, with very nice support by the likable Frost. It's delightful to see a whole bunch of distinguished British acting veterans actually having a real ball with the material, including Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Billie Whitelaw, Paul Freeman, Stuart Wilson, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Edward Woodward, and Kenneth Cranham (with Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan, Peter Jackson, and director Wright making uncredited cameos). Dalton in particular is a total hoot. The characters are never less than entertaining, and the movie does have a definite wild energy and a lot of flashy cutting. The soundtrack is cool and there are a respectable amount of laughs to be had in watching this clever comedy, which does have some fine character moments amid all of the murderous mayhem.

"dwpollar","7","0","1","1 November 2011"," Funny tongue-in-cheek spoof of American action movies...
","1st watched 10/30/2011 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Edgar Wright): Funny tongue-in-cheek spoof of American action movies with Simon Pegg playing a cop that's too good for the big city of London – so he's promoted(aka. Demoted) to be a sheriff of a small village because he's making everyone look bad. The same team that made ""Shaun of the Dead"" was involved in this British farce that sometimes goes a little overboard late in the movie, but for the most part is laugh-out-loud funny. They kind of do an-overdone last half hour action scene but add gags in the middle of everything to help you realize that even the drawn-out action is part of the farce. The perfect police officer finds people to arrest in the new village the night of his arrival, even before he's officially on the job. A few deaths then start to occur and he starts suspecting something fishy is going on. Of course, the locals, say the deaths are just accidents because the village is going for ""village of the year"" and couldn't have the ""m"" word(murder) happen in their little bungalow. His partner, played by Nick Frost, is about the only one who believes him and plays a great sidekick to the straight-laced Pegg. The rest of the cast does their part, but the writing and Pegg's straight-lace portrayal is what makes the movie work. The movie really isn't about one-liners but instead just the idea that the ones making the movie are laughing in their heads and keep straight faces so we can do the laughing. This is definitely not a perfect movie but as a comedy it is one of the better ones I've seen lately."

"david-2829","7","0","1","10 March 2011"," Cop Buddy Movie genre mashup with humor, drama and action!
","A hilarious blend of comedy, action and drama taking aim and squarely blasting the cop buddy movie genre. Too serious to be a ""spoof"", but filled with humor both obvious and subtle, this is the type of movie that begs repeat viewings. It's a cross-genre mashup that might be hard to define, but sure is fun to watch.<br/><br/>In ""Hot Fuzz"" we get the traditional mismatched cop buddies, but it's taken to the extreme, and actually works very well. Even the dichotomy of a rural setting for a crazy murder mystery plot adds to the surreal as well as the humor.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the film is that I'm not a fan of overt gore. True it is done in a comedic manner for effect (ow, ow , ow), but it caught me off guard and is unnecessary. Severed heads, impalement's, blood-spurting wounds... the explicitness should be left to horror films.<br/><br/>Another minor gripe was that some of the action stuff was cut way too fast and makes you dizzy. I appreciate the idea of adding multiple cuts to add energy, but this was over-the-top. Perhaps the decision was purposeful, lampooning even the style of action movies... but for me it was a little distracting.<br/><br/>""Hot Fuzz"" is at it's best with the many laugh out loud moments: the runaway goose, translating the local dialect, the human statue ""threat"", the bodyguard who just says ""Naarp!"", and wordplay twists throughout. These smart bits of humor make the film a keeper... just be prepared for high action and some gore with your laughs."
"mario_c","7","0","1","25 December 2009"," ""This is something I've to do myself!""
","HOT FUZZ is a nice cop movie that we can easily insert in the action/comedy genre. It has very intelligent humor with nice and sharpened jokes, but also silly scenes with brainless funny moments.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg does the main role and one more time he does a good job; a bit different from what I was used to see from him, but good. The rest of the acting is also fine.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure if it was a tribute or a spoof but that clear reference to BAD BOYS II near the end was kind of strange and explicit I must say! However, I guess we can split this film into two parts: one before that reference, and another after that. In the first half, it's a bit slow paced and centers in the investigation on the murders NICHOLAS ANGEL (Simon Pegg) did. The second half (about the last 30 minutes) begins when NICHOLAS says ""This is something I've to do myself"" after see the BAD BOYS II DVD cover on a gas stationThis part is all about the action in a very fast pace! Nice action scenes were done here I must say.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this movie, especially for the action and the jokes."
"AirPlant","7","0","1","30 October 2009"," Simon Peggs for James Bond.....
","There are no laugh-out loud, pee yourself moments in Hot Fuzz. -Well, maybe one comes close;, that's not what HF is about. This is a Simon Pegg film so, in a sense, in doesn't matter what its about -what you get, is that Nice Simon Pegg doing what he does so well -Being Nice. Simon Pegg represents the kind of person wed all like to know (or to be) no one does Nice like him -Cast him in any part and our sympathies are with his character. If he'd been in The Shining wed have handed him the fire axe, patted him on the head, and shoo him upstairs to polish of that nasty wife and little kid. Simon Pegg as Darth Vader; wed sympathise with that nasty sore throat. Nice is what he does, and to wheel out a cliché -nobody does it better. HF is in many ways a very reactionary piece of work: harking back to the golden era of Dads Army and Lively Lads or further back to the Ealing comedies. The jokes are mostly telegraphed a reel or two ahead so you can get back from making the tea in time for a chortle, and there's none of that smutty new-wave comedy to disturbed the middle-England tranquillity of the (apparently) sleepy village of Sandford. I smiled a lot in this movie -the homo-erotic undertone of the relationship between hopelessly uptight Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg) and big hearted PC Danny Butterman is beautifully played. There's also a bewildering array of British comedy luminaries to gawk at. As to the plot, well its a load of nonsense about dark goings-on in rural paradise. But then, you're not watching this for the plot, or for that matter the laughs. Its Pegg's film, literally as well as figuratively -you're watching to be reassured that somewhere out there, there really are nice, decent people doing nice, decent things, and, in this area HF delivers in spades. Watch it, enjoy it & don't feel guilty about it. Now that's got me thinking..how about Simon Peggs as the next James Bond -don't laugh -think about it for a minute."
"policy134","8","0","1","16 January 2009"," My two cents
","There seems to be 50/50 split between those who like this and those who think it is absolute trash. For my part, I enjoyed it but you definitely have to be a fan of straight action movies to really get the whole feel of what the director, Edgar Wright and the writer/star, Simon Pegg were trying to do here.<br/><br/>This is not a direct parody of action/thriller/buddy movies. It really stands on its own but all the clichés of these movies are put in here, some meant as parody and some for purpose. It's a dangerous combination but Wright/Pegg pulls it off. The actors who play it absolutely straight and especially Nick Frost must be credited by giving the rather ridiculous plot some resonance. Nick Frost as Danny Butterman is absolutely brilliant because the character is kind of sad but at the same time you never feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>The movie is a bit too long and it ends with a cheat that is a bit hard to swallow. Still, the other way around may have been too depressing for what is essentially a comedy (think Lethal Weapon 2). What can you do? So, over the top? Definitely. But engaging and you really have to admire the care that was put into it."

","This is a funny movie. I don't like it nearly as much as I Loved Loved Loved Shaun of the Dead (awesome movie see it if you haven't already!) but it was still worth seeing and very funny in places. The ending seems to drag on a bit but the funny parts are funny enough to make it worth the cost of seeing the movie, most people like it and the word of mouth is there for a reason. I got the DVD of this movie as a gift and watched it again and the only other knock I'd have against it is that it didn't seem nearly as funny the second time where Shaun of the Dead I can still watch and laugh at. The main characters were great but the supporting actors and actresses sometimes weren't as good. The plot is pretty ridiculous as it goes on but hey at least it's not predictable!"

","Hilarious, of course, as was the follow-up, ""Shaun of the Dead."" But then there's the acting, the action, the characters, the little town of Sandford, and the question to who the real murderer is. (The answer will blow your mind). For those oversensitive, there is not as much profanity in this as Shaun of the Dead, but be warned of the pretty graphic murder sequences, with quick action-editing. Simon Pegg portrays Seargent Nicholas Angel with expertise, and Nick Frost is just hilarious. This is the greatest movie ever. Edgar Wright is a genius. This is of course, the 2nd installment to the ""Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy,"" a series of films written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The first installment is Shaun of the Dead, and the second is Hot Fuzz.

","I really had high expectations for this film.I mainly wanted to see it because I enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead"" so much and this film had many of the same blokes in front and behind the cameras.Sadly it wasn't nearly as good as ""Shaun"".<br/><br/>A hot shot London cop is transferred to a sleepy country-side village after his gung-ho attitude starts making his superiors look bad.His partner is the police chiefs dim-witted son.But the pair soon discover there is a sinister reason why the quiet little village has very little crime.<br/><br/>The first 2/3 of the film was pretty good as the pair attempts to figure out the reasons behind a series of apparent accidents that leave some of the townspeople dead.The last 1/3 of the film completely ruins the first 2/3 as it breaks down into a drawn out shoot out that parodies many cop films from the last few years.The shoot out is dumb without being funny and the parodies are so self-conscience that they lose all impact.<br/><br/>Now there were a few very well done gory scenes and a few laugh out loud funny bits but there just wasn't enough of either of them for the 90 minutes that this movie lasted.For some reason this film was rated R but there was no nudity ,very little profanity and just the couple of gory scenes.This is worth a rental but not one I'll add to my collection.<br/><br/>See ""Shaun of the Dead"" to see this gang's best work."

There are a few dull parts that could be cut out where the story goes a bit dead. But on the up side Simon and Co work well together and bounce off each other. The film does not look cheap, the scenes, wardrobe all look authentic. There are even a handful of laugh out loud moments too, but I shant spoil them for you.<br/><br/>A movie I'd rent for a Sunday afternoon, but doesn't warrant a cinema ticket.

Now whit the little help of QT & RR and also Guillermo Del Toro, this film have more attention than Shaun....<br/><br/>I saw this film this afternoon whit an empty cinema, just my cousin,and 3 or 4 people more so i think Hot Fuzz is going to be out of cinemas this very same week and is going to be a cult film. It's a shame because this film is more than excellent but well at least i can watch it on the cinema.<br/><br/>Now about the film: Is about Nicholas Angel, who is the best cop in London so he is transfered to the ""best town in England"",Sandford. He is going to see how different is the town of London and later start to investigate a series of murderers that for the people of Sandford are just ""accidents"".<br/><br/>Amazing humor, just like in Shaun of dead,also whit Nick Frost one again as Simon Pegg's friend. And is like the same type of town and like the same bar (winchester and the pub). Whit a lot of movies references (oh i love the film collection of Danny , is just amazing) so thats why a lot of people think that this a parody of action films but Edgar Wright said that this was more like a tribute.<br/><br/>As a conclusion: this film is just excellent,for me is one of my favorites of 2007. Contains a lot of fun dialogs and fun scenes whit the same style of Shaun of the dead and also the edition and the cast is great.

","Hot Fuzz explores the sides of dark comedies like no other film. It is a combination of wit, action, horror, violence and blood. It is a simple movie, but executed in a way that no other has been done. It captures the essence of the English country side and the performances by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are excellent, as usual.<br/><br/>Many compare this to Shaun of the Dead and say that this is even a better film, but I disagree. I think both are excellent films and cannot be compared because they are different genres. Shaun combines comedy with horror, but horror is its main genre. Fuzz combines comedy with action and violence, but action is its main genre. Anyways, both films are awesome.<br/><br/>The action scenes in Hof Fuzz are very enjoyable to watch. The script is smart and witty. The little tones of horror are great and unexpected! Let's hope that these trio continues to make awesome films such as the Shaun ""odyssey"" and Hot Fuzz."

","I wont try to calm myself down, and NOT over-hype this one. I simply cannot say anything bad about this. It's a pity, some people can. Don't believe them. The entertaining quality of this one depends only on YOU!<br/><br/>First of all do you know these two guys? Nick Frost and Simon Pegg? They've done a series called ""Spaced"", and a movie called ""Shaun of the dead"". Much more too, of course, but these are the major titles. If you haven't seen any of them, you probably don't know much about their style of comedy, which features satire, irony, and over the top PARODY elements. I really don't know how these guys doing it, but they're a bit like the comedy-duo version of Tarantino himself! I mean the way every single shot made in their films, has so much observation, sense, talent, and cynicism. Even when a character is drinking beer looks like a parody of a film, where someone drinks beer. Every moment has a breathtakingly professional touch, and wit, you probably wont find elsewhere.<br/><br/>Every single frame in Hot Fuzz is a parody. Every one of them. But don't except parody in the way you got used to it. It's nothing like scary movie (no crap/puke jokes. you may call the filmmakers prude, but after you've done that, PLEASE GROW UP!), or the similar turd, you can see, and it even differs from Melk Brooks, and OLD Zucker bros. comedies. The main reason is that every single joke is a coherent part of the well written plot! You'll be afraid to even blink, for one moment is for a hilarious joke, and the following one starts building up a new one. And thats it. Not a single second goes to waste. And like I said, all most them is quite important for this precisely put together parody-film. Even the story might remind you of some of the most classic action-movies.<br/><br/>Nicolas Angel (Simon Pegg) is the most effective policeman in London. Whatever he does, turns out to be immediate success. He's fast, strong, intelligent, strong-willed, obedient. With all these strong points, he brings shame to all other local police officers, so his superiors send him to Sandford. A little village far being the back of god. A place, where ""Nothing's going on"". The deepest, darkest hell for Nicolas... Fortunately strange accidents are following each other, but officer Angel cannot deal with this mystery on his own. He needs the trust and help of the local law enforcement (whose only duties were eating pudding, and drink stout until this time) to bring down the most crooked conspiracy that can happen in a peaceful village like Sandford!<br/><br/>This story sounds stupid, and it's even more stupid, to see on film:) The other main character is Officer Butterman (Nick Frost), the son of the local chief inspector, and later on, Angels best friend ever. The best thing about the Pegg-Frost duo, is that they incredibly likable. I don't know how good as actors they are, for it was enough to play themselves in every project the made: childhood friends (in hot fuzz, they're childlike:) ), Pegg is the stubborn, yet miserable one, and Frost is the fat, good-for nothing one, teaching Pedd some valuable lessons about the brighter side of life. Alright, this sounds really gay, but it is not:) They are as good to laugh at, as to feel with.<br/><br/>That leads to the only aspect of the film, i think people MAY find unappealing: dryness. Even the most emotional scenes are made with full self-awareness, and a large dose of irony. You'll even laugh harder at this ones.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the funniest, wittiest, most intense, and intelligent comedy nowadays. If you're into action, comedy and parody, and seen at least five dozen movies in those genres, you'll find this movie very good, If not, you might have to see more films."

","I must say that this movie is not what it may look like from the cover: a serious cop gets stuck with fat Mr.Bean kind of a partner and they must learn to work together while catching bad guys. True, there is a serious cop (Sergeant Angel) and plenty of dumb/lazy/slow or simply crooked cops from a small town he gets transferred to, but it's not just a comedy movie- there's some mystery, action and the way the dark angles are shot, characters developed and sub-plot stories introduced, it all really adds a very interesting addition to what at first seemed as a silly comedy movie. There are some things that are perhaps a bit forced and far-fetched (especially when we learn who is behind the murders and all the shooting begins), but I guess this is where it is apparent that besides the mystery/action components, Hot Fuzz is first and foremost a comedy and then a bit of everything else mixed up in a fuzzy ball of Brit humor.

While some of the film does fall under that description (though it's very, very funny!), the movie is just as much a spoof on the ""shady small town with a secret"" horror subgenre, which I absolutely love. I had a great time with this one. It's hilarious and clever and gross. It isn't quite as quotable or funny as ""Shaun,"" but then again, what the hell is?

Well it's a damn good thing my friend persuaded me to finally rent it a week or two ago, as this is honestly one of my favorite movies of '07 now.<br/><br/>This is not at all a simple generic comedy film that will fade out of the public periscope of vision. No, this is a comedy of the highest level, boasting a good sense of balance between the funny, goofy parts and the more action-packed ones near the end (which of course are just littered with jokes and gags). I think the best thing about this is that it doesn't try too hard to be funny; it just IS. There are so many hilarious lines and situations here that it's impossible to mention them all. Just know that you're definitely getting your money's worth and more when you get Hot Fuzz, as this is a timeless, ageless, monstrous epic of a comedy that people will come back to time and time again.<br/><br/>The acting is generally top notch, as is the directing. Everything seems to flow so well here, there's not an awkward moment to be found. Hot Fuzz moves at a blisteringly fast pace, and challenges you to keep up, softening it's rock-hard blows with laughter and comedy that seems to come in powerful surges. Most of the comedy here is gold, and shouldn't be missed by fans of any genre. Yes, any genre, that's right. I can't see too many people disliking this on the basis of pure entertainment value, since it packs bucketfuls of comedy, some high-octane, thrilling gunfights and action, and even gore for those odd little splatter-hounds amongst the audience.<br/><br/>Bottom line: There aren't many words I can say about this masterpiece. It's funny, it's action packed, there are a few scenes that will touch your heart, and the plot is extremely involving and enjoyable. This is the type of thing you watch on a rainy day when you're feeling blue, the type of thing you can come back to over and over again and still enjoy the hell out of.

I still have hope for him, might as well rent this just to see his progression and be ready for something new and even better.<br/><br/>5 of my stars goes to the directing style, and 1.5 goes to the effort, unfortunately there are no half stars so i have to round up. 7 stars from me on a moderately entertaining film, that is not worth buying except for the true Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg fans."

","Some might say that if you liked Shaun of the Dead, you'll like Hot Fuzz, since they have the same director, writer, and stars (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). But while Shaun was a more-or-less tongue-in-cheeky-cheek look at zombie movies, Fuzz is a little more straightforward, going for an action-comedy vibe rather than a horror-comedy vibe. This isn't to say Hot Fuzz fails to meet expectations, it's just that you sort of have to make sure your expectations are calibrated efficiently.<br/><br/>Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a straight-arrow London bobby who is extremely good at his job. Crime declines considerably when he's on the beat, much to the dismay of his superiors, who feel he's making the rest of them look bad. As a punishment for his good deeds, Angel is transferred to the hinterlands of England, specifically a small village called Sandford, where he proceeds to lock up half the town in his first night on such reckless crimes as underage drinking and urinating in public. Oops, turns out the criminal of the second crime is his new partner - cue wacky soundtrack - who's also the son (Frost) of the police chief (Jim Broadbent). Off to a bad start already, Angel is chagrined to learn that the police force in the sleepy town doesn't really care a lot about crimestopping, instead electing to eat, drink, loaf, that sort of thing. Then people start to die in mysterious and gruesome ways, and only Angel believes they're all connected. The deaths, not the people themselves, although that's also possible. He smells a conspiracy, is what I'm trying to say here. But no one believes him - cue wacky soundtrack again.<br/><br/>Now, this might have come off as a one-note, dumb action movie if it weren't for the grim determination of Pegg to essay a character of some depth. He's not simply a righteous cop out to save the world, he's a nice guy who has ultimate respect for the law and is devastated when others don't. Pegg's performance is perfectly sincere, and although he seems unassuming and even vague - witness his Shaun of the Dead - he is commanding, taciturn, and an utter delight as the seemingly humorless, single-minded cop. He's fantastic, and because his character is so emotionless, the other actors by contrast seem even funnier, particularly Frost as a doofus who'd love to be more than what he is, if only there weren't so much work involved. Broadbent, Stuart Wilson, Paddy Considine, and a wolfish Timothy Dalton round out a pitch-perfect cast.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz is splendid, a genial change from Shaun of the Dead, as it maintains all the soul and equilibrium of that minor classic without feeling stodgy, stilted, or dull. Pegg in particular - good thing, since he's the lead - manages to elevate the proceedings magnificently. Oh, and watch for Peter Jackson and Cate Blanchett in cameos (hint: it'll be tough to spot Blanchett)."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","9 August 2007"," More than meets the eyes
","Those who have seen ""Shaun of the dead"" (same director, same lead) would know what kind of a movie this is - a witty and sometimes outrageous spoof/parody: what Shaun does for zombie movies this does for supercop movies. But then, this movie has more than initially meets the eyes.<br/><br/>The story starts off, somewhat slowly, with a supercop in London who has become so good that the department finds him an embarrassment and sends him off, with a promotion, to a small out-of-the-way village. The interesting thing is that just as you think that it is settling down to a familiar genre, it throws you off balance by becoming something else. The new job throws our hero into a odd-couple-cops situation that you have seen far too often. For a while (which is actually half-an-hour), nothing much seems to happen as Sergeant Angel gets to know the village (but there's a meaning behind all this). Then we have a serial murder story unfolding. But before long, you find yourself watching something like ""The dark secret of harvest home"" (1978 TV mini series), with the chilling horror transported from suburban New England to suburban real England. The mood then changes again, to something like The Magnificent Seven, but with returning to the village only one individual, the male version of Ripley in Aliens (i.e. the second one). Then all hell breaks loose and it becomes Monty Python territory.<br/><br/>Therein lies the fun of this movie. It is funny, witty, satirical, but not without its moments of pathos. It can also get outrageously hilarious and gory - at the same time. When you see a sharp steeple break off, drop several stories right onto the head of a man below causing said head to kind of blow up with blood splashing like an erupting volcano, you ought to scream in horror. But you'll find yourself roaring in uncontrollable laughter of mirth at the sight of the broken off steeple resting on the now headless neck, taking the place of said head. Hot fuzz is that kind of a movie. If that is you cup of tea, you'll have a whale of a time.<br/><br/>Also most impressive is the astounding attention paid to the details. Everything that appears in the movie - objects (""deactivated"" land mine), animal (lost swan), dialogue (a million ways of firing a shot) -is rounded up nicely at the end of the movie."
"Gubby-Allen","7","0","1","8 August 2007"," 7/10 but surprised by the praise.
","7/10 for this one. Staggered though to find it in the top 150 of all time.<br/><br/>Not so much because I didn't rate it that high - more it just doesn't strike me as the sort of film so many others would, especially on a worldwide basis.<br/><br/>I cannot see the logic in putting the success down to British fans / humour though - given the average rating for U.S voters is 8.4 but non U.S is only 8.1.<br/><br/>Unlike others, I actually preferred the early segments of Hot Fuzz. I'd agree little happened of any note, just setting up the latter plot but it always remained an interesting scope on country life.<br/><br/>I found it as much a take on Midsomer Murders as American cop shows.<br/><br/>On the plusses, the supporting cast were all terrific, some very good characters and a great take on English country life and Frost played the role brilliantly and convincingly.<br/><br/>The other coppers were a mixed mag, the uniformed ones were all super, the female cop arguably the best character in the film, brilliantly scripted and played out.<br/><br/>But the two detectives for me, never even bordered on likable or amusing and their character change near the end was far too much of a bolt out of the blue.<br/><br/>Not so much negatives but minor criticisms - on reflection I didn't actually find many if any laugh out loud gags. It never stopped being pleasant, enjoyable or mildly humorous, but to hear some talking of side-splitting laughter, don't be fooled into thinking this is Airplane, Four Weddings or Monty Python & the Holy Grail. I actually preferred Shaun of the Dead by maybe one mark to this with the similar-ish gags funnier first time time round.<br/><br/>The shoot-out scene at the end seemed to get a little lost. For the main part it had a touch of the A-Team with shootings, violence from distances where you couldn't miss but nobody actually getting killed which didn't fit with the film as a whole where there was plenty of gory deaths.<br/><br/>But all in all, well worth a look. You won't find too many films better written or as unique & enjoyable as Hot Fuzz."
"scobbah","7","0","2","4 August 2007"," Simon Pegg and Nick Frost bring more British humour to our big-screens
","I first saw Simon Pegg in Shaun of The Dead (2004) and I have to admit that even though I enjoyed that movie, Simon's face did not become etched into my memory. I will definitely remember his face after seeing Hot Fuzz, however, and he is one superb actor, that is one thing for sure.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz brings British humour to the big screen, a kind of humour which I find really enjoyable. Simon Pegg plays a fine police officer who cleanses London from perpetrators in the most satisfactory way, which turns out to be too satisfactory as Simon becomes promoted and then transferred to a small city situated in the English countryside. Although this peculiar city seems to be peaceful and has numerous times won a sort of annual ""greatest village"" competition, the city seems to be stacked with a great number of original characters of who all of them seem to be law-benders to some extent. Simon Pegg's law-abiding character thus faces a great challenge as regards enforcing the law in this peculiar city.<br/><br/>This film is well-executed comedy mixed with mystery, and if I was not a fan of Simon Pegg in the past, I am certainly one now. Fans of Shaun of The Dead will most likely enjoy this one and perhaps some fans will be attracted to Hot Fuzz simply because Simon's friend and side-kick Nick Frost is featured in this film, too.<br/><br/>I think I must see Hot Fuzz a second time. At any rate, this film is well-worth a 7/10 from me."
"Yolas","10","0","2","2 August 2007"," The Best Movie I've seen in 2007
","I went to the cinema with expectations. However I didn't really think it'd be better than Shaun of the Dead because it was a masterpiece and masterpieces by the same director and/or actors only come once in a decade. I knew it was gonna be fun though.<br/><br/>From the first moment of the movie, the story grabbed my attention. This movie is not just a comedy movie with some action elements, but it is more like a true hybrid of comedy and action genres. You do laugh a lot, and at the same time you get excited by action scenes. unlike shaun of the dead which was a pure comedy which didn't scare me at all ( and it didn't intend to ) this movie is as about action as it is about comedy.<br/><br/>In conclusion, i hold the view that everyone must see this masterpiece. Cause you'll wanna see it again and again..."
"mvassa71","5","0","7","1 August 2007"," A Tale of Two Movies
","I feel like I just took a blow to the gut after finishing with this movie. What started off as a stylish, clever, fast paced, funny film with a promising premise, deteriorated into a preposterous and grotesque send-up of Hollywood cop-buddy movies. But if skewering the ridiculous was the filmmaker's intent, he only managed to skewer himself, and what ultimately was his own irritating movie. There were several smart one-liners and amusing gags, but not nearly enough to overcome the general sophomoric brand of comedy that prevails throughout. The film veers way off course in pursuing an absurd storyline, and it all goes to hell very fast. I could barely finish watching it, it was so stupid. ""Hott Fuzz"" was a major disappointment for me, especially since it garnered high marks from notable publications, and this esteemed site as well. Utter garbage."
"robwealer","Null","0","2","31 July 2007"," Farce
","Not sure what genre this was supposed to be , possible an English ""Airplane"" but it utterly failed trying to be something, whatever it was trying to do. Farces use the truth much better than this film and weave it more expertly into it's meaning (like Airplane) . Continuity is a difficult thing to attain in a farce and usually the story will suffer as a result due to the failure in maintain a complex lineage of subtleties, the mark of a great farce. Also, delivery went overboard regularly to pump up the often flat dialogue. The script was intended for a different delivery when written and it seemed to take on a life of its own once the cameras started rolling and live people were added, probably far different from the writer's intent. Compared to some brilliant farces from England (eg. Withnail and I) this film relied heavily on common, barely laughable ancient and well-worn stereotypes (dumb country folk, inbred cousins, hypocritical evil religious people) to shore up a lame story and a favorite refuge for stuck writers with a contractual obligation hanging over their heads."
"rickyrickrickson","8","0","1","13 July 2007"," Great Comedy
","You see the thing with most action movies is they are already funny inherently. I mean Rambo? That's a funny franchise.<br/><br/>No, Bad Boys one and two are not funny even though two supposedly funny men are the stars. And, yes Point Break is funny even though its two stars are far from funny, (though Ted Theodore Logan is pretty darn funny). But none of this has anything to do with how funny ""Hot Fuzz!!"" is except that the filmmakers love those types of action movies so much they are willing to spoof them in a completely over the top way.<br/><br/>From a ridiculous plot and collection of characters to even more ridiculous directorial techniques from hyper active editing of mundane things to overly wrought sound design the movie makers tapped directly into the hot vein of American action genre films. And it is hilarious.<br/><br/>Whether you love or hate the movies they are spoofing you'll love ""Hot Fuzz!!"" It's smart in all the right places and completely ludicrous in all the right places which makes for a jolly fun time at the cineplex.<br/><br/>There has been a glut of ""spoof"" movies from the ""Scary Movie"" cycle to the horrible ""Date Movie"". The difference here is this one rides its own merits of story, character and plot while reminiscing about those great to mediocre action movies of the past without simply twisting a scene directly form those movies.<br/><br/>Or simply: these guys are original. Like their last outing, ""Shaun of the Dead"", they made a movie here with just the right amounts of jokes and didn't rely too much on gags.<br/><br/>A definite must see."
"Fizzwizz","5","0","8","8 July 2007"," Disappointing, especially in comparison to Shaun of the Dead
","I waited a long time to get to see this film. I'm a huge Shaun of the Dead fan.<br/><br/>My first impression was that it had a better technical feel than SOTD and was very well made, however, I was struggling to laugh at much of it. There were some funny moments but despite trying hard to enjoy it I'm afraid I was left quite disappointed.<br/><br/>In SOTD there was great chemistry between the two leads, this seemed to be missing in HF. The main character Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) was an outstanding police officer and could do no wrong, a feature I just don't find funny. I preferred the loser makes good in a crisis theme of SOTD. Nick Frost's character (PC Danny Butterman) was much funnier.<br/><br/>I have re-watched this film again and found that halfway through I became bored and distracted. This does not happen with SOTD which I regularly replay.<br/><br/>I am a little surprised by the high score others have given it. Most people I know personally agree with me, that though it is a reasonable British comedy with some funny moments it is not in the same class as the classic Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>Worth watching, but not one for the collection."
"Lenoxus","Null","0","8","20 May 2007"," The viewer is advised to first familiarize self with action movie tropes
","Simply put, I walked out of the theater thinking this was totally wretched and appalling, and wondering why my opinion was at such a distance from that of so many critics and fellow viewers. Then I realized that I was really projecting my hatred onto cop films themselves, a genre I'm about as familiar with as Kanye West is with German opera. They're just not my  what's that British phrase?  cup of tea.<br/><br/>See, most of us  well, most Anglo-Americans anyway  have seen enough cop movies to be drawn in to their strange little world, absorb their themes and grammar, temporarily suppress any natural abhorrence for gun violence, and suspend one's disbelief regarding such absurd displays of gratuitous bloodshed as the standard shoot-out climax. So if you've seen enough cop movies  say, three times as many as I have  you, unlike me, will probably appreciate this send-up. But hey, when you think about it, aren't most of those films already self- parodies to begin with? (Note: I'm trying to submit this with no rating, but if I must, I'll rate it 5/10)."
"khyrlik","6","0","9","16 May 2007"," Well, It isn't (hot fuzz)
","It's OK movie but no way it deserves such high score and ran in best 250 movies.<br/><br/>First of all is not quite comedy. It has some funny moments, but also has many gore (!) moments with blood splashing, head decapitation. So overall it is a bit strange mix of police shootings ala Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon, but no way near funny or entertaining, there are also comedy horror, music clip ""loud music-super-quick cuts"". One moment you enjoy this, a minute later you wander if there were are more than one director in this movie, feel irritated and want to get out of theater. Quentin Tarantino have talent to make action, bloody and funny movie - but Hot Fuzz isn't like that. Cool idea went nowhere, so director threw here everything. It just doesn't work. 6/10"
"ArizWldcat","7","0","4","11 May 2007"," Funny; a but overrated and much, much too long
","I have to say that I enjoyed this movie; however, there were way too many explosions for my taste. I guess that's part of the point, since this is a spoof of many other ""buddy"" films. I have never seen Shaun of the Dead (nor will I), so I guess a lot of the humor is lost on me. However, I AM a major Anglophile, and many of my favorite Brits are in this movie, so it was enjoyable if just for that. I chose to go to this movie due to slim pickings at the local multiplex (there just isn't much out there that appeals to me; most of the romantic comedies out there are receiving poor, poor reviews)...and the 89% recommendation on rotten tomatoes.com...I have to say that I don't think this deserves THAT much high praise. I did have a lot of laughs, but also, this went just a tad too long, and had me glancing at my watch every few minutes during the middle of it. The ending, I thought, was a little too drawn out. minor spoiler.... After about 5 solid minutes of carnage, I'd had enough, but it went on and on and on after that. Timothy Dalton shines in this, as does Simon Pegg. Worth seeing, but didn't knock my socks off."

"j8me5","9","0","1","6 February 2007"," Fantastic Follow-up!
","Firstly let me say I entered an advanced preview screening of Hot Fuzz with more than a degree of trepidation having thoroughly enjoyed the previous work from these writers & the assorted ensemble cast. Having enjoyed Shaun of the Dead (and spaced etc) so much I has hoping not to be let down by this. Thankfully I was far from let down and have to admit to enjoying this even more than SOTD.<br/><br/>In my opinion this film has a little bit of everything whilst managing to never overdo any particular aspect. Whilst SOTD was described as a rom-zom-com this contains so many elements of thrillers, comedy, gore, and action. There are also a number of references to other feature films as is customary in any feature from this writing duo.<br/><br/>The film starts a little slowly but jokes still come relatively thick and fast and for once the film is not ruined by the having all the best material in the trailers! The cast appear to really enjoy making the film and who wouldn't as the movie is a veritable who's who of British comedy and acting pedigree. I cannot recommend this film highly enough to everyone I meet & shall intensify my promotions once it is on general release on the 14th. :)<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"Calorian","9","0","1","6 February 2007"," Awesome, Amazing and Unbelievable.
","When I first booked my gala preview tickets to Hot Fuzz, I was a little sceptical. I thought that it maybe much like Shaun of the Dead (All gore and comedy, no real story) but as the film went on, I realised how wrong I was.<br/><br/>N. Angel (Pegg) and D. Butterman (Frost) are policemen, officers in a small village in the English countryside. Angel (Pegg) is the ""Super Cop"" was an amazing arrest record and history and Butterman (Frost) is the not so clever but loyal and friendly tag along. Throughout the film they become closer until they are finally partners against the strange crimes that are occurring through the village.<br/><br/>Between Pegg and Frost the acting is great and with occasional extras such as Bailey, Broadbent, Eldon and Nighy. Also with the return of Dalton to the big screen, the film is defiantly set to be a hot when it is publicly released.<br/><br/>I really recommend this film to any fans of Shaun of the dead, and also to anyone else, no matter what you're into or who you are otherwise you'll be missing out big time!"
"Mat_Zombie","9","0","2","6 February 2007"," A real surprise
","Let me start by saying Shaun of the dead did nothing for me. I found it slightly amusing at the cinema, and have had no desire to watch it again since.<br/><br/>After watching the trailer for Hot Fuzz with Pegg jumping over the fences, i was expecting the same stupid level of humour. However, i was pleasantly surprised. While there is still lots of stupid humour, its written so well, and the gags come so thick and fast i found i had a grin for most of the film, accompanied by frequent laugh out loud moments. The advanced screening i watched was full and this seemed to be reflected with everyone else laughing just as loud as me.<br/><br/>Some genuinely hilarious jokes, as well as a quite good storyline for this kind of film, really pull the whole film together. Some brilliant supporting roles from the likes of Bill Bailey, Steve Coogan, Martin Freeman, Olivia Colman (Sophie from peepshow), that guy from Big Train and no less than Timothy Dalton cant be bad either."
