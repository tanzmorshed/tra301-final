","Saw II follows on the heels of Saw, as another taught, tense thriller. The mark of a great thriller/shocker/horror movie is the number of twists and turns, and this is what identifies Saw II as one of the better members of its genre.<br/><br/>This is NOT a movie where people walk backwards into dark rooms. This is NOT a movie where people pull sheets off bodies. That's all too predictable for Saw II. In fact, there's virtually nowhere in this film, where you can say that you've got it figured out.<br/><br/>Few movies keep me on the edge of my seat. This was one of them. There was no one dozing off during this flick. And the number of folks who walked out to take/make cell phone calls was the lowest I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Like Saw, this sequel is more than a little bloody in some places, but that's to be understood. It was never promoted as a walk in the park. If you're in the mood for a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is worth a try.<br/><br/>And this movie left more than a few folks in the audience waiting for another sequel."
"Ledout","7","16","20","15 June 2006"," Less original, but still worth a look.
","The original Saw was probably my most favorite recent ""horror"" movie, so naturally I was excited when the second one came out. I saw it its opening weekend in theaters, and **THIS WAS IN PREVIEWS, SO I Don't CONSIDER IT A SPOILER** I see a man strapped to a chair, with this ""Man in the Iron Mask""-like thing on with all sorts of pretty nails poking toward his face. If you've seen the first one, you can expect what it does. A TV turns on, and there's the puppet thing, and that creepy voice. I'm like ""Hell yes!"" and it seemed like a great beginning, and it truly does have a great idea going for it, but unfortunately it seems like they got lost in the success of the original and the new bigger budget and lost something. It became the traditional horror movie, with your typical predictable characters, and the innovation and claustrophobic feel of the original was gone. It wasn't scary, but then again I didn't think the first one was to be honest, I think they're more of a mental experience than anything. The weird acid-trip like camera shake still occurs, though thankfully less frequently, and it is like a bigger budget Saw. Think Land of the Dead. Still a Romero movie, but it didn't feel like one as much. Same thing applies here. The ending is cool for most people, but I honestly saw it coming. It gets a bit muddled, and by the end of it you really don't remember much except the very beginning and end. It's fun, and it's an interesting piece of this new Saw series, but it just doesn't seem to live up to the original for me. You watch it yourself and give it a chance. I give it a 6 1/2."
"pirateonweekends","4","96","158","5 November 2005"," horrible
","OK, if you've already seen the first one, you will be absolutely disappointed. it in no way lives up to the first one at all. first of all, saw was great because it was two kids on a low budget writing a script. they had to make up for the lack of money with the plot and script. secondly, the plot was really good and thick and everyone was connected in some odd way. the ending had so many twists, it was just brilliant. OK, now for saw 2. they had more money, so they definitely used it. instead of the people being in one room, it was one huge house. having more money took away from the effect, and most definitely the script, the plot and the acting. the plot had an unbelievable amount of holes in it. the people were connected by one stupid little line and the ending was absolutely ridiculous. one of the characters is just a complete idiot and decides to just get mad about everything. so, when he finds out there are numbers on the back of people's necks, instead of just kindly asking them to turn around, he kills them! finally, someone points out that he has a number on the back of his head that he's going to need, so he can't kill everyone. first of all, he tries seeing it with his little knife, then he decides to just cut it off, as any logical person would do. then, the murderer, john some how came up with a lot of money between dr gordon and now. before hand, his technique was simple. the tools he used to murder people could be found at a yardsale. in this one, somehow he got surgical equipment, the brains to do surgery and about five places with 20 computers. at some point in time, the writers seemed to have decided that it didn't matter that he had cancer, he can still do all this stuff. however, when you see him, he's in pretty bad shape. OK, now for the ending. remember the changed druggy, amanda? well, apparently, after she was almost killed, she decided the entire idea was a good one. so, she comes to john as an apprentice and decides to take his place as jigsaw. john becomes her yoda and teaches her the way of murder. at the end of saw 1, john had the memorable line of ""GAME OVER"". it was so great because of his voice, his appearance, everything. at the end of saw 2, amanda comes in, looking like she just went shopping and got her hair done and put on make up, and in a very little girl voice says ""game over"". absolutely horrible."
"Plumberduck","6","155","275","4 November 2005"," A few nice ideas dulled by a lot of stupidity
","I have the same main problem I had with Saw II that I had with the original (Shockingly enough, not the gaping plot holes). At the core, both movies are about the same thing: Elaborate puzzles that stupid people ignore so they can spend more time yelling at each other.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like Saw II, but I felt like I was being teased. I catch a whiff of interesting puzzle-solving, instead I have a lot of yelling.<br/><br/>It's a personal preference, I know. The movie I wanted to see was about people adapting to their situation and using their brains against that of an evil genius. Instead, I got the evil genius (Tobin Bell is great as Jigsaw, by the way, one of the parts of the film I really enjoyed) going to a lot of work for some people who, frankly, don't seem to appreciate it. The creators seemed to want to make a film about how people's lives are dictated by their unavoidable flaws (driven home by the ending, the last few twists, and the general character of the cop, all of which are the reason my rating is as high as it is), and how panic destroys people.<br/><br/>And the horror... isn't. I don't find blood scary. There are some *shocking* moments in this film, some cringe-inducing moments, but nothing actually scary. That really disappointed me, because Adam's capture in Saw I was one of the scarier scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time. There's nothing for people who actually want to be scared here, just grossed out."
"xfear26","9","93","160","23 October 2005"," Awesome, gory, bloody, what you could expect of Saw II!
","The tag line says it all: Oh yes, there will be blood!<br/><br/>I've had the chance/honor of seeing the sequel of a very anticipated movie this year at the world's premiere at the Montreal's Midnight Madness and I haven't been disappointed one bit. Off course, there was some magic that night, considering the fact that there were hundreds of horror fans expecting a gory sequel to the Saw installment and they got served! Without stating any spoilers, let me confirm that the movie is packed with bloody action and gore at its best. Those who liked the Jigsaw's strategy of allowing him the chance of survival to its victims by giving them a puzzle to solve, this time it goes even further. From the start until the end, you'll be given puzzling situation in which you wouldn't like to be part of at any time in your life. Near the end of the movie, the twisted game gets even more spicy...<br/><br/>I wasn't used to hear people applauding at the theater and it created some kind of psycho ambiance in the room that I kinda really enjoyed. The sadistic approach of the Jigsaw killer is still pretty impressive! Without telling you more, go watch it with some friends that will be able to tolerate blood in gallons and you'll be served! I give it a 9/10 for its originality, gory moments, interesting story and punch of action. It is rare to see a sequel that beats its predecessor but in this case, it does!"
"stealthskr17","10","294","539","28 October 2005"," One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
","The first Saw really through me through some spins and caught me off guard for originality, Saw 2 is leagues above the first. Saw 2 runs with the same game based theme as the first, with clues for both the characters and the audience about what might happen next, but it takes the game to a completely different level. Just when things start to come together there is another twist to leave the viewer on the edge of their seat for what may come next. Without seeming to give everything away the movie was made to give it all away, but no one can catch all the clues because they have been pulled so deep into the movie. I highly recommend this one."
"stupidmunk","8","204","369","28 October 2005"," Too Gory for Popcorn
","This movie has just mad a quantum leap in horror films. after watching this movie i had the chills walking to my car, and lets say that i more than enjoy a scary movie. this movie kept me up for at least and hour after watching it. it was one of those movies were you cant let it out of your mind. <br/><br/>The movie had one of the best openings that i have seen in a long time. after a few minutes into the movie i had to put down my popcorn. i don't have a weak stomach and this movie got me to put down my popcorn, that is huge. <br/><br/>With a great blend of suspense, acting, and oh yes there was a lot of blood. this movie great deserves another watch, i would pay to see this movie a couple of times. not to mention one of the best twists i have seen in a movie. i would say 2nd best ending i have seen in a movie.(#1 was Fight Club). you definitely have to see this movie."
"cmarston","5","41","67","5 November 2005"," Those Who Make Sequels Don't Deserve Life
","Let's start by saying what this movie did have, that will take a lot less time. Gore check. Creepy puppet and various devices used to permanently dismantle people's craniums check. Pasty cancer victim forcing the ""unworthy"" to develop some want to survive check. Alright, now that that's done I can move on to other, more pressing issues.<br/><br/>I know that everybody, myself included, simply adored the twist ending to the first Saw. Finally learning that the ""dead"" guy who'd been lying in a pool of his own blood for the entire movie wasn't really dead and was in fact an ingenious, if not twisted as hell, cancer victim striving to show people the value of their meaningless lives was a treasured moment in horror movie history. I can't say much about its staying power in the minds of the general public I will always remember watching that body rise from the floor of that bathroom.<br/><br/>Of course the producers couldn't just reenact the twist from the first one, they had to take it a step farther, keep people guessing. So how do you top a twist as well developed and well executed as the one in Saw? If you take a hint from Saw II I guess the answer is to make the ending so ridiculously contrived that nobody would ever dream of guessing it for fear of feeling stupid even in their own mind. Though I'm sure the girl who played Amanda was thrilled to get her second major acting gig reviving the heroine-addict she so briefly portrayed in the first Saw, I didn't appreciate her reappearance quite so much. It was completely pointless to bring her back; she was useless in the first movie and even more useless in this one. When you get right down to it they used her presence as out: this way they could kill off our friend the cancer victim and still keep the series going. At least we can sleep easy knowing ""Amanda"" won't soon be out of work.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the real sin in the writing here is that they simply took it too far. All they had to do was leave it with the SWAT team figuring out that the whole thing was staged and that the kid was really in a ""safe"" place. That would have been more than enough for me. Also, I could have done without Beverley Mitchell crying constantly, but they couldn't have cast the part better. A decade of complaining on 7th Heaven made her the perfect choice for the part.<br/><br/>The one redeemable quality of this film is the thing that made the first one: a truly original and inventive antagonist. This guy ranks up there with Hannibal and John Doe of Seven on my list of awesome villains. This is where the writers showed their true prowess. They managed to do what is rare these days: they created a powerfully psychopathic serial killer that had a defendable philosophy. ""Those who don't value life don't deserve life."" It sounds cruel, but there is some part in all of us that has to agree with the sentiment if not the deeds carried out in its name. It bothers me that he claims never to have killed anyone because it seems to me that putting people into a situation where they will almost certainly perish and offering them only a slim chance for survival is grounds for a murder charge. I know what he means, but that one statement is the only stupid thing that he says and he continues to say it despite the glaring error in it. That fact aside, this guy continues to impress me. He outsmarts everybody. The beauty in his strategy is that he tells everybody exactly what they need to know in order to walk out of their given situation entirely intact. He just banks on the fact that people never change and they, when put under immense stress, default to their baser instincts instead of taking a second to think the situation out rationally. The sad truth about humankind is that he will never be disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie, but I had pretty low expectations to begin with. I expected exactly what I got: a solid villain and an hour and a half of gratuitous violence and blood. If you're looking for a great piece of cinematography you're going to be sorely upset with what you see; you'll probably be a little motion-sick by the end too. Bring your sense of humor and check your upchuck reflex at the door, especially if you are sensitive about the use of scalpels on eyeballs."

","I anxiously waited for this film to be released---eagerly anticipating every frame, and I was not disappointed when I ""saw"" the first screening this afternoon. From the opening scene thru the end? I found myself being transported into the big screen, taken for one of the wildest rides I have ever experienced, and deposited back into my seat knowing I had not wasted my money (nor the afternoon, for the matter). I was kept guessing until the end, and I was not let down with a ""cliched and wrap it up"" ending...I left wanting more. (Having seen CUBE...I don't see the ""ripoff""...I see a very well thought out original script with a deeper story). The acting was very impressive and very believable. A special shout out to the team who came up with the set design and atmospheric lighting. I was moved and mentally manipulated by this film, and when I stepped out of the theater into the lobby and real life I had to take a minute to let my mind unwind before I went out the theater door."
"MovieAddict2016","8","14","20","9 April 2006"," The rare sequel that is intelligent AND in many ways better than its predecessor
","I saw the original ""Saw"" when it came out in UK theaters back in 2004. I thought it was very good - thrilling, different and clever. The acting was pretty bad (especially the ending with Elwes' laughable facial contortions), but it was the jolt that horror sorely needed. It wasn't another slice-'em-dice'-em slasher flick - it was smarter.<br/><br/>When I read that they were almost instantly putting ""Saw II"" into production based on the success of the original - and that pretty much no one from the original film was returning except for Tobin Bell (who plays Jigsaw) - I had very small hopes. I even said on the message board for the film at one point that it was going to ruin the impact of the original.<br/><br/>Well, I was wrong. In many ways, ""Saw II"" is better than the original. The acting talents are far stronger -- Donnie Wahlberg (Marky Mark's brother) is so much better than Elwes was in the first film. Due credit to Elwes -- he's a fine actor usually, but in ""Saw"" he was embarrassing towards the end. Wahlberg is perfect for the film.<br/><br/>Another nice twist in the plot is that it isn't totally repetitive as the trailers would lead you to believe. It does something I've never seen before - the killer is arrested within the first twenty minutes AND unmasked. Tobin Bell is on-screen throughout the entire film in plain view, having discussions with Wahlberg.<br/><br/>The movie implements a lot of new twists such as the whole concept of ""Rashomon""ing everything and going back and forth between different perspectives. The ending is brilliant because it's not just a throwaway shocker - it has a moral message that I never expected from this film.<br/><br/>The movie's interweaving plots and self-referential layers (such as a revisiting of the bathroom from the first movie) provide lots of fun and Jigsaw's game with the detective in the film is thought-provoking - this film is so much smarter and better than I ever expected and I was really blown away by the fact that we still have the capability of making good sequels to good movies that offer something fresh, rather than simply retreading material from the original."
"mattdenes","10","205","389","28 October 2005"," It Will Blow You Away
","Why is it that so many critics, movie-goers and film patrons see such bold and unique forms of film as nothing but bloody and un-needed garbage? Isn't it about time to enter the age of the modern horror film, and to realize that audiences these days have already seen it all when it comes to the horror movie, so one-of-a-kind ideas such as the SAW series should be seen as a much needed godsend to the film industry. They say that this is what is takes to scare people these days: untrue. Take the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre for instance, upon close examination, one can notice that it is essentially a bloodless film. So what is it about such movies that scare us? Well, it's the idea, the cinematography, and the boldness to plant such a terrifying seed into the world of movies. It isn't a man sawing his foot off or a man being set on fire that scares audiences, it's the fact that it has NEVER...EVER been done before on the big screen that engulfs the audience into a trance-like cloak of fear over a movie. The people who conjure these ideas for movies are not on the mindset to create something for the SOLE PURPOSE of making someone cringe and fray, they want to be their own level, nay, rank of movies for others to, essentially, build off of. Are SAW and SAW II the last of their kind? By no means, if anything they are merely predecessors of the film noir that is going to eventually rise into the R-rated spectrum. Forgive me for not stressing on the movie's actual content, but I feel it is the very ideas behind SAW that make us have to see it for ourselves. And I highly recommend those of you skeptical about it to do so. Will you be frightened? Yes. Will you see things never before shined onto the screen? Yes. And will you leave the darkness of the theater in a sense that you have witnessed movie history unfold before your eyes? YES."

","I just got back from the midnight screening of the film and I must say -- It was an OK movie.<br/><br/>Most of all the cool ""deaths"" were already shown in either clips or on television... but the main highlight of the movie was the conversation between Eric Mathews and Jigsaw himself. You find out a lot more about him then what you think. You find out what makes him tick. Of course, it's not as Gory as what people are telling you, it's just a marketing scam.. However, there IS much more blood then Saw 1.<br/><br/>The ending... Grabs you by the hair and kicks you square in the nuts!. <br/><br/>And you know when they said they'd revisit some ""old friends?"" oh yes.. they do :) Darren Bousman definitely has a film career on his hands and I hope he goes far with it because the man has talent.<br/><br/>I can clearly see SAW becoming the next ""Horror"" franchise."

","I loved this movie for many reasons. The acting was so much better then in the first one, and the plot twists are good as well. Kept me on the edge of my seat and the gore is at its best. When watching the movie, it is very fun to try to guess what is going to happen at the end. Make sure that you listen to the killer(John) very closely, as you know from the first, it is very important to do this. I can't stress enough how much better the acting and over-all story of this movie is, I don't want to give away to much, but be prepared for an awesome show. If you liked Saw, you will LOVE Saw 2, if you hated it or didn't see it, good chance you will still love it. It is worth the ticket to get in, and then some. In fact, I'll go see it again tomorrow."

","When I had seen the first movie I already had mixed feelings about it, part of me liked it mostly because of the ending and an other part of me thought it could have been better because of the lack of suspense. (Every ""game"" except the one with the two guys are being told which made it less interesting) Anyway, I still bought the DVD since the whole idea was quite interesting. So before I went to Saw II I had high hopes, also because IMDb rated it a 7.<br/><br/>Damn I was wrong, as the first movie lacked in suspense, this movie has totally no suspense. It's like watching a plant grow for 1,5 hours. It's just a waste of time.<br/><br/>You will not care who dies, who lives and why you are being forced to watch this movie. You just want to go home, sleep and pretend this never happened. The whole movie has to many twists, that make no sense. Characters that do stuff that makes no sense. O and the movie actually things the audience is retarded.<br/><br/>Because if you have played one of his games before you know exactly where the main clue is behind some brick wall. Sure, every one would know that. :/ <br/><br/>And the common link between all those people was pretty obvious but still the movie makers decided to tell it to the audience 50 minutes after everyone knew it already. Not to mention that it added totally no value to the movie because the guy finding it out had already decided to kill everyone.<br/><br/>The thing that is likable in this movie is the voice on the tape. I mean that's really cool. But they needed to rape that as well at the end by letting us know the girl will be the one taking over his work. Even letting her end the movie as the first one, but with one difference; in this movie it totally sucked.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 1 because it has an unfair rating of 7."
"ruomujiang","1","33","56","25 February 2006"," overrated on IMDb
","This is my first post on IMDb. The reason I am devoting my first post to such a crappy movie is the 7/10 rating here fooled me into renting this DVD and now I want my money and time back. The biggest issue of this film is its lackluster plot. It's just painfully dumb comparing to similar film like ""Cube"" , which was shot ~ 10 yrs ago (are films getting better today ?). In ""Cube"", you also got people waking up inside some closed cell and they need to solve some puzzle to find their way out. But in SAW II, there isn't really any puzzle to solve. For the most part of the movie, you just watch the characters running around and getting killed. There is no intelligence involved in this movie. BTW, the characters are poisoned, this greatly compromises their mobility and thus makes it a lot harder for them to move from A to B, which in turn lengthens the film a lot. Also the traps are pretty lame. Another issue is that the characters are so stereotypical (loud and rowdy). The moment they are first introduced, I know they will start killing each other before long. Overall the movie deserves 1/10 and I wish I could give it -10^10 just to counter balance all the positive ratings this film doesn't deserve. Seriously, if you think this movie is good, you should watch ""Cube"" and think about the improvement filmmakers have achieved over 10 yrs. Also you should watch ""Cabin Fever"" coz it's an equally crappy movie and crappy movies have a lot in common."
"analogeist83","3","14","21","22 February 2006"," Wretched, but not in a good way
","Shame, shame, shame. I actually enjoyed the first Saw quite a bit, and had hopes that this installment would meet or surpass its predecessor in quality. Poor guess on my part. I am a huge fan of horror movies...I have been watching them since I was a child. This was no horror movie. It was a poorly put-together ""psychological"" thriller with some violence in it. Part of what made the first movie good was the anonymous evil-doer. Having Jigsaw out and front all the time just didn't do it for me. The movie tries to justify his motivations, but his diatribes into the human condition fall short of convincing me. Fear of the unknown is one of the strongest types of fear there is, and having the killer spell out all his intentions is really kind of a let down. Also, the twist just left me snoring. And another thing (whine whine whine) was that I just could not suspend my disbelief. So there is this terminal cancer patient who can barely walk, yet is able to put many large sturdy devices together. Sure, he has help, but look at all the gear setup, and you'll see what I'm getting at. Also, Jigsaw must be psychic. His big ransom is the son of the detective. So he sets up all these traps in order to reach a desired outcome. What if people dropped dead from the nerve gas early? What if one of the criminals flipped out and killed the boy early? Sure, he might have profiled them, but I had some of these same issues with Mindhunters. The kicker is that I just don't care about any of the characters in this movie. They're all jerks, and it doesn't pain me to see them die. The end. Don't see this movie, it is a waste of time."
"Sperethiel","7","57","107","23 October 2005"," Entertaining despite its differences...
","Last night we were part of the lucky few(750 peoples) who got to see the world premiere to the public of Saw II. Without going too much into the details, for this kind of movie can be ruined quite easily by revealing to much, I can say that it was a good sequel albeit not as strong as the first one. I could compare quite easily having seen the first one the night before.<br/><br/>First of all the character development, one of the greatest strength in the first one, is quasi inexistent in the sequel. This of course could be explain by the fact that having 8 characters locked together instead of only 2 gives less room for each one of them. Even if I liked the concept of having a bunch of people trapped, there could have been a way to remove some character and give a little more room to the background of the more important ones. This actually lead to a feeling of watching a more americanized version of saw. You actually loses a part of the psychology that was also very strong in the first one. This loss i could say is partly due to the fact that you again haver very little to base yourself on the background of the characters.<br/><br/>Despite all of this it was entertaining. Most of the jigsaw's game of the sequel still have the same flavor as those in the original and the plot line in itself is still very good as you get to understand a little more behind the games of jigsaw. I recommend for all of you to watch it once its out in theater but don't go expecting the same feeling you had when watching Saw, you'll be disappointed."

","Saw 2 is a better than average movie with a promising storyline that just didn't turn out as good as it seemed.I did enjoy the dialog between Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bell,but the scenes with everyone stuck in the booty trapped room set up by Jigsaw was terrible,the dialog and acting was very mediocre and it mostly relied on gore.It is definitely more gory than the first Saw,a bit too gory for me,the way everyone is killed is just disgusting and graphic.The movie also wasn't as frightening as the first Saw and the story didn't have a build up as exciting as the original.I also didn't like how we didn't get to see much of the Jigsaw puppet and the direction isn't as dark (the director is different) as the first.Saw 2 is very gruesome,but its not very scary,if your a fan of the first you should still check it out,mainly because of Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bells impressive performances and a very unexpected twist,but you will be overall disappointed.<br/><br/>The Jigsaw Killer has kidnapped the son of cop Eric Matthews.Jigsaw gets Eric to talk to him while his son and many others try to survive."
"mister_samsa","8","3","3","9 March 2006"," great movie, don't listen to the detractors
","This was not the perfect movie, but it was also leagues better than most contemporary horror movies. I wanted to discuss the positives and negatives in my review but then also address common complaints from other reviews and forums.<br/><br/>The absolute best part of the movie (many of the detractors even give this credit) was a detailed look into Jigsaw's past and his twisted motivations. The traps were decent - I think too many people romanticized the traps of the first Saw when many of the new ones relied on the exact same cringe factor that made the first movie so effective. I feel that in order to appreciate Saw II, you really have to approach the subject in a similar matter to Jigsaw. Sure, the situations in the movie were not scary like ""Hellraiser"" scary. Instead, if you look at it more like a psychological experiment, the true dark genius of the movie comes out. What would happen if eight people awoke in a room, their lives in danger, and no certain way to save them? We see immediately all of these very distinct personalities working together or against each other. Despite best intentions, there's always going to be some violent ass like Xavier that ruins even the most well laid plans. Thus, even ""capable"" humans are brought down by the defects of those around them.<br/><br/>The drawbacks - there was no single scene that was comparable in terms of tension to the ""Adam camera"" scene from Saw. Also, at 93 minutes, I felt like some of the characters (Laura, Gus, Addison) never got a chance to be developed. It would have been great to have seen their traps explained or heard their back stories. However, this can be explained by reference to the plot. As a cohesive group, the hostages were a failure. Who knows how vividly the characters could have been described if they had opened Xavier's door or worked together better? But if they had been successful, more of them would have gotten the antidotes and there would have been less urgency all around. So it seems like some characters had to be sacrificed to keep the movie going.<br/><br/>I've noticed a lot of people expressing incredulity at some of the logic in the movie and it's been bothering me for two reasons. First of all, I know plenty of people who are willing to suspend disbelief for some stupid action flick, but not for a horror movie. This doesn't necessarily describe the exact people writing reviews - my point is only that horror should probably given more slack than other types of movies. Second of all, a lot of the ""illogical"" reactions are not all that crazy when you think about them.<br/><br/>For instance, why did Xavier cut the number off of his neck instead of asking politely? Lots of people found this unrealistic simply because they CLAIM that they wouldn't do that. Well, it made perfect sense for the character who had been established as a heartless egomaniac up until that point. Also, let's not forget that there's only 1 antidote in the safe. If you have ONLY 15 minutes to live and have reason to believe that others will screw you over if you cooperate, you'd do something drastic too.<br/><br/>Others claim that there's no way Amanda would go over to the ""dark side"" once having run through Jigsaw's gauntlet, herself. Again, this is not all that unbelievable. Psychologists have noted the phenomenon of Stockholm Syndrome, in which hostages come to identify with and even join their captors (Patty Hearst). Likewise, in abusive families, children who suffer psychological or physical abuse don't ALWAYS repeat this cycle, but they are much more likely to than the general population. I found Amanda the scariest part of the movie, not because Shawnee Smith can match the creepy gravitas of Tobin Bell (she can't), but the sheer notion of her transformation. Jigsaw, while not physically powerful has the ability to reproduce his twisted world view in formerly sane people, including the ones he's ""tested."" Shawnee is not capable of delivering the ""game over"" line like Tobin can, but the thought that the idea of Jigsaw won't die even when he's physically dead is truly one of the more disturbing aspects of the movie."

They are doomed to die, unless they can find out what they have in common, complete various tasks in the house and find the antidote.<br/><br/>Where the original film's gore could be forgiven on the account of its high logic, this lazy sequel is just gore for its own sake.

That of course meaning there is going to be a Saw III.

Even the unpredicted turns of the story, were predictable, because from the first minute YOU KNOW, that it HAS TO end reversal, and unexpectedly :). <br/><br/>If this is not enough for You, let me say that there are lots of logical mistakes in directing, and cinematography. For example - in the scene when one of the characters has to enter the big metal oven to obtain some idiotic syringes, the whole gang already know that they have to be careful when they touch everything. Even so, NO ONE from the group notices bizarre roll and rope attached to the oven door. When finally inside the oven, guy named Obi pulls a rope on which hangs a syringe - Surprisingly - the oven door close behind him(!). Jesus!

I'm writing this now after coming home from a staff screening, and i haven't been so excited after a film since .....probably ever.<br/><br/>The story is fantastic, and probably actually better than the first one. It also has more of those sick devices from Jigsaw. But , even better, it has more of those plot twists that keep you gripped till the end.<br/><br/>Remember the feeling when the supposed dead body stood up in the room, well, multiply that by 10 and thats how you feel at the end of SAW2<br/><br/>I can't recommend this highly enough for anybody, especially those who are a fan of the original, put all your fears aside of it being terrible.Take it from a huge SAW fan, you WONT be disappointed"

They are locked in and the same deadly nerve agent that was used in the Japanese subways is poisoning them. The doors are elaborate and cannot be used as an exit. But the windows are WEAKLY boarded up. They have plenty of tools to either go through the windows, or if those are barred, to punch through the wall.

They had 2 hours to punch through the wall and get to a hospital.<br/><br/>Do that and the movie ends.<br/><br/>And that is just an example of what all ""victims"" suffer in this series. They follow the rules given by this merely condescending and quite stupid villain. The victims NEVER think outside the box. They never search for traps. A trap might find them though. They know it's a trap, but they do the obvious thing anyway, knowing that it will kill them. How stupid do Bousman and Whannell think we are??? The victims NEVER think. For ONCE I would like someone to anticipate the tripwire and freaking STEP OVER IT!!!!!!!! AND STILL GET KILLED!!!! A good horror/suspense movie doesn't demand that they escape.

","I said it, ""Saw II is better than the first Saw."" The reason is simple. The first Saw had unexplainable logic flaws in the characters, while Saw II is nearly perfectly constructed and gives the audience just enough information for them to answer their own questions. For those of you that don't get it, try looking at the film as one long game that jigsaw plays with detective Matthews. that is the heart of the movie, everything else (people in the house getting killed off) that was all supporting material. The turning point in the movie is when Det. Matthews resorts to physical violence and threats and completely pummels jigsaw. That is the point at which he lost the game because he had broken his agreement to just sit and talk until the time ran out. The explanation at the end tied everything together very nicely. I was amazed that the film was written so well, and if the creators continue to be this clever, then I can not wait for the third movie.<br/><br/>how refreshing!!!"

","The starting scene was so terrific when Michael had the Venus fly trap around his neck and he had to cut his eye open to get the key out that was quite similar to the reverse bear trap on Amanda in the first Saw. The first one was more psychological but the second is rather relentless than scary and there is no sign of Dr. Gordon. Jigsaw was really annoying to Detective Eric Mathews and he could not hit him or anything because he is a cancer patient & he is using it as his defence weapon. Jigsaw also told that why is he doing all this it's because he wanted to teach people the value of life to those who do not appreciate them> He should really mind his own business> To be honest I was suspecting on Amanda because everyone in the house were coughing out blood except Amanda and Daniel. Daniel is the son of Eric & he is just a kid that's why I did not suspect on him. The real twist in the end was when the video was not live it was already recorded playing back so all that had already happened not while Jigsaw was in the police's custody. I think that the twist in the end is the main trademark of the Saw trilogy & that is the main thing I like about it. After watching all three of them the second is the best. Saw 2 is shot in 25 days in one building (except the outdoor scene) with a budget of $4 million & grossed about $144 million worldwide."

"sggst4","1","29","58","6 November 2005"," Ouch...no pun intended.
","The singular star should speak for itself...but to justify my vote would only be fair. First, the technical aspects of this ""film,"" which I liken to a bad NYPD Blue episode and a made for TV movie, are stunningly awful. Poor editing and poor cinematography make for an unintentionally distracted feel to the film, one that does not serve any purpose besides annoyance. Morever, the lighting simply didn't achieve the same effect it did in Saw, nor was it conducive to the tense atmosphere it hoped to engender. Secondly, the script and dialogue was painful to the point that I found myself cringing with each spoken word, rather than the acts of violence and display of gore. Now arises the question: With an improved script, would the acting improve? And the answer is: No. The acting was as awful, if not more so, than the script itself! It seemed to be truly made-for-TV quality. Finally, the plot, the horribly predictable plot... Each line (as if read from a teleprompter) can be predicted beforehand as can the opening scene and ending scene and every scene in between. Not once did I find myself with sweaty palms or a tight throat, simply because I knew everything that would happen, the entire 93 minutes (this should be a clue as to the production of the film). Fortunately, I went in with low expectations and I found entertainment in the absurdity of the entire production, accompanied by non-stop laughter."

The part where that girl puts her hand in the box for the antidote than realizes she is stuck and decides to put her other hand in the box made me roflol as did the rest of the theater.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","3","22","43","30 October 2005"," A horribly rushed, pointless cash-in.
","'Oh yes, there will be blood,' Jigsaw promises.<br/><br/>Well about a tea-cup's worth if you're lucky. 'There will be boredom' or ""There will be headaches"" would be more appropriate tagline for this absolutely worthless, mess of a sequel. After the surprisingly great and successful original, Lionsgate immediately green-lit this movie for production and completion within less than a year. Exactly how good can a film be with such a short production schedule? The answer is not very good at all. In fact it's downright awful.<br/><br/>Jigsaw has returned to teach ironic lessons to those who live dull lives yet are not truly alive. Only this time he attracts the attention of a half-crazed cop (oh wait, he did that last time as well) who is so thoroughly incompetent at his job that you'll want to jump into the movie and throttle him. Jigsaw has locked a bunch of strangers in a spooky old house with nerve gas slowly killing them. He gives them loads of clues on how to escape but since they are all idiots, none of them work together and their utter stupidity only serves to force the lumbering plot along and lead to their well deserved deaths.<br/><br/>It's not just the bad script that kills the film, after all great filmmakers can make brilliance out of a rotten screenplay. It's the very poor editing, urine-soaked cinematography, incoherent pacing, and dumb characters that cripple the film beyond repair. First-time director Darren Lynn Bousman isn't exactly Uwe Boll, but his lack of experience behind the camera gives this entire film an amateurish, hack feel.<br/><br/>Wahlberg's clichéd stereotype Detective is right out of a bad, 80s, bottom shelf Cop video and the people stuck in the poisonous house are just morons. The first Saw worked so well because we only had 2 victims who conversed and worked with/against each other for the whole film. We had a stronger attachment to them. And they looked for logical ways out before resorting to the painful. This time we get loads more victims with little explanation on who they are or what importance they have and they just never use their common sense.<br/><br/>Another thing that bogs this sequel down even more is its total reliance on condescending to the audience. Any average movie goer could figure the best way out of most of the booby-traps and death scenarios but these stupid characters just do the dumbest things so they can get killed and so film offers up another corpse for us to scream at. But not even this works. Some guy climbs into a big oven (only a retard would do this in a horror film) and is burned alive. But we don't even see anything! And when he tries to pull himself out, not only is he not even burnt, but he just dies for no apparent reason. So his feet got burnt a bit, big deal! If their were no swearing in this film, it would be a PG-13 all the way. Don't expect any of the bone-chilling scares you got first time around.<br/><br/>The only thing that stops Saw II from being a complete failure is the interesting, if incredibly stupid, plot twist. But is it worth suffering 90 minutes for? I would only recommend this film if you expect it to be crap, have lowered your expectations extremely far and obviously if you have the time and money to waste on it.<br/><br/>Overall this is a disgrace to the original. Oh and said Saw only appears for about a second and half."

(Why else would she be put to the test again? That would have been too dumb even for this piece of s*** of a movie. Plus the fact that she's always hanging around the cop's kid should make it obvious even to the most bird-brained film-goer.) 4: From the moment the psycho informed the kidnapees that the ""answer lies in the back of their minds"" it was so obvious that they had numbers on their heads. (Why couldn't any of them think of that???? I IMMEDIATELY thought ""check your heads, you dolts"".) 5: From the moment I saw the gangly, silent kidnapee I knew he was in some way connected to the psycho. And as the movie neared the end (thankfully) it became so obvious they'd trap the cop. And the movie isn't original, either: almost the same premise as ""Cube"".<br/><br/>I was thinking, ""that cop looks like Marky Mark, no  wait!, looks like Donnie Wahlberg  and in the end-credits it really turned out to be him! They've got a New Kid On The Block playing a tough cop! That should pretty much be a warning in itself.<br/><br/>So as far as twists are concerned, the film is a MISERABLE failure. However, in the illogic departement the movie wins standing ovations. Stupidities, absurdities, far-fetchedness. A real mess, once again. Just a few details/questions: why would the muscular guy kill the black guy in order to see the number on the back of his head? How could the psycho POSSIBLY know who the cop framed, and for all those ex-convicts??? For each and every one of them he knew they were framed! What, was the framing released in all DVD clubs for everyone to see??? What is he, a god? He seems to know EVERYTHING. And since he is obviously omnipotent, omnipresent and omni-everything, why not simply call him ""God"", and have him fly off with demon wings etc. When you look at the way things turn out in the movie, it seems as if the psycho can predict EVERY thought and EVERY move and EVERY event that ANYBODY makes in advance!!! I mean, we've had movie-killers before who knew too much, who were too smart to be real but THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I had to laugh at times, I really did. The psycho's story of failing to commit suicide with a car crash and then falling off a cliff!!! Now, that's pythonesque! It's high camp! It's comedy! And how about that dumb ending when the woman announces that she's going to ""continue his work""?!!! If the movie weren't so bleak it'd be actually funny, in a ""Plan 9"" sort of way.<br/><br/>I am curious about ""Saw III"". Perhaps the woman will die of AIDS and a three month-old infant will ""continue HER work"". Who knows what nonsense they'll come up with in the sequel(s)."

""Saw 2"" was exactly what it tried to hype itself as not being: contrived, unoriginal, poorly directed, badly written, terrible acting and worst of all, dumbed-down and rushed out to theaters to cash in on the first installment. <br/><br/>This movie is totally devoid of energy from the opening sequence to the last minute (where it copies the exact ending of the first ""Saw"" so that we can have a ""Saw 3""). There are any number of puzzles left unsolved by the end of this lame sequel, but none so glaring and infuriating as the business with the numbers on the back of the necks of the characters that you can't bring yourselves to care about. A fair amount of screen time is taken up by this matter and then the significance of it just vanishes into thin air. Also, let's not ignore Jigsaw's advice in the matter of the ""furnace"" killing: ""If you're in Hell only the Devil can get you out"" (or something like that). While the fool who climbs into the furnace in the first place is burning up, there's a brief shot of the interior wall of the furnace where a graphic illustration of the Devil is seen painted on the wall, pointing to a small handle marked ""TURN"". This is never explained or followed up.<br/><br/>None of the tension created in the first ""Saw"" is apparent here at all. Not once are you ever convinced that the motley crew of people ""trapped"" in the house are really trapped. You can get more suspense by dragging out your old copy of the boardgame ""Clue"" and playing that.

I'd seen the hype documentary on ""Saw 2"" so many times before actually seeing the movie that knowing how everything was done effects-wise etc. (not that it was rocket science to begin with) that the whole movie had already been telegraphed and therefore, no surprise.<br/><br/>This might have been something good, built on an original idea but as usual, Hollywood goes for the cash and assumes the people who buy the tickets won't recognize trash when they see it.<br/><br/>One star is here is being overly generous."

This time, he's pitted against a tough detective (Donnie Wahlberg), who must try to save his son and others from a house of horrors filled with deadly nerve gas, puzzles and death traps.<br/><br/>Saw 2 is just as scary and suspenseful as the original. The death traps are very creative and some of the twists are unpredictable. The original Saw was a very suspenseful film that actually terrified its audience. The sequel is more or less the same except its much bloodier. Whether or not that's a good thing is entirely up to you but it was fine by me. There were more scary, over the top gory scenes in this film then in the original Saw. There were more characters as well and that kind of hurt the film since they were all one dimensional. Some of them didn't even share their story of why they were there. The acting was well not so good. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who has seen the original film.<br/><br/>Tobin Bell probably gives the best performance as Jigsaw. This guy is defiantly very scary and very creepy. You see a lot more of him this time around so it made the film better. Donnie Wahlberg plays the detective who is trying to hunt down the people being tortured. He does a decent job though nothing special. Shawnee Smith plays Amanda and she also gives a decent performance. Everyone else was either too over the top or under performed. The worst was Beverley Mitchell but she's from 7th Heaven so that shouldn't be too much of a surprise. James Wan didn't direct this one and it shows. The original relied more on suspense to scare its audience while this one focuses more on disturbing scenes. There were disturbing scenes in Saw but that wasn't what the film was really about. So, the director for Saw 2 isn't as good as Wan. Also, the film is too short so the story feels rushed and its not as effective as it could have been. Like the original, it's hard to feel sorry for the characters because they do bad things and are so unlikable but that's just me. In the end, Saw 2 is a very gory and violent sequel that lives up to the original. Rating 8/10."

","The first Saw wasn't a perfect film, but it was at least interesting and had a whopper of an ending. This one doesn't even come close to the first one; it's just more gore, but with a much weaker script. There's one interesting plot twist, but it feels like too little too late because it comes at the very end. Hopefully the original screen writers will return for Saw 3...<br/><br/>One thing that too few people in Hollywood understand is that a good script is absolutely imperative in film-making. Everything else can be mediocre, but the script is the backbone and if that's weak, it doesn't matter how much violence and gore you have, it's not going to work.

I was pretty insulted while reading the negative reviews on this. I am categorised as the ""MTV generation"". PAH. I'm not a big fan of ""horror"" movies. I think the first ""gore"" one I watched was Cabin Fever when I was 11/12 (dear God, why did I waste my time?) and it was rubbish, to put it bluntly. So like I said, I wouldn't usually watch these sort of films - I got scared after watching The Others (don't laugh)! But anyway, back to Saw. Are we meant to be stupid or something to really connect with this trash? ALL the characters were stupid... from what I can remember, the first in the house to die was the idiot who decided to peer out of the keyhole(?) and got shot there and then. Then we have that Obi guy (Gollum lookalike, seriously) who must have thought, ""A big giant oven? I'm surrounded by criminal strangers, but no worries, I'll just climb in here and have a pull on that rope that's dangling there... NOTHING could go wrong."" Ah, and we have the petty blondie who ends up spazzing over the poison (actually made me laugh), that girl who shoved her hand up through glass to get the antidote (if she was clever enough, she might have noticed that there was in fact a way to get the antidote without even touching the glass). So her wrist has been sliced open, and she thinks ""Right, well, I better stick the other one up there too,"" and, oh look, we've got ourselves in a right little mess, haven't we, dear? Aaaanddd.... oh yeah, the black guy who gets whacked on the head by that spiked axe, the butch guy who actually slices off his skin to see a bunch of numbers that, in the end, don't help him at all, since the boy cuts up his throat a bit.<br/><br/>Can I just say, wouldn't old Jiggy be a bit peeved off if his assistant ended up saving the boy used to get back at the dad?

I can honestly say that this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Before I even start on the movie, I want to address the Jigsaw character. He was somewhat mysterious in the first movie but his motives were ridiculous. Punishing others because they don't appreciate life. This idea was somewhat passable in the first movie, but it just doesn't work in the second movie.<br/><br/>After watching the movie I can't believe that this is even in the 7.0 range. The characters were sooo laughable to watch and the dialogue was terrible. I did not care for any of those characters unlike the first, and when each of them died I really could not care less. All of them acted irrationally to the point where I couldn't take the movie seriously anymore. On top of this you had a police force which consisted of less than 10 people. This was so lame.

Since the killer has Cancer and now values life, hes decided to make other people value their life by putting them in almost impossible situations. The movie is a big contradiction, it tries to be deep, but comes off as random incoherent ramblings of an omnipotent killer. The movies not smart, it has a twist, but one that you could've never guessed. The 'gore' was on the light side too, even though the previews would like you to think other-wise.

","So much of the stuff that happens in this movie is boring and stupid, and none of it makes sense. The main game in SAW II is made up of eight people. Of these eight people, one is a child, two work for jigsaw, one is brain damaged, and one dies immediately so that there are stakes. It never occurred to jigsaw how unfair that is. They're job is to escape from a house full of nerve gas and solve little puzzles along the way, to get little bottles of antidote. All of the traps are stupid. At one point, a Russian man who works for jigsaw has to crawl into a metal box he has been told is called ""The Furnace"" and get two bottles of antidote. He crawls in and grabs one, then spends a while trying his hardest to grab the second one. Once he does, the door shut, and fire starts to come towards him. In order to open the door, he has to push a button that isn't in any way obscured, but he doesn't because he didn't see it. He never looked behind him. He, a man who works for jigsaw, heard that the box was called ""the furnace"" and was like ""thats probably just a box, I should just go get the antidote, that's probably the trap.""

It's basically a thriller version of The Cube (which wasn't that great in the first place).<br/><br/>Characters are uniformly unlikeable and boring; of course, there is the mandatory psycho stalker who starts murdering his companions because... well, no reason at all. He is eeeeeeeeeeeeevil, and that's it.

Otherwise you could just open the door and a bullet would fly by you about a foot away. And the kid was in in ""a safe place""...why didn't the cop say ""what do you mean he's in 'a safe place'? isn't he in this booby trapped house?"" totally predictable ending! And why didn't anyone think to look at the back of each other's heads to see if there was anything written there?

","Saw was already a movie with a deep, terrific plot. The sequel contained the same, although it just isn't as great as the first one. First off, there are much more people locked inside the trap. Therefore, if one gets angry or upset, they can kill each other, like Xavier did. Chaos and fights will start between people, unlike the first one where there were only an amount of two, so if one dies the other one will most likely go too. Torture scenes were just as brutal and left you with eyes opened wide enough to make your eyes dry up. Such as Amanda jumping into a pool of syringes, Obi being cooked up in an oven.<br/><br/>Parts of the movie weren't as confusing and mind boggling anymore. I understand that ""The Devil May help You"" for Obi, but it's kind of obvious. Also, the first one tells the story of each person and WHY they are in the trap and HOW they aren't appreciating their lives. This one only explains probably one or two.<br/><br/>I'd give props to the ending, because it was just a complete shock to me. I couldn't believe the fact that Amanda was faking the whole time and how she was actually helping Jigsaw, and that the surveillance camera was set 2 hours back already. As Jigsaw said, if Eric Matthews would have listened, his son is SAFE. Instead, he didn't listen, and he ended up dead, when his son was in a safe next to him.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was pretty good, just wasn't AS good as the first one. I would watch it again, but it wouldn't give me much interest after a while since it's pretty shady and dull."

The victims have two hours to find antidotes in order to escape a virus with which they are infected, involving deadly tasks and booby traps, as well as negotiating differences with their fellow-captives. Meanwhile Detective Matthews seeks to find where his son is being held through interrogating Jigsaw, the true colours of the cop coming out through the course of the film.<br/><br/>Mixed within the depth of violence and suspense of the film lies juxtaposed moralistic messages and a superb plot that is increasingly rare in the genre in modern times. However, for some, the violence may be too much, indeed the processes of killing the subjects are ingenious but not in any way subtle. However, if you're going to watch Saw II, then it's unlikely that your shy of horror, and you'll get it in bucket-loads, as well as a twist at the end that is as good as any you'll see in cinemas today.<br/><br/>Overall as a film Saw II is very good, it's entertaining, thou such a strong plot may have benefited from not seeming to want to rely so heavily on graphic violence. It probably won't go down as a classic and it's certainly not for everyone (don't rent it for the kids one night), but it's certainly one of the better 'scary' movies of recent times and worthy of a trip to the cinema or DVD store."

It is gone forever.<br/><br/>If they had eschewed the rapid fire editing and worked on mood, the overall picture could have been much better. As it stands though, it's a weak attempt and not nearly as good as the 3 of 5 star Saw I. The premise has been discussed before, a group of people trapped in a small area forced to find out why and how to escape, which is reminiscent of the highly superior movie Cube. There is no character development, you have no idea who these people are and you don't care. The main protagonists are miserable, as are the secondary authority figures in the helpless hero role. It's basically just an excuse to unravel Rube Goldberg trap after trap, constrained to a 3 seconds per scene limit, so you can't even see what is going on! There is no mood, no overall feeling of dread, the only emotion I actually felt was anger and frustration at watching my Saturday Night drift away. Maybe it is my age, at 35 I remember the new ""classics"" of the 70s and 80s and really don't relate to this flashy style over substance approach to recent horror films. So take my words with a grain of salt if the new Dawn of the Dead far surpasses the original to you.<br/><br/>As for me, this was bad enough for me to want to write some words of warning to others.

","James Wan's sleeper-hit ""Saw"" is one of the best and most memorable horror achievements of the last fifteen year, simply because it finally dared to shock and/or upset audiences again! No politically correct or goody-goody teenage horror in which girls are screaming and running while their breasts nearly burst out of the too-tight tops. No, even though far from flawless, ""Saw"" was a creative and full-blooded horror film and thus a sequel was inevitable...and the sooner the better, according to Hollywood rules. It's only normal that the surprise and shock effects of the first have entirely vanished, but you're aware of that (or at least you should be) before watching it, so expectations are automatically set a little lower. Personally, I assumed that every true horror fan would agree this sequel is not a patch on the 2004 original but, and to my amazement, a lot of people seem to prefer it! Granted, the acting performances are better (though not that much...) and it is true that new writer/director Darren Lynn Bousman attempts to bring more depth and background to the characters. But more background also means more chance to create plot holes and confusion, and regretfully that is what happens here most. The opening sequence of ""Saw 2"" is still very powerful and it easily could have come straight out of the first. After the credits, however, it goes downhill as fatigue copper Eric Matthews is challenged to a deadly game by the notorious Jigsaw-killer. The presumed sadist-killer turns out an old and pathetic cancer patient who can't stand it when people waste their lives aimlessly, while he has still so many dreams but can't fulfill them because of his disease. Apparently many fans liked this revelation. I sure didn't. Anyway, Jigsaw  or John Cremer, as he prefers to be called  kidnapped a whole lot of petty criminals and locked them all up in a nasty old house filled with traps. Among them also, is detective Matthews teenage son Daniel. Together, they have to look for clues that'll help them escape the house before the deadly nerves gas, which is spread around all the rooms, kills them first. Basically, ""Saw 2"" is an expansion of the first film, only with a whole group of people instead of just two and a police officer who's more involved with the victims. The rest is pretty much identical and thus very repetitive. The murders also are a lot less imaginative and disturbing and I only counted ONE genuine shock-moment...which involved a pit and large amount of eerie syringes. All the aspects like set pieces, camera-work and musical score are good but  again  they're largely copied from the first movie and thus not worth praising. ""Saw 2"" is a generally endurable sequel that enthusiast genre fans won't mind checking out, but don't expect another mesmerizing horror experience. As the tagline implies, there IS blood!...Oh Yes, there's blood, alright, but not much else."

But at least it hinted towards it, making it easy to swallow. <br/><br/>This movie however, fails miserably. May i note here that this movie is a desperate rip-off of the instant Canadian classic Cube. I'm not sure what the intention was with this movie; it seems that it was confined to simply do what hadn't been done in the first. As if one more crazy trap would make it worth the effort. To me, quite the opposite happened. Although i counted two creative traps, i counted more than i wanted which were aggravatingly idiotic.<br/><br/>I find it very annoying when the villain has an intelligence far superior than God himself. I also find it very boring when characters do stupid things, which are not explained, or, worse, they just do it for the sake of doing stupid things. Those movies were already done in the 70's with more remakes and sequels of even worse quality.<br/><br/>Where Saw I tried to be inventive, this movie is your standard completely flopping sequel. Where the first one had characters and plot twists worth developing, this movie is just a bad mix of blood, violence and stupidity.<br/><br/>I give it a 3, because the start wasn't that bad and the actors do try their best. But in the end, the plot fails, ending is weak, characters are not developed, the villain is a joke and the open ending is purely for commercial purposes.

Consider, then, what SAW and SAW 2 glorify: sadism, selfishness and Pharisaic homicide.<br/><br/>'Nuff said, I hope."
"domjc13","3","8","16","1 November 2005"," Shocking for the sake of it, a dismal sequel
","When the first Saw was released it reinvigorated the horror genre, although being incredibly violent and at times almost hard to watch, it possessed an intelligence rarely seen in the genre (despite the blatant nod to 'se7en'). This film suffers from the archetypal horror sequel problem - improving on a plot line that was so complex it would seem foolish to try to add to it. It follows the same basic structure as the first film although the violence is so sadistic that it lacks meaning neither does it add value to the film - almost as if the producers picked up on the predominant features of the first film and thought ""more of the same please"". For example the violence is gratuitous, and there is a convenient (if not slightly predictable) plot twist at the end. My main problem with this film is that the tension is solely built around increasingly horrific ways to shock the audience, lacking any real conviction or thought thus removing the factors that made the first film so original and brilliant, leaving the film to adhere to your stereotypical slasher flick. The only thing that saves this film from a 1/10 is Donnie Wahlberg's performance.. Shame he couldn't have been given a better narrative!"

","Wow. While I enjoyed the first Saw, let me say this sequel was an utter disgrace. If its title were an anagram, as in my heading, it would be more honest. This movie was an exercise in shock video, not a horror film. Believe me, there is a difference. It looks like today's audiences have forgotten, or, judging by some poster's ages, never gotten the chance to experience, what a true horror film is.<br/><br/>Some reviews which gave this high ratings said they did so because it had ""more movement"", was ""more gory and bloody"" and ""leaves it open for the next installment."" Well, none of those suggests a superior piece of cinema. The script was poor, editing was spastic, and the characters were absent. Even in this age of sequels, need we be reminded a 90 minute film is not an episode? This is a clumsily slapped together torture fest which is missing the mystery, the characterization, and the human element of the first. Horror needs pacing, buildup, and subtlety. Apparently, bloodshed, arguing, and a tacked on twist ending which made little sense scare people nowadays. And I haven't even delved into plot yet! <br/><br/>In short, Saw II takes the could-be mystery and shines a light on it, takes the entities and blurs them, takes the audience and leads us by the hand to a ridiculous ending. Save your time and money, and watch some old horror on DVD instead."

","Now, let's just admit something first off, horror movies aren't my favorite. I liked ""Dawn of the Dead"" especially with an awesome use of that Johnny Cash song based on the book of Revelation. I also liked Cabin Fever (shut up, I know). I'm more into comedy from Life Aquatic quirky to Waterboy stupid.<br/><br/>It's not so much that this movie was a bad production, it's just the motivation behind it. What's the point? We've got a movie that's violent for the sake of being violent...almost like the movie makers just get off on it. And hey, I've seen some weird fetishes, so it's not really surprising. I especially get this from the ""Trivia"" at the bottom of the IMDb page.<br/><br/>This may be more of a critique of the IMDb system than anything but half of these glowing reviews just have to be fake. Again, don't act surprised. Look, we've got guys comparing it to The Shining, and giving it equal ratings to King Kong and 2001. That MUST be a joke...yes, surprise, surprise! There are TONS of fake reviews on IMDb...yet this movie seems to have more than it's share.<br/><br/>Side note...HOW TO SPOT FAKE REVIEWS: 1) The reviewer only has like 2 movies to his or her credit. 2) Out of control hyperbole. 3) Way too much detail.<br/><br/>OK, it's not NEARLY as bad as ""House of the Dead"" (based on a Sega game) but it's not ""mind blowing"" or whatever bull crap the filmmakers are on here passing off as a legitimate review.<br/><br/>I like a good scary movie, this is not one of them. This is a ""gross out"" movie. Kind of like the American Pie movies (which I thought were funny) but with killing instead of pubes on a wedding cake."
"iwantu2hitme","1","7","14","22 November 2005"," Not a good horror film by any means.
","Slasher films experience a resurrection about every ten years. It starts out with an innovative and lower budget film that brings in a lot of revenue. Usually it is just a reinvention of a previously existing genre. In the seventies we had Mike Meyers, the eighties brought us Jason and Freddy, the nineties brought us the constantly changing ghost from Scream and it looks like this decade will be the decade of Jigsaw.<br/><br/>Saw II fails where it's predecessor succeeded. The original Saw was made for a low budget and predominantly took place in one room and was made up of one conversation between two people. Now parts of the dialogue were awkward but it was a challenging and very interesting way to approach a tired genre. Saw II instead of picking up with the idea of the original takes a different direction.<br/><br/>Why need ingenuity when you have money right? It is a haunted house film. People wake up and they do not know why they are in this house. If you pay close enough attention to the dialogue and the camera work; the entire story can be figured out within the first thirty-forty minutes. Sometimes this can be good, get the meat of the plot out of the way and just let the killing commence, but that never quite starts. Instead we go into more meaningless deposition about the value of life and death and what a person really wants in something.<br/><br/>It is as though the filmmakers, writers and all were just going through the motions.<br/><br/>Jigsaw's motives are puzzling, even after they divulge into his past, being sick is not a good excuse to exact revenge on society. If the filmmakers were not attempting to make him more sympathetic it was pure filler.<br/><br/>The ending is the most contrived piece of crap in film-making to happen in a long time. It is original, and creative, unfortunately, like the rest of the film, really contrived."

","This movie was absolutely awful. For one, what the hell is up with movies nowadays that they need to have twenty to thirty cuts for every second of footage? Watching this movie reminds me of the time that I got electrocuted for a couple of seconds. I could barely concentrate watching this heap of poo. I blame MTV for this one.<br/><br/>What I really hate about this film is that the villain is just TOO goddamn smart. I'm sorry but in order to plan anything even halfway to the level that Jigsaw did in this film would require an IQ of at least alien proportions, not to mention an ability to see into the future and predict a person's every move. I can appreciate that this is a movie and all but come on, this was just ridiculous. You had this guy making schemes so complicated that even Leonard Nimoy would've been left scratching his head had he read the script. This movie has nothing on the dozens of other movies it has ripped off and frankly, I'm going to die happy knowing I never have to watch it again.<br/><br/>I will say that there are some good deaths but the movie is so bad that it just renders it all useless. Yeah there are some scenes that will freak people out but come on, this is far from good stuff. And before I forget, Franky G, (who plays Xavier the muscle bound retard whose role in the film seems to be to make Hispanics look bad... I'm Hispanic myself so I can say that) is absolutely horrendous in this. I found myself wanting to jam my thumbs in my eyes whenever he did so much as speak.<br/><br/>A few things save this from being a COMPLETE waste of time: some good murders, a semi interesting ending and Donnie Wahlberg who always surprises me with how bad he can be when he wants to be.<br/><br/>No more Saw movies, I beg you!<br/><br/>RATING * and a 1/2 out of *****."
"bob the moo","Null","5","9","2 April 2006"," Enjoyably mean but the weak plot and lack of characters means it is a lesser beast than the original
","Having been taunted by twisted killer Jigsaw, Detective Eric Matthews cracks the clue that leads him directly to the hide-out where they capture the man himself. However Jigsaw directs Matthews' attention to a bank of monitors that show a group of people stuck in a locked house  one of whom is Matthews young son. The people in the house are breathing in a deadly nerve gas which will kill them in two hours, but they have the ability to solve puzzles to get out before then. While they try to solve the deadly puzzles, Matthews tries to break Jigsaw to find out where the house is.<br/><br/>When Saw was a big success in the cinemas it was only a matter of time before a sequel was produced that tried to repeat the success all over again and duly this does feel like a film that has been produced to cash in. Of course this is not to say that it isn't any good but suffice to say that it doesn't quite match up the energy and tension of the first film. It does still produce the goods as a teenage style horror movie, with moments that made me cringe and look away all doing just enough to keep the film moving. Problem was more with the plot, which was never going to be as cool as the first film mainly because it couldn't be as simple and sharp. Instead we have a baggier and more contrived set up that doesn't work as well. The stuff with Matthews and Jigsaw doesn't really connect that well to the action in the house and, although part of the twist was reasonably clever, it did rather feel like it was more about setting up more sequels than producing a big impacting finish.<br/><br/>The cast are mixed but limited by the material. Bell is good but, considering he is the heart of the story, he doesn't get much to do and is not as good a presence as he needed to be within the narrative (although the producers clearly feel the series doesn't need him so who am I to speak?). Wahlberg is cut off from the action and although he shouts well, he cannot develop the character that was needed in order to explain the plot and make the ending. The rest of the cast are so much filler and generally they run, shout, scream and die as required without doing much to make themselves stand out; basically when the most famous face is ""the guy from Speed"" then you know you are in trouble.<br/><br/>Overall then this is an OK Hollywood horror movie that has a nice mean streak running through it from start to finish. The story is a bit weak and doesn't have the impact of the original, a problem not helped by the lack of good characters. Fans of the original will probably still like it but it is hard to ignore that this is much lesser product than the first film."
"Admiral_Ass_Annihilator","1","8","17","31 October 2005"," We've just been set back hundreds of years
","MILD, MARKED SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I have never seen the original, but I was with a group of friends who were desperate to see the sequel, as they are fans of the original, so we decided we would go. After hearing about the original, I was excited to see this one, but I was deeply disappointed. <br/><br/>This was a violent film, and when I say ""violent"", I mean violence on a level that you've likely never seen, unless you're into snuff. The thought of being deeply disturbed by this movie didn't even occur to me; I'm an adamant fan of the Kill Bill films, and have been a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino for years. No amount of violence can get to me, until I saw this.<br/><br/>Here are some things the movie did wrong:<br/><br/>1) Script The writing wasn't bad for the more mysterious characters, such as John, but for basic human characters faced with insurmountable obstacles, the script was either way over the top, or not touching enough on the tension there should be between characters. The plot could have been far more elaborate and that could have been a saving grace, although I don't think anyone would ever notice it.<br/><br/>2) Direction It was erratic. There's no excuse for camera work this poor. The film gave itself a lot of grief by not exploring the whole house. If these people are so desperate to get out, why don't they explore the whole building? There were tons of doors left unopened and it made the characters seem even stupider then they already were.<br/><br/>3) Photography The photography was completely overdone. There's no need for the bright yellows, it doesn't advance an atmosphere, it just makes the film look like a music video.<br/><br/>4) Acting This film featured some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Period.<br/><br/>5) Staging The traps were not creative at all. Instead of making it seem like he wanted them to get through the traps and learn something, it just seemed like he wanted to kill them for his own twisted pleasure (For example --< SPOILER AHEAD >--The seen where the guy is put in the furnace. What is he supposed to learn from that? And why didn't they stick something in the furnace--like a poll or something--and knock the syringes down? It doesn't make sense, and I refuse to suspend disbelief for a film like this--</ SPOILER >--). There wasn't much to the traps, and it could have made the movie a lot more interesting if they had worked on the traps some more.<br/><br/>6) Violence Unless you're a sociopath, there's no reason for anyone to ever see this. This is on par with snuff and it makes me sick to think that some people find this entertaining. At least snuff has the dignity to tell you what it is beforehand. This is an exercise in cruelty, and how much violence the public can handle, and the answer is, people line up in droves for this garbage, then bask in it. This is truly horrific, and not in the way it intended to be."

It took only a year to write, film, and produce...That's a bad sign. Of course, the result is terrible.<br/><br/>This time around, the Jigsaw killer has a house full of 8 people, yes, 8 people instead of 2, how thrilling, and there's plenty of traps to go around. One of the victims is Det. Eric Mason's son, so this makes it all personal for him.<br/><br/>As well as the first one, the concept is kind of cool, but the acting is almost unbearably bad. Donnie Wahlberg isn't really worth the money he gets paid to act. He should leave acting to his brother, even though he isn't even that good either.<br/><br/>Like the first film, it ends with a twist.

","Well, here we go yet again. No doubt this movie or should I say this type of movie really does have its followers...age in range of about 10 to 16. For those of us with serious tastes for horror, suspense and the macabre, this ain't it. Let's face a few facts of life, OK? Everything, and I mean just about everything has been done, especially when it comes to splatter and slice and dice. The original ""Texas Chainsaw"" is certainly much more suspenseful and horrific primarily because it follows a basic rule: only imply what's happening, don't actually show it. Alfred Hitchock made ""Psycho"" that way as well. Always merely suggest what's behind the door but never really define it. The human mind is so much more adept at creating its own horrors and fears than whatever a special effects guy or makeup artist is capable of creating. When it's all out in the open, basically, the surprise is over with and you merely have to sit through another hour or so and just wait it out. This film is yet another example of how contemporary writers, directors and producers come up with another ""cash in"" scheme of a picture and then it disappears, except on home video. None of these so-called genre films will ever be remembered except maybe someday in a film history class as ""how not to make a horror film"". Save your money and your time on this one."

Beverley Mitchell's character dies before anyone else of the poisoning but is this explained, no. it doesn't even explain why shes there. all the people playing jigsaws little game are there because they were convicted. but thats all, no back story, characterization, these people are 2-D. also when they discover the room from the first saw movie, it makes no sense. considering the environment and placement of that place in the original saw its like a bad suspense cliché. also the ending is uninspired. first off what if when the detective that beats jigsaw up while trying to get information knocked jigsaw out and was unable to fall for jigsaws trap, its to sloppy. not the jigsaw from the first saw at all. its insulting when they change the murder from a previous horror movie into something it isn't in the sequel. they insulted jigsaw with this change in character and sloppiness. at the end it turns out Amanda was in the bathtub in the room from saw 1 and it was all a video recording, wow what a nut breaking surprise (for those of you who don't know that was sarcasm your the perfect example for the simple minded fools who liked this.) Amanda injects the detective with a poison and kills him, no game! jigsaw doesn't kill people he makes them kill themselves but injecting the detective with the poison was the last straw.. if you like cliché thriller suspense movie then this movie is for you, and id suggest to heighten your tastes. if you like mindless violence that is in this movie, then go get a movie with better violence, not this cheep cliché killings, id recommend Dead Alive by peter Jackson. now I'm concluding this, and as some may have noticed this review is all over the place, i did this to make it just like the movie, all over the place. now if you enjoyed this movie i got one thing to say to those people.......baa baa. opium for the people little sheep."

","I don't really know why I was so excited to see Saw II. From the second I saw the first preview for it, I knew I would though. It's not like the experience of the first one isn't still seared into the lobes of my brain, aching to be washed away and forgotten like the piece of tripe that it was.<br/><br/>That's why, I guess. I was so enamored of the POSSIBILITY of the first one. There was serious potential there for an excellent movie in the vein of Se7en, even if it had to rip off Se7en a little to get there.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that one, though not as much as this one, was a piece of ass asking to be tossed in the bargain bin at your local supermarket.<br/><br/>This movie is ridiculous, from start to finish. The acting is awful (though Ewes has thankfully been dismissed), the script could have been pieced together with magnetic poetry, and the sets/designs were enough to make a community college theater group blush with embarrassment.<br/><br/>Why did they do it again? Why couldn't they have taken a little time to make a movie that didn't suck? The characters in this one are once again completely and totally incapable of thinking like a rational being would given the situation. There's lots of yelling, screaming, fighting, etc., when just a little bit of chatting could have saved a lot of trouble.<br/><br/>Take, for example, the guy who puts his face up against the door, right as the resident Brute puts the key that was EXPLICITY NOT TO BE PUT IN THE DOOR, in the door. Bam. Bullet to the face. Got what you deserved.<br/><br/>Or let's talk about the oven. Poor guy sure did spend a lot of time looking over that oven before he got in it. Maybe if he'd taken just a second longer he would have realized that the same window that was later broken and that he would become lodged in could have been used to remove the antidote WITHOUT getting roasted up BBQ style.<br/><br/>The syringe part was, admittedly, a good scene. Aside from the bad acting and the ridiculously small amount of time she was given, this one had me cringing.<br/><br/>And the lady with the box? Are you serious? Did someone actually green-light this scene? I've made better decisions after huffing video cleaner than that. She gets one hand stuck, then, in a move of sheer brilliance, gets the other hand stuck instead of using it to unstick the first hand.<br/><br/>Did anyone else notice that there weren't even enough traps to finish everybody off? If the big guy hadn't gone crazy with the makeshift morning star, there would have way more people than antidotes. Just another piece of the ""puzzle"" that didn't fit.<br/><br/>There's so much more about this that warrants criticism, the lighting, the directing, the sets, the actors, even the soundtrack for Pete's sake. It's just not worth it to me to go into it.<br/><br/>All in all, not as good as the first (which is sad), because it ultimately didn't do anything to really SCARE the audience.

","i was incredibly disturbed and thoroughly disgusted by this movie. the violence was distasteful, the acting was atrocious, it was just plain bad. it really angers me that millions were wasted on making piece of crap movies like this when that money could have been put towards a better cause. whoever thought of this movie is just plain sick and needs to seek professional help. some directors can handle violence such as Quentin Tarantino, who almost makes his violence a work of art. this is just sleazy gore. if you have any sense i would suggest you avoid this movie. take your $10 you were planning on spending at this movie and donate it to the red cross. also, by the looks of the ending (don't worry i'm not giving anything away) they could just be making another sequel, but i'm only guessing."

","Saw II is not as good as the original, but boy, is it still a ride. All of the surprises and twists of the first installment cannot be topped, but they sure try. The traps are not so threatening as before and the story no more stronger.<br/><br/>The actors were at most decent this time around. There was no gritty feel to them, but the scenery more than makes up for that. <br/><br/>Why a high score? Because all in all it made my pulse rise, my palms sweat, and my eyes want to shut while all the while screaming for more. See this movie if not for the story, but for the ride and the nice twist at the end."

What is missing from this movie that was in the first is the raw brutality, the mystery and the excitement that comes with identifying with the characters. The villain also acts a bit differently and the tortures are not as clever.<br/><br/>This time around we get a low budget poorly acted crappily written mess. <br/><br/>The point of this movie was to be scary or entertaining or both. It is none of the above. This time we get a fast food drive through biggie size version, where a group of people get stuck with a saw puzzle all at once instead of the more intricate and personalized situations from the previous movie. <br/><br/>What we wind up with is a dumb cop drama where a cop is trying to protect his family, can we say cheese plate au gratin? Yes it's very cheesy formula crap of all the junk that DOESN'T work in a horror flick. This sequel is like SAW's evil twin - it's the brother that came out blue and rides the short bus."
"ShadySovereign","1","6","13","29 April 2006"," Jigsaw returns...with more idiocy
","""Saw 2"", like the original, is arguably one of the most overrated films ever. Although this film is slightly better than the original Saw, it still has the same boring ideas and tries badly to be a horror movie.<br/><br/>This time, instead of just two guys trapped in a room by Jigsaw (from the first movie), there are now about 7 people locked up in a house with deadly gas. These people must figure out the clues given by Jigsaw in order to escape the house. Meanwhile, police have located Jigsaw himself and start questioning him about how to release the trapped victims...<br/><br/>The previews were right when they said that there would be more blood than the original film. Nevertheless, along with more blood, there is more stupidity brought by the characters that are locked inside the house. Each and every one of them are among the dumbest characters I've ever seen in film history. The clues they were given were so obvious that they all should have figured everything out. But alas, they all take wrong turns and end up killing each other.<br/><br/>Aside from the stupidity happening in the the deadly house, the police arrive at Jigsaw's hideout to persuade him to set his victims free. Jigsaw himself is a laughable rip-off of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The questioning scenes between Jigsaw & the main cop are carbon copies of the questioning scenes between Dr. Hannibal Lecter & FBI agent Clarice Starling in ""The Silence of the Lambs"". The film-makers attempted to make Jigsaw look ""clever"" by letting him use metaphorical sentences, much like Hannibal. However, Jigsaw is in no way as psychologically menacing as Hannibal, since Hannibal uses his mind to frighten his victims, while Jigsaw relies solely on traps to keep his victims scared. In my eyes, Jigsaw is a lame Hannibal wannabe.<br/><br/>Jigsaw is much more weaker than I expected him to be. In this film, he is a very old man in a wheelchair, supported by oxygen breathers. As the movie progresses, the audience learns that he ended up this way due to being in a freak car accident. He reveals that he has an assistant who helped him build the traps. This assistant is actually among the victims from the booby-trapped house! However, it is hard to believe that Jigsaw's assistant is a teenage girl. I would never believe that she could have helped Jigsaw build the traps. She seems too much of an amateur to be an assistant of a so-called ""criminal mastermind"". Both Jigsaw and his assistant are totally unrealistic and pathetic.<br/><br/>Finally, the traps in this movie are better than the first film. Some of them were impressive, but still not good enough to make this film a horror movie. I guess people consider this film a horror movie because of the dangerous traps. But traps are not scary at all.<br/><br/>To conclude, this movie is almost the same as the original Saw movie, except that it has more blood than the first one. There are also stupid characters who do dumb things. It's still a thriller, with more horror elements than the first movie. If you liked the first film, then you will enjoy this sequel. If you are a horror movie fan, however, avoid this movie.<br/><br/>I give this film a 1/10."

","OK, so the voice combined with the creepy dummy with the suit on was scary for me, but then again clowns, porcelain dolls, and George W. Bush scare me, so that makes sense. Yeah so what was with the clues being 'over the rainbow'? The numbers had different colors but they never found the clue! I wanted to hear Jigsaw's personal recordings for each of the victims, if only to get a deeper feel for their crime and his vision of it. Donnie Wahlberg was amazing in BOOMTOWN, why sink to this level. His character never changed. He was always mad. Always mad, even when crying over his kid. With abysmal acting, horrible plot, and shaky direction, even the elaborate set construction and innovative torture setups (putting the key behind his eye...ingenious) couldn't bring the movie to a simmer on my stove. Bland, tripe, and callow, should be avoided by all those who would like to retain their brain cells."
"akuma634","1","6","13","18 February 2006"," A movie that makes you feel stupider for just watching it,
","I hated SAW with a passion. There was no gore, no suspense, loads of plot holes, and ""shocker"" ending thought up at the last second, not to mention it damn near plagiarized the much superior Se7en. How can the sequel get any worse? Well I went to Block Buster to spend my free rental, I didn't see anything halfway interesting so I grabbed SAW 2 because it can't be worst than the first and it got so much praise and hype.<br/><br/>So it starts almost exactly like part one. This guy has an iron mask filled with nails that will snap. OK I know for a fact it won't be gory because it'll just cover his face, what's the point. So I was right, just a little cheap blood. It goes on very slow paced with characters no one gives a damn about and never a reason to care if they live or die. Eventually everyone is locked in a room with no idea how they got there. They get a message that each one of them can unlock a safe and each one knows a number. Wait, did you ever see the movie Cube? Wow, they just ripped off Cube this time. But Cube had suspense and some gory moments and Saw one and two don't have either. So everyone of these idiots blinds runs right into every single trap without thing about it. It's like an hour in a half of watching rats walk into a mouse trap for a chunk of cheese. Not to mention that this movie isn't anywhere near as gory as it's hyped to be. as far as gore and violence go this would be a 3/10, even that snooze fest Hostel had a little more blood than this dung heap. Oh yeah and this Jigsaw killer is the lamest horror villain since the Leprechaun. Jigsaw is just a poor man's John Doe (Se7en) and Hannibal (in this movie he blatantly rips off Hannibal.) So just like SAW one everyone is stupid, there's no gore, and you already know who's going to die and how. For example ""Hey I should craw into this giant oven, nothing could possibly go wrong here!"" The movie treats it's viewers like idiots, and you know what after all the praise both movies got maybe they have a point. And like SAW one this movie does another moronic plot twist that will either leave you laughing or just insulted. Not to mention like SAW one this isn't the slightest bit scary. I think it's made to freak out teenie boppers who think I Know What You Did Last Summer was scary.<br/><br/>How do people say this movie is gory anyway? If you thought this was gory I'll bet you wet yourself in terror at the very mention of The Little Mermaid. You'll be better of renting or buying something good, like Se7en or Cube. I want my free rental back."

","I was a huge fan of Saw, and was intrigued by its plot and story I line. The only thing I thought was holding it back was the acting. The sequel, unlike many sequels, is much better than the first in many ways. The actors fell in line, the story was completely new and interesting, and the ending was BETTER than the first.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone. I've never seen a horror movie made like these, and they are a refreshing change from the overplayed ""bad guy kills people, good guys end up winning"" plot line. Go see this movie, but watch the first one first, even if you've seen it before, refresh your memory!"
"nubyan_queen","4","6","13","28 October 2005"," Decent plot, horrible characters
","What the HELL. Okay, given that I've just wasted my money on this crap, I'll try to be as fair as I can.<br/><br/>The original Saw was an intelligent, complex, entertaining horror movie (bad acting aside). Saw II absolutely does not live up to its predecessor. THE ONLY expectation Saw II lived up to, it my opinion, would have to be that of a typical horror movie sequel - Disappointing.<br/><br/>I'll outline the plot without spoiling it for you if you're planning on seeing it: A bent cop finds himself involved in the notorious ""serial-killer"" Jigsaw's latest game. His son is one of 6 people trapped in a house, trying to find the antidotes for the toxic gas they're breathing. The 6 captives are told that they have 2 hours to work out the combination to a safe in order to get some antidotes within it, or work out the puzzles in various rooms of the house to find individual doses of antidote. So the race begins!<br/><br/>To be fair, the plot and puzzles are quite good; my favourite would have to be the pit of needles, as well as the Jigsaw's own game with the cop himself, to talk (you'll understand what I mean if you see it). A couple of ideas are recycled from the original film, but it all works well with what's happening. What makes Saw II suck so much is the bloody characters! They can only be described as predictable, run-of-the-mill and most of all aggravating! The way they behave is simply not the way anyone with any sort of sense would react in their given situations! This is the case with basically all horror movies, so that aside, a lot of the characters are still just plain dumb.<br/><br/>Really, if I would've known this is what the film would be like, I wouldn't have paid money to see it. If you have seen the original Saw and were impressed by it, just try not to have high expectations when you go to see this one. Then maybe you won't be as disappointed as me. Rather wait for it to show on cable or something... Entertaining enough, but I could swear even the new Wallace and Gromit movie looks more promising than this load of crap.<br/><br/>4/10 - only because of the ingenuity of the plot."

Don't waste your money on it, but if you do at least don't eat as you watch it, you will probably get sick. However I am glad to see Donnie Wahlberg is looking much better than he did in previous roles (The Sixth Sense and Dreamcatcher). He did a great job in his role as Officer Eric Matthews! Also welcome back to the cast Amanda from Saw, the very lucky girl who survived the killer's sick game. Answer me this, if you survived once, why do something that could tempt him to put you through this again?"
"preppy-3","8","7","16","1 November 2005"," I'm shocked--a GOOD horror film sequel!
","""Saw"" was one of last year's best horror films--grim, brutal, no stupid jokes and VERY dark. I expected the worst when I heard a sequel was coming. I was shocked to find it just as disturbing as the original.<br/><br/>The film opens right up with a young guy trapped in a mask-like creation. There are spikes all over it--but he has the key. Problem is it's embedded BEHIND his eye and he has to cut his eye to get it out! He's been put here by Jigsaw--a serial killer who punishes people for things they do wrong.<br/><br/>It involves a bunch of people that Jigsaw has trapped in a house together. There seems to be no way out--and a deadly poison is being pumped through the air vents. If they don't get out in two hours they'll die. But Jigsaw tells them there IS a way out--they just have to find it for themselves with obscure clues he gives...and there are multiple, gory booby traps they have to watch for...Meanwhile the police HAVE Jigsaw and try to get him to reveal where the house is...<br/><br/>Sounds like another stupid horror film but, like the first film, there's no humor and the killings are brutal and bloody. It also tells us the back story of Jigsaw and why he's doing all this. It brings up questions of morality--Jigsaw is doing this for a reason--but what gives him the right to torture people? It makes you think and, at the same time, you're trying to figure out the clues Jigsaw keeps giving the people to get out. It all comes together at the end and throws in multiple clever plot twists that I didn't see coming.<br/><br/>Be warned--this is a bloody, brutal film but VERY well-made and disturbing. I walked out of the theatre shaken and thinking about the questions the film brought up. There are no easy answers. I hope there's a third movie as good as this! I give it an 8 only because it's not really a movie you enjoy..."

Bad acting, bad idea, bad script, bad directing and w whole lot of blood for nothing. Who would pay to see this c-r-a-p? I can't believe i payed to see it. Okay, i paid for the different reasons. I've seen all the Saw movies, not in theaters, and every last one of them sucks. Except for the first one that's at least watchable. The reason i've seen them is because i don't like to criticize something i don't know anything about and because so many people seems to like them. Which is just another proof of where the society is going when people are ready to pay their hard earned money to see movies about people being tortured by some psycho that the writers give their best to show him as some sort of a 'ocassionaly makes sense' kinda guy! <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against violence in movies. But i don't see why so many people want to see a movie that's about nothing but violence. Braveheart, The Deer Hunter, Clockwork Orange, Pulp Fiction, even Kick Ass... Those are all violent movies. Some of them don't even have a message that speaks against it! And i don't mind that. I am not searching for a message when i'm watching a movie. I'm searching for a good movie. But Saw is a movie with only one storyline-violence. That's what i don't like about it. It's about nothing but violence! <br/><br/>The worst thing is that they made a whole money making series on it. That's something i will never understand! Violence is OK - movies that hurt peoples intelligence are not. This kind of movie belongs to that group. And how in the world did it succeed to make that many fans??? I guess i'll never know!?

It was an intense psychological thriller with a lot of surprises. The writing was excellent and fresh.<br/><br/>Having said that, I recently watched Saw II and it was the most appalling piece of trash I have watched in a long time. There was absolutely nothing in the second one that could be compared to the first one. The writing was weak and the writers should be embarrassed to have their name associated with this tripe. The situations are stupid, the characters are complete idiot's and there isn't a scare in the whole movie. If you think listening to a lot of screaming and seeing over the top amounts of fake blood is scary then maybe this movie is for you. I don't think I jumped once and I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat. The twist at the end was okay, but it was just a set-up to make a third one. The only thing good about this movie is that you get to know Jigsaw more and learn what makes him do what he does.<br/><br/>If you have any sense at all you would avoid this movie at all costs. Don't pay money to see it, but if you must watch it try and see it for free.<br/><br/>If you want to watch an intelligent, tense movie, then watch Saw.

The only difference, however, is Saw 2 does not suffer the same cast. Let us not forget that Carey Elwes is a fantastic COMEDY actor, he never should have been cast in a movie like saw. So, better cast, slightly more intriguing story make for a marginally less craptacular film.

Gone here is all the humor, and genre fans will feel redeemed from the bad acting of the first especially with all the bone-crunching, throat-slitting, head-exploding action on parade here.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is leaner and meaner than the first, and all the better for it.

","First of all I am blown away that Saw II has received rave reviews from not only critics but people who have seen it. This is a typical Hollywood movie,that lacks emotion and intelligent dialog and carries on with pointless blood and guts only to insert a massive plot twist in the end.Over the past three years horror movies have become so similar in script and violence that they are ruining American Cinema. What ever happened to slasher flicks, with a touch of humor or realist views of horror. Now a days there is always some form of game or puzzle which the characters must solve, and Saw II follows this pattern. The twist in the end isn't satisfying one bit, even though it is surprising you know it is coming in some form or another; thus, taking away any scary aspects of the movie. Sorry to say but Saw II is an embarrassment to the horror genre and my intelligence. My advice to anyone is who is listening to all these fantastic reviews, just ignore these people they have no comprehension of real horror movies and should not be trusted. Save your Ten bucks and spend it on renting ""The Shining"" or a Jason flick."

I was fully expecting a plot less gore fest but to my surprise it was a true psychological thriller. Although it wasn't as thought provoking as the first I believe that it got the message home much clearer and wasn't spoilt by bad acting, directing or scripting. I don't know where to begin but I found an attraction to some of the plot twists but again I believe a fault lies once again in the casting. A few of the characters were great whereas others made me wince in pain from the stereo-types. The burly 'thug' and the 'hard-ass chick' have to be two of the worst characters to ever brace a cinema and as per-usual were poorly acted out by no name stars. The directing at the start of the film was frustrating with the typical rapid camera fade but as it progressed it turned into slick movement from one scene to another with the right shots and timing. I'm going to keep it short... you may see 6 out of 10 a harsh rating given my positives but nothing in particular made me say 'this is great' but I certainly had a few negatives."

","Hey I'm So Proud to say that i'eve been to the ""world premiere"" Of saw 2 And This Movie totally beat the first one. I first taught it was going to be less bater cause of the new producer, but i change my mind when i saw what he did with the movie and my wish have been granted when i saw that the ending is more troubling than the first (i taught i'd would never feel this again, but saw 2 did bring back some nice and freaky memory). And people will be happy to see that the director's bring us back to the little bathroom of saw 1 where the main story happen. And if you wanna make the experience even more freaky well just do like the first time you've saw SAW 1, just try to find out a way to survive the game."
"Bababooe","1","2","3","12 November 2017"," Garbage Filmmaking. Crap story, acting, dialogue, cinematography, editing, music, etc
","I've seen the first Saw a few times, last time in 2016. First viewing I thought good. Last viewing in 2016, there were no surprises left, so the impression was a C rating for a B movie, maybe 5 stars. At least the story was decent and the acting was well done.<br/><br/>Now Saw 2. This movie is garbage all the way around. Very little to recommend. First the story sucks. Very cliché. Our main character is a divorced, estranged father, cigarette smoking, possible alcoholic, corrupt cop that will plant evidence. Not a nice guy. The actor? Donnie Wahlberg. Now I've seen this guy do some decent acting before. But not here. The character is crap, and his actions and dialogue is trash. I can't blame him completely, but he took the job so he's not innocent. He is garbage here. His son, Erik Knudsen adds nothing to the mix. Nothing! His x partner, Dina Meyer, adds nothing, just garbage. The black cop with the bandanna on his head, crap. What's with the bandanna? Tobin Bell as Jigman, crap. He's got maybe 10 seconds of decent dialogue if that. Most of the crap that comes out of his mouth is boring, nonsense. I guess the filmmakers were trying to be a twisted gore fest here. It did not work.<br/><br/>This opens with a killing. So, that was one thing the filmmakers did right. No brainer. Then we are introduced to the Donnie having a problem with his son. Let's all get excited for the introduction of these boring/cliché characters. Then the scene of the opening killing with more boring cliché characters, the cops. And then the scene with the SWAT team breaking in on the Jig Guy and finding out via videotape that Donnie's son and 7 other people are trapped and a gas has been released that will kill them in a few hours. Interesting idea. And the clock is ticking idea. All good. However, the execution sucks. The characters are garbage, and the dialogue is garbage. Help me. We are then introduced to the 8 people stuck in Jig's hell. Hispanic/Tough Guy/Drug Dealer, Black Gangster (where's the hip hop music?), Female Prostitute, Female Drug Addict (ended up conspiring with Jig Man, and then becoming the new Jig Woman), Businessman (no clue), Businesswoman (no clue), Donnie's son, Thief (we find out he helped Jig kidnap these people).<br/><br/>The garbage that comes out of these kidnapped characters is unbearable. The acting sucked. The only one that seemed to show any type of terror was the businesswoman.<br/><br/>We find out that all the kidnapped characters were framed by Donnie. They are disposed of one by one. And for no apparent reason the Drug Dealer starts killing people because he wants to find the number tattooed on the back of the neck. Why not just ask the person to turn around? The camera-work is garbage. Lots of quick edits, like we are going on a roller-coaster ride. The colors are garbage, some kind of green, brown lighting. Just garbage. I don't remember the music, so it wasn't good, but better yet I guess it wasn't horrible either. I did not buy the idea for why Jig decided to trap people into these death games. That he's sick and dying of cancer and people don't know what it is to live, and to deserve to live. And the idea that now, the drug addict is taking over for the same reason. The story is completely convoluted. I hate the dialogue. Lot's of F words, wise cracks, just plain garbage. When Donnie started tearing apart Jigs files, I was thinking maybe now we are going into comedy territory. What the hell was that? Then our screenwriter throws everything into the mix. Donnie starts beating the crap out of Jig. I mean, just add the loonie tunes soundtrack, at least it would be entertainment.<br/><br/>This movie is a freaking mess. You can tell the filmmakers have some ideas and some skills, but don't know how to put it together. But dialogue like ""Shut the F Up!"" – that's the best you could come up with? The twist end with the drug addict now taking over for Jig – nonsense. Remember the saying ""A mind is a terrible thing to waste?"" well this movie illustrates that a mind is a terrible thing. The filmmakers come up with a cliché/non original story plot dialogue with garbage actors and cinematography and editing to show us the payload. The payload? Disturbing gore.<br/><br/>I hate this movie. I got it in a set of 7 Saw movies. I will rewatch Saw in fast forward so I can properly review it. And watch the other Saw movies, and god I hope they are better. Even if the stories are crap, if the cinematography/lighting/sets/editing/music is decent I can find some entertainment in it.<br/><br/>Saw 2 – F, 1. Full on garbage. Quick summery – convoluted, cliché characters and dialogue, garbage kills/gore. Nothing of value."
"callanvass","6","2","3","24 May 2010"," Too gimmicky for my liking, lacking all the qualities that made the 1st so special.
","Saw II is an OK film, but vastly underwhelming in my opinion for a number of reasons. Many of the characters here are selfish, whiny and I couldn't wait for them to get their ultimate demise. With Saw I was able to care about the two main central characters, and even though they had there selfish qualities, they both possessed likable qualities. Donnie Wahlberg's character is not very easy to root for. He's verbally abusive, he uses brutality too much and he never learns his lesson when he's supposed to, therefore I had a hard time coming to grips to root for him. The 1st time you watch this one, the twist at the end is very clever, but the 2nd time around it's not so shocking and you start to wonder why you couldn't figure it out in the 1st place. The gore level while good, is toned down here compared to most of them, but the needle in the haystack scene makes for some fun and gruesome times. Most of the people prefer this one over Saw III, but I personally think the 3rd one is miles above this sequel.<br/><br/>Performances. Tobin Bell is very effective as Jigsaw once more. His cold eerie stare and his presence are just great. Shawnee Smith displays a great balance of vulnerability and bravery, while being very likable to boot. Donnie Wahlberg does very well, but his character is not very easy to root for. Erik Knudsen plays a likable kid and I actually rooted for him as the Son. Franky G plays one of the most unlikable slime balls I've seen in recent memory, I couldn't stand his selfish antics. Beverley Mitchell is good, but too whiny for my liking. Dina Meyer plays her part well.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Saw II is OK, but not the dandy followup I remembered it to be. It's slick-looking and well done, but it's too selfish for its own good. It's worth a look as an OK time waster, but nothing more in my opinion.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The first Saw was heavily flawed, grotesque in appearance, and very mediocre. To give that movie a four-star (out of 10, mind you) review was hard, as I don't think there was anything to give it higher than one-star. However, compared to Saw II, the first installment was far more entertaining, which is where this one fails.<br/><br/>The only thing I can say about Saw II that is not negative, is that the devices used for killing these morons are actually quite clever and intriguing in design.<br/><br/>Down to the acting; this cast is ridiculous. Donnie Wahlberg's performance as the harsh, detective father is very lame and uninspired -- probably the biggest cliché of the movie. Tobin Bell is okay, but the material he is given is poor. Everyone else can be tossed back on the street for all the yelling they do; that's acting? The characters are terribly written. There's not one person worth rooting for but Wahlberg's, and to show how stupendously moronic these people are, the writer(s) decided to turn this into a movie more about cabin fever, rather than ""let's get out of here, ALIVE"". For example, the Hispanic male goes on a killing spree, hyped-up on the desperation of not dying, but in-turn, what good is he doing himself? Another example would have to be a device disguised as a glass box with two slots where one would insert their hands to retrieve something of desire. Now, one of the protagonists wants this object, for without it she will die. She puts her hands in very nonchalantly only to find that she is caught in it, with razor blades twisting and slicing up her wrists as she desperately tries to escape. Now, no matter how desperate people may get, there's always common sense thrown in somewhere, and none of these people comprehend that working as a team might be a more proficient way of living, rather than aimlessly walking around trying to die a ridiculous death.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's a lot I could argue with anyone about on this movie. There's nothing to like, and to give it a one-star would be a little mean, as I did laugh at how bad it was.<br/><br/>After viewing Saw II, it certainly has done something victorious, and that it is the sequel that has made me stop viewing the rest of the series, as I was hoping there would be improvements made from the last one's flaws... nope.<br/><br/>Skip this and the rest."
"twinmike","4","2","3","19 January 2007"," Too many coincidences
","Spoiler To many coincidences to make the plot work. The movie is actually very silly if you think about it. If you watch the movie simply for the gore it is OK I guess, but if you give it a moments thought it is very poor and full of plot holes and poor continuity. In no particular order; Why would Amanda go into the house with all the other victims? She was in the room with all the others and was likely exposed to the same nerve gas. She likely had already taken an antidote and was not going to die but she could have been killed by one of the others. At the end of the movie Xavier is going to kill Amanda and Daniel. And in an amazing change of character Daniel jumps up and slices is throat very cleanly with a very dull looking hacksaw. Besides being impossible to do with a hacksaw it is too coincidently and crucial to the plot. If Xavier had killed them both or even just her the story is over. If Eric had simply waited 15 more minutes at the end he would have been reunited with his son and then he could have killed jigsaw. It is quite a coincidence that he went with Jigsaw. When he gets to the house where Jigsaw takes him he leaves Jigsaw (serial killer) unattended in the van. Why would he trust jigsaw to stay in the van? Was it jigsaws van or a police van? When Eric finds the person in the bathtub why wouldn't he poke the person with a piece of wood or metal bar. He must have expected a trap when he went into the house (remember Jigsaw lead him to the house). I am guessing that an irate cop would have shot the person in the tub when they quickly lunged out. The person in the tub was facing away, it would have been very easy to simply jump back. <br/><br/>When Jigsaw and Eric run off near the end of the movie why didn't the police follow him? The SWAT team would have had many members outside securing the entire area. It would be impossible anybody to enter or leave the building unnoticed. If the entire SWAT team would have followed him the ending would have been very different.<br/><br/>Less critical to the movie is the clock behind Jigsaw. Watch the time on it throughout the movie. It changes backward and forward and at one point 1.5 hours passes on the video of the victims but only 0.5 hours passes on the clock. Maybe the clock doesn't work or the timer for the victims is off?"

"Tubular_Bell","2","2","3","22 October 2006"," Everything you expect from the movie is there. And NOTHING MORE.
","For beginners, the movie suffers from the Shyamalan syndrome: you KNOW there's going to be a twist at the end, and you KNOW the writers will do their best to make you go ""WOW, I could never tell that was going to happen!"". That's obvious right from the start. So, what's the point? Even if you don't know what the revelation will be, you know it WILL be there, and you know it will be in the exact same The Usual Suspects style - which was already done in the first movie. And what's worse: it looks EXACTLY like on the first movie. Exactly. Even without the less-than-subtle throwbacks to the first movie. The writers were willingly delivering ""more of the same"" to people who wanted it. And there were a lot of them, so who's to blame them? Still, though, the ending isn't the only thing in the movie that matters. The set-up of Saw II is nothing new. For starters, it's Cube - even with the exact number of people (edit: in fact, there's one more person in Saw II, but he dies such a jaw-droppingly contrived death that he isn't even worth mentioning) - but with an over-the-top back story and with idiotic, uninteresting characters. Through the whole movie, I was amazed to see that the characters KNEW what kind of ""puzzles"" they were to expect, and didn't try to out-trick the puzzles even once - and it was possible. The puzzles AND the characters were there merely to provide sick, gratuitous violence and those intense ""psychological"" sequences of people screaming and going nuts. And yes, their actions were calculated down to the millisecond to make the WHOLE plan work, with the maximum amount of violence possible. There's no depth to the story. There's not even any development in the relationship between characters. There's just blood, blood, death and people screaming. And I say, what's the need for a Cube rip-off that takes off its most interesting aspects and replaces it with shallowness aplenty? The Jigsaw back story, well, I could live without it. I don't know the need EITHER for a story about 90-year-old Christopher Walken lookalike with a brain tumour and more than sufficient money and time to build ultra-clever ""games"" which all work flawlessly due to the victims' stupidity and a few plot contrivances. With games and movies like that, I'm thankful we still have Chessmaster. Overall, I'll just stop calling the movie a rip-off of a dozen other movies because it actually looks more like a homage (check the mandatory verbal reference to Last House On The Left); a humble homage; a VERY, VERY humble homage, so it deserves an extra star."
"Falconeer","2","2","3","15 October 2006"," Tacky cash-in sequel ""oh, yes, there will be crap..""
","The original ""Saw"" is a pretty good horror effort, for an American film, (although it can't compare with the stuff coming out of Japan.) It was bloody, but stopped right on the line of going overboard with the violence, which would have cheapened the film. It had a suspenseful story, with some real twists, and finally, a surprising, and satisfying ending. There were only two main characters, and this allowed for some focus on actual character development, and believable story. And so it received attention and praise, as something decent coming out of Hollywood these days is rare indeed. Unfortunately when a horror film is successful in the States, the parade of inferior sequels is inevitable. ""Saw 2"" is no exception. First, lets state the obvious; You cannot make the same film twice and expect the same level of quality entertainment. The film makers here, seemed to want desperately to make a sequel that actually didn't suck. So they decided that they had to top the first one, by making it a hundred times bloodier. Well, they did succeed at that. And the first ""Saw"" ended with a surprise finale, so they tried to think up another shocking last second revelation, to wow audiences. But this time they failed. Because the ending was contrived, and most of us saw it coming a mile away, because we know how the first one worked. And like I said, you can't pull the same trick twice, because we will always want something new, and different. At least when it comes to this type of film. Because films like ""Saw 2"" have nothing else to offer, besides shocks and cheap thrills, and gore. There is not one scene in this film that is stylishly or artistically shot, or even competently shot for that matter. Most of the film looks like a TV cop show, or an MTV video.There is not one interesting character here (with the exception of Jigsaw himself). And this fact really sunk this film. Filled with the most insipid stereotypes imaginable. We have the macho dark-skinned drug dealer, the sexy Spanish-looking bad girl, the white bread 'honkie' who spends her entire time on camera crying with mascara running down her dirty face. We have one of the most ridiculous, one dimensional versions of ""the ex-junkie"" that i have ever seen. We even have the ""token black guy"". It seems like the film makers were trying to make everyone like the film, by including a character that each one of us could relate to individually. I even found myself relating a little to the little juvenile delinquent with the estranged, cold father. Afterwards i realized what manipulative bull it all was. Nothing more than a money making ploy here. The thing that depresses me now, is how much some other people praised this film, some even saying it was better than the first film! Are todays moviegoers that stupid, that easily fooled? We should get one thing straight: Saw 2 is BLOODIER than Saw 1. That does not mean it is better. This film should only appeal to MTV and video game addicts, looking for gore set pieces and nothing else. And I will give credit where it is deserved; There are some good blood scenes here, including one of the most grisly and realistic throat-slashing scenes ever. Don't expect anything more, unless you have extremely low standards, or extremely poor taste in film. I will not be in attendance for the inevitable, (and inevitably stupid) ""Saw 3""."

They had basic bodies for the creation, with interesting aspects, but it was all very ""ooh, look at that! I think i'll puke now!"" instead of in the first.

","It seems that it is written in the Hollywood textbooks that every successful film will eventually spawn a sequel, or even an entire series.<br/><br/>Such is the case for the latest horror franchise best known as ""Saw"", a small, low-budget film which quickly became a highly bankable hit, and inevitably produced a sequel that was promptly released in just a year's time.<br/><br/>Whereas many lamented the amateurish style and performances of the first installment, it nonetheless presented a creative, gritty and tense premise, elements that were sorely lacking from the recent teen-friendly offerings.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this sequel follows the same ideas, but with slightly different implications, and a lot less originality.<br/><br/>This time around, the same villain, the ""Jigsaw"" killer returns, but his victims have grown in numbers, from two people to a group of eight. Cancer-stricken Jigsaw, continues his mission to teach ungrateful people about the meaning of life, and ultimately, about the lack thereof.<br/><br/>The setup for Jigsaw's latest challenge is an abandoned house where his group of ""players"" are held captive. They are an assembly of seemingly random strangers who all have an unknown connection to each other. Meanwhile, air ducts throughout the house, are releasing a lethal nerve toxin, whose effects can be reversed by means of an antidote, an antidote that can be found, but not without first having to explore some elaborate and potentially deadly traps.<br/><br/>Investigating the Jigsaw case, is Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), who soon learns that his wayward son, Daniel, is part of the group of young victims, which throughout, are being guided by Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who managed to survive Jigsaw's first orchestrated reign of terror.<br/><br/>Tobin Bell who portrays Jigsaw, is a lot more prominent this time around, and becomes an identifiable character, rather than just an invisible threat. Yet, the psychological head-games found in the first film, are substituted here, with predictable by-the-numbers carnage and basic horror movie clichés. The film also plays out like a television reality show, where contestants confined in the same living space, must compete against time, and against each other, to claim the final prize, in this case, their own lives.<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings, the film offers up plenty of cutting edge material that is sure to satisfy the hardcore fans of the genre, which is a good thing, since it looks like Jigsaw's legacy will live on for a long time to come."

","We could have seen this one coming for miles before the brown stuff hit the fan. Once the success of SAW was declared, a sequel was already in the makes before the first one had even time to exit theaters, make it into our living rooms, and sort-of scare us with these elaborate machinations Jigsaw has a knack of coming up with.<br/><br/>However, this is not a re-hash of the original. Well, it is, but in a totally different way. Where in the first one, two men chained to a wall, there was this sketchy feel of a plot that could not outlast its 100 minutes of duration, and skipped into some completely implausible grounds, the second one has a tighter plotting, meaner settings, and is actually better than the first because of that.<br/><br/>So we get Jigsaw, also known as John Parker (Tobin Bell), up close, looking quite frail but no less sinister or deadly -- a geriatric Hannibal Lecter. He has his reasons for why he does these things. He also has his eye on a certain detective (Donnie Wahlberg) who has done a couple of Really Bad Things in the past, but now is caught in a tight jam when lo and behold, his son becomes one of several of Jigsaw's newest victims, and may not have much longer to live because seeping in through the vents is the gas sarin, known for its rather impolite use in Japan's subways some years back by members of Aum Shinrikyo.<br/><br/>SAW moves fast and is fast. At less time, it has to in order to set the stage, introduce us to the characters -- many of those who we never get to know past the surface, and one who returns from the first -- and stages this supremely perverse, live video game in which any false move could literally blow an eye (and your brains) out. The camera is as agitated and deft in shifting from the room where Jigsaw is being kept to the computers monitoring these captives in another place, and I loved the opening sequence where one man gets into such a predicament that any form of escape is virtually impossible, particularly because a key piece (pun intended) is lodged behind his eye.<br/><br/>Sadistic and loving every moment of it, SAW doesn't ever go into overdrive or collapse near its end, although with a cast as large as it has, it's only fitting that there be numerous deaths, none of them peaceful and filled with sights of angels and lollipops. SAW 3? Definitely, and due out later this year for your (twisted) view."

","With what they had to work with (budget included), this film should have been directed by David Fincher (Se7en)written by Andrew Kevin Walker (same) with cinematography by Paul Laufer (The Cell). Or even the director, screenwriter, and producer of The Cell. This film takes a fascinating criminal nut-job serial killer flick and turns it into I Know What You Did Last Summer. For crying out loud, it really would have been scarier by bringing mortal fear into the equation rather than distaste for scenes of slow death and dismemberment. This has the flavor of a made-for-TV movie, only I'd have to say those have more interesting crime dramas. If I combined Darkness Falls with a cop show on ABC mixed with a bad reality-TV style show, I'd get Saw II. I only watched it because of the spoof in Scary Movie 4. I think the spoof was better. Twisted Pictures should be replaced by Dark Castle Entertainment. They made House on Haunted Hill in 1999. The characters in Saw 2 did not behave in a natural way when locked together. I can only say the actors I could respect were the cops and the son. Also, they did the female cop's hair so stylishly perfect. I gotta say only Nicole Kidman has hair like that for work. But that lady went on a stake out in style, so it seemed a bit unrealistic she'd have that fancy hair-do to go catch a serial killer."

The film just makes me cringe, and you don't get to know any of the characters locked in the house well at all. The actings fine, the deaths are clever, but it is nowhere up to the standard the first Saw set, you feel somewhat detached from the characters, and this didn't make me feel sympathetic when they died. <br/><br/>John was a wuss, and left plot holes big enough for another Saw movie. All of the dialouge felt a little thin between the two. <br/><br/>Since the audience was so shocked by the first twist, they decided to DOUBLE UP, so they had two 'great' twists that are amazingly obvious from the start.

","""Saw II"" is the perfect epitome of disposable entertainment.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>After months of hard work, Detective Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg) tracks down and apprehends the serial killer Jigsaw, (Tobin Bell) who informs him that his son Daniel, (Erik Knudsen) is trapped along with several other people, Amanda, (Shawnee Smith) Xavier, (Frankie G) Jonas, (Glenn Plummer) Addison, (Emmanuelle Vaugier) Laura, (Beverly Mitchell) and Obi, (Tim Burd) inside a booby trapped house and have a certain amount of time to get out before they all die inside. As they start to wander looking for antidotes, they fall into Jigsaw's traps, despite Amanda's warnings. When they secret to their situation is finally revealed, it increases the desperation and the fight to survive.<br/><br/>The Good News: Wow, what do I say about this one? There wasn't a whole lot to it. The traps this time where much bigger, more involved, and therefore, much better. Several of them were quite inventive as well, including the wonderful opening kill that perfectly sets the tone for the others throughout the movie. We get more gore in this one, which is an improvement over the first one. This one is a bit more of an R than the first one in terms of the violence, which is nice to see. It moves at a lot faster pace than the first one, and the time just disappears, which is the hallmark of good writing. It really does get lost in the moment in the story.<br/><br/>The Bad News: Again, not a whole lot. Not a lot wrong with ti, but nothing wrong either. It's just inside and then nothing.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: I don't quite know how to feel about this one. I wasn't super entertained, but yet wasn't bored either. The perfect kind of film that if you want a harmless hour and a half to go by with nothing too special of a film, this is the perfect choice. Naturally, fans of the first one will eat this one up.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence"

","When I first watched Saw, i liked it. I admit, the storyline was a little slow and the acting quite poor, but entertaining none-the-less. It's dark and dull set increased the suspense until the final twist made me long for the release date of Saw 2.<br/><br/>Now that I've seen Saw 2, I feel that it has not met the standards set by the first Saw. Being from Australia, where the writers of Saw are from, i realised that Americanism has pulled out their nasty big arm, reached across the Pacific, and taken, yet another, Australian idea to cheese up, add some 'D' grade actors, and throw in a horror cliché' for fun. I feel disappointed from the performance of the Saw 2 and i hope Saw 3, which I am however longing to see, will be better.<br/><br/>A cheesy effort 4/10"

","This movie was awfully boring and dumb! I really did like the original Saw movie, well acted, good direction, original murderer mind games and a stunning twist at the end. None of that with SawII! First of all the characters trapped in the house were not interesting at all and secondly terribly dumb. There were the clues, one girl new it was important to follow them but none of the clues were even thought or talked about. Did they even realize they were all together in the same situation? The cops, same thing, boring characters and not really clever. The end was somewhat surprising (however the tape recording thing wasn't new), but will not tempt me to watch a Saw 3..."
"jacobde","Null","2","3","20 March 2006"," Waste of good fake blood
","What a total waste of good fake blood!<br/><br/>'Saw II' may be mildly scary to an 11 year-old, but only because the movie seems to scream: 'Oh my, ain't I scary!' But even to an average 11 year-old, or in fact anyone who has watched an episode of 'The A-team' without having to take cover behind mama's armchair, this movie is indeed as dull as, as another critic already remarked, 'watching a plant grow'. Also, the acting is terrible. The old man with the yellow face doesn't even start to try to act like the terrible bastard he's supposed to portray. He just sits around saying things in a gritty voice. Given a choice between the two of them, Uncle Fester is definitely the more horrifying. The people who are waiting to get snuffed one-by one aren't any more interesting or sympathetic than so many wooden logs waiting to be thrown on a campfire. Nobody could care less what will happen to this boring bunch of stupid losers. The biggest mistake of this movie might be, that it doesn't fulfill its promise to be really gory, bloody or awful. A setting stolen from ""Se7en"", a mysterious, handicapped but naughty, gentleman stolen from ""Hannibal"", the ""Who'll be next"" - issue stolen from something as amusing as ""Scream"" (but of course of much earlier origin)... A terribly clumsy and bad movie like this could have compensated with containing some really blood-churning, horrifying scenes, cheap as that may sound, but no such thing... No, no... Failed; cult-status not reached. Just not worth your ticket or rental fee. A heap of cheap, unexciting crap. No stars for this thing which should have never happened."
"wewelsburg","3","2","3","10 March 2006"," don't waste your time
","Their are two kinds of people who see saw 2: Those horror fans in search for a gripping and compelling story which matches the film's intensity and those who are immature and only see it for gore and shock value, the teenage boy types who think naked chicks and blowing stuff up immediately qualifies for a good movie. Sadly you'll have to be in the second category to enjoy this. <br/><br/>Saw 2 takes off from SAW and very poorly at that. After a boring intro sequence we are introduced to a group of social misfits who have been drugged and put into one of Jigsaw's trap riddled houses. One of the people is the son of a burnt out detective who will stop at nothing to get him back (yawn).<br/><br/>The acting is bad, we don't care about these characters and it quickly becomes an episode of ""survivor"" with trumped up gore. Their is no shock value; the scenario's could never even happen and the director's constant close up shots of traps and screaming victims becomes very predictable. Of course there are twists in this mess but it's like pouring the choicest of sauces onto a cow manure sandwich, the main course still tastes bad.<br/><br/>One of sensible taste doesn't waste time on this rubbish however if you lack an eye for true creativity and are easily satisfied by the instant gratification commercial culture then by all means see it."
"turnipism","Null","2","3","22 February 2006"," It's a Doooooooom House.
","This movie was truly a disappointment. I had expectations. Only because the premise seemed to be a step up from the first one. Alas, this film didn't deliver anything I was looking for. <br/><br/>The concept of Saw and its sequel is a really good concept, but neither film managed to fully realize its potential. The first one had a great creepy design and look, but suffered from hideous overacting and a hard to swallow 'surprise' ending. The sequel didn't improve upon these flaws, but instead found completely new ways to screw up. It didn't have overacting, it went with NO acting. Some people say that the Jigsaw character was an impressive performance the likes of Hannibal Lector, etc. What are they talking about? Talking in a gravely voice and looking hung over doesn't make you a great actor. This guy should have stayed in the shadows and remained a mostly unknown figure of terror and torture. Perhaps that would have added at least a speck of suspense to the film.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with the film is that the eight people trapped in the house are some of the stupidest individuals I've seen on film. The idea of a house filled with deranged booby traps and mechanized torture devices that the 'players' have to work though in order to survive is a cool and fascinating idea. The concept of the Saw movies was to put humans in these puzzling situations where they have to work with the elements around them, and of course each other, to live. I like that. That would make a great movie. And it's also okay if the tension and terror of the games crack a few of the weaker 'players' and gets them killed. It's not a horror film if most characters live through it. But holy cow ... I wasn't ready for how crappy the Jigsaw's games would be, and how dumb the players would play. <br/><br/>The eight people are slowly dying from a nerve gas they're breathing, and Jigsaw has set up a few elaborate puzzles for them to work out (together) in order to acquire antidotes. But the whole film turns into people yelling their stupid heads off and falling for the dumbest traps on earth. And it's not scary in the least. It can't be when it's that predictable. There's an antidote in an incinerator oven in the basement. What will happen if they go get the antidote? Gosh, I wonder. I'm supposed to feel surprised or terrified when the guy who crawls into the psycho's incinerator gets incinerated? The most hilarious thing was when the woman walks into a room and finds the glass box hanging from the ceiling with two holes underneath to reach through and grab the antidote. Simple as pie. You'd think that being someone in her situation, she'd hesitate or even avoid going after something so obviously a trap. But no, Sally No-brains is gonna stick her hand in the box and realize it wont be coming back with an antidote. The best part is that once she got one hand stuck, she put her other hand in the other hole. What on earth!!? I half expected her to find a third hole and jam her head in there.<br/><br/>With people this stupid it's a shame the Jigsaw killer bothered to put any effort into his traps. He could have simply put a sign that read 'Free Escapes' under a huge hammer and watch them get crushed one by one. <br/><br/>All the people in the house had a mysterious connection that, once discovered, would make the games all the more difficult. However, by the time they realized what it was, they were all either dead or insane, making this revelation utterly pointless. As for the ending, I admit it was surprising, but it's so far-fetched it's cancels out it's coolness. The Jigsaw killer is able rely on human weakness and emotion to kill the people in his 'games', but no amount of human unpredictability or the thousands of variables in his game seem to send his plan askew. Everything falls perfectly into place and everyone working against him is killed, tricked, or doomed. Not only is the ending ridiculously absurd and lame, but it also ensures that this franchise will not go away and another sloppy sequel will be right around the corner.<br/><br/>The movie ultimately flushed all it's opportunities for intrigue or terror right down the can. Even the opening scene with the guy in the head-crushing device avoided being suspenseful through hyper-editing with annoying music and sound (which continued throughout the film, I'm sorry to say). Anyone going to this film should be disappointed. If you're looking for the gritty unsettling scenario of the first film, it's not here. If you're looking for gore and shocking deaths, it's also not here. Instead what could have been a huge psychological game of survival was nothing more than a bunch of knobs running around, yelling, and dying much deserved deaths."

","I was quite happy when i saw Saw II coming in the theaters here in Germany this early spring as I'm going to call it. I was surprised and quite astonished by Saw 1, the surprise maybe of all genres last year. So there was no question, I had to go see Saw II<br/><br/>Now for your viewing pleasure, and maybe the ongoing life of your monitor or TFT - thing, i shall not tell you the plot.<br/><br/>So, well the basics: (includes just about as much as cinema commercials include) Cop argues with son, who is in the eyes of the cop on the way to being the number one criminal in the city (the ones who have a father that is on the police force might recall that they tend to see the ones who eats their piece of chicken at dinner to be on the road to be a major criminal) well anyway. So they find a body, the cop merely engages in investigation, easy case, finds jigsaw, game is on. <br/><br/>OK so far. But then it gets tricky, having way more characters than Saw 1, and being just for a moment in the brain of Jigsaw, I would it find greatly troubling to keep track of all the lunatics I'm playing with at the same time, while having a couple of guns pointed at my face. And thats the problem of the movie. It's too thin for its many characters, the viewer is not as connected to the characters as he is in Saw 1. Sometimes somebody says: ""Let's discuss who we are so we might find a way out."" And the answer by another character is:""There is no need for that"" <br/><br/>That just about sums up the entire movie. There is no need for it. And when you do your homework during the movie you will find out what is going on so early that you might have a chance to go out while the movie is still on and actually enjoy the rest of the night."

","This is the story of eight strangers picked to live in a house, have their lives taped, and find out what happens when people stop being polite and start being real.<br/><br/>No, this is not another season of ''The Real World,"" it's the second instalment of ''Saw."" Indeed, a year after the debut of the first movie, ''Saw II"" reunites us with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the cancer patient with the passive-aggressive approach to serial killing (his victims kill one another.) Here he's locked some folks in a big, dank, booby-trapped shelter, where he's left them clues and riddles they must follow and solve in order to survive his medieval tortures. Needless to say, ''Saw II"" is not for the faint of heart. It's for the foolish of wallet.<br/><br/>The victims have something in common, although it takes forever for them to figure out what. They're given two hours. After that, the poison gas that's streaming out the air vents will have corroded their insides. So following instructions is crucial. The first victim disobeys that order about not unlocking a door and promptly has the back of his head blown out.<br/><br/>At one point, the film takes a break from the bloodletting inside the house to give us a police procedural. In the name of reality TV, Jigsaw and the cops watch the action on surveillance monitors. Donnie Wahlberg plays the detective on the case and the estranged father of one of the contestants. He looks tired and mad as hell: Where is his son? But those old-school, rogue-cop methods of his won't get him far with Jigsaw. As one SWAT commando remarks, the detective has ''to start thinking outside the box or his son's gonna be in one."" Word.<br/><br/>This all makes for dreadful movie-going, even on Halloween. It's not that the acting is bad -- except for Dina Meyer, as the other detective, and Frankie G, as one of the most annoying horror victims in the genre's history. It's that there's little fun in watching a girl fish for a key in a pit of hypodermic needles -- even if she used to be a junkie.<br/><br/>The first ''Saw"" offered mounting existential dread: two strangers woke up in a foul washroom and had to hack each other up. It was Jean-Paul Sartre's ''No Exit"" by way of the grind-house. It wasn't good, but it occasionally delivered the visceral terror we want from a horror movie. The sequel sheds both philosophy and suspense.<br/><br/>Darren Lynn Bousman and Leigh Whannell wrote ''Saw II,"" which Bousman directed. They aren't yet 30, and Whannell, who also wrote and acted in the first movie, looks particularly fresh-faced in his publicity photos. Accordingly, his movie is the product of immaturity. It approaches suffering with a meaninglessness that must be a luxury for anyone who has never lost anyone, or is incapable of empathising with someone who has.<br/><br/>So overall, the movie is pretty good and fully matches the old one!"

","This movie is truly disturbing. I think it should have gotten an NC-17 rating.

The disturbing part of this movie is how plausible the plot could be to someone that is not right in the head. All of the traps/games of torture in the movie could be easily reproduced by any nut.<br/><br/>I think it exposes the hypocrisy that Congress would raise such a stink about video game violence, but you hear no complaints about Saw II?

","While investigating the bloody aftermath of a grizzly murder, Detective Eric Matthews has the feeling that it is the work of Jigsaw, the notorious killer who disappeared leaving a trail of bodies behind. Jigsaw is indeed back, but instead of two people locked in a room with only one unthinkable way out, there are eight. Eight strangers, unaware of their connection to each other, forced to play out a game that challenges their wits and puts their lives in jeopardy.<br/><br/>James Wan and Leigh Whannell gave us a sharp and unique film last year, which shocked audiences around the world. It also had over-acting, major plot holes and mediocre pacing. Saw II manages to stay away from everything that was flawed with Saw, although, in doing so, it plays it too safe and loses all the shock that it wanted to give us.<br/><br/>Much like the original, you will find some people in impossible situations, which are unique and great to watch. But Saw 2 tries to take it up a notch by putting more people in this situation, the more people you have the more clichés you need to put in. You get the macho guy, the mysterious guy, the pretty girl, the scared girl, the little kid, the one who knows whats going on, and the token black guy.<br/><br/>Unlike the original, where you actually liked the characters, as annoying or over the top they may have been, here you hate them all. You know that most of them, if not all are going to die in some elaborate death, and this keeps us wanting to see more, just so we can watch them die in Jigsaw's house of horrors. Saw 2 focuses more on booby traps then clues for it's players. Even if there were more clues, the people don't care about them, or the director didn't care enough to enlighten us with them.<br/><br/>With these clues, you would expect the people inside to pull together and try to solve this puzzle, instead they all turn on each other. One guy finds out what the first clue was and goes on a killing rampage. It's pretty much the same formula as the first, which makes this saw rusty and dull. The original had many jaws drop to the floor with it's twist ending, and going into Saw 2, you would expect the same. There is a twist, more then one to be precise, which is probably the best thing in this film. Although it never reaches the high-point of the original.<br/><br/>How can a film that has better acting, not as many plot holes and more on Jigsaw, not be as good you might as yourself. It's basically the overall feel of the movie. I got chills throughout the entire first film, here I got one. Without ruining it, I'll just say that when the lights went on, my eyes were wide open with disbelief.<br/><br/>Donnie Whalberg is much better in this film, then Danny Glover was in the first. In this installment, he actually has a reason to be here. Aside from the creepy Tobin Bell, Whalberg actually gives a good performance.Everyone else in the house just plays their characters they way they were written. Scream on cue, cry here, and die there.<br/><br/>Excluding the house and all it's traps, the film only showcases one other Jigsaw predicament. A man with a bear trap on his face, who must cut out his own eye in order to get the key to unlock the contraption. Very cool, but not like the reverse bear trap on the girl's jaw from the original. Why did I like the first so much, well it was cool seeing all those little trap he put people in. That was missing from this one. The traps inside the house had wre impossible to get out of, the people were doomed and you knew it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Saw 2 does end with a twist that sets up a possible third installment. Hopefully in the next one, the saw is sharper and the traps are more convincing. If I were ever in a situation with Jigsaw, I would listen to him carefully and follow his every step, I even yelled at the detective to do so. Saw 2 doesn't put to rest the ongoing debate of whether or not Dr. Gordon is alive or dead and it shouldn't, it should be up to interpretation.<br/><br/>Saw 2 was quickly written and directed because it wanted to ride the success of the first and it shows. If time was taken and people who first brought it to us were still involved, Saw 2 could have surpassed the original. The script was written before Saw came out and had nothing to do with it. Once Saw became a hit, a few changes were made and it became Saw 2. So when a script is not written directly for the sequel purpose, you know you're in for trouble."
"sma92176","2","2","3","5 November 2005"," This movie totally sucks
","I thought that that the original Saw was thought provoking and intelligent. With Saw2 there was nothing of the merit from the original film. Yes you still have the ""scary"" voice and the methodical killing game style, however, I think that largely the message of the importance of life and living it were almost entirely lost on this film; they turned this sequel into a film revolving on a revenge plot. Gimme a break. If you see this movie, you may think as I did: ""Why did this entire plot need to take place? They could have skipped from A(the background) directly to D(the wrap up shortly before the end). If you want to see something really scary, go rent The Man Behind the Sun and freak out on what real people have done to each other."

I felt like I was watching what will be filmed in 15 years when they eventually remake Saw. 8 people instead of 2. A whole house instead of one room.

There are enough throwbacks to the original film to make this a rewarding viewing experience as opposed to most horror franchises with films written and produced entirely independent of each other.
One thing the first two entries in this franchise did really well was paying attention to the minor plot details. There are a lot of loose ends left in the dark corners of this story that are all resolved satisfactorily by the end.
And this film ends in such a way that I'm genuinely interested and excited to see what comes next. Very well done."

","This is a great follow up to the first saw. This time we have 8 people stuck in a house, filling with nerve gas , they have to get to an antidote within 2 hours or succumb to the nerve gas.<br/><br/>I love the idea of a group of characters trapped instead of one person in a trap, it makes it more realistic to see all of these characters personalities and how they work together to find a solution to why they are there and how they're going to get out. And unlike many other horror movies, there's characters that you care about here, and they are not just there to be killed , they have back story and personalities.<br/><br/>The acting in this sequel is even better than the first, the entire cast, I can't complain about a single actor/ actress, Tobin belk is an amazing actor , he olays this role like he was born for it, so eerie yet quiet philosoohical character, I loved Emmanulle Vaugier's character Addison, Erik Knudsen's Daniel, and Beverly Mitchell was this sort of sweet child-like girl. Unfortunately our characters are killed as they move throughout the house, the traps here are great!! There's 2 that are the best in the film, the needle pit( a giant hole in the floor in one of the rooms filled with thousands of used syringes, yuck!!!) and the Razor box( a box hanging from the ceiling with arm holes that are lined with hidden blades preventing you from pulling them out and cuts deeper the more you try ouch!!. A long drawn out death, bleeding to death) the others are just as brutal and innovative.<br/><br/>Great twist!! Once again just like the first film the twist comes out of nowhere!! You will not guess it! Trust me.<br/><br/>The story is excellent and the films focus is not the brutality or the gore it focuses more on the story although the film is obviously bloodier than the first one.
In the end we are left with only 2 characters that survive, but won't spoil it here.<br/><br/>Check it out if you're a fan of the first one, if you're a newcomer watch the first one first

","Oh wait a minute. If I am supposed to get interested in a story, it's got to make sense, right? I don't mean nit-picking a sci-fi, alternate-universe kind of sense. That is rightly called 'fantasy' and so you can let that slide. I'm talking about things that supposedly could happen to you tomorrow. What makes a film 'work' is if what you are shown has the aura of plausibility, that it could happen to you tomorrow. If it doesn't, then the thrill is gone and instead you're left shaking your head and saying, 'well that's a load of garbage right there.' Unless you are one of those people who doesn't care if things don't make sense, and you somehow convince yourself that illogical rubbish is really gripping theater. LOL more power to you.<br/><br/>Why I rated it a '5': ""Saw II"" follows the continuing adventures of the serial killer named ""Jigsaw."" As it's a sequel I'm going to assume anyone seeing this has already seen the original ""Saw"" and thus no real exposition is necessary here. Instead I will attempt to illustrate some of its major flaws and explain to those who want to give it a '10' that maybe they should reconsider. ""Saw II"" is one of those films that is very intense, and often moves at a breakneck pace so that you barely have time to process what you're seeing. But once you do take a breath and think back about it, some really annoying and nagging questions pop up. A lot of them actually. And you ask yourself ""hmm would I do that if I had the choice? Or would no one do the things shown here?"" And if your answers are ""yeah no one would do that"" guess what? The film sucks.<br/><br/>So let's see...if there was a number tattooed to the back of your head, would you (A) cut off the back of your head to read the number? Would you really? Or would you ask another person to read the number?<br/><br/>Similarly, in trying to obtain the numbers on other people's heads, would you (A) kill them? Or how about just asking for them to turn around briefly so you can read the tattoo?<br/><br/>If someone is going to unlock a door, would you (A) run up to the door and look through the peephole as the other person is unlocking it? Or would you just sort of stand there and wait for the person to open it?<br/><br/>If you are told a key is hidden in a massive pile of syringes, your best chance of finding the key is to..., uh, grab the nearest person to you and throw her into the pile and demand she find it in two minutes? Haha I could go on, you get the point.<br/><br/>Besides these awful character decisions to ponder, there's more. How about figuring out how 6 people were all successfully kidnapped on the same night? No problems, no issues, no one avoided capture. All caught and brought to a certain location in a few hours. One or maybe two people managed to swing that nifty piece of business without any complications, interference, and no one noticing them dragging people to their car. That's pretty darn amazing. And isn't it a bit curious that the mastermind behind this setup just happens to know the smallest and intimate details of all of these random people? When he's not going for cancer treatment that is. Heck he even knows what a cop said to his son when they were out walking around the city. Heck he even knows the cop is dirty but it seems Internal Affairs didn't get the memo. This guy is awesome! (Or, maybe the plot is mind-numbingly far-fetched...) And I guess he's rich or something to have all of his time to devote to his 'games' and pay for the materials. Speaking of, he must also have a degree in mechanical engineering. It's just...so dumb. The more you think about it, the more stupid it gets.<br/><br/>But the best is for last. Now just think for a minute. If you were the victim of a serial killer, but managed to survive your ordeal, wouldn't your first reaction be....'you know, that was great? I enjoyed being traumatized and almost losing my life, and I actually had to kill someone else to preserve mine, this is wonderful. I would like to do this for a career!

","Wan has departed. Bousman enters. Marky Mark Wahlberg sent in his brother. And a tantalising psychological thriller turns into an ""escape room"" fiasco. Audiences lapped up this sequel like a demonic kitten drinking the blood of its victims. Yet a consequence of the growing popularity meant that a repetitive structure for the franchise had just been formulated, and it's not great. A detective is enveloped in a game to which his son is stuck in a house, filled with traps of course, with random strangers. He must confront ""Jigsaw"" to try and save his son before it's too late.<br/><br/>For those of you that wanted gore, devious traps and an expendable cast. Well, happy birthday, because you got them. The intricate design of Kramer's contraptions certainly had me wincing on occasion. Whether it be an individual thrown into a hole filled with dirty syringes or an unsuspecting victim having a bullet penetrate his eye. These devices, ranging from classic booby traps to mechanically engineered contraptions, hold enough credibility and blood-curdling gore to make them interesting.<br/><br/>The story itself, with both Bousman and Whannell writing (dream team they are not!), is functional and greatly explores the antagonistic ""Jigsaw"" killer with plenty of depth, giving Bell the opportunity for a menacing performance. If only he didn't whisper everything, I might've been able to hear him. There's timers, a tormenting musical score and sufficient screaming to gradually ramp up the tension. But when these characters, both the victims and detectives, are so incomprehensibly dumb, it loses all intelligence that the script thinks it has.<br/><br/>Examples. Victims failing to understand the obvious literary purpose of ""numbers in the back of your mind"" throughout the entire film. One stupid victim works it out, and resorts to killing everyone instead of politely asking ""can I have a look at your head?"". He then proceeds to cut a big chunk of skin off instead of asking someone ""hey, how you doing? Can you please have a look at my head for me? Thank you in advance!"". Inept detective doesn't get off lightly either. For someone who knows they shouldn't listen to Kramer, considering how meticulous he is, he essentially does everything a detective shouldn't. ""I can show you where the house is"", really!? Are you telling me you are going to believe him now after two hours! Urgh. This is just the tip of the bloody iceberg. So many stupid character decisions.<br/><br/>Oh, and the acting isn't particularly fantastic either. It's not bad, but the absurd amount of jump cuts and flashy editing (thank you Greutert, once again...) diminishes most scenes with dialogue. Don't forget about the obligatory final plot twist! Not as effective as its predecessor, but functional nonetheless. I should've guessed it, but I was dumb. Much like these characters ey?<br/><br/>Saw II is blunted by the greatness of the original. An involving first half unfortunately crumbles into a messy second half that rapidly identified several plot points that are sure to be repeated in the sequels. It's a trap!"
"TheLittleSongbird","6","1","1","25 November 2017"," The game continues, and just as disturbing if not as puzzling
","Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.<br/><br/>The films as an overall series are a very mixed bag. The original 'Saw' had a great premise and while it was problematic it was still pretty good and one of the best in the series. Its first sequel is one of its few follow-ups to be just as good and contain what made its predecessor click as well as it did and, while it is full of its own problems, it is one of the better sequels by quite some way. It is very easy to see why people will dislike it, and the 'Saw' films in general, and no it is not because of the full throttle horror-like elements that are not for the faint hearted.<br/><br/>'Saw II's' story is just as weak in the dialogue, here quite cheesy, half-baked and repetitive as well as at times rambling and sometimes irrelevant. Actually it's worse, at least the dialogue in the first 'Saw' had some tightness and intrigue, even if they didn't come consistently. The credibility lapses here are just as numerous and just as big, although the character behaviour here doesn't frustrate as much, nothing as bad as that for Danny Glover's character.<br/><br/>Its twists are not as bold and are uneven in execution. Some of them are very clever and devilish, like the apprehending of Jigsaw, didn't see that one coming. Others are plain stupid and pretty predictable. The ending is a let-down, instead of the shocking one of the original this one was hideously contrived. The characters, other than Jigsaw and Eric, are basically cliché-ridden filler and are either bland, irritating or both.<br/><br/>However, really liked that 'Saw II' was visually more elaborate and slicker than the production values of the first with much tighter, more audacious and more professional-looking editing. Even if one does miss somewhat the effectively claustrophobic feel. The music is eerily unsettling.<br/><br/>Despite its ridiculousness, the story is also edge-of-your-seat and highly atmospheric. A lot of it delights and disturbs, with some truly imaginative traps and uncompromisingly brutal demises. The novelty has not worn off yet. The direction is serviceable and once again Jigsaw's modus operandi, impulse and justification sets him apart from most characters of his type.<br/><br/>Saying that Donnie Wahlberg is a huge improvement over Cary Elwes is saying a lot, really not that hard to be better and one would have to be bottom of the barrel SyFy/The Asylum-level to be worse. Tobin Bell is terrifying as one of the most iconic villains of the past twenty years or so (or at least to me). Apart from Franky G the actors don't fare shabbily.<br/><br/>In short, very uneven but for a horror sequel not bad at all. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"davispittman","4","1","1","21 November 2017"," Not too impressive
","Saw II (2005) is of course the sequel to the famous Saw (2004). This sequel didn't really impress me all that much. I'll start with what I didn't really care for in the movie. One of the negatives about the movie is some of the cast members acting ability. Tobin Bell and Donnie Wahlberg both turn in good performances, but to be honest, the other actors just didn't really sell me on their performances or pull me into it the movie more. Another one of the negatives is that the movie as a whole isn't all that interesting. The first Saw movie is undoubtedly the best in the series, and it surpasses this second installment. To be completely honest, if you watch Saw for the traps, then you probably won't like this one, the jigsaw traps aren't that interesting or creative at all. The characters, except for Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and his teenage son, don't have much depth at all, which made me not really care about them very much. The writing is slightly below average. So all in all, Saw II gets a 4/10, just not a very entertaining film. I don't even think fans of the Saw films would enjoy it very much."
"a_chinn","5","1","1","21 June 2017"," Engaging, but lacking the mystery of the original
","Disappointing sequel to the surprisingly quality first film. ""Saw"" had good plotting and a solid mystery, along with a lot of memorably grizzly horror. This sequel instead focuses primarily on the grizzly horror (the pit of dirty drug needles is by far the film's most memorable moment and unsettling) and really doesn't have much of a story outside of how-are-these-people-going-escape-Jigsaw's-deadly-traps? The film does offer one unexpected twist at the end, which led to several more sequels, but for the most part, this film set the formula for the many sequels, which was simply a new set of victims and anew set of overly elaborate traps. That was enough to hold my interest, but it's not really enough to call this a good horror film. Donnie Wahlberg, Beverley Mitchell, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Glenn Plummer, and Dina Meyer provide the solid cast."
"Leofwine_draca","5","1","1","10 December 2016"," A very ordinary kind of sequel
","This is where it all began. Where all what began, you might ask. The film franchise? No, because obviously that began with SAW, the first movie in the franchise. No, SAW II is where the endless sequels to the SAW movies began, each one virtually similar to the last, except that the various traps and torture devices are more extreme and explicit than before. It marked the beginning of the SAW 'Halloween' event, in which cinemas would turn out the latest sequel for 31st October, year after year. Before I sat down to watch this, I was a bit more in the know about it, because I'd already seen 1, 3 and 4, although 2 had slipped me by. It fills in a lot of the gaps and I'd say these movies MUST be watched in the correct order – if not then you have no chance of understanding the intricacies of the plot.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it's fairly by-the-by. It's not as original as the first film, but it's fairly well made and with a good pacing. It doesn't seem to be quite as vicious this time around, although that might be because I'd seen some later sequels before this. The eye-watering opening scene is horrific stuff but has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. In essence, this is a film a bit like CUBE; a bunch of people trapped in one location, trying to figure out the clues and work together to escape, although it doesn't hold together as well as that film. The hunt for antidotes just seems a little laughable and not very well thought out and realism is a long way away. Tobin Bell is still creepy, but a returning Shawnee Smith is simply irritating here while others like STARSHIP TROOPERS's Dina Meyer are on the sidelines; she had more to do in her one scene in SAW III! Donnie Wahlberg lends a bit of gravitas as the weary cop investigating the case but, again, he doesn't have much to work with other than a few shouty scenes.<br/><br/>What of the horror content? Well, there are a couple of nasty deaths – wow, like you didn't guess – including one horrible bit in a glass box with razor blades – and a nasty scene in a pit filled with syringes. There are a few twists, notably towards the climax, which kept me watching. Fans of the series will enjoy it, but newcomers might well find it's more of a makeweight film, purely designed to bridge the gap between the first movie and the later sequels."
"waynethg","3","1","1","10 July 2013"," Somehow, even worse than I expected!
","I ended up watching this cinematic 'classic' because there was literally no other films on TV at the time. I've got to confess that I wasn't expecting too much from it, having seen numerous trailers for this franchise over the years, but I thought that maybe it will surprise me and not be as dire as I feared. However I was badly mistaken! As I didn't find myself really caring if any of the characters lived or died at no point was there any real tension in the movie. This may not have been purely the fault of the cast but possibly a combination of a poor cast, bad director, shocking script. The soundtrack is also terrible and seemingly constant, even when nothing is really happening.<br/><br/>I will give some credit to Franky G who played Xavier Chavez, he gave an excellent audition for Shaun of the Dead 2, by spending most of film wandering around like a zombie with a knife in his hand and a glazed look on his face.<br/><br/>To sum this up, it is a very poor film and a terrible advertisement for modern Hollywood horror. Some teenagers who haven't seen many films yet may like this nonsense but I doubt many others would do. If you value you free time, AVOID!"
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","6","1","1","14 December 2011"," Saw II (2005)
","A surprisingly effective sequel. Keeps much of the atmosphere from the first and just increases the gore and horror aspects. This time a number of people are in a house, one of those being the son of police officer Donnie Wahlberg. Watching Wahlberg and Bell's back and forth is a lot of fun, and adds a stark contrast to the gore. Unfortunately a rather 4th rate cast must carry the film and don't seem up to the task at times. It tries to create a claustrophobic atmosphere, like that of Cube and the first Saw, but characters change dramatically in the blink of an eye. It's too focused on furthering the plot towards its bloody conclusion, rather than having believable relationships. But for those that love gore, with a little bit of character, this certainly delivers."
"gigan-92","4","1","1","8 November 2010"," Oh gee
","F Well, I tried to get the most out of the first Saw film, with its decent plot and unexpected twists. But in the end, mediocrity is, after all, mediocrity. There was little to no tension in this garbage. The believability of it all is at an all time low compared to the last film. The logic is just terrible. The whole story had to deal with these victims having these numbers to their salvation on all places their necks. So, first off, why was the guy motivated to kill everybody? Insanity and desperation; that was the excuse I assume, but still wouldn't it have been a hell of a lot easier to simply ask for the numbers instead of killing them off? It would of token a lot less killing, chasing, and overall effort, not to mention time when it came down to it. The plot hole is so big it's more of a gaping wound dripping with stupidity. <br/><br/>Then a poorly delivered twist; Amanda is his apprentice? Wait, what the f*ck? Okay oh yeah, and I guess the whole moral reasoning behind this is that he wants to teach people the value of life? Let's be realistic here, would I really have found any meaning in all that suffering other than it's a sick world and that I wish I could get my hands on that sadistic bastard?

","The opening scene of SAW II is as compelling and horrifying as anything you will ever see as a human being with pain receptors: A man wakes in a dungeon with an open bear trap locked around his neck, lined with nails. It is on a timer to snap shut on his head, but he is told where the key is to unlock it - surgically implanted behind his eye! A scalpel and a mirror are laid out before him... The question is not what HE would do - but what YOU would.<br/><br/>That's the draw of SAW.<br/><br/>After this grand opening, though, SAW II (co-written by SAW's writer, Leigh Whannell and the director, Darren Lynn Bousman) is on a tricycle downhill. Not all the way, but definitely not keeping pace with its powerful predecessor.<br/><br/>Donnie Wahlberg is emphatic as Matthews, the slightly unethical cop at the center of SAW II, whose son's (Erik Knudsen) life is at stake. His partner though, Dina Meyer, recently graduated top of her overacting classes and brought her Method Of Smug to this production that just made me want to slap her after brutal spinner sex with her.<br/><br/>We feel Matthews's pain and desperation as a father, as he watches his son on a monitor trying to escape a house of traps with six other strangers (Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Beverly Mitchell, Tim Burd, Shawnee Smith); they got every ""type"" in there - it's TWELVE ANGRY MEN meets the passengers on the bus in SPEED.<br/><br/>Except for Shawnee Smith (reprising her role from SAW), the trapped characters are staples from the Clichéd Character Handbook - the beefy guy, the slut, the businessman, the bum, the token black guy; each supplied with Nifty Exposition Dialog, with all gaps in backstory filled in by Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), his Exposition Monologue Handbook open on his wheelchaired lap.<br/><br/>""I want to play a game..."" But the game is not as compelling as that which Jigsaw played in SAW. The people traps are not as insidious or as smart as those in the last movie. Therefore, the gore seems more gratuitous, rather than organic. And someone should probably do a psych evaluation on Australian writer, Leigh Whannell - to say this guy's imagination is morbid is a nice way of saying he's a latent maniacal serial killer...<br/><br/>The story itself is loaded with twists and reveals and surprises that keep ramping up the stakes, twisting the barbed wire tighter around your chest, all filmed in that sickly green hue that makes you think you just vomited.<br/><br/>The original SAW had a reveal at the end that rivaled Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE for ground-shaking impact: We never saw Jigsaw coming. In SAW II, there can be no such surprise quotient any more - even though Jigsaw is menacing and ominous and intellectually superior - so they try hard for a shocking reveal, but it is forced.<br/><br/>Of course, with the SAW series, the title would mean nought if we didn't get some juicy self-mutilation for the sake of escape, rather than the sake of being a supermodel.<br/><br/>Towards the end, there is a nice little wink to fans of the original SAW.

"stewiefan201","3","1","1","6 March 2008"," Saw II is sloppy and completely devoid of logic.
","Saw II is the sequel to the hit original. It is about the depressed Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is slowly losing his son Daniel (Erik Knudsen). Daniel has been getting into trouble lately, and after Eric yells at him he disappears. Soon after Eric and his SWAT team luckily pinpoint the whereabouts of the Jigsaw killer, locating him in an abandoned warehouse he has turned into his lair for his grisly doings. However Eric and his team cannot move Jigsaw (real name John Kramer) to prison since he is hooked up to medical equipment helping him to survive his cancer. Eric then learns that John has taken his son and 7 other criminals and locked them in a building with lots of hallways and secret passages. One of these people is Amanda (Shawnee Smith) who survived one of Jigsaw's past games. The eight people are told they have two hours to find the combination to a safe before a deadly nerve gas seeping through the air vents kills them. However this building is filled to the brim with booby traps and other traps that these people must put themselves through in order to keep moving along. Meanwhile Eric is told by John that all he has to do is talk to him for the 2 hours, and his son will turn up safely. But as time winds down Eric and all eight people locked away grow desperate, and begin resorting to extreme measures.<br/><br/>Saw II really didn't have big shoes to fill. The first movie wasn't really that great so this sequel could have easily surpassed it. But no this movie is far worse, and even more unrealistic and farfetch'd than the original. Saw II presents to us a storyline that is simply not possible unless Jigsaw has access to military nerve gas. The twists are all implausible and all in all pretty random at times. This movie raises the gore level by a long shot, with traps and games that are pretty hard to stomach at times. One trap a few people I know couldn't handle was when one character gets shoved into a pit full of pointy needles, and has to dig through them. These scenes are actually kind of creative while the rest of the movie is not.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are secondary, or maybe third, to the blood and gore and twists. A few of the criminals in the building are less than paper thin in development, they're string hair thin. One woman who I can't remember her name is played by Beverley Mitchell (That's right from 7th Heaven), and she basically sits in a corner, cries, and has seizures...that's it. Also when we first get introduced to these eight people Amanda finds a key that says not to use it to open the only door out of the room. One guy takes it anyway and opens the door while looking through the peep hole, and guess what he gets shot through the eye and dies after the first 2 or 3 minutes. I thought to myself Jigsaw must be psychic if he knew someone would look through the peep hole while opening the door. Also wouldn't the character have seen the gun through the hole, I think that'd be a sign not to open it. One character Xavier (Franky G) is the most interesting criminal who turns out to be a vicious psychopath determined to do whatever he can to get out of the building before death.<br/><br/>As for John and Eric, their characters are a little better. Tobin Bell plays the part really well and gave me reason to continue on with the movie. A little of John's back story is given, which is quite interesting, but there's not nearly enough. The next few sequels explain more about him but I would rather the filmmakers have just wrapped it up with Saw II, at least the movie would be more watchable. But of course any series that makes big money equals a franchise. Now for the character of Eric Matthews who is a depressed work-aholic and alcoholic. Detective Matthews is well acted by Donnie Wahlberg, who surprisingly turns out far superior to Danny Glover in the first Saw. His character is developed but really turns out kind of one dimensional, he is basically just an angry self-centered jerk and that's about it.<br/><br/>The traps in Saw II are plenty and are sure to attract gore lovers. Some of it like I said is hard to watch since it's so utterly gruesome, but what do you expect it is named Saw II. While some of the traps are creative and actually have some kind of symbolism behind them, they are very farfetch'd and some are just put in to up the anty in the gore department. All the traps and twists are far too perfectly designed and would require everything to fall exactly into place the way Jigsaw planned it. But as I'm watching Saw II there is a scene where the criminals are trying to get through a steel door with an electronic password, and I'm wondering how Jigsaw gets his hands on all these materials. Everything is far too implausible and the traps contain far too much detail and perfection. For a man with cancer John simply would not be able to pull all this off. Every twist or plot shift works entirely to the effect of the movie, and it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Saw II is full of blood and guts, but shorts out on the intriguing plot of the first. Everything that happens here is impossible and way devoid of logic and reality. However this sequel also seems sloppy since the filmmakers rushed to get it out to theaters only one year after the first Saw was released. They should have taken their time. I give Saw II a 1 out of 4."

","A first I was intrigued at what I saw in Saw. I like those movies where each moment is a jaw dropper. Saw showed its A game in the first movie. With gore and blood, it had numerous scenes where you could not bear to see anyone in that pain. This is what made the movie so good. However in the second movie, I was disappointed by the fact that the gruesome scenes were not as impressive as to the first movie. I highly recommend that you stop watching Saw movies after the first one. They just keep getting worse and worse. Not only is it not scary, but throughout the movie it leads you into believing that something exciting was going to happen, but it never does all you see is a little bit of blood here and there but that's about it. So do yourself a favor and save your money."

"revival05","3","1","1","31 May 2007"," Insanely stupid
","The ""torture porn"" horror films of the latest decade, leave me (a lifetime horror buff) divided. One the one hand, it's nice that young filmmakers who've grown up with good old hardcore horror films from the 70's and 80's, such as EVIL DEAD and Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, get to make films in that vein after a 90's of slasher-yawners. But also, new and fresh films have to feel fresh and new. Films like THE DESCEND and HOSTEL - for instance - are stealing the ideas, rather than just letting them be elegant homage elements. Another strange thing is that these filmmakers seem to have bought the hype that throughout the years have grown in the following of these cult classics. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre simply had a point and an idea, and wasn't nearly as gruesome as the scandalously bad 2003 remake.<br/><br/>The SAW franchise is probably the most popular example of torture porn, and in the second film the concept reaches a peak: This really is a porno film. The gore comes off in violence and not sex, but it follows the rules of a porno, first and foremost: Don't mind the story. I was no big fan of the first Saw. I liked the first 20 minutes, but the cop story was laughably amateur (the script was obviously written by two kids who desperately wanted to be cops, but had nothing but their juvenile imagination to go on) and the ending was disturbing...ly crappy. So it's safe to say, I didn't expect much from SAW II. But come on, I didn't expect it to be surpassed by SCARY MOVIE 4.<br/><br/>This film is money-hungry crap. Everything (I mean EVERYTHING) that happens in this film is either totally unlikely, or at best merely questionable when it comes to realism. The ""Jigsaw"" killer, the actual hero of these films (the only one who succeeds in them, anyway), is in this one brought out in broad daylight - and turns out to be this gray old Hannibal Lecter wannabe. The idea, I guess, is that his intellectual cool will be scary but honestly, this guy is full of it! In comparison, Hannibal Lecter was frightening due to the logic in his reasoning. This guy have no real arguments for doing what he does, the ones presented are incoherent and stupid, and comes off like a phony character without substance, only done for cheap scares. Meanwhile, the kids in the house make one unlikely move after another, and make sure to do their best to become butchered. The film is unlikely, therefore impossible to be engaged in - it's just a bunch of so-so actors running around killing each other off, following an insanely stupid screenplay. The reasoning must have been: Who cares about logic, if people simply want their money's worth in blood?<br/><br/>This is a film so geekily eager to chop up ""chock""-violence, it never takes the time to even try to be a good film. It is sad and it is pathetic. Oh yes, there will be blood - just don't expect ANYTHING else.<br/><br/>PS.<br/><br/>About the guys imagining cop life while writing the screenplay, the same goes in Saw II for SWAT-teams. This is the kind of film where a SWAT-unit sees an elaborate trap and, without one moment of afterthought, walk right into it. Just one of many laughable examples."

Saw was good as it was well thought out and shocked me at the end. However Saw II was the same all the way through.

Donnie Wahlberg however, plays Detective Eric Matthews With a realism that is a reflection of the British Police (Well Meaning and willing to do anything to get their man or woman for that matter) Shawnee smith is great as the female protagonist because you know she isn't like the others due to the fact that she tries to protect Daniel Matthews (Eric Knudsen) One of the best things about this film is the creativity in the death traps. They are a lot more creative than the original however,the way the traps are laid out within the film give me an impression that the director wanted to create an action flick instead of a horror. <br/><br/>In conclusion, ""SAW 2"" is a sequel not to be taken seriously because if you are expecting a horror film you will be disappointed"

","Title: Saw II (2005) <br/><br/>Director: Darren Lyn Bousman <br/><br/>Cast: Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell <br/><br/>Review: <br/><br/>There was no doubt on anyones mind that this sequel would get made after the first SAW film became such a huge success. The people liked something...lets give them more of what they liked! And with more blood, more effects, more actors! And sadly, less suspense and a dumbed down plot! Yeah that will bring them in! <br/><br/>The story for SAW II isn't to hard to summarize. First off the killer known as the Jigsaw, has captured and kidnapped a group of strangers and placed them in a house filled with death traps. Together they must follow the rules of his game if they want to survive. The police commence their investigation to try and save them.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that this movie is a clone of the first one. Its basically the first movie step by step, everything that you liked from the first one is done here again. Only thing is that since this time you already know whats coming, well there's no real surprise to anything. The Jigsaw traps his victims, places them in an elaborate death traps and he sits back and watches them kill themselves while trying to escape. So there's no novelty in its premise. That jolt you got when you saw the first one, where you didn't know what was going on or what was going to happen next just doesn't happen this time around.<br/><br/>But putting aside the fact that this movie sacrificed its freshness to the altar of sequels, there is some fun to be had with this flick. The only redeeming quality for me in this flick where the kills. I knew the people where going to die at some point, I just wanted to see HOW. And for the most part, the deaths were cool. Not as gory as expected and kind of tame, but cool. Id definitely say that with the exception of the first death with the ""venus flytrap"" mask, the rest of the deaths in the movie are very mild in comparison to the gruesomeness of the first film.<br/><br/>Now, onto what I didn't like about this film. First off, the characters were the dumbest most unreliable characters I've seen in quite some time! The jigsaw killer left them with some very obvious clues which the chose to completely ignore for most of the movie...right until the last part! I'm like Hello! wake up he left you idiots plenty of clues! But no, we have to stretch the movie so lets let them be idiots for most of the film. I didn't like that. It just felt like an excuse to stretch the running time of the film.<br/><br/>They would fall into the traps so easily...and in one instant when they throw a girl into a pit of needles to look for a key that the killer has placed in it, she starts to savagely look through the needles getting hurt in the process, I found this act to be so dumb! She didn't have to look through the needles like that! She could have done it more carefully so she wouldn't hurt herself, but no, these characters are idiots. And then after all the hoopla has happened you realized she could have gotten out of the pit if she wanted to. It was only like two feet high or something.<br/><br/>Then there's the premise. I loved the idea of the first movie involving only two people for a grand majority of its running time. It was just this intense plot with just two people inside of a room. Now in comes the sequel, and of course this translates to more budget and everything having to be bigger, so what do they do? The have a house full of people ready to die. I personally thought it was more tense with just the two guys in the first film.<br/><br/>As it is, with this film, I got some really strong CUBE flashbacks. Think about it, a bunch of people in a claustrophobic environment, they switch from one room to the next searching for clues on how to get out...and in every room a different form of death awaits them. And just like in Cube, the real conflict comes from all the different personalities just clashing with each other, and of course one of the characters has to be this real asshole that becomes deadly dangerous to the group, just like the Cube films.<br/><br/>The plot was really dumbed down in my opinion. It didn't have the edge that the first film had, it didn't have the element of surprise that the first one had, and the characters were dumb as hell. The only saving grace for this movie in my opinion was the ending and how the film connected with the first. Thats the only really cool thing about it. The rest was just dumb and repetitive.<br/><br/>Rating: 2 out of 5"

","Like its predecessor, Saw II proves that not only is there a market for hardcore, adult-oriented material, Hollywood is only hurting itself by ignoring the fact. Made for a mere estimated four million dollars, Saw II has already given a RoboCop-like return to the tune of eighty million, and it is only just coming to the home video market. To call this a spit in the face of the Everything Must Be Suitable For Four Year Olds mentality that is making Hollywood painful is like calling a nuclear missile a subtle expression of disdain. But I am getting ahead of myself here. All the box office data in the world does not mean a thing without the answer to an exceedingly simple question. Namely, is the film any good? Does it keep one interested during its running length? The answer to these questions, in spite of a few artistic decisions I am not sure I agree with, is a big yes. Everything that the horror film industry got wrong in the late 1980s or early 1990s, Saw II gets right. The film gets them very right, as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>Saw II has a similar plot to its predecessor, but with some important differences. The scope of the story is broader, the cast is larger, and the game is more complex. Where the original revolved around two men chained to the piping in a disused bathroom, this sequel gives us a small group of very confused characters who all have unsavoury histories. In Repo Man, we are told by Agent Rodgersz that no one is innocent. Darren Lynn Bousman and Leigh Whannell must have been paying attention during this shot, because the only character in their script for Saw II that comes remotely close to appearing innocent is Daniel, the son of the detective portrayed with a great fury by Donnie Wahlberg. As Daniel attempts to survive by psychologically manipulating his peers, Wahlberg's Eric Matthews tries to coerce Jigsaw into being a little less exceedingly obvious. Tobin Bell once again gives us a stunning portrayal of a madman who just wants people to appreciate what they take for granted. He survives the comparison to classic film villains such as Darth Vader brilliantly.<br/><br/>Obviously, when the budget on your film is this small, you are not going to have elaborate special effects or amazing feats of action. The real kicker in Saw II, like its predecessor, is in the fiendish traps and puzzles designed by the production team. It is impossible to describe these traps to someone who has not seen their kind before. It is also impossible to explain exactly what Jigsaw is doing without giving away the plot. Suffice to say that Jigsaw is extremely literal. As one reviewer has pointed out, one of the trademarks of the old 1980s serial killer characters that devolved in annoyances with the progression of sequels is that everything must be complicated beyond belief. When Jigsaw speaks, it makes the film exceptionally enjoyable to bear in mind that he is never lying or elaborating. It is the people he speaks to who defeat themselves by assuming complication and deception where none exists. We should be able to say this kind of dialogue and plotting is not unique, but in a manner of speaking, it is. But as I indicated earlier, this is by no means the only way in which the Saw films set an example others should follow.<br/><br/>I have but one complaint about Saw II. Where its predecessor was a tad overlong at a hundred minutes, Saw II feels too short. Yes, it is well-paced and holds the viewer's interest for its entire running time, but in expanding the cast, Saw II presents a few too many characters in too little time. Some of the deaths are just too brief, and some characters could have done with a little more background. The upside to this is that in contrast to some films that are short and yet feel too long, Saw II leaves the viewer waiting for more. If every film that ran for ninety-three minutes could say the same, Hollywood and its product might just be experiencing a little less consumer hostility. While I cannot say anything about the ending for fear of spoiling the surprise, I will say that the performances of Shawnee Smith and Donnie Wahlberg will leave this scene echoing in the viewer's memory long after the credits roll. Tobin Bell also gets in a few cracking lines, but this truly is Smith's and Wahlberg's show, through and through. Both deserve far more work than they have received of late.<br/><br/>I gave Saw II a nine out of ten. It is not the kind of life-affirming experience that I found X-Men 2 or Eegah to be, but it does give one hope for the future of film. See it with a friend, or with someone who likes to do something with their brain while they wear their eyes down. You will both be glad you did."

","OK, I didn't see the original movie, so I guess that's why I don't like this one. It was not clever, I was onto them as soon as they said ""the answer was in the back of their head"". I must admit the part where the drug dealer threw that girl into that tub was very raw doggish. But other than that, this movie had no sense of suspense, you basically knew the little boy was going to live, and that his dad was the one, who connected them all together. Very Predictable. Not enough gore. There weren't any scenes that really made the audience jump. Just an all around let down, in terms of a horror movie. I think that horror movies in general have lost their way, and this movie is a classic example of that. This movie was more of a joke than Scream 3."

They're all just stupid who always do exactly what Jigsaw anticipated, although there are so many other possibilities. Sure, they're scared and under a lot of stress, but absolutely nobody seemed to make any good moves - even guinea pigs would've been able to come up with something. The characters in Saw 2 are all like ""okay, I know this place is full of booby traps, but I'll run around and touch everything dodgy-looking anyway and see what happens!"".<br/><br/>And the detective... he should've known not to play with Jigsaw right at the start.

","I went to the cinema preparing myself for a fantastically gory, chilling and generally nightmarish film. My verdict, Overrated. This film lacks something that the original ""Saw"" contained and although has a fantastic storyline, it has very poor acting and editing which removes the overall tension in the film. By the end of the film I was so uninterested that I decided to see how many M&M's I could fit into my mouth at one time. This film is not worth the money you pay at the cinema's. If you are a hardcore horror film enthusiast you will marvel at the goriness of the film but cringe at the unrealistic and unconvincing acting put on show by the average cast which includes the terrible Donnie Wahlberg who's one facial expression made me think that I could do a better job.

","Writing, filming and producing a sequel to a film that is a surprise hit is always difficult. Doing it in under one year is even more challenging. Making it as good as the first film and in some ways better is nearly impossible, and I am pleased to say it was done.<br/><br/>The script is fully capable of carrying itself without brilliant acting. At times the acting seemed contrived and almost forced, with obvious exceptions from Tobin Bell and occasionally Shawnee Smith. It seemed to in many ways prove David Mamet right when he said that the actors job is to just say the lines and the script, if it is good, will tell the story itself. It does. Lacking the complete element of surprise of the first film the writers of this script, while maintaining the conventions of the previous movie, do an excellent job of adding in twists and will keep you guessing on your first run through it.<br/><br/>Tobin Bell is the one actor I appreciated in this movie and I may also be able to attribute much of that to the character he plays. On the whole the majority of the acting in this movie seemed to be at just above the level of a decent Haunted House tour. Not a good tour, a decent one. However the spectacle of gore and blood and the myriad of ways available for the characters to hurt, maim and kill each other will keep your mind off their performances and on keeping your popcorn down. It delivers everything and more that you can come to expect from this franchise.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first movie then you will not be disappointed with this one. You may even become giddy. If you did not enjoy the first one you will not enjoy the second one. Well, you might if the first one was just ruined for you and that took you out of it.

","SAW from 2004 is one of the scariest films to come along in quite a while. It isn't surprising that since it was a small film and was such a hit, a sequel would be inevitable. Unfortunately Saw 2 is awful: this film is so bad I almost wish Saw 1 had never been made. The story follows the further exploits of Jigsaw, a terminal cancer patient turned serial killer. Jigsaw's existence and motives were part of the reason that Saw 1 was kind of hokey, but at least that film had characters I cared about and it was scary. There is absolutely no one in this film that I cared for, and this film is merely disgusting and cruel AND NOT SCARY IN ONE SCENE. There could have been scares later on, but I turned this film off at the 50 minute mark, taking cue from the late Redd Foxx.

","This is an immature and decidedly teenage thriller movie. Unfortunately, the violence in this movie gets in the way of the potential horror of the script. The premise contains enough material to construct a half-way decent horror film, (as did the very similar ""Cube""), however, it cannot resist temptation, and indulges itself continuously with low-end graphic-novel style violence.<br/><br/>Sure, the odd hack/stab/bullet/club is effective, but, with so many identical and self-referential films in this failing genre, each action halves the effect of the next. What impact does the first bullet have, say, after watching 60+mins of additional violence? Very little. It is it's own worst enemy.<br/><br/>By the way, notice how for the length of the entire movie the swirling, ""tortured"", rubbishy atmospheric soundtrack? This just further undermines any potential long-term horror as it consistently blending every scene into the next - every scene is equal. I've never seen a movie with so much violence and gore lack so much power.<br/><br/>Thankfully the cinema I went to shows these films at a reduced price, so I'm too upset about this hunk of trash. Not scary, not suspenseful, not funny, not reasonable, but (thank God) not too long."

","Very disappointing ""sequel"" but it was expected if you have a new director and a new writer; First this director fail to recreate the same darkish, tense atmosphere.

That's called Fraud!!.<br/><br/>And the more pathetic is that the movie made no sense with the original, in ""Saw 1"" the ""sick games"" were supposed to be ""winnable"" if the player was willing to play and take the pain; in this poor sequel most of the games are ""unwinnable"" they are designed to kill the players no matter what they do. They never get a chance to win!! This is a revenge movie, not a ""Saw"" movie. In the original ""Saw"" the logic was: Take the pain and survive (and learn to appreciate life) Or give-up and die in pain.<br/><br/>In ""Saw 2"" you don't see any of that, just a bunch of people being killed one by one; they are not given real chances to survive. They are not playing, they are being hunted.<br/><br/>Instead of trying to cheat the public the producers should have put a different title to this piece of junk.<br/><br/>The next time you go to see a ""Sequel"" make sure it's done by the same writer and director of the original."

","Jigsaw is back and this time he has 8 people locked in a house full of traps and only a few hours to live and it's up to Detective Matthews to save them as one of the unlucky 8 people is his son.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the first Saw it was brilliant and very original and I'll be the first to admit that when I heard that a sequel was being prepped to be released only one year after the original I thought that it was gonna be bad but gladly I was wrong. SAW II was a relentless, enthusiastically directed and twisted little gem. Just like any other good film, this continuation had a powerful weapon in its holster, one that Hollywood so often forgets to bring to the table when creating their ""products"" and that's a strong screenplay. The bases were mostly covered in that department with riveting chain of events, a clever puzzle like nature when it came to its mind toying mystery, some heart (the Matthews ordeal) and a near flawless juggling act in terms of the two main plot lines which were steamrolled forward simultaneously. To make matters much better. Now being that this is a sequel, some of what made the original special was lost in the name of not fully repeating the first film while new goodies were gained. I particularly loved the ""Hannibal Lecter/Clarice"" like mental warfare Jigsaw and Matthews shared. It made for a compelling listen/watch, was the soul of the film while acting as an interesting contrast to the more action oriented ""in the house"" shenanigans. The further exploration of my fave Bath Robe wearing killer's psyche worked really well! Although I craved more info (I still don't know why Jigsaw is so freaking nuts!), the added insight was appreciated and went to prove me wrong. Knowing more about the lad didn't make him less scary. I think I fear him more now! Donnie Wahlberg (Det. Matthews) played it smart; he underplayed it while displaying an endearing mix of toughness and vulnerability. Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) was very much focused and controlled as Jigsaw Dina Meyer (Kerry) did what she had to do adequately most of the time, although I didn't buy a couple of her ""reaction shots"" and wished she'd do more than stare at PC screens. Shawnee Smith (Amanda) was bang on in her role; selling it to the max. I'm so happy they brought her back and gave her more to do.<br/><br/>All in all I really enjoyed this movie much better than the first."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","3","6","6 June 2006"," Perhaps disappointing when compared to the first but as a genre movie it's still one of the very best.
","""Saw"" was one of the most surprising movies of this decade. How would they ever have been able to top that very first surprising success. ""Saw"" was a fresh and surprising horror-flick that was different and more direct than any other movie from the same genre. It would been a real achievement if ""Saw II"" would had become a better movie than its predecessor. ""Saw II"" isn't a better movie but it still has plenty of originals and great to offer.<br/><br/>There are several reasons why ""Saw II"" isn't as good as ""Saw"". First and foremost; the originality is gone and people already know sort of what to expect while watching this movie. Also the story and settings are a few other reasons. A whole house as playground this time, simply isn't as claustrophobic and psychological strong, as just one small dirty room, like in the first movie was the case. ""Saw"" mostly was a psychological horror movie in which you never knew what to expect and what actions the main characters would take. ""Saw II"" is for most part lacking this psychological horror element in the story. In ""Saw II"" there also are multiple characters who unwillingly participate in Jigsaw's games. Having multiple characters, yet again, isn't as scary and claustrophobic as just having two characters who are trying to find a way out of their positions. It also is harder to identify yourself with any of the characters. Also Jigsaw himself plays a far more prominent role in the movie this time. He has lots of screen time with as a result that he perhaps loses some of his mystery and therefor also some of his scariness.<br/><br/>But if you have to judge this movie for what it is you have to conclude that it still is a powerful, gory, well made horror movie that is better than lets say 90% of other recent horror flicks. ""Saw II"" is mostly original in its games and settings and you never really know what to expect or who will be the next one to die. Although, when you have seen ""Saw"" you already know sort of what to expect and you know that the movie will end with a 'surprise' ending and in the movie itself nothing is what it seems at first sight. The 'surprise' ending isn't as good and powerful as in ""Saw"" was the case and perhaps it even is a bit too far fetched but it still leaves the door open for plenty of sequels, which is a good thing.<br/><br/>""Saw II"" mostly relies on its gory moments and yes it has some original constructed and executed moments in the movie. Some things come as a real surprise and therefor ""Saw II"" still is a great mysterious and scary horror movie. It's an original genre movie that without doubt will surely please the fans.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are pretty shallow but I some how think this was intentional to still maintain a sort of mysterious atmosphere and feeling. Donnie Wahlberg is a welcome addition to the Saw franchise and he does play a pretty good role. Jigsaw still is a scary enough villain, mainly thanks to Tobin Bell, who portrays him, who simply is a very good actor that perfectly knows how to play his character.<br/><br/>Overall ""Saw II"" is a good looking and well made horror movie that is unique in its genre and has plenty of originals to offer to shock its viewers, as long as they can get over it that this movie will become nowhere as good as its successful predecessor.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The acting is bad enough but who really has outdone himself is the editor of this movie who puzzles together the wildly hand-shaken parts without any feeling for rhythm or atmosphere at all. It's really a pain to watch bad movies like this, because their makers do real annoying pseudo-hip stuff to hide the fact that they have no talent for this sort of thing ( making horror work). It's good to see that the ""new wave"" of horror movies is trying to keep a straight face like in the good old days but while watching ""Saw II"" you can learn why there were so many ""comic"" slashers and monsterflics through the 90ies.

So obviously Shawnee was in there to make sure no harm came to the kid. Think it's pretty obvious that she almost got killed so what would have happened if she had have died? The kid would have died too, which means that even if the cop 'played by the rules' the risk is there that the kid still would have died which means that Jigsaw would have failed his own game, and what? He has to then push a key behind his eye so he can get himself out of the deathmask he has managed to get himself in to? I'm sorry, but if you make a film with rules, everyone has to play by them, otherwise the rules (like this film) become completely redundant.<br/><br/>Lastly, the film cheated, it didn't just hide the 'twist', it specifically delivered the VIEWER information which made it impossible for the twist to become apparent or guessable. When Shawnee first wakes up, she grabs the back of her head like she's in the deathmask again (thats how I knew who she was), like it's a memory. Considering none of the people in the room with her would have a clue about who she was, and she already knows that she's OK, for what reason does she grab the back of her head? To show us that she's as much a victim as all the others in there.... But she wasn't was she? No.<br/><br/>The film cheated and therefore becomes nothing more than fodder to sit alongside other ridiculous films like CABIN FEVER.<br/><br/>I may not get these 90 minutes of my life back, but you know, I don't care, cause I'm going to spend a lot longer trashing this film, as it should be trashed.<br/><br/>Pathetic effort right across the board. The ONLY thing i liked about this film...: Oh yes, there will be blood."

","This movie reminds me of another idiotic plot: Identity (2003). A group of people locked together bound by something in common! How original! To make things worse, we keep going back and forth in between the Jigsaw ""lair"" and the trap where the unfortunate people are in. The attempts of plot twists are so unlikely to happen, the sequel tries to give you details about who Jigsaw really is and I really don't think this was interesting at all. Unfortunately, I can see this coming as being a cheap horror franchise as it happened with the Friday the 13th films - I mean, I think we can expect the sequels to be worse and worse until no one will take it seriously anymore (Jason X - anyone?). I really liked the first Saw movie, but this one, in my humble opinion is a capital L Loser!

","Saw II was one of the few movies I was actually looking forward to seeing this year, and I have to say that I was quite disappointed. Not only was this movie more predictable than the first, but the psychological aspects were dulled down and almost drowned out by needless gore.<br/><br/>This movie is lacking the key elements that made it's predecessor so great: a fresh and original story, well-developed -likable- characters, and a crazy plot twist that you won't see coming. Instead, Saw II features the opposite: an unexcitingly dry story, more than a few too many under-developed characters that make it almost unbearable to watch the story (with Xavier striking a surprising resemblance to Quentin from Cube), and ""plot twists"" that are too predictable and boring to deserve the title.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure if the faults found in this sequel originate from Bousman's ""The Desperate"" (the movie Saw II was built around) but it sure would be a place to start. The movie begins it's head-first plunge downhill after the opening scene, and ends much lower than a true Saw fan would expect.

"dbborroughs","3","3","6","12 November 2005"," Jigsaw is back and so is the nastiness in a not very good sequel
","Jigsaw, the crazed killer from the first Saw is back. Here he's locked up a group of people and told them they have two hours to get out of the house before the nerve gas he's pumping in will kill them. Meanwhile a cop has captured the killer and learns that one of the people trapped in the house is his son.<br/><br/>As illogical and mean the first film was it had a certain something that made you want to watch to the end. You had real characters and real twists that kept you glued to your seat. Unfortunately here only the meanness and illogic remains.<br/><br/>I need more than just the prospect of nasty things happening to make a movie. Saw 2's horror does not arise from anything other than waiting to see what the next gory event is going to be. Its a step up and over from the slasher films of the early 1980's where you were more interested in how people died than who the characters were. Here the interest is how are the elaborate traps going to kill the next victim. Yes it creates tension, but on some level it becomes nothing more than catalog of mans cruelty to man.<br/><br/>Saw 2 also has other problems that I can not get past (Spoilers a head) how does Jigsaw have the time to build these huge death traps? This is especially curious owing to his condition. I had the same question about the first film but the plot moved along at such a clip I didn't have time to think. Here there is time and it made me crazy. How does Jigsaw know so much? He knows so much about everyone and he has access to files and info that he would have no reasonable way of getting. Again how does he have the time and strength to gather all of this material? I won't go into the behavior of the cops, the means of his rounding up all of the victims. Obviously you can't think about these things or the film will collapse.<br/><br/>I can't really recommend this film, since while it is well made, its little more than a collection of nasty deaths and cruel acts with the pretense of being something else."
"Derek237","6","3","6","8 November 2005"," Sick and twisted
","If you think movies like Friday the 13th or Scream are exploitive then it would be wise to avoid this movie at all costs. Since lots of blood has slowly but surely become acceptable in the theatres it's the job of sick minds behind the camera to come up with new ways to shock audiences. In the 80's, heads were being lopped off, people were stabbed and what not, and it all just seemed to get old real fast. By the time the 90's came there were very few movies that actually tried to be creative or reinvent some of the old ideas; the hit Scream movies did this, and also a little movie called Se7en. The victims in Se7en were actually not-so-great of people and were more or less tortured to death by a killer who felt completely justified. Now, we have the Saw movies, and not only are they pushing the envelope, they're cutting it apart and setting it on fire. 20 years ago you'd have to find a movie like this in the pornography section with all the other Hammer films, but today it's number one at the box-office.<br/><br/>The appeal is pretty clear: modern audiences aren't really shocked by simple killings anymore. Now we need to see people being tortured and mutilated to actually feel alive. What also helps is that aside from that, it is pretty absorbing. People like twists and turns, and Saw II is not too much unlike watching an episode of CSI. What is really interesting and grabbed my attention was the fact that this evil ""Jigsaw killer"" was not some superhuman zombie that kills senselessly, but an old man. An old man with cancer, at that! And he doesn't just randomly kill, he hand-picks his victims, and really takes time to think his sadistic plans through. A sick mind proves to be more dangerous than any machete, which is pretty frightening.<br/><br/>Saw II was not really much better or worse than the first one. It's bigger: there's more characters, much more blood, but probably an equal amount of twists. Personally, I prefer the first Saw. It had that indie film charm, where it's just these two guys in a room with a puzzle to solve. The game in Saw II plays out as less of a puzzle, more of a fun-house of horrors. Just like the first, there is a final ""end twist."" It was more believable than the first film's twist but not as scary or shocking.<br/><br/>I like to think I'm fairly desensitized to movie violence, but I'll admit that Saw II had me cringing at more than a few points. So for all intents and purposes, Saw II's verdict is: mission accomplished. My only concern is wondering where we'll find horror/gore films in the next ten years. How far can you go? <br/><br/>My rating: 6/10"

After seeing it tonight I'm sad to say it was very disappointing.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be more of a standard horror than the exciting thriller that Saw was. Sure lots of people were killed, but in nowhere as such a spectacular form as the original Saw movie. <br/><br/>The twist wasn't that great either. In no way did it compare to the amazing twist of the original Saw movie.<br/><br/>I was expecting to give this a rating of 10/10 after hearing such great user comments, but having just seen it I would rate it as an average movie.

"brokenlovesongs","7","3","6","1 November 2005"," Same material, Different approach
","This movie was similar to the first Saw in that it had the same style of plot (the killer is the same person, victims must save themselves, the internal conflicts of the film deal with familial problems), but this time instead of two main victims (Dr. Gordon & Adam), there are many- eight or nine victims I believe. This increase in the number of victims warrants a different approach to the material; there are more victims to kill off, so naturally there will be a higher body count, less character depth, and more of a focus on the ways in which people are killed rather than why the lives of these characters are worth saving. Although the first film heavily emphasized its desire to get creative with blood and guts, it functioned as more of a character sketch than this film does. I feel like I know a lot about Dr. Gordon and Adam, but I can't even remember the names of the characters in this movie, give or take a few. This movie is much more of an exercise in bloody visual effects- it doesn't care about its characters like the original Saw does. Its primary function is to gross the audience out- and that's just fine for a 'halloween' movie. I would say that I appreciated the first film more, just because I liked getting to know the characters better (although it is nice that we get to know John a bit better in this film). There are some creative gory sequences in this film, but they are no more creative than the kills in the first film. Therefore, I would say that while this film is not as good as the original Saw, it is still worth seeing if you're looking for some blood and guts in your movies."

"peplet","4","6","17","27 October 2005"," I wanted to like this movie
","I'm not going to talk about the gore and the violence. If you've come to see the movie, you know what's in store for you. I'm also not going to talk about how many stories that this movie rips off - though it will seem new to mainstream audiences because the ideas that this movie does take from (The Dr. Phibes Series, The Cube Series and on a much grander level, Jim Brown's 24/7) aren't common works - so the ideas will seem original.<br/><br/>The problem is deeper than that, yet simple - the cast just isn't likable. Even in the original Saw, although the acting was marginal, you still felt for the characters and you were rooting for them to try to figure a way out of their circumstance. In this one, you really don't care about them (and you certainly won't care by the end of the movie) and you'll be rooting for all of them to be grizzly dispatched. Fortunately, for almost all of them, you'll be getting your wish - and the deaths are rather grizzly and certainly ratcheted up from the first movie.<br/><br/>The one thing for me that usually makes or breaks a horror film like this is the ending. Though there is a much greater closure in this movie than the first one (you won't be wondering what happened to the people in this film - or what happened to Adam and the good doctor in the original, for that matter), the ending (and the aftermath from it) comes up flat. This could have been a very powerful ending - one that sends a message of redemption and could have been very daring to try to prove to us that Jigsaw is actually justified in what he's doing - but instead, all we get is the shadow of a psychotic who is more bent on a vendetta. Instead of a new type of psychological villain in the style of a Hannibal Lechter, we only get a shell of a genius, and that may be the biggest crime of all."

"darcybabydoll","3","4","10","30 October 2005"," Hugely disappointing sequel.
","To me, Saw was never a film that could really be made into a series or franchise. There were many comparisons made with Se7en around the release of Saw and, although it was quite a loose comparison, both films did really make their impact as stand alone 'jaw drop' twist films.<br/><br/>So forgive me for being iffy about Saw 2 from the moment I heard it was seriously going to be made. But I gave it a chance and I was sadly massively disappointed by this sequel. I'll try not to go on a rant here...<br/><br/>Saw was a film that got under the audiences skin not simply because of the twisted and disturbing premise of a serial killer who does not actually kill with his own hands, but also due to the character development building up through the film that made it's dark and unforgiving ending have such an incredible impact. We began to feel like we knew the characters a little by the end of the film, thanks to flashbacks and snatches of dialogue between the two victims. We could begin to place ourselves in the situation of the film because it felt more rounded and perhaps we could even relate to these characters.<br/><br/>Relating to the characters in Saw 2 is not an option. Not only does it present depressingly familiar stock characters (the tough cop in the midst of a divorce, the son going off the rails who just longs to be loved, the hard ass female partner who has at some point got close to the tough cop, the special squad that just want to 'kick some ass!' or 'take him down!' or shout 'let's dooooo this!') Exactly who are we meant to relate with in the film? Perhaps nobody, but how then is this film meant to be as effective as the first? We certainly can't relate to the good guys as we know little to nothing about them. Do we see any of their home life? No. Their past? No, but we get a few 'shocks' far too late in the film. How are we meant to care whether they have any sort of a moral code if we know squat about them? Of course we're not going to relate to the 'baddie'. I doubt few people did in the first film, although the idea of his motive and his status was a particularly interesting one. Well, it was until this film when they attempt to break it down by making Jigsaw more human. Not only does Jigsaw look and sound different and far less threatening in this picture, he gets the most character development out of everyone. You think this could be positive? Wrong. Very soon, you'll begin to long for the certain amount of mystery that surrounded him.<br/><br/>I promised not to rant, didn't I? Well, I'll skim over the rest, The victims are terribly 2D. Convicts and ex junkies and the 'joker card' that connects them all, we never know much about their pasts either. They're simply used as cannon fodder. If the deaths were sickeningly inventive again then maybe that would suffice, but they're not. The whole 'needle' scenario is about the only 'oh no!' bit in this film. Once again, how is this meant to get under our skin if you've destroyed every element that made the first film genuinely special? Finally, the ending/surprise twist. I can't say much without saying too much. Simply put, they've really clutched at straws here. See it for yourself, you'll see what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>When the first film came out, I tried to see it twice before I actually managed to get tickets. The screening I attended was once again completely sold out. Word of mouth had done the job well. At the end of the first film I felt like my nerve endings were completely blasted and I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. The whole cinema seemed to be in shock. Nobody spoke on the way out. I was terrified walking through the cinema car park.<br/><br/>At the end of this film I heard laughter. People had been walking out throughout the film. The room was barely half full to begin with. On the first weekend. At 7pm. On a Saturday night.<br/><br/>Weak."

","I really, really, REALLY enjoyed the original SAW. When I asked friends who had seen it what they thought, some were impressed, others weren't. I, for one, enjoyed the premise - that this one man forces these people to confront their mortality, and allows (if not forces) them to decide whether they really want to live. I liked that part of the plot, because it was something I hadn't see before. Also, the variety and complexity of the traps were great. And, the twist at the end of the movie was, at least for me (forgive me for being naive) out of nowhere, and got me instantly hooked on the film.<br/><br/>For the sequel, I had mixed expectations. I wanted more of the same mental manipulation - I didn't want to see anything coming. I was worried, however, that the speed with which this sequel released would force it to be sub-par, another sequel to tarnish the memory of the original.<br/><br/>That was not the case.<br/><br/>SAW 2 is amazing. Start to finish. Yes, a little gory (not for the squeamish). Yes, the acting was good but not Oscar-winning. But the storyline was adequate, and made sense. The character development, especially in the case of John the Killer, was a great addition. And, the twists, turns and traps were all great. More than great. Better than I could've hoped for. Whether you liked SAW or not, this movie, in my subtle opinion, is entirely different, while keeping the parts of the original you liked.

The Jigsaw killer is found but a cop at the scene played by Donnie Wahlberg learns that his son and several others are in extreme danger if he doesn't comply with certain demands. Very similar setup with victims waking up in a room and breathing in gas with only so much time to find the antidotes.

Asides from Walhberg there is dreadful performances from Dina Meyer, Shawnee Smith and Beverly Mitchell. Wahlberg is given the bad news that there will be another sequel. Meyer plays his airhead partner. Smith was a previous survivor so it is only fitting that she receive the ultimate punishment of being part of this film. Mitchell of 7th Heaven fame is hardly in a heavenly situation here. Tobin Bell is featured as the killer who has nothing better to do with his time.

","This is supposed to be a thriller/horror movie that is meant to keep you on the edge, have you biting your finger nails, and forgetting to eat your pop corn.<br/><br/>However the methods used to elicit this response from the audience are barbaric. Do you enjoy seeing women and children maimed and tortured by warlords in Africa? Do you enjoy seeing burn victims at the ER? If you are such a sick psycho then maybe you will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Some people have commented on Saw's genius setting up elaborate puzzles. Except of course that Saw has all the time in the world to prepare/research/set up his gruesome ""puzzles"" whereas the victims have minutes sometimes seconds and their hands tied.<br/><br/>The usual clichés are necessary to keep the film going. The bad guy will not ever be caught or stopped , the bullets will miss, the good guys will hesitate and ignore obvious danger signs, time and time again, to give him the time to escape. The good guys will also behave irrationally repeatedly, again, to offer the bad guy the chance to escape.<br/><br/>Another typical cliché is that the good guys AR not what they seem and have done something bad in their past that is revealed half way through the film. And that somehow means that the sociopath killer has some moral basis for sticking a gun to a little girl's head or blowing the victims up? I do not think so.<br/><br/>A very common theme which becomes boringly predictable is the main characters/victims having to play the (sick) games set up by Saw even when they do not need to. If a sick sociopath with a history of dozens of murders has kidnapped your son, how many of his fingers would you break to force him to reveal the location? One? Two? I think I would cut him into a thousand pieces. But predictably in the movie the good guy falls victim to yet another trap. In the TV series ""24"" we saw more believable ways of forcing fanatics to reveal the truth.<br/><br/>Naked, this film is a horror flick where after 90 minutes we expect to see body parts strewn all over the screen in various sadistic traps and self mutilation arising from self preservation and/or duress. It is sick and cheap, it has no value and no elegance. It is like someone asking you to cut your own hand off or remove one of your eyes so that he does not shoot you or your child. Similar kinds of torture took place in Iraq and Africa but we do not celebrate them by making films. <br/><br/>The material is plentiful. Ideas for sadism and torture are easy to invent, and dress up in elaborate puzzles. ""solve this puzzle which involves chopping your leg off or I will explode a bomb at your child's school"".

"screenman","3","2","4","27 October 2008"," Unremitting Twaddle
","I didn't see the original of what has now become an apparently endless franchise. But I caught 'Saw 2' on the telly recently and was about as disenchanted with it as I more or less expected to be.<br/><br/>A bunch of typical boring young farts who you couldn't give a rap about and who've been providing slasher-fodder ever since Freddie Kruger went into glove-making, find themselves collectively imprisoned in a sort of death-trap maze affair by a raving loony, believe it or not. Yes; that's how desperate entertainment has become these days.<br/><br/>This loony - who is apparently dying from cancer (though, sadly, not quick enough) is in police custody and they are able to watch the desperate antics of those boring young farts on his video link. He won't tell them where they are. And what's more; one of the kids is one of the cops' son. Yep; I mean it.<br/><br/>So, there are two stories in one. The loony and the cops engaged in a sort of hammy Lecter/Starling stand-off, whilst the brats get winnowed down by nasty traps. The movie cuts from one to the other with the most inept and untimely editing. It's very difficult to engage with the characters of either sequence because just as we begin to, we are unexpectedly jerked out of one scenario into the other, breaking the continuity and destroying the spell. Not that there is much in the way of engaging characterisation anyway.<br/><br/>Acting is about as wooden and contrived as one has come to expect from this kind of twaddle. And the script is positively asinine.<br/><br/>There isn't much left to hold the attention after that lot.<br/><br/>Oh - and I forgot to mention; all the brats have been infected with some kind of deadly nerve agent for which they must find the antidote. As I said; it's unremitting.<br/><br/>The traps are as predictable as page three. Some noddy puts his eye to an eye-hole. And as sure as sure you know he's going to get it poked. This time by a 45 calibre. Another dummy climbs into a small furnace to get some antidote. You can see it coming a mile away. The door bangs shut and he gets roasted alive. This despite the fact that a riddle specifically warned him he might finish-up in hell. Later, one of the bimbettes puts her hands through a trap that is so obviously intended to sever blood-vessels in the wrist that - by now - you begin to realise that the loony's IQ is scarcely higher than his subjects. He just has an amazing prowess in demented DIY. Not long after this there was an advertisement break, and it seemed as good a reason as any to call it quits.<br/><br/>Did I miss out on a spectacular and rewarding denouement? I'm sure of it.<br/><br/>The ongoing franchise and the encomiums of praise on this website testify to a growing section of our society for whom the best that can be said is that they are a sign of the times. One suspects them of being the sort of people who tyrannise their fellow siblings into suicide, or torture their pets out of academic interest. You sure wouldn't want 'em as baby-sitters.<br/><br/>Unredeemed by any cinematic virtue."

","Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back! this time he has trapped a helpless group of people (Shawnee Smith, Erik Knudsen, Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Emmanuelle Vaugier and Tony Nappo) in a booby-trapped filled house conducted by Jigsaw and his twisted ideas. Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlburg) discovers the vicious criminal mastermind himself and must play a game if his son and the other victims can survive all through the house.<br/><br/>Excellent sequel to the instant suspense-horror-thriller classic of 2004! The creator of the original movie James Wan serves as executive producer here. The acting is good in some parts as it's much more improved then the original's acting and there are moments of memorable torture and gore such as the now infamous yet cringe inducing ""Pit of Syringes"" and the gun blast to the eyeball booby trap sequence. There is the memorable ""Hello Zep"" theme score which is now one of horror's most popular theme scores this side of Tubular Bells from ""The Exorcist"" or the theme to ""Halloween"", it's a must see sequel and it just might have surpassed the original."

","""Saw II"" delivers more than expected. It's not just a sequel to capitalize the surprising success of the original ""Saw"".<br/><br/>The plot is clever and truly plays with the viewer's mind. The movie is not straight Horror because it involves action and light drama. There are spectacular action sequences and good, decent gore.<br/><br/>But don't be carried away because ""Saw II"" won't stay in your mind for it's content, scenes, or even ending.<br/><br/>I'm impressed for it's huge fan database but I can understand why it's a very popular movie. It has a good amount of action and horror and that's what makes it so entertaining. Plus, the characters are likable and each of them has a ""cool"" attitude that may have many teens identified to. Shawnee Smith, Donnie Wahlberg, and Emmanuelle Vaugier deliver the best performances in my opinion.<br/><br/>The death scenes are creative and may be the highlight scenes for the movie.<br/><br/>Give a chance for this movie if you are into the new wave of Horror or if you enjoy twist endings. ""Saw II"" is a product that should be used only once and get the most possible benefit from it."

","For those of you who have seen Saw and not yet seen Saw II, I remain to have only one question. Why have you not seen it yet? This movie is by far more superior than the prequel. While the prequel had it's fair share of twists, this one by far supersedes the amount of twists as the prequel. As for the gore factor, at the point in time that this movie had come out I believe this movie to have topped the rest. I read a review to this movie stating the ""this movie just as good if not better than the prequel"" that being an understatement if you will. This movie is definitely far better than the prequel. I as many who know me rarely go that far in stating that to a sequel. Enjoy this movie as much as I have."

Also like the original, the plot here builds to some great intensity and is topped off with another great surprise ending.<br/><br/>Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, and young Erik Knudsen turn in great performances.<br/><br/>A good sequel all around, that won't disappoint the fans!<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","It was a very well written script and the actors were really good. I also saw the first one and I thought good things of it too, but what was up with the dead guy waking up and saying ""the keys in the bathtub"" HORRIBLE ENDING! The 2nd was much better... Wonderful movies though. I wonder if they'll come up with a Saw 3, I think they might. I love the themes of this movie and everything. I wonder what body part they would use if they did come up with a saw 3?? Maybe a head, or a arm. My favorite part in SAW 1 is when the guy (Doctor) John I think? says ""The saws aren't for the chains, their for our feet!"" That was SO gross at the end when the guy ends up killing himself by cutting off his foot. I have weird feelings for jigsaw... mostly scaredness, and hatefulness, but also a sort of likeness... what would the movie be like with out him???"

I know there is a third one coming out this year and I hope to God it is not as bad or worse. The worst part of Saw 2 was the end. Sequels usually suck, this one especially did. It lives up nothing to the original, just plain stupid. I expected better, I got a HUGE disappointment. Shawnee Smith was a lot better in the first one. The killer is a geek, and the killing scenes suck. Yes, they are bloody, gory, but what horror movie isn't? This movie was a big ripoff. I hope 3 won't be."

","I can't believe so many other IMDb users liked this movie. It was absolutely awful, had no cinematic or artistic value whatsoever. It's plot was completely idiotic, contained none of the interesting twists that it's prequel had. A child could have written this piece of crap... Awful, cliché acting with no thought or inspection left to the audience. The film relies entirely on gruesome images and scenes to be 'scary'... don't waste your time. It's stupid, and nothing happens. This film tries to be more of an action film than a horror film. In fact, I don't think there was anything scary at all, beyond a few 'pop-out-at-you' shots. The direction is drab and uninteresting... you'll notice that the director of Saw (James Wan) had nothing to do with this piece of crap. It appears as though the production studio pulled some run-of-the-mill inexperienced hack out of a barrel and gave him the job. <br/><br/>If you like this movie, you have absolutely no taste."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","2","4","22 February 2006"," Doesn't have the same ""cutting edge"" as the first ""Saw"" :)
","Well, finally after months of waiting, I saw ""Saw 2"". Everyone told me that it was a lot better than the first, so I expected a whole lot considering that I enjoyed the first very much. Well, I did enjoy ""Saw 2"" over all, it had good suspense and kept me interested. But I think it did loose it's originality and I felt empty at the ending. A lot of moments I found to be very pointless or like the director only used it just as a way to get the gore. Like the group being locked in a room together, now for those who haven't seen the film first, it does all come together, but I'm going to say that the violence did seem unrealistic and the reactions were either a little late or early. I don't know, lucky enough I haven't been in a situation like that, so maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions. But there were some very awesome twists and turns, along with the acting, it was worth a watch. I just didn't feel the same excitement as I did with the first one.

","The original Saw was the first movie I ever walked out of. I've seen some awful movies in my life, but I've never felt the need to make such a bold statement before. So why I suckered in on buying Saw II on DVD is just my own fault. Oh, Wahlberg is in it, it can't be that bad. Wrong Wahlberg. I was thinking it was the Wahlberg that doesn't make crappy movies. The Saw series offers such a great premise without following through with a great cast or script, not to mention the worst acting ever. Do you know how they do recaps from previous episodes on TV series? They felt the need to do a montage of all the scenes that explains the twist in the end. That is just too sad. I really have no one to blame but myself."

","I saw this movie and it was plain awful and illogical in every way. The first thing that irritates is the jigsaw saying ""I want to play a game with you"" 1000 times per 10minutes so it eventually is working out more funny then intended. Further on i want to say the teenagers in the house are dumb as hell. They cant walk out of a room without being shot, so hey; lets crawl inside an oven. WHY? Why the hell does someone in a house filled with traps crawl inside an oven? what did he expect? The oven contained beer? Of course it'll be set on fire.

"PeachesStalin","5","2","4","13 January 2006"," Very disappointing and extremely flawed
","I completely agree with Plumberduck! I actually liked the first Saw film, but this one was pretty much rubbish. In the first one we get all these great and horrifying puzzles that the victim needs to solve to avoid dying, in this one we get them too, but like plumberduck says, they are not really solved at all. It was not nearly as scary as the first one, maybe because now we've seen it before, though I was a bit disgusted, but mostly with the behavior of some of the characters and some of the acting as well. I am sorry, but I simply cannot take Lucy from 7th Heaven seriously in a role like this. And yes, the yelling overshadows the puzzle solving completely. Jigsaw has managed to capture some pretty dumb people this time. I did enjoy the Jigsaw character, but I'm getting a little sick of his ""I don't kill people, they kill themselves"" routine. No they don't. They do NOT kill themselves, they are just unable to save themselves. And as far as I remember, in the first one, the last guy didn't really have a fair chance of saving himself, so Jigsaw definitely killed him. I mean, does this guy think what he does isn't illegal, simply because he doesn't directly shoot the victims? He captures them and place them in different sort of devices that will eventually kill them. Now come on! I do, however, think the whole Saw plot idea is pretty good, just too bad they mess it up like that. With a better writer and a couple of better actors, this movie could have kicked ass. But it doesn't. And now they're doing a 3rd? Jesus Christ. I'll give it 5 for nice traps."
"antoniotierno","4","2","4","12 January 2006"," revolting and frankly meaningless
","The only thing I'd save is the twisty ending (as twisty as the prequel finale) but, apart from that, I found no positive notes, in spite of the bigger budget and of the certainly bigger expectations. Too may scenes are needlessly disgusting and besides, when a horror movie is only revolting without showing the audience something different from mere violence and bloodshed, well, it means the film is not worth watching and nothing did work; that's why the only reason why somebody could (not should) be interested in going to theaters and watching this sequel is the memory of the premise. This picture then has no famous actor nor significant character, therefore the conclusion is that no one, except for affectionate fans, should waste time and money."
"alex-876","3","2","4","5 January 2006"," Devoid of emotion and scary for the wrong reasons.
","Although the Saw films have some rather nifty ideas, you cant help but feel the same ideas could be pulled from a 12 year old boy sitting above the ants nest with his magnifying glass. I felt, watching this movie, the presence of those same twisted little boys now grown up now inside their brand new executive suits and looking for a way to prize money out of the new generation of twisted little boys. Saw is, to horror, what pop-stars is to pop music. Films such as Michael Hanekes 'Funny Games' make you feel implicated and ill embarrassed with yourself for the events you are witnessing. I think the director might hope he has duped his audience that this is also his intention. I do not believe it though, although this is a scary film, the object of my fear is the people who made it and starred in it. Saw 2 will make a lot of money and many of the audience will be happy, perhaps I am too sensitive a soul but for me, I feel a sense of emptiness, what has society come to when this is entertainment. I have felt this many times before with a lot of horror films better or worse. This time I feel the reason behind this gray feeling I have, the object of my fears, lie in the filmmakers and, perhaps I am just to sensitive a soul, but there comes a time for me when horror films cross the line."
"jpschapira","5","2","4","15 December 2005"," ""Yes, there will be blood...""
","James Wan is gone, and the studio needed a sequel for what was being regarded, incorrectly I think, as a new type of cult horror. Leigh Whannel stayed, and the studio decided to turn a man's interesting screenplay into ""Saw II"".<br/><br/>The film doesn't begin where it ended up, but it didn't have to. Later on, you could say it really has a lot to do with its predecessor, because manipulating plot lines connections can be created. Most people don't care if something actually makes sense, but I do; and there's nothing in this film we could have understood without the multiple flashbacks the movie presents to help us.<br/><br/>""Saw"" was original and in a way its sequel is original too; but not as risky as the first part, that wasn't even that risky. If the writers give us something to make our minds work, why do they provide us all the hints to resolve their madness? Maybe because they know it's impossible for us to figure it out! And then what are we watching? In terms of directing, the same thing Wan did last year. A lot of loud sounds, quick shots, constant camera changes, the wanted problems and confusions with time; and if I hadn't seen the name of Darren Lynn Bousman (that's the director), I would have thought it was Wan again. But then maybe it's a comfort, because Wan did it differently.<br/><br/>I said when I wrote about ""Saw"" that it had accomplished something that wasn't all ""blood and death"". He had the courage of putting no more than two persons in a room for over an hour. But when the number of persons increases, the complexity decreases. In ""Saw II"" we get around eight persons (I don't even remember) in the same environment that, according to Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) have something in common; and to get out of there they have to play a game.<br/><br/>There's no complexity because it becomes the typical lock-up script (""Cube""); with different types of stereotyped characters, suspicions, distrusts, anger andYes, killing everywhere. A lot of blood all around in a lot of varied ways, that betray Wan's vision of a subtle and well constructed film. There was no need of most of the things included in this sequel, and the intentions don't work either. The blood didn't even make me squeeze. Does that mean that I'm brave? No, it doesn't; it means that the elements were out of place.<br/><br/>Miraculously, at least one thing felt right. I'm talking about Tobin Bell and his expansive portrayal of which is, while not presented as it, the main character of this films. His commitment goes way beyond what's written in the screenplay and the duality of his interpretation remains to be the strongest connection of this film with the other one, which is saying a lot.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention lots of things; some actors, some plot lines, some surprises, I don't know. But I know this: ""Saw"" was a regular film; ""Saw II"" is worseIt's bad."
"massivemanson","3","2","4","6 December 2005"," Mission complete for a bad movie
","I saw this movie yesterday. I don't like nothing in that movie. The direction of Lynn Bousman is a fusion of a television style and bad B series direction. The acting is terrible bad but is worst the characters of this movie you can't to get along with anybody, the music is inexistent and the final song is a metal crap. The script is awful. I enjoy very much with the first movie ... but in this sequel wished that it finished ... the ending is ridiculous ... it tries to discredit the first film. I don't understand the others reviews ... is a bad movie. The violence is low ... and I think is little explicit it compares with other movies of this quine of genre."
"nowonmai42","5","2","4","27 November 2005"," Brutality and boredom. A can't-miss combination!
","The ""Saw"" movies are alternately quite clever and very distressing. Taken together, they constitute an endurance test of brutality. These films challenge us not to look away at least once. So it's no surprise, for those versed in the first installment, when the various expendables of ""Saw II"" start digging into their own flesh, climbing into industrial ovens, and inadvertently shooting themselves in the face. These things sometimes can't be avoided.<br/><br/>The hook of ""Saw II,"" like its predecessor, is a neat trick. The victims of Jigsaw, evil mastermind extraordinaire, are given legitimate  albeit gruesome  means of escape. Likewise, the police have the keys to these deadly puzzles right in front of them, if only they knew where to look. This time, Jigsaw is captured early on, in what seems to be a suspiciously easy fashion. Sure enough, he's arranged things so that he's calling the shots, even from police custody. He's rigged a series of monitors showing Detective Eric Matthews' (Donnie Wahlberg) son trapped, with 5 or 6 others, in a house that is to a normal abode what a roach motel is to the real thing. They're slowly being poisoned, and must navigate the house to find the antidote before they start to bleed from places they shouldn't.<br/><br/>As in the first ""Saw,"" the film depends on an essentially omnipotent villain. This seems unfair; since we're dealing with god, it's a given that everyone in his clutches will be killed, horribly maimed, or otherwise put at his mercy exactly as planned. The ""thrills"" of ""Saw II,"" if that's the appropriate term, come not from discovering whether these people will be disgustingly done in, but simply how. That leaves us with an ultra-graphic peepshow that exists for its own sake. It's morbid fascination taken to seriously grisly extremes.<br/><br/>Both these films are extraordinarily aggressive. They're far less interested in suspense than in making us squirm. The result are some lengthy, boring sequences of chatter between scenes of people getting offed in various death traps. There's little incentive to care about anyone when their ultimate fates are all but certain. As creative as these murder machines are (and they are creative, if you're into that sort of thing), they almost always depend upon impossible anticipation of character behavior and superhuman timing. ""Saw II"" comes with a nifty little twist at the end. I guess it works as much as anything else in the movie, but the body of the film gives viewers no conceivable opportunity to work it out themselves. All the characters here are given the tools they need, if only they can figure out how to use them, but the movie doesn't give us the same benefit. ""Saw II"" happens to us, rather than engaging us. With no stake in the outcome, we're turned into mere voyeurs. But the escape for audiences is hidden in plain sight as if it were one of Jigsaw's traps. It's at the back of the theater, and has a red ""EXIT"" sign over it."

Yes, the movie was okay..it was nearly as good as the first, in my opinion, and I seem to recall hearing a blurb somewhere saying that all my questions would be answered and only one of my questions was answered, so I was a bit disappointed in that.

But I went along with my friends to watch it anyway. And I came out of the theater with the credits rolling a very very impressed man. The story, the camera work, the violence, everything just blew me away. The movie also manages to throw some social commentary at you. But what I really loved was the subtle hints that the director threw at the viewers all throughout the movie. Right from the beginning, you see things, hear things, things that seem really unassuming and harmless at first, but at the end of the movie, all of it ties up for an explosive twist. The final twist of the movie caught me totally off guard, I don't think I've been so surprised by a movie twist since ""The Others"" in 2001. This is a great movie, and if you're not scared of blood and are a horror/thriller fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. Now to go get Saw 1 in DVD..."

","Following the line of gruesome death scenes, surprising plot twists and creepy clowns, Saw II directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Bousman and Leigh Whannel (he played Adam in Saw) will definitely make you jump out of your seat.<br/><br/>The Jigsaw Killer is at it again. The movie begins with an unknowing victim trapped in a room and subject to self mutilation in order to save his life. This crime scene draws the attention of Detective Eric Matthews, played by New Kids on the Block's Donnie Wahlberg.<br/><br/>In the events that follow, a group of seven extremely unlucky individuals find themselves playing one of Jigsaw's twisted games while trying to find an anecdote for the lethal poison seeping through their veins and a way out of the booby trapped house.<br/><br/>Saw II immediately grabs your attention and keeps it for the entire 90 minutes of blood, gore and death.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie fits perfectly - from the camera shots, to the actors, and all the plots. Saw II is creatively mastered from every angle.<br/><br/>The sequel also takes time to make a connection back to the original movie to clarify the relationship between Jigsaw and his first set of victims. Jigsaw's motives and philosophy of his work is also revealed in Saw II.<br/><br/>At first it's hard to decide which movie is better Saw or Saw II, but in the end I would have to vote for the sequel  shocking isn't it! In the original, Dr. Lawrence, played by Cary Elwes was not a good actor and somewhat took away from the movie. In addition, the single room scene became somewhat stagnant.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in the sequel, all the characters were well cast and the continuous motion only added to the suspense.<br/><br/>Overall, Saw II receives three and a half out of four stars.

","Anytime a low budget ($4 Million) horror film beats the box office pants off all the expensive stuff is cause for rejoicing, even when it is being pushed by a major distributor (Lion's Gate). <br/><br/>It is hard to understand the negative reviews of ""Saw II"". Sure its target audience is the lamest segment of the teen market (the ones who rushed to see ""Dukes of Hazard"" and avoided ""Serenity""), and braving the Halloween crowd at my local mega-plex required the self-infliction of a large dose of local drones and wigger girls snorting like pigs throughout the film. But this sequel is a much better movie than the original (insert ""Aliens"" here). Although not on the level of the more subtle ""The Hole"", it delivers a nice package of suspense and misdirection, plus a cute ending. And even tripling the original's budget did not make it so big that the good qualities of the original were lost to expensive effects and computer generated nonsense. <br/><br/>The ""Saw"" franchise is an idea born out of the need for low cost production design. They continue to make do with an industrial rest room and the interiors of an old house (or apartment complex) and warehouse. Which fortunately fit the atmosphere and texture that they want. Acting and action are secondary to this psychological thriller/horror film despite vast quantities of blood and gore (insert the snorting of wigger girls here). It is much better on the big screen than at home because the audio is extremely important to the whole effect.<br/><br/>Three characters return from the original. This time Tobin Bell has a major role as a kind of low-key Hannibal Lexter (the franchise owes a lot to ""Silence of the Lambs"") and Shawnee Smith reprises an expanded Amanda role. I was shocked that I actually recognized a slimmed down Beverly Mitchell in the cast, maybe not as shocked as I was at seeing a virtually unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg. The last I recall of him was ""Southie"" (1998) and the seven years since have not been kind.<br/><br/>To really enjoy ""Saw II"" you have to be willing to cut it some slack in the credibility department, although not to quite the degree as was required by the original. Although several of the performances are poor (Dina Meyer-the third returnee and Frankie G especially) none are on the clinker level of Danny Glover's in the original. Likewise the plausibility factor never hits deeply into negative, there is no repeat of anything as inane as the original's family menacing scene."
"KyleFurr2","8","2","4","31 October 2005"," better than expected
","I was surprised at how good the first one was and was even more surprised at this one since most horror sequels suck. This one was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and stars Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer as a couple of detectives hunting the jigsaw killer. This time there are several people trapped in a bobby trapped house and they have only two hours before they are killed by poisonous gas or something else in the house. There is a great ending that is totally unexpected just like the first one and this one is probably even better. It's a great movie that is probably better than the first one and you know that they are going to make a third one with this kind of ending."
"cal112hmb","4","2","4","30 October 2005"," Disappointed
","First off, let me just say that the first Saw film was a work of art that made me feel something no other horror movie has touched since. There was claustrophobia, tension, and a great plot twist at the end. Most of this is lost in Saw 2.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a bang, as Jigsaw has set up a trap for an unknowing individual. You get the same look and feel as you did when seeing the traps for the first time in ""Saw"". However, it is all downhill from here. John is not the mysterious character that he was in the first movie; rather the writers tried to make his humanity stand out more through a series of flashbacks throughout the movie. I don't think they foresaw the entire mystery element being swept away with that decision, but that is exactly what happens in this film. Not many movies can survive outing the villain within the first 15 minutes, and sadly, this falls into that group.<br/><br/>When the mystery element is compromised, one of the things that can really keep me on the edge of my seat is the tension of the actors. This is also vacant in Saw 2. The cast never gels as Adam and the doctor do in the first movie, and it is apparent in every scene. Shawnee Smith, the lone survivor of Jigsaw's ""game"", is back for the sequel and acts much like Ali Larter did in Final Destination 2. She tries to be a leader and mentor to everybody in the house, yet comes off as a smug and obnoxious character who is just as unlikable as everyone else in the house. Beverley Mitchell (of 7th Heaven fame) is out of her league in the horror genre, as is Franky G, who plays Xavier. Everyone else had loads of potential, but never quite gelled as they should have.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the tension element is lacking in Saw 2, and much of it has to do with the missing claustrophobia that was everywhere in the first one. At first, I thought they were all going to be confined into the one room that they wake up in, but you find shortly after that the rest of the house is their's to explore as well. The house felt huge compared to what it was being portrayed as in the previews, and I feel that was a mistake.<br/><br/>The two things that I felt Saw 2 had going for it were Donnie Wahlberg's acting and the amazingly twisted ending. Donnie was great as the father of one of the victim's of Jigsaw's game, and fans of the first Saw's ending will NOT be disappointed with this ending. As stated in countless reviews before mine, the ending to Saw 2 sets up the franchise for however long Lion's Gate decides to keep it running. Overall, the movie is a disappointing entry in the Saw franchise, but looking forward to the last 15 minutes makes the other 1 hour 15 minutes bearable."

","Saw II (2005) - ""Saw II"" follows on from the hugely-successful 2004 chiller ""Saw"" and is one of the rare occasions where a decent sequel outshines a decent original. I like the original Saw just fine, it's nothing too special but it has some interesting concepts and ideas besides being extremely unnerving; Saw II is about the same but it approaches things in a way that for me elevates it just ever so slightly above its prequel, making it my favorite of the Saw movies.<br/><br/>In Saw II we once more hone in on the Jigsaw Killer, the enigmatic and insane serial killer who has made it his life's goal to test people's desires to live by putting them through torturous traps and life-or-death games. With a whole new cast of characters forced through the killer's deadly games, including a dirty cop's troubled teenage son, Saw II has a rather-loose and tenuous connection at best to the previous film, shifting its focus more towards the action and police procedural side of things as opposed to focusing on ambiance and atmosphere like the first movie did. While there is a lot of what made the first film so unique and chilling in this one, I do think that Saw II is ultimately the more entertaining of the two due to the change of focus that it employs-although I do think that the police procedural elements were handled somewhat better in later entries in the franchise, the blend of crime thriller and visceral horror truly makes Saw II stand out from the rest. To a degree the movie is also acted pretty well for a horror sequel, with Donnie Wahlberg-Mark's brother-delivering a visceral and intense performance as an unhinged and violent homicide detective, a role that I never would have seen the lead singer of New Kids on the Block playing in a million years. Tobin Bell is great as always as the sick and twisted serial killer; newcomer Erik Knudsen gives a very vulnerable, sensitive performance as Eric's troubled son; and Shawnee Smith takes a terrifyingly realistic turn as a mysterious woman who knows a thing or two about the mysterious situation Daniel and the others have found themselves in.<br/><br/>Saw 2 follows the corrupt Detective Eric Matthews as he tries to rescue his estranged teenage son Daniel from the clutches of the killer and his associates after the latter is kidnapped and thrust into a horrifying game alongside seven strangers who each hold dark secrets. With Daniel in grave danger, Eric desperately races against time to right his wrongs and save his son from certain death, going to any lengths necessary to secure his son's freedom. Having a crooked detective's teenage son forced into a game alongside dangerous strangers with serious criminal records is an intriguing and tense concept, and for the most part, its execution in this film is handled pretty well. Where the film focuses on Daniel trying to survive amidst a motley crew of ex-convicts such as the fearsome Xavier is where Saw II really shines, but what ruins it for me is that much like in the other films there is absolutely no resolution to anything that happens in this film. The lack of resolution to anything in Saw II is a recurring theme of sorts throughout the franchise and leaves me with the impression that the sequels were made as hollow and cheap cash grabs given that they all follow more or less the same structure as the original. Something else that bothers me about Saw II, in particular, is how unlikable a lot of these characters are: the ex-cons Daniel works alongside aren't particularly interesting characters and not much depth is given to them, and Xavier is no doubt the worst character in the film. Eric himself is hugely unlikable at times as a lead protagonist owing to his being a loose cannon to say the least; his relationship with his son or lack thereof is never resolved, almost as if the film is saying he ""deserved"" it despite their father-son relationship adding a whole new dynamic to it.<br/><br/>In spite of its flaws, however, Saw II is a perfectly passable sequel that raises the bar and the stakes for the franchise after a decent first film. Though it has none of the atmosphere that the original had and doesn't add anything new to the franchise Saw II is well-acted and extremely intense, with numerous harrowing and pulse-pounding scenes of terror. Barring the original Saw II was the franchise's finest hour, shame the series only goes downhill from here."
"bowmanblue","7","0","0","25 November 2019"," Does well (for a sequel)
","Sequels rarely live up to the originals. And in the horror genre that's even rarer. I reckon that 'Saw' (part I) will always be better, due to its originality and shock value, but its (first) successor does its best to expand on the mythology and give the audience something more. In short... it's definitely worth a watch if you enjoyed the original.<br/><br/>The first outing could be summed up best by 'two men wake up in a serial killer's lair and try to figure out how to escape.' However, there was far more to the story than just that and the amount of different twists and turns really struck a chord with audiences (that and the amount of 'body horror' that was involved.<br/><br/>'Part II' ups the ante in every sense. There are more victims in the killer's latest 'lair,' more gore, more traps, more police officers trying to figure out where these hapless people are, perhaps most importantly, more of the killer himself (who was surprisingly not in the first installment very much). In fact... out of all the characters in the film, it's the killer 'Jigsaw' (Tobin Bell) who steals every scene.<br/><br/>As with the first film, there's more to the story than just a bunch of people trying to escape from some fiendishly fatal death-traps. 'Saw II' does its best to keep the surprises coming and, like the first, you'll only have one chance to watch it without knowing all the plot twists that will be heading your way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, if you liked the original then you should enjoy this one, too. In fact it's almost like these two films could have been written together and filmed back to back. After this one I only stayed with the franchise for a couple more films as the quality really does go downhill after this one. For me the 'Saw' franchise was a two-picture deal."

Eric and a swat team find Jigsaw's lair, and Eric confronts John Kramer (Tobin Bell). Eric must abide by the rules that John gives him and t he rules of the game, otherwise he will never see his son again.<br/><br/>Saw II was a phenomenal sequel. It may not pick up exactly right after the first, but it was still great to watch.<br/><br/>I loved the story. I love how it's a group of people that go through traps in order to live or die, and a big investigation is going on that worked perfectly. The traps this time around are very creative and this was when the series increases the graphicness.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch. Wahlberg is a great actor, and while his character is a bit of a jerk at times, he still pulled it off great. I also love Tobin Bell's performance in the film. He gets a TON more screentime here and has a lot more to do. The rest of the cast, especially the people that played the victims in the game, did phenomenal.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Saw II is my favorite of the series, and was the beginning of the creativity of the series."

","The first Saw is a decent psychological thriller. It is technically well executed, specifically with the editing and pacing (crucial to horror and thriller).

It is good for a casual watch, but there is nothing more at play in this movie other than some ""just okay"" puzzles and an obvious attempt to top the first Saw in terms of gore and level of danger. But, it tries to hard. The realistic danger of Saw I is what makes the movie. The over the top nature of this one is what ruins it.<br/><br/>Watch the first Saw seriously. I mean it.

","Saw II continues the tale of modern horror's greatest villain: Jigsaw. This time, 8 people are locked in a brutal test while a detective, the father to one of the victims, and the police try to save them. S2 is a rough, brutal ride. It has been treated unfairly by critics because of the bloodshed. That's just what it uses for scares. Some horror movies use jump scares. Some use tension. This uses violence and uses it reasonably well. It's not always enjoyable as it does get pretty unpleasant at times, but it is undeniably effective. Therefore, it's easy to write it off as a nasty gore-fest, but it counterbalances the gore with thought-provoking thematic material on morals, justice and how far one will go to save themselves. It's a nasty film, but it is effective. It's far from a perfect movie admittedly. The characters aside from Jigsaw and the main detective are weak, the drama is somewhat superficial, it's not as tense as the first one and things are a bit sillier this time. That being said, it's a watchable and reasonably thrilling horror film, although for many it will be a bit much. It's worth watching for all the twists and turns, as you will never see them coming.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Attempting to track down the Jigsaw killer, a detective and his team's raid on a hideout reveals his son's involvement in a deadly game with other victims inside a house filled with traps and must rescue him before succumbing to the traps.<br/><br/>This here ended up being quite the overall bland effort here. As with the rest of the franchise, the biggest problem here is with the feeling of his own brand of punishment being too far self-centered that there's little to gleam from the ethics and morality found here which tends to come away rather wholeheartedly. This one spends so much time trying to pontificate over doling out a sense of righteousness to his actions that there's just nothing that can be taken from who he's specifically targeting with this one seemingly bent on trying to bring about the fact that what's happening is of a great good to the individual. The gathered group is all supposedly tied together with the detective yet nothing here is really all that positive about why they're being targeted. Once it's discovered what the connection is, that makes his attempt at teaching them lessons seem even more foolhardy and suspect here with a simply lame reasoning to suspect that he's truly in trouble. Not only that, it's dropped way too late into the film anyway which makes this seem all the more confusing and pointless which renders this one irritatingly non-essential about that twist. Coupled with a series of utterly baffling character decisions that render this one rather non-descript and a bland first half that tends to leave all the kills here in the second half, there's a lot of flaws and problems here. While these here all hold this one down, there's very little here that's worthwhile. All of that positive force here comes from the traps on display, which are quite brutal in their execution if completely lacking in their connection to the types of traps usually featured in the series. There's some rather cruel and brutal traps here, from the crawl through the incinerator or the trap-door pit full of needles that's quite squirm-inducing. The other fine action in the last-half here as everyone turns on each other to get out of the house which gets interesting with some decent brawling and stalking that results in some enjoyable gore, but otherwise the flaws here are more impactful overall.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and children-in- jeopardy."
"rooprect","Null","0","0","16 December 2015"," Saw II: Measure once, cut twice
","I have no idea what my title means, except that it sounded clever in my head. Hmm.<br/><br/>I'll assume that you've already seen the original Saw and you're wondering if this is a worthy successor. In a word: yeah. But it's a very different approach. While the first Saw was brilliantly minimalistic, the story being staged almost entirely in one room, this second installment takes us out of the box. Gone is the claustrophobic feeling of confusion and good ole existentialistic ""who am I"" from the original, and instead we get more of a mystery as seen from the outside, as our hero Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) tries to crack the case before it's too late.<br/><br/>Sure, the same elements existed in the first film, with 2 concurrent plots of victim & detective. But the draw of the first was to figure out why all these things are happening. Here the mystery is revealed in the first few minutes, the killer is apprehended, and what follows is a sort of chess game between investigator Eric and perp Jigsaw with the clock ticking to save the intended victims. It's actually a clever approach similar to the rather AWESOME film ""Exorcist III"" (1990) which is composed of dark dialogues between the detective and the lunatic, and this dramatic approach was repeated a year later in the more popular ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). But in this domain, in order for it to work, the film must be slow, almost painfully slow, thick and heavy.<br/><br/>Saw II attempts to balance the heavy, psychological ""Lambs"" approach with good old fashioned slashes & gore. It succeeds, I feel. But I still can't help but wonder how it would've been if the filmmakers had gone full tilt ""Lambs"" on us. Instead the dialogues between Eric & Jigsaw seem a bit short, rushed and not fully explored.<br/><br/>The result is a film which is certainly entertaining, but I don't think it will ever be considered a psychological classic like the other two I mentioned, or like ""Seven""--films that are much slower in pace, with far fewer gallons of blood spilled but with oceans of drama.<br/><br/>I know this may sound like a negative review, but that's only because I'm comparing Saw II to the heavyweights. If instead we take Saw II at face value, a straightforward horror flick, it certainly delivers. There's the added bonus of having two nice twists at the end. In terms of sheer entertainment value, Saw II cuts a real log.<br/><br/>I should really quit trying to come up with witty puns."

","Saw 2 lacks a lot of the tension of the first one, the jump moments aren't as effective and the pacing is a little slow. Tobin Bell, who plays Jigsaw is really good. They gave the character a lot more depth and he is really convincing and even relatable. Sadly this cannot be said for the other characters, who are all rather shallow and uninteresting. The key to good horror is to make the protagonists relatable so that the audience cares about what happens to them. Now perhaps I'm just a sick, twisted person, but the only character I really found myself caring about is the killer.<br/><br/>This brings me to my next point. While the original Saw was definitely a psychological piece, the sequel already started going more for the gore. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and with the same twisted editing and cinematographic techniques they used in the first one it works quite well.<br/><br/>Saw 2 had a much higher budget than the first one, a larger cast and better production value, but they sacrificed a lot of the tight direction and tension that made the original great. Also this film is more graphic than it's predecessor, so consider yourself warned. However it is worth watching just to learn more about the Jigsaw character."
"Samiam3","6","0","0","16 September 2009"," Not terrible but not needed either.
","If I have to make one statement about the nature of the on-going horror (and specifically) the slasher trend it would be this; No good formula works twice.<br/><br/>This is the simplest reason why Saw II is an inferior sequel as so many films are. James Wan had a clever idea for his debut picture, it was well thought out, nicely paced, and offers a really scary twist ending which was totally unpredictable. Saw II presents a different string of characters and bloody chapters, but at its centre, this is pretty much the same thing, only less effective. The story is far more shallow, and moves too quickly. The acting is weak, the plot twists are predicable, not to mention the the ending which is totally plagerized from the Saw script. What is frustrating is that it offers a cliff hanger for what is probably an even worse sequel. The Saw franchise is the latest domino effect with each film's ending giving way to a new beginning. They are now up to #6. By the time they decide to stop the franchise there will be so many Saws that the public is liable to forget the brilliance of where the idea began. <br/><br/>Jigsaw plays a more ambitious game this time. He has locked a bunch of people in a house. The instructional cassette informs them thay they have (without knowing) inhaled a lethal gas which will take affect in two hours. In the room is a safe, and inside is the antidote. They have two hours to find the numbers to the code which are located somewhere within his booby trapped house. The youngest of these captives is Daniel Matthews, and his father Eric is a locally renowned police detective. He and his team have miraculously arrested jigsaw, but can detective Matthews get him to reveal the whereabout of his son before time runs out?<br/><br/>I like the way Saw II is photographed. Each location uses a different filter to change the color scheme. The house is tinted golden making it look kind of retro or antique. Jigsaw's headquarters are tinted green, which is a very sickly color, and one of the last scene takes us back to the cellar bathroom from Saw. The colour is tinted Blue/and white, which are very cold colours.<br/><br/>I guess the only reason I am not appalled by Saw II is the fact that I was expecting it to be less impressive than Saw (which it is). Saw truly is a story fit for one film, not 2 (let alone 6 or more)"

","Well, I didn't much care for the original film; however, I had a glimmer of hope for the sequel. I felt the original lacked ambition as though it just ran through the motions (and did a pretty damn good job of running through said motions) but ultimately didn't deliver anything new. Superficial? Sure. Genuine? No.<br/><br/>Saw II commits my ultimate pet-peeve of horror sequels. It explains  and explains  and explains. Great, we get it. The Jigsaw killer does what he does to make people appreciate their life. Did you see what I just did? I explained the entirety of the Jigsaw's motive in a single sentence. Saw II spends the bulk of its running time explaining that one sentence. And you know what? I distinctly remember the first Saw over-explaining how technically the Jigsaw has never pulled the trigger himself, yadda, yadda, yadda.<br/><br/>Honestly, who gives a damn about John the Jigsaw being a cancer patient and his attempted suicide when there's poisoned characters running around through a trap-filled house looking for the antidote? When one of these characters is a complete psychopathic nutcase who will inevitably snap and start killing everyone else (a la Cube)? It's great that the villain isn't a faceless killing machine, and indeed Tobin Bell brings great charisma to the mastermind role (side note: he might be the only character in the film with charisma). It's great that he has an actual motive and a logic behind what he does (regardless of how warped said logic may be.) That makes Saw II all the more depressing. It's not that the writers did not give their killer a reason, it's the fact they don't know when to shut up about it.<br/><br/>What's the point of that expository montage at the end when the entire movie is an elongated expository montage? I know, I know  it's not supposed to be great literature. Cut it some slack for at least trying, right? Well, if a die-hard fan has made it this far before clicking ""No, this review was not helpful"" out of spite, then here's the good news: this ain't no sissy PG13 ""horror"" flick. Saw II knows exactly who its fans are, and delivers the gore along with scenarios that make the squirm-inducing original look like a day at the spa. From the thought of someone cutting open their own eye, to a pit full of syringes, to a character cutting off a large chunk of his own flesh, again Saw II delivers the bloody goods. And here's a bonus: most of the trapped characters hits those annoying archetypes the scenario demands, making their deaths all the more satisfying.<br/><br/>Also to its credit  Saw II is slick and polished, but at the end of the day all Saw II has done for horror is trade in the 80s-naivety/motiveless killers gimmick and the 90s hyper-self aware ""Scream"" rip off gimmick for the current fad: the trendier over-explained ""gotcha"" twist ending gimmick.<br/><br/>And, who knows, maybe I wouldn't be complaining too much if the film would have actually, you know, surprised me. Then again, the first Saw actually did surprise me, and I still wasn't impressed. Oh well"

The element of crime and murder twinned with the fact many-a police officers are running around trying to solve a crime in progress just cements the feeling and it's this rapid approach to the material that hammers home the race-against-time atmosphere throughout. But in essence, this is alright if done sparsely and within moderation  the reason I hate most television serials has a lot to do with the drawn out manner they take to the material; from face value, characters can travel a lot of distance over a lot of time and not really achieve much which is frustrating, but Saw II seems to get down to brass tacks and just gives you what you want.<br/><br/>This 'what you want' is a mixture of suspense; race against time; something emotionally involving at stake and generally horror and/or gore. They are the hallmarks of generic horror and Saw II delivers perhaps not what you demand but what the genre demands on top of a grungy and depressing approach to cinematography that compliments the enclosed and bleak setting. Much like the first Saw film, unknowns are trapped in a room with no initial knowledge of how they got there  things will become clearer at nicely spaced intervals.<br/><br/>They are there, of course, due to the actions of themselves but the instigations of one other man; he is Jigsaw (Bell) and in Jigsaw we have a villain well suited to the piece. As a horror villain, Jigsaw is not what we expect: he is old, decrepit and barely able to breath or talk. The effectiveness of Jigsaw is in his presence and his 'type' of villain. Saw II is the sort of film that will have most of its viewers squirm in some fashion; it taps into basic fears and phobias but does not make an obvious study. Whether someone's fear or phobia are needles or enclosed spaces, Saw II carries an unpleasant but effective atmosphere and the idea that its villain is an old and incapacitated old man complete with breathing apparatus adds to the squirming nature it carries  do we like seeing an elderly and frail man being threatened and knocked about like this despite his clear delicate complexion? <br/><br/>But of course this effectiveness in appearance of a character can only carry as many cons as it can pros. This is because the emphasis on the weak and frail is so apparent and made to be so effective that it's almost impossible to believe that someone of this disposition is able to own so much real estate and is able to set up so many elaborate traps, not to mention to be able to handpick people out of society and place them there. Jigsaw is an interesting character; the sort of character that by appearance and build appears weak and useless but is constantly in control of any given situation and given a few twists that unravel towards the end, seems to be able to remain deadly calm even when the ball isn't entirely in his court.<br/><br/>The victims this time range from big, broad, egotistical Hispanics to young and insecure kids that are barely teenagers but act as a link to the bigger picture. This is in opposition to two guys, in a room, with restraints around their legs. Saw II's hook is that these several people are given the freedom of their surroundings and the surroundings are an entire house with extra rooms complete with individual traps and 'tasks' of their own. One of this Saw edition's grizzlier scenes involves a woman having to go down into a pit of syringes in order to fetch a key  it's a set up or an idea similar to Fincher's 1995 film 'Se7en' with the idea that people pay for their 'sins' (or crimes in Saw II's case) by way of meeting them head on in an orgy of terror and pain. On this occasion, the person down there (or supposed to be down there) distributed the syringes, complete with drugs, and must now meet his wrong-doing head on.<br/><br/>The film forces its race against time idea upon us via inclusion of a poisonous gas slowly making its way through the victims lungs  if they don't solve the bigger picture, they all die. This actually works against the film in the sense one of the reasons I liked the first Saw was that they had time to think, work things out and do their best to escape. Here, they have limited time and I feel the film would've been better without the inclusion of the gas. What's at stake here is the well being of the hero's child, Daniel (Knudsen), it is policeman Eric's (Wahlberg) problem so remove the poisonous gas and allow the many traps and general desperation of the captives to act as the primary threat to the well being of Daniel. <br/><br/>Indeed, when the captives find out who Daniel is this should act as a further dramatic twist but it falls marginally flat due to the fact we know the gas will kill everyone eventually anyway, regardless of how much everybody knows. The film is by no means great but as a dramatic and grungy thriller with a constant whiff of unpleasantness, Saw II works on a basic dramatic and horrific level."

","The first Saw was, on its own terms, groundbreaking in its nastiness and brutal originality. The sequel, on the other hand, does what all other horror follow-ups do - mimic the formula of the first one -, albeit with a little more thoughtfulness.<br/><br/>The script, according to various statements by the crew, was originally a stand-alone thriller, written by director Darren Lynn Bousmann, and had to be rearranged to fit in the Saw universe after the original became a huge box office hit. Despite Leigh Whannell's best efforts, this fact shows quite a bit, mostly because of the plot being a lot more complex than in the first movie. This time, instead of two people in a bathroom, we have eight in an entire building, and it's only a matter of hours before they're all killed by lethal nerve gas. While each of them figures out why he or she deserves to be there, Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and his task force get as far as facing Jigsaw himself (Tobin Bell), a cancer-ridden old man who has no intention of dying before his work is complete. There is also another reason why Matthews can't kill him right away: his only son is the gas-infested building.<br/><br/>Making the story more twisted and ambitious is not a bad thing per se, but considering all the traps seen in the first Saw were conceived for one or two people at most, the mass carnage in Saw II appears a little difficult to justify. That it becomes rather easy to ignore this fact is down to two elements: the consistent tension, paired with some good old gore, and Tobin Bell, who is allowed to expand on his character after the brilliant twist ending of the previous entry showed us how far he could go. Having perfected his villainous acting in episodes of Alias and 24 (and also, surprisingly, Seinfeld), he owns the entire film, spitting out Jigsaw's life (and death) philosophy with understated menace.<br/><br/>And then there's the one thing most fans will judge more harshly than anything else: the final twist, or rather twists (there are at least two). One is a bit of a let-down, in fact it's Saw II's biggest liability (anyone who's seen the first movie can guess it very easily), the other is actually smarter than expected, although the overall feeling is that the ending was constructed to leave the road open for Saw III instead of providing a good shock. Still, after seeing the third installment, it has to be said that at least the makers of the second one tried their best."

","It's difficult to recommend a movie like ""Saw II,"" or its predecessor for that matter, to a wide variety of people.<br/><br/>For some, seeing a person decide whether or not he should pluck his eyeball out with a scalpel to save his head from being crushed by a bear-trap-like-contraption, complete with thousands of sharp, protruding nails, is just the adrenaline fix those seeking a movie with an incredibly high body count paid eight bucks to see. However, the person sitting next to him may be regretting the fact that he just ate a large meal before going to the theater.<br/><br/>Then there are those viewers who are divided. They may enjoy the film's tense scenarios and unexpected plot twists, but deem the excess violence unnecessary and distracting. Such is the case of Saw II, a movie that manages to, in some ways, improve upon the original (which really isn't saying much), but loses some freshness, creativity, and character development along the way.<br/><br/>""Saw II"" continues directly from the events of the first film. The ""serial killer"" Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), who forces people he feels are not worthy of the life they had been given to participate in his sick ""games,"" is still on the loose. He is again the subject of a police investigation, this time headed by Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), a corrupt cop with many parental and spousal issues. The first twist occurs early on, resulting in a majority of the film's emphasis to be placed on eight strangers trapped by Jigsaw in a house littered with booby traps. Meanwhile, a nerve agent is being pumped throughout the house, forcing the captives to find several scattered antidotes before their bodies succumb to the poison.<br/><br/>Sadly, just like the first installment, the premise of ""Saw II"" is much better than its execution. Sure, it's miles beyond you're typical horror/slasher film made these days (""House of Wax"" and ""The Fog,"" anyone?), but in no way does its creativity live up to its potential. For starters, and you knew this was going to happen, a large chunk of the film simply degenerates into a mindless slasher film in which no audience member will feel any emotion towards the stereotypical and unlikable characters (Beverly Mitchell of 7th Heaven, for instance, may have the most useless character in the history of film).<br/><br/>When Saw II spends its time inside the house (the portion of the movie that should create the most tension and uncertainty) the film degrades itself by developing into a paint-by-numbers thriller in which we can see each and every gruesome kill of a stupid cardboard character coming from miles away. The original's creative and ironic scenarios based on the fallible nature of the characters's pasts are essentially gone, replaced by an overabundance of gruesome violence towards people we care nothing about, trying to make up for the fact that the filmmakers have run out of creative ideas.<br/><br/>With that being said, ""Saw II"" is still somewhat fun. It corrects many of the things most people felt were wrong with the first film, most notably the unnecessary flashbacks and detours from the main plot which absolutely annihilated its pace and tension. The sequel instead flows very nicely between two main plots, the stronger of which belongs to the ongoing cat-and-mouse games between Det. Matthews and an apprehended Jigsaw. The acting and dialogue are considerably better, especially in the scenes with Wahlberg and Bell, which, finally, add several layers of complexity to the Jigsaw character. These scenes essentially carry the movie, serving as the film's main source of suspense and compliment the kinetic frenzy of action within the house nicely.<br/><br/>They also lay the groundwork successfully for the film's ending, which, yet again, is extremely effective, and wouldn't have worked at all if the script hadn't set it up so nicely. First-time director Darren Lynn Bousman does a nice job of supplying the film with style and great focus, even though his eye for creativity and suspense (save for the excellent opening scene) is inferior to ""Saw's"" James Wan. Bousman's nods to the first film towards the end will leave any fan of the original with a huge smile on their face.<br/><br/>The tagline of ""Saw II"" (""Oh yes. There will be blood"") tells you everything you need to know. Most fans of the first film, or gruesome violence for that matter, will come away pleased, but it's those searching for an extension and improvement to ""Saw's"" wasted potential of psychological tension who will be disappointed after squandering yet another good premise. It's dumb fun, but it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>** out of ****"

Technicality wise, the Saw films are top-notch even if repetitive and scraping the barrel for justification of means.

","The plot of this movie was genius; the twists and story of the whole film was exciting, surprising, and just plain cool! The whole blood-and-guts element in the movie made it even scarier, in a good way. In short, I loved the whole idea. Key word: idea. Let's just say, the acting is a whole different story.<br/><br/>First of all, Donnie Wahlberg isn't a very good actor to begin with, but he didn't affect the movie too much. However, Glenn Plummer, who played Jonas, did affect the movie to a point where I almost wanted to leave the theater. He was absolutely awful. Just terrible. I could take one look at the script and do it better by memory! But I must say, Shawnee Smith as Amanda was pretty good, as was Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. I was a little disappointed that Erik Knudsen and Beverly Mitchell didn't give very memorable performances, and that Franky G man as Xavier was a little too scary for me. The rest of the performances were pretty good, especially the bickering between many of the characters.<br/><br/>Over all, I liked the concept of the movie, and it would have been brilliant if the acting was better."

","MAJOR SPOILERS <br/><br/>This flick isn't bad for a sequel. It kicks off with a hell of a bang that, unfortunately (and inevitably) the rest of the film can't live up to, but it still manages to keep you interested in the storyline that is unfolding. There is an element of more of the same about it  but then that's why sequels are made  but there are just about enough fresh developments  and an unexpected (by me at least) twist that is worth waiting for. For my money, the only major drawback is the way some of the characters behave: why did Xavier feel he has to kill everybody in order to discover the number tattooed on the back of their neck? And would that girl, having spent 2 hours in a booby-trapped house, really have been so stupid as to plunge her hands into that glass box to retrieve the antidote (especially when the box is secured by a padlock with the key still in it). It made for an effective moment, but it didn't make a lot of sense. Pretty good film though, an equal to its predecessor, that's for sure."

","A couple of Aussies were responsible for Saw - a dirt cheap, original and very successful horror movie. The sequel is co-written by one of them (Leigh Wannel). It has a much bigger budget, and the same mix of complex plot and sadistic gore. A psychopathic weirdo called Jigsaw arranges for 8 people to be imprisoned in a dingy, booby-trapped dwelling, from which they must escape, before they are killed by the lethal nerve gas, which is seeping into the place. Charming! If you relish seeing ex-jailbirds, alcoholics, junkies, hookers, and hapless teenagers scream in terror as they're subjected to psychological and physical torture, this is for you. I found it repulsive, and pointless, so I must be old fashioned. If I wanted to see terrified people turn on each other, before most of them suffer horrifically, I'd go back to working in the public service. The story is undeniably cleverly woven, and the twist at the end is unpredictable, but what I'm most disturbed by is that there are people out there, thinking up things like the hideous head trap, the hand trap and the hypodermic needle trap. Deeply grubby, and definitely not for kids."
"afromme","4","0","0","2 September 2007"," Phew - not really good
","Uhm, well the headline of this comment says it all. Not a good movie. The beginning has another one of those wretched contraptions that made Saw 1 original/noteworthy - and then it all becomes a bit daft and even illogical.<br/><br/>It was made so blatantly obvious that the detective's son will be safe, just like it was made bleedingly obvious that it's not actually a live transmission from the house that the police are watching. In the beginning, I was watching it while also doing work on the computer and I still got that figured out about halfway through the film. Not good. Equally, it's just too predictable that Obi is not going to survive his very first challenge.<br/><br/>And then there's those leaps of (il)logic. Like - a single detective manages to get away with a terminal cancer patient whom he has just beaten up severely. Without being intercepted by one of the SWAT guys abundant inside the house. Without being followed by other police staff. Despite the fact that it probably did take some time to move said beaten-up cancer patient through the house and into the van. And no need to hassle with SWAT/police agents securing the outside of the building - conveniently, there were none (otherwise, they would have a) seen and intercepted him b) been at least informed by walkietalkie). Sure thing, we're only talking about a building in which THE prime suspect for the notorious ""Jigsaw"" cases is being held. Hey, he's terminal, he's got lots of monitors inside the building, no need to secure the outside of that building. D'oh. And no - nobody tries to take up the lead on where that detective goes, nobody so much as hints at a trap or a set-up and nobody is watching him particularly, although it could be anticipated that he might do something unwise as the guy's son is involved. Nope, the detective can just get the Jigsaw guy and leave without anybody caring much, whereas half of the police team stays in the house and the other half is tracking down the place from which the transmission is coming.<br/><br/>But no, that's not enough. As soon as the detective enters the house, it is abundantly clear that he will NOT get out again. Not in Saw 2, anyways. So, with about 15 minutes left before the end of the film, almost every scene is screaming ""sequel!"". Which is quite annoying.<br/><br/>But even that's not all from the repertoire of annoyance the writers could think of - they even put the Dark Side equivalent of ""wise Yoda teaches you"" in there. Amanda went through the jigsaw ordeal before, survived and apparently thought it was a good idea, so she's taking up what monsieur jigsaw started.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that there would be a way of wriggling out of the death of jigsaw (which was imminent) to produce a sequel. There's two alternatives: quickly introduce a scholar-of-jigsaw character _or_ make the sequel a prequel, i.e. make it about something that happened _before_ the ""plot"" of Saw 2. Amazingly, the Saw franchise did more or less both at once.<br/><br/>Have I talked about colour saturation filters and quick cuts (that make the film look like an episode from any given MTV series) yet? Well, there - I just did.<br/><br/>Now, why 4 stars... good question. I watched it on a rather unmotivated Sunday afternoon. It wasn't boring as such, which is a plus on Sunday afternoons. There were also some cringeworthy moments (needles). And, by giving me the urge to write this review, it actually gave me a reason to procrastinate work a little longer."

I absolutely adored Tobin Bell's performance in this film and Jigsaw had a fair script. Everyone else was lacking in these areas. The cop (Donnie Wahlberg) was ridiculously annoying. You wanted to punch him for his impatience and the ending made you want to murder him yourself because of his idiocy. The ending was a twist. Sure. I had actually thought that maybe, just maybe the girl was in on it but then I figured, ""No. That's just silly. The movie would never work."" Ha. Apparently I was wrong because that's how it ended up and let me tell you, I've never heard anything as painful as listening to her voice on the tape player and realizing that the movie was doomed. The plot was fairly predictable and the characters were static and stereotypical. I did like the fact that the kid was found safe and sound in a 'safe place' at the end. Everything else seemed pointless though. The gore was fair play and I cringed in some bits but I ate the bowl of chili and chips that I had until I was full with no negative repercussions. Apparently even the cringe inducing bit of someone slicing the skin off the back of their neck (which I found to be somewhat silly, should have just asked the girl, then killed her) was not gory enough to cause me to lose my lunch. The one redeeming quality was the insight into the mind of the killer and that is why my rating isn't lower. As a sequel this movie has no dice but on it's own it could be considered fair game. In other words, if you're looking for something that lives up to Saw, forget it. If you just want a movie to pass the time with that's better than trying to watch the original movies on the Sci-fi channel, go for it."

","Saw was a stylish, gritty horror film made by two independent Australian film makers. Saw II, like so many other horror sequels, is a bloated, hackneyed Hollywood monstrosity that squanders most of the promise of the original and left me disappointed.<br/><br/>I expect horror films to follow some sort of internal logic. Indeed, the best horror creates its own world and set of rules. Saw II throws logic out the window, resorting to a cheesy montage at the end to explain the obvious plot devices. When you add that to poor pacing, a hyper-kinetic editing style and story holes a mile wide, Saw II makes for unpleasant viewing for anyone except the most uncritical horror fan.<br/><br/>Why do producers cast as many out-of-work actors as possible in a film? Instead of the intense character development of the first movie, Saw II is stuffed with an ensemble of ten people we barely know or care about. To totally ruin any illusion of reality, they jam in Beverly Mitchell (best known as the smiling pastors daughter from TV soap Seventh Heaven) as another hapless victim with perhaps three lines of dialog, wandering aimlessly throughout the film for no apparent reason. Jigsaw's new accomplice is also poorly cast, being obvious to the viewer within minutes but lacking both acting skills and sufficient menace for this key role. For those two sins alone, the casting director deserves to face Jigsaw. <br/><br/>By raising the stakes and expanding Jigsaw's Rube Goldberg contraptions to a seemingly endless labyrinth, the entire premise begins to stagger under its own weight. The earlier Saw contraptions were fiendish but on such a small scale I was willing to suspend disbelief. Saw II had so many gadgets it felt like a Bond movie, and there was none of the tension and mood of the original film. I can accept a huge maze loaded with traps, poison gas and automated thousand pound steel doors built by Dr No and henchmen, but not by a wheelchair bound psycho with a single accomplice!<br/><br/>The police depicted in this film are the real horror. They send a single SWAT team after a high-profile serial killer and criminal genius. The backup tech team takes one hour and forty five minutes to arrive. We hear the officers calling for a bomb squad that never shows up. With everything the police know about Jigsaw's predilections for traps, we are expected to believe these officers are foolish enough to enter his lair without a bomb squad? Even two hours after his arrest, there are only a handful of police in the whole building, Jigsaw himself has not been restrained beyond a pair of handcuffs, and nobody has searched his lair. At this point, the plot begins to closely resemble one of Jigsaw's creaky contraptions, and the viewer realizes it is they, not the actors, caught in a hellish device of torture. When they used the 'closing trapdoor' gag not once, not twice but three times, it dawned on me that I just wanted the victims to die and the movie to be done with.<br/><br/>Horror sequels rarely approach their originals. To no great surprise, the Saw movies have plumbed the depths almost immediately. What shocks me more is the number of positive reviews and the high rating on IMDb. If this is the future of horror movies, I would rather read a book."

","I'm not a big fan of hardcore Horror like this, but I like the first Saw a whole lot. So obviously I wanted to see the second one. but I made the mistake of buying it. In the first Saw movie, there were only two people trapped in the room. But now they added an extra 6 or seven people. which in my opinion made the movie a lot less gripping. But this movie the parts that really turned me off had to do with NO PLOT WHATSOEVER, and dirty, used needles. This movie is worth seeing, if your interested in this stuff. it is most certainly the same style as the first one. Except the first one had a plot, and overall a good story. I don't recommend that you buy this movie until you have seen it before, and liked it immensely. I don't know how you could though. I will most likely choose not to watch the third Saw. because that looks pretty crappy too."

","Seeing Saw as a hit, I couldn't wait to see Saw II. Well, I saw it alright, but not as I expected.Now, Saw II still had its same zest as the first, the crazed mastermind Jigsaw trapping young victims and putting a series of gut-wrenching challenges for them to face and solve in order to stay alive.With all new characters and a twist in plot, it had some holes, but still measures up to its gross out level as before. If I could describe Saw II, it'd be gruesome. I don't know, the horror just wasn't as intense as Saw (Adam's capture = DANG!). Several parts, I guarantee, will make you jump, but others...just sit through. And, wow, those characters were doing TONS of yelling rather than trying to figure out how to solve the puzzles. Not very bloody, and not as scary as before, expect some from Saw II, but don't expect it all."

"Joventino","6","0","0","21 April 2006"," The Saw has gone blunt
","Saw was a well-written piece of work that balanced suspense and drama. There was sufficient gore to keep the audience happy (well, those who came to watch it for the gore) and shocked as well. <br/><br/>Sadly, Saw II does not live up to its predecessor. There are a few key things missing that made Saw such a treat to watch.<br/><br/>The first being character development. This same easy for Saw because the focus was mainly on two individuals. In Saw II, there's quite a few of them and hence not all of them get explored. Heck, the majority of the characters are very obnoxious and antagonistic and it's hard to care for any of them. But this could have been done to make the audience cheer for their deaths.<br/><br/>The next would be suspense. There isn't simply enough of this to keep me shocked or glued to my seat. Plus those who have seen the first one (or Cube) won't be as fearful for their familiarity. The deaths were also more predictable. <br/><br/>I also credit the advertisements for ruining some of the best moments in the film. Why do film ads these days have to ruin the best parts of the film?<br/><br/>There is also a lacking build-up that was present in Saw. But again this problem is an attribute to the number of characters present plus the limited screening time.<br/><br/>What this film maintains however is the great writing. While the film didn't have as much shocking moments as Saw, it has a pretty sweet twist and I give credit to that.<br/><br/>This movie is better credited as a ""slasher flick"" rather than a suspense. This is not to say that the movie is not good. It is still entertaining. I recommend this to anyone who loves gore but to those who are expecting something of the same magnitude as Saw, better not see this or you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>3/5"

","Without a shadow of a doubt the horror genre is my favourite, having said that the amount of ""trashy, teens with fake tits, getting cut up whilst still pouting"" horrors I have witnessed over the past 3 years or so, is vile!! Without trying to cause offence to any of the actors, they are not your stereotypical starlets, they seem to all have ""interesting"" looks as opposed to Paris Hilton lookalikes! This was different, having seem many a horror, i am used to plot turns and twists and can usually spot the killer a mile off.With Saw II you already know who he is. It opens up the film for many more twists. Donnie Wahlberg plays the caring father, recently divorced, who has to play along with the sick Jigsaw. He has to listen to him spill out his vicious story whilst his son is slowly dying from a gas leak in a very spooky house. With horrors I always put myself in the victims shoes, It made me feel uncomfortable to think ""How would it feel to watch your child die as the killer sits opposite you?"" The answer is Id probably faint, or chew his face off!! Overall Id give this film 8/10 it creates a chilling and extremely claustrophobic atmosphere only matched with the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes."

","One of the best horror films I have seen this year that keeps you at the edge of your seat and with a twist at the end you should expect but you never see coming. I watched this film late at night and for the first time in I don't know how long I double locked the front door. This is a film not a movie one that you pick more and more up each time you watch it. A group of people wake to find themselves locked in a house all unknown to each other but they all have one thing in common that they soon discover. Like the cube films (made by the same company) They start by trying to work together but as panic sets in they realise it is survival of the fittest and one realises that in order to survive they have to terminate the others but like in most films the baddie normally gets what's coming. This is a clever film and I understand saw III is in production I do hope that this will be just as good."

","This is the sequel to the bloody SAw and I personally think the series could have gotten away with only making one. The first one actually made you think, as in the second Saw it's basically showcasing the creative and gory ways to kill someone. Mentioning the gore, this is one of the bloodiest movies I have ever seen the violence is in your face and bloody ( e.g. slit throats, attacking an old man, a gun shot to the eyes). There is minimum sexual content, but a few harsh insults to women including things like ""The only door you open is between your legs."". This movie basically focuses on brutal and bloody violence and countless uses of the F-word. I enjoyed this movie but really could have lived without seeing it. I would recommend it if your in for a bloody, and twisted gore fest."

"thomasaaa123","6","0","0","20 March 2006"," An okay effort
","I think the movie's okay but definitely not very interesting. While many people talked about the twist ending, I can't share as much enthusiasm as some feel. I was not too impressed with the twists, and even less so with the story, if there's one.<br/><br/>1) The people locked up in the room were totally 2-dimensional human-shaped cardboard. Besides furnishing us with the minimal info about the criminal background of the captives, nobody bothered to seriously treat them as ""characters"" instead of anonymous guinea pigs used to demonstrate how lethal each trap was. 99% of the lines they said was generic. And it's unfortunate that in the other space-time, the lines delivered by the detectives and the SWAT team captain were equally boring.<br/><br/>2) There's close to zero story in the movie. It's entirely based on the same premise of the original Saw. No new concepts were brought in. The sequel resembled more a long ""deleted scene"" from the original than a new movie.<br/><br/>3) The most surprising development that happened among the captives was the utterly unbelievable behaviors of the Latino guy. Oh well, who would have thought instead of trying to cooperate with all others on the same boat, the Latino guy would get so irritated by the sight of other life forms that he start slaughtering them one by one? What did he gain by shedding blood instead of politely asking the fellow captives to turn around and show him the number? <br/><br/>4) I didn't see the twist coming. It's unexpected, but that unfortunately does not mean it's appreciated. Yes, I didn't expect that the feed was prerecorded. Yes, I didn't expect that Amanda was an accomplice. But did the revelation help explain anything? No. And it's largely because there's no mystery to begin with. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't see much difference whether Amanda was in on it or not. Likewise, what's the point of the whole charade of showing us the feed as if it's taken real-time? If Jigsaw just wanted to trick the detective, wasn't it enough to tell the detective that his son was kidnapped? Why bother with all the video? A good twist might also just re-orient the audience's perspectives and reformed our understanding of the story. In the case of Saw II, the ""twists"" neither added anything to the plot nor showed me a new way to look at what's on the plate. They felt unnecessary.<br/><br/>5) Why nowadays no horror movies could do without fast cuts? A small amount of fast cuts might attenuate the atmosphere, but an excessive amount of them inevitably makes matter worse. On the other hand, of course, a director using lots of fast cuts is a pretty good signal that he's lacking innovative ideas and skills to scare and engross the audience.<br/><br/>Having said all these, I should also add two more things.<br/><br/>First, I'm not against the Saw concepts. I liked the original Saw. It's suspenseful  I was literally on the edge of my seat most of the time I was watching it. Yea I knew the twist was not very credible but I liked how it resolved the whodunit puzzle in a surprising fashion. I applauded the movie makers making a very notable addition to the much-exploited subgenre already crowded by the likes of ""Scream"" and ""Phone Booth."" Second, despite my complaints, I still think Saw II made an okay entertainment. It'd not be memorable, but the occasional thrills would not make the 2-hour viewing time totally regrettable."

","This was one of my favorite horror movies by far. I've seen saw 1 and saw 2, In my opinion saw 2 was better. It Let's you get a look into the killer's personality more. Also shows the personalities of the other main characters. The DVD also contains special features, and I suggest you watch the ""making of the traps"" after watching the movie. it shows how all of jigsaw's traps were made, how the makeup and special effects were done, very interesting.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie that will make you cringe over and over. It is very brutal. If you do not 'scare easily' you will love how this movie will make you scared.

","The first Saw really through me through some spins and caught me off guard for originality, Saw 2 is leagues above the first. Saw 2 runs with the same game based theme as the first, with clues for both the characters and the audience about what might happen next, but it takes the game to a completely different level. Just when things start to come together there is another twist to leave the viewer on the edge of their seat for what may come next. Without seeming to give everything away the movie was made to give it all away, but no one can catch all the clues because they have been pulled so deep into the movie.

"Superunknovvn","6","0","0","12 March 2006"," A huge step down from part 1
","""Saw"" was one of the most surprising and original hit movies of 2004. It had also been fairly cheap to make, so a sequel was produced immediately. The script for ""Saw II"" was derived from an already existing, ""saw-ish"" project that had been rejected for the longest time. After the success of ""Saw"" producers were reminded of that script and decided to adjust it so it would fit the story of Jigsaw and his crazy little world. At times this shows because the movie doesn't quite have the same feel as the first one. It's seems more like a mixture of ""Cube"" and ""Home Alone"".<br/><br/>A group of people is stuck in a house full of deadly traps. Needless to say most of them have their little secrets and they start to distrust each other after a while. Unfortunately, the characters' motivations are as predictable as they are unbelievable. Writers needed a little bit more drive so they decided that the group would consist of psychos who act unreasonably all the time, which makes for a couple of silly scenes.<br/><br/>Like in part one, there are two parallel story lines in ""Saw II"", but the storytelling is far less exciting than the first time around. At this point Jigsaw has just become too much of a super-brain. This killer is not only a genius, but apparently he also has the time and the money to realize each and every one of his sick fantasies. I know one shouldn't be nitpicky when it comes to such logical observations in psycho thrillers, but I really think they went a bit too far this time.<br/><br/>""Saw II"" is also a step down when it comes to the lazy direction, the annoying editing and the less than average acting. The set decoration is a joke. You can literally see how cheap this production was. The rooms look so fake that I thought I was watching a TV-movie at times.<br/><br/>Yes, the death traps are gruesome and pretty creative. Yes, it is a torture to watch Jigsaw's victims die. And yes, one of the twists is enjoyably surprising, but the final solution is too unbelievable to be satisfying. The whole story seems forced. It's meant to match our expectations and at the same time blow our minds, but the problem is that the formula is already getting old. We've seen it before and better. ""Saw II"" isn't a catastrophe, but it can't compete with it's predecessor on any level."

I loved his age.

But I missed the ""old man"". They made him ""younger"" in mannerisms instead of more on the older, painful side as implied in the first one. And most of all -- I hate that 'they' are trying to make this into a franchise instead of leaving it alone.<br/><br/>Saw II also contains a bit of the social commentary of the first and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also has that story that you never see coming which makes 'john' such a great character and those around him so oblivious to his games. But oblivious in a smart way.<br/><br/>Forgive me if I am a bit upset with where this is going - it just seems so ""money grubbing studio"" to me, for such a great story and idea. Obviously, young audiences accepted an ""older lead character"". Even though I am aware that 'john' could NOT go on for long because of his predicament.

","But sadly a litany of endless dialogue interrupts what otherwise might have been a worthwhile and bloody sequel to the original ""Saw"". Though the performances by the leads, Tobin Bell as Jigsaw, Donnie Wahlberg as disgruntled cop Eric Matthews, and Shawnee Smith as the resourceful Amanda, are all outstanding, this film mires down in endless build-up and far too little action. The visual aspects of the film are superb, as with the first film, and the many devices designed to make the deaths gory and startling are great as well. I hope that if this film spawns another sequel it will deal more with the game players and how they play the game and much less with the motivation of the killer.

My sole interest in seeing Saw 2 was to find out if they would catch that sick, self-righteous S.O.B. who kept putting people in these traps. Well, you had to know that catching him wouldn't be easy and it would make for some excellent drama. I give this movie credit for separating itself a bit from part one. I had a big problem with Jigsaw and his traps. I didn't have a problem with him being a nut job with the brilliance enough to set such elaborate and deadly traps, I had a problem with him being an engineer, medical scientist, AS WELL as a psychology expert so as to know exactly what people would do in certain situations. I generally have a problem with movies that have a genius that sets up traps that rely on people doing precisely what they predicted they would do.

","I had my doubts about this movie since sequels tend to be total flops. The first scene was ""eye"" catching but the rest of the movie was the same old thing. The acting was not all there but at least it was attempted by certain actors. The mind playing games were good and once they were solved, the quick recap at the end of the movie leading to the answer of who and why was well released. The gore was there, the unnecessary gore was also there(if it wasn't it wouldn't be a Saw movie)This sequel is good the first time you watch it but not the second time since you've solved the puzzle already. A second viewing of the movie would be just for the blood splattering scenes."

","The first Saw was decent but had its problems as well. Part 2 follows suit and emerges as a polished, highly watchable thriller that could have been better than it actually is. In this entry police, led by gruff, crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) interrogate a very ill Jigsaw (eerily played by Tobin Bell), who has Eric's estranged teenage son and some others trapped inside a booby-trapped house of horrors. Shawnee Smith (who had a bit in the original) gives a surprisingly convincing performance as reformed junkie Amanda, who is also trapped in the house. There's plenty of gore and a few major plot twists along the way. The killer's moralizing gets to be a bit much and the scenes with Jigsaw and the detectives are uneven and heavy-handed. However, the scenes taking place inside the deadly house are taut, suspenseful and very well played. All in all Saw II is a good movie, just not a great one."

","Having never seen Saw, I went into Saw II expecting a new, thought-provoking level of horror; a psychological thriller. Instead, the movie contains the same lackluster, unoriginal death scenes as so many others on the market. The first scene of the movie was by far the best. The only part of the rest of the entire movie that holds anything more than nominal interest is the explanation behind Jigsaw's motivation. I will concede that the ending was not expected, however, it was as non-phenomenal as the previous hour and a half. I would recommend watching this movie, but not if you are in the mood for a true horror story, rather, more as an interesting, if somewhat bloody, action-drama."
"DonFishies","6","0","0","22 February 2006"," Fails to capture the spirit of the original film
","Saw II is clever like the first, but definitely not as good.<br/><br/>Whereas the first was original, and genuinely scary at times, this movie just fails to live up to it. It's an alright movie, don't get me wrong. But nowhere near on par with the original (which wasn't all that amazing to begin with).<br/><br/>The acting is alright for what it is. Donnie Wahlberg does Cary Elwes proud with the really bad overacting, and everyone else just makes an attempt with what they have to work with. Adding more characters was not a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>But the entire movie just feels a bit rushed. Yeah, there are many nods to the original film, but the rest of it is just there. Characters are dismissed all too quickly, and the characters that stay are not the least bit interesting. There are a few shock moments, but it loses a lot of the terror the original packed. The terror made it jump so far ahead of modern horror films, especially ones coming from the United States, and it just is not the same here. Those few moments are also marred by some fast editing that really takes away from it all. The ending rocks hard when it comes, but everything leading up to it just feels a little forced, like they had the ending, but just needed to come up with some filler to get to it.<br/><br/>While both movies failed to really captivate, this one just doesn't leave the same feeling with you afterwards that the original did. And that's a shame.<br/><br/>6/10."

","I watched Saw 2 on DVD the other night. I have to say that this one was relatively AWESOME than saw 1, in its storyline, plots and filming sequence. I can't believe that some people actually thought it was trashy/junky, even boring? No matter how they came up with those words to describe such great thriller, I would have to say that Saw 1 & 2 is the best thriller sequel that has ever been made since Friday the 13th. I loved how they put in a lot more traps to the movie, comparing to Saw 1, Saw 2 had more ""richness"" to it. Referring back to the movie, Amanda was literally dumped into a syringe pit filled up with dangerously sharp needles to look for the key to the door. And she just went nuts in there. There were so many scenes like this that dealt with human nature. The director really did a good job on depicting such point. Amazingly, Amanda was the ""wicked"" one, who continued and will continue to finish jigsaw's left off unfinished business. Overall, Saw 2 is definitely a great thriller/slasher to watch even after decades."

","I guess nobody was surprised when Lions Gate announced they were making a sequel to Saw. The first part, despite being a Se7en rip-off, was the most original horror movie released in the last few years, and was a breath of fresh air to the genre. Fortunately, the second part is almost as good.<br/><br/>This time around, we have 8 people locked in a house. They must find a way out before inhaling too much of a lethal nerve gas and die. Detective Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg), is the father of one of the hostages, and he only has 2 hours to save his son.<br/><br/>The best thing about Saw was its originality. We spent the whole movie watching 2 people trying to get out of the bathroom they were locked in. Saw II tried to follow the same footsteps by having 8 people locked in a house, but obviously, the originality of the prequel is now gone. In addition, I felt there were too many characters in the house. Therefore, we didn't get to know these characters well, and so we didn't care for them. Also, I thought some of the characters in the house didn't have choices, while Saw was all about the choices we make.<br/><br/>But these flaws aside, Saw II was better on every other level. Remember how Cary Elwes gave overacting a whole new meaning in the first part? Well, the acting is far better this time. I especially liked the performances of Wahlberg and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw). The sequel was also more shocking. Two scenes in particular will make you cringe; when one of the characters is thrown into a needles pit, and the death-mask scene. Also, the twist ending, although a part of it was somehow predictable, made much more sense this time, and is a great set-up for a third part. And finally, the film had the best opening scene of the year, and featured a great homage the Saw.<br/><br/>So, I'd definitely recommend Saw II, it's not as good as Saw, but it will keep on the edge of your seat for the whole time."

","I find it ironic that ""Saw II"" is rated 'R,' yet the demographic that was the most impressed and thus has dragged it up to its cumulative rating on the IMDb site is those under aged 18. Of course, for authentic fans of the horror genre, and for those who admired the powerful message so effectively delivered in the film ""Seven,"" the original ""Saw"" may have worked, but this beginning of yet another suffocating franchise in the bowels of horror film history is yet just another forgettable sequel.<br/><br/>In this one, Donnie Wahlberg (yes, formerly of that New Kids on the Block rubbish- perhaps the most witty aspect of this story is that he is now cast as a father of a rebellious and bitter child) plays a detective who has captured the elusive Jigsaw architect (see below for elaboration on why I refer to him as this), but who is now set in another game to play- to save a whole group of victims. As the coming events play out, Donnie himself is the target of Jigsaw in a twist so ridiculous, you have to have been born with part of your brain missing to have missed it.<br/><br/>As for the omnipotent Jigsaw Architect, who boasts that he's never killed anyone (which is a lie- just by sheerly leaving Adam (Leigh Whannel) in the original chained to a pipe and closing the door behind him, he has in effect murdered him. But lets buy into the little game-is anyone else as fed up as I am with this ridiculous fiasco? Once again we are treated to the fact that Jigsaw has inoperable cancer, and to his holier than thou proclamation ""those who don't value life don't deserve life."" And what makes him a fair judge of who is deserving and who is not? I know that someone will come along with some malarkey that legitimizes this story line, and from the way this one ended, the former druggie who is the only survivor of his diabolical planning (interesting that he's never killed anyone, but only ONE PERSON has ever survived his plans) in this one decides to assume the legacy. I guess the near brush with death didn't actually teach her any lessons worth learning- like don't try and kill others! But my biggest pet peeve with this movie is that the original managed to be the sleeper hit of 2004, making over $100 million, and doing it on a budget that shoe stringed on everything, including the driving effects. What does it have to show for it? The sequel incorporates the same cheap and cheesy effects, and actually limits itself in settings, and in actors. Not one actor in this film matches the caliber of Danny Glover in the original...and even though audiences will no doubt notice a few more familiar faces in this film, its only because there are more faces.<br/><br/>A sad and pathetic effort on this one...not even worthy of your attention because it doesn't even have the originality of the first movie."

Also, you, as the audience member are also playing along, as you try to figure out what has been going on the whole time. The smart part about it, is you wont realize it till the end when you are really blowed away.

","This was most definitely the most amazing movie I've seen in my life. My first time seeing it was just two days ago because my friends and I failed at sneaking in, so I had to watch it at my house instead of the theater -- THANK GOODNESS. I'm not usually very phased by scary movies, but this one had me holding onto a teddy bear, no joke. When I saw the first Saw, I didn't think there was a movie on EARTH better. Saw II just blew Saw out of sight. To be able to intermix extreme gory horror with cleverness and wittiness is an amazing trait in a movie. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, the killer is apprehended. John is being watched by the cops, but they soon find out he already has more victims being tortured at those moments. They keep John around to try to convince him to tell them where the victims are, one of which is a cop's son. As the eight victims inhale the gas of the house they were put in, it's up to the cop to get something out of John. ""Oh yes, there will be blood."" <-- Perfect for the trailer. And oh yes, there WAS blood. A lot of it.<br/><br/>The ending to this movie was unbelievable. It really blew me away. It was something NO ONE would have expected.

In a way this is really disappointing though because this was pretty much the film I was hoping the first one would be when i saw it in theaters after i read so many good reviews for it. I was very disappointed by the first film and when i saw this in theaters, i didn't read any reviews of it because i felt this film would be a long, scary, confusing, gross, and loud mess like the first one is. Well, it is long, scary, confusing, gross, and loud, like the first, but it is anything but a mess.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is much like the first. Seven or eight people are trapped in a room inside of a big decaying house filled with very disturbing deathtraps. The people must work together to escape, but unfortunately, there is a time limit. The house is filled with a weird poison that will kill them very soon.<br/><br/>There is much more to the story than just this simple plot line. There are flashbacks throughout the film which was really distracting in the first film but much more fleshed out and organized.<br/><br/>The ""Jigsaw"" killer's identity is explored much more and adds solidly to the plot. His character is developed very well and he doesn't feel like a plot device like he did in the first film.<br/><br/>The characters are much more likable compared to the everlasting crybabies in the first film, but not likable enough to have you crying when one of them is killed, which many of them will be.<br/><br/>The gore is extremely repugnant and revolting, but, again, it is added to be integral and flesh out the nature of the film more. There is at least one scene to me that, while i successfully sat through it, was very hard to swallow and made me want to look away. It worked though.<br/><br/>The film's ending is, again, a twist. But it isn't the kind of twist that will give you nightmares, like the first one did, instead its the kind of ending that gives you a really good accomplished feeling. You feel good when it happens.<br/><br/>This film, despite being a sequel, manages to be better, stronger, gorier, scarier, and even funnier than the original. This gives me great hope in this growing series. Looks like it might just have a chance at being a pretty solid horror film trilogy like SCREAM and not like Friday THE 13th. I have great faith in the SAW series and i look forward to seeing the next in this series.<br/><br/>Rated R for grisly violence and gore, terror, language and drug content."

","*THIS HAS THE STORY SPOILER, WARNING*<br/><br/>This is without a doubt, the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. If you've the first one, you'll think you know the definition of gross. But after watching this, the first looks like a puppy dog. <br/><br/>*SPOILER WARNING* The most disgusting part is the part where the girl from the first movie falls into the pit of syringes. It's not the fact that she fell into the syringes, it's the fact that after she falls in, you see them stick out of her arms and legs, and you think ""OOOO, that must hurt SOOO good"". Other than that, black guy's death was pretty grisly, and the oven one was pretty messed up, too. Oh yeah, and the girl that reaches into the box looks SO painful. OUCH.<br/><br/>*SPOILER WARNING, STORY GIVEN AWAY* I once again warn you, if you are planning to watch the movie, skip this part. If you read it, it will ruin the entire suspense of the movie. <br/><br/>The plot is that the old man (aka ""Jigsaw"") let's himself get caught ""in the act"" by police. You may wonder why at first, but as you watch, it becomes apparent why. Jigsaw wants the victims to live. They all die(except two, which I talk about), but he wanted two of them to live. Actually, it's automatic that two of them live. When you watch the video feeds on the TV's set up in the cage room, you think it's all happening, but it's not. In fact, everything you watch is not even live. It was all taped, and is being played now by Jigsaw(Jigsaw is extremely smart, in case you haven't noticed). The cop, who is the father of one of the victims, had also set up the other victims for murder, possession, etc. and sent them to jail, even though they were innocent. Well, actually, they weren't, but if the cop hadn't set them up, they probably wouldn't have gone to jail. Anyway, the cop is sent into a frenzy because he under the knowledge that his son is gonna die in the house. By the way, the house is rigged with a nerve gas that will, in two hours, cause you to die from losing blood. The gas will cause blood to literally pour out of you. So the idea is to get out in under two hours. Of course, not everyone survives, and there are gruesome, terrible deaths. <br/><br/>*ENDING SPOILER WARNING* The ending is once again a spectacular finish. Not as good as the first one(nothing could beat the first one), nut still quite good. It is set in the Bathroom from the first movie, complete with the corpses of the original two people, and the foot that the Doctor cut off. The girl from the first movie stabs the cop with the needle after disguising herself as a ""Pigface"" and hiding inside the bathtub. The needle causes the cop to lose consciousness, and he slowly falls asleep. <br/><br/>The son turns out to be, and I quote Jigsaw, ""In a safe and secure area"". The son is actually right there behind where the cop and Jigsaw were talking, locked inside a safe, which unlocks at the 2 Hour mark. The girl from the first movie has sold her soul to the devil, and announces that she will take over the reign of Jigsaw. She shuts the bathroom door, and the movie ends with the cop trapped inside.<br/><br/>I'm anxious to see the cop trapped in Saw 3. Also, apparently, the original Jigsaw is not dead, so it should be interesting, and should give the writers something refreshing since they have a new Jigsaw. I personally thought this was better than the first movie, even though the first one had more puke-fest scenes of death and torture, as far as I'm concerned. My final comment on this movie is in Saw 3, put more disgusting traps and things like that. They are truly great ideas, not matter how gross they are."

Though Cary Elwes's acting is dreadful in ""Saw"", it had the ending that made your jaw drop. In this one, the acting was only slightly better, but the twist didn't quite have that same effect. I think it's the ""been there, done that"" phenomenon. Hear me out on this one. Remember seeing the first ""Final Destination""? I loved the whole ""death's design"" thing. And it scared the bejeezus out of me. The second one was pretty much the same, but it wasn't nearly as scary. I'm figuring the 3rd is really repetitive. It was the same with this movie. Once you saw the unique and frightening death traps of ""Saw"", the ones in ""Saw II"" just weren't as scary. Sure they were gory, but it didn't have the same fear factor. It was just watching the same movie over again. The twist was different, but was more ""oh, how interesting"" rather than ""Oh man!!"".

There is nerve gas running through the house and if they don't get out soon they will all be dead. Not all of them die from the gas as one dies from a bullet through the head (nice) and another from from a baseball bat with nails in it to the back of the head (okay). How are these people connected? Let's see, they were once, at one point, in jail. All except for the young boy whose father is a cop. The same cop who put these people in jail. Are you following me? Shawnee Smith (she's great) returns as Amanda, the girl from the first who had the reverse bear trap on her head. Why is she in this movie you may ask? Well, I won't tell you that. Oh, by the way, I knew how this movie was going to end before I watched it. Thank you to that person in movie chat who ruined it for me.

A guy brings a certain amount of people to a place where no one could reach them, acusses them of murder indirectly, and slowly kills everyone. <br/><br/>But there's a twist to it like Saw 1: The murderer was in the room/place the whole time with people knowing of the murderer being there (He was not hidden, He was secretly with them).<br/><br/>And Then There Were None is not a horror movie, but i strongly urge anyone to try to find the Russian version an make the comparison. It'll be worth your while because it's a great story/movie/premise. <br/><br/>This also brings up another point... Has Hollywood really run out of original ideas? Someone please try to save me.

","As far as movies go and horror movie in general I love this one. It has everything that makes a good horror movie. The acting and characters are very well done. the methods of torture and death are original and bloody, or just gruesome. The movie gets the point of the traps being horrible and gruesome without having to show to much of the gore, with like all good horror movies (i.e. Psycho (1960) directed by none other than Alfred Hitchcock). Tobin Bell is awesome as they get. His performance is one that rivals Anthony Perkins in Psycho and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Donnie Wahlberg is one to be commended for his performance as the corrupt police detective. Shawnee Smith not only is beautiful but talented as well. To pull off her role in Saw and now Saw 2 and also be able to roles like Linda on the hit show ""Becker"" (1998) TV Series, I just can't say enough about her. All the little twists add up to a hell of film that should be watched in a cold, dark room."

","The Saw movies consist a pure progress of the Horror films. The Jigsaw killer using TV monitors, recorders and some sadistic methods to torture people. Having a pure and maniac philosophy, the Jigsaw kills only people who don't appreciate their blessings. He isn't a serial stupid killer like some freaks from Hollywood. Some bad horror movies are known such as Freddy v.s Jason but the ""Saw"" movies made me gained trust in the horror industry. Such independent movies represent a better evolution because they don't have to respond to some ""certain"" CRITTERS in order to make the movie a Hollywood product.

","Gory horror suspense mystery race against time movie does everything right which its predecessor got wrong.<br/><br/>Saw II is a direct follow up to the overrated original which featured a psychotic maniacal serial killer who set up traps for his victims to fall into. They could get out of them, but at a huge personal cost.<br/><br/>Saw II reveals the killer after the original very much kept him as a hidden figure, and places him right in front of the cops who've tracked him down after he purposefully left a clue to his whereabouts on his latest victim's body. Once the cops find him they discover to their horror that he appears to have set up another trap, this time involving someone close to the main cop.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is a race against time to find the location of the latest trap and save the day.<br/><br/>This being Saw, however, nothing is as it appears and twists and turns rule the roost.<br/><br/>It's fair to say this is a much more satisfying movie than the first one was. The acting is acceptable enough without being Oscar standard, but particularly from Jigsaw (The bad guy) it has a nice sinister and dark edge to it. Everyone is suitably stressed out and while there is a stereotype or two in the mix, the characters are generally pretty good and reasonably well thought out.<br/><br/>The direction is really excellent, so good in fact it's completely un-noticeable. The movie flows at a superb pace and never bores for a second. The cinematography isn't really the name of the game in a movie like this, such is its claustrophobic indoor nature.<br/><br/>However, what *is* the name of the game is gore. Well, not so much gore as pain. Saw devised ingenious ways of depicting how painful death could be. The various traps portrayed yet crueler ways of hurting a victim, and of murdering them in the most repugnant and toe curling ways.<br/><br/>Well Saw II takes this further and has many sequences to make your skin crawl - the level of agony shown is quite disturbing at times. It goes without saying horror fans will be in their element with the sheer imagination on show in this one.<br/><br/>Add to that the all round helplessness and general despair on offer, and you have a pretty smart movie with lashings of dark overtones.<br/><br/>Very good and recommended. But you do need to have fairly strong resilience to the content."

","A while back I found myself in English class trying to read some King when a nearby group's conversation gradually changed the topic to horror movies. That's when I first heard about Saw and how it's apparently one of the scariest and goriest movies ever made. I was skeptical and took my sweet time getting to it. After the initial watch I was a tad bit disappointed since Saw was not a horror movie. It had horror elements but it was supposed to be more of a mystery and on that ground it failed miserably. The ending was totally out of the left field and quite frankly I don't think it was even all that realistic.<br/><br/>I gave Saw some time and it grew on me a bit, not one of my favorites but I am now able to respect it for what it is. Saw II on the other hand was definitely a few steps down. Coming into the movie we know how Jigsaw sets up games of torture to test his victims. We know that there are going to be clever traps that involve people turning against each other and I guess we now know that there's going to be a dumb implausible twist at the end (though I admit it's a bit better in this one).<br/><br/>Saw II really does suffer from a ""been there, done that"" attitude. It also suffers from being too much like a horror movie. The first film at least tried to be smart; this sequel is just a brutal slasher flick. Hell they even have a stereotypical axe murdered running around at one point. With better writing this content would work but almost everything on display has been done before.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being a bit too hard on this film. Most sequels do suffer from being too familiar. That's not to say it's all bad, in fact there are quite a few clever little scenes that impressed even me. The pool of syringes was memorable and Jigsaw was an interesting yet slightly familiar character (was it just he or did he give off a weird Hannibal Lecter vibe?) So as you can see, a lot of things have been changed for this sequel unfortunately these changes are not the ones that needed to be made. Rather than trying to expand the formula they should have made an effort to fix the things that were wrong with the first one. The camera work for instance. It tries to be ""cool"" by being wild and all over the place with nifty rock music blaring but it just seems silly to me, same with the car chases that were sped up, I actually laughed out loud during these scenes.<br/><br/>Another thing would be the acting. I know it's a horror movie and they never have good acting but it was just so bad. I not once felt for any of these characters, well except Jigsaw who was very well portrayed by Tobin Bell. Yet again, Jigsaw was the villain, we're not supposed to care about the villain.<br/><br/>I suppose my review may be a bit misleading considering how little good I have to say about the film. I'll admit it's not that bad when compared to other slasher flicks and there's probably enough to keep you entertained for it's running time, just don't expect it to blow your socks off.<br/><br/>My review from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=saw2"

","** I added the spoiler warning, but trust me, it wasn't necessary. So please read on :) **<br/><br/>I was scared, no ... terrified that they (read: idiot producers in Hollywood) were going to f*ck this up. But I'm glad to say that they didn't.<br/><br/>The first Saw became big by word of mouth, and rightly so. It was a low-key thriller that dragged you into the darkest corners of your soul and then shocked you with ""that ending"".<br/><br/>Now here's what the creators didn't do: they didn't go overboard. No huge budgets were used, no overblown special effects, no Will Smith-like superstars. They stayed true to the spirit of the original. And that's largely due to the fact that the writer of the original was brought in to adjust an already existing screenplay. A good call, because the movie's gritty opening grabs you by the balls (or any other body part) and refuses to let go until you've seen the result of another sick jigsaw game.<br/><br/>For the sake of surprise I won't talk about the storyline. It was a relief to see that Hollywood still knows how to make a decent sequel. The setting may not be wildly original, and the characters aren't that bright either **(you know you're dealing with booby traps, then why crawl into an enclosed furnace?!)** but the enthusiasm of everyone involved just bursts from the screen.<br/><br/>To close I just want to say this: you HAVE to see the original first if you fully want to enjoy yet another surprise ending to another more than qualified gore thriller. 7/10"

"ala1993","6","0","0","22 December 2005"," where are the characters?
","There are both negative and positive things to say about Saw 2. Negative first: same problem as almost every horror, namely that there is no character exploration whatsoever. Perhaps many people will watch this for the grisly deaths and injuries, but at what point do we find this horrific if we do not care about the characters who are dying? We know a few sparse facts about them, all of which rarely go beyond 'they were all in prison', and it doesn't take much to work out their link early on. What reason do any of them have to live beyond life itself (even if they are, apparently, supposed to realise this)? Positive? Well, the sense of fear is managed fairly well. The urgency, while difficult to empathise with, is certainly demonstrated. It is just a pity that the characters are two-dimensional, and thus offer nothing with which to relate.<br/><br/>Overall: not as good as Saw 1, which was tighter and more careful and had better characters (even Cary Elwes). Also, less bloody and shocking. However, perhaps still an important landmark for anyone wanting to make a really shocking horror film."
"Malamut","7","0","0","4 December 2005"," saw 2 not as good as the first one
","When i heard that Saw would have a sequel i was very happy awaiting another masterpiece to come to the world.And i had solid reasons. Saw was one of the best thrillers i had ever seen.The strongest feature of that movie was its brilliant plot but it had many other advantages, too. Is saw 2 going to be better or as usually happens worse than the first part?Definitely it is not a bad sequel. Actually it is pretty damn good.It is scary. It has a decent plot.Some good actors.A lot of suspense and extreme situations that will definitely catch your attention. That was not the kind of movie i expected, though.The first one was very realistic with few exceptions. The second is far more unrealistic in many different aspects of the plot. And in addition it contains some even fantastic elements.And the blood is too much as well. There are new shocking ways of dying but not as terrifying as those unforgettable moments from the first one. My basic point is that the second film has gone into the wrong direction. Everything that was a major advantage of SAW 1 is somehow distorted in the second part.The stress is too much on the physical rather than the emotional and psychological state of the characters. The second part i not as intelligent as the first one.It is pretty much a horror movie. It is a little bit elementary. Still it is one of the best movies i have seen recently and it is worth watching. But when you have seen a masterpiece usually you expect more from the sequel. That is the horrible destiny of the sequels. They always bear the weight of fans'expectations. Though this movie is not my type it is good.I have one last thing to say: do not make more saw sequels, please.It will be too much of a distortion, i believe!"

","-CONTAINS SPOILERS- Instead of repeating what has already been said, I am going to counter some of the reasons certain users said this move was ""horrible"". I am just doing this to show they have no idea what they are talking about. First, some were saying the characters in the film did not communicate and spent the whole time arguing. Not true. They all had an attitude because they were all formers prisoners. Name one prisoner that would be happy-go-lucky about the fact they are gonna die. They communicated quite well, and the on-screen chemistry between the characters was intense and realistic. As for saying the crazy testosterone fueled drug dealer started killing people once he found out the numbers were on their back of their necks instead of just asking, I would say watch the movie again. He plainly tells all of the characters simply to turn around, and they run in a panic because he is obviously insane. After watching him pick up Amanda and throw her in a pit of needles, I would be scared to. The truth of the matter is, the only person he killed attacked him first. He simply told the man to turn around, and the man started beating him up out of fear. And how can you say this movie was predictable? Please, no explanation required for that one. Plot holes? If there are any of those, they are rare and unnoticeable as they did a very good job filling in the holes. This movie wasn't low budget like the first one so it's not as interesting? What kind of logic is that I may ask. How does that take away from the fact the movie was well developed, fast paced, gripping, and horrifying? Why compare a movie to its original? The movie is amazing standing alone. The lighting is not as good as Saw? Same grimy feeling, same dark camera, and same sort of angles and shots make it virtually the same feel. I would like one logical reason how this movie at all sucked. My review? This movie has genuinely tense moments, and will keep you guessing until the last frame. The acting is above average, and the Jigsaw character is absolutely chilling. It is fast paced and packs a punch with every scene. I watch motion pictures to be entertained, and this movie certainly did the job. My eyes did not leave the screen the entire film. In fact, it had me leaning towards the screen in a dumb gaze for its short but effective 93 minutes. The cinematography was outstanding as was the directing and dark script. The ideas are truly thought provoking and the setting is disturbing to say the least. The editing was perfect as was the lighting. As far as horror movies go, this is one of the best. Take a look at this one for a bone-chilling good time."

Since Jigsaw is dying from Cancer. An stubborn detective (Donnie Wahlberg) is trying to built a relationship with his troubled son (Erik Knudsen).

Watch for film horror/fantasy critic:John Fallon (from ""arrowinthehead.com"") in a cameo as a S.W.A.T. Video Technician. This script was originally written by the director, which it had nothing to do with ""Saw"". Leigh Whannell, who played ""Adam"" in the original. Which Whannell re-wrote the script with the director.

","Note to all the 50+ year old critics who are still single and spend most of their time in arthouses praising the subtext of Oscar-contending foreign films: this movie isn't intended for you. You might want to keep that in mind the next time you insist on reviewing it just so you can lambaste the gullibility of its target audience.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm going to make this real simple for you readers. Are you actually part of Saw II's target audience? Did you enjoy the original? If so, then I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this sequel. If not, then direct your time and money elsewhere. It's not a complicated process.<br/><br/>Let me make it even clearer: the opening scene involves a man with a trapjaw device hooked up to his face. He has a very short amount of time to get the key to unlock it before the device snaps shut and uses his skull as a pin cushion. The real kick to all this? The key is buried in his face, below his eye. But hey, he has a knife he can use to dig it out! I'm sure there's no need for me to point out that it's not a pretty scene. This is either your flavor of frappuccino or not.<br/><br/>Being a sequel, Saw II has no choice but to be looked upon with a skeptical eye. Sequels always start with that handicap. I enjoyed Saw (especially considering its LOW budget and less-than-stellar cast), so when a sequel was announced about 12.3 seconds after Saw made a profit on opening night, I had my doubts. The question had to be asked, is there a story to be told or just money to be made? <br/><br/>There's no doubt that there's money to be made here, but thankfully the story doesn't suffer just for the sake of making a healthy profit against yet another small budget ($4 million). The main element of Saw II's story that really gripped me is its intense unpredictability. A lot of that is due to the fact that you likely won't recognize most of the cast. That's fine with me. If you stick the 5'4"" Tom Cruise in that room then there's no doubt that he's going to figure out all the puzzles and save the day. However, put such no-names as Lyriq Bent and Tim Burd in there and you know everybody's fair game! <br/><br/>The premise isn't much different than its predecessor - Jigsaw is one messed up individual who is dying of cancer, and he's putting people in nasty situations to find out what lengths they'd go to in order to survive. But what I like about the new group of victims is that they all have something in common. To make things a little more complicated, they also have a connection to Donnie Wahlberg. Are they disgruntled New Kids on the Block fans who still feel they're owed refunds? You'll have to watch to find out.<br/><br/>So is this sequel better than the original? It's hard to say. There are definitely areas that have been improved - the acting, for example. I'm not going to claim that the acting is across-the-boards fantastic, but overall it is better than the original. Nobody attempts the over-the-top act that Cary Elwes tap danced upon us. I particularly liked the interaction between Jigsaw (whom we see a LOT more of) and Donnie Wahlberg. Both guys put in fine performances.<br/><br/>But the main advantage that the original still owns over the sequel is its ending. I felt Saw's climax was possibly the most exciting, most intense 10-15 minutes of any movie of 2004. Saw II doesn't end on quite the same pace, but it still goes out with a pretty loud bang. The suspense, tension, and painful-to-watch gore moves along at a consistent clip, and by the time it all wraps up we're delivered a couple of clever twists and really cool tie-ins to the original. Just keep in mind that this ain't no riblet that needs a clean picking and you should be fine.<br/><br/>Just be forewarned that like needles on a chalkboard, there are some scenes that will make you tense up and feel the pain. All I'll say is when you see a big group of hypodermic needles appear on screen then go ahead and start preparing yourself. Get in your best squint-mode and be ready to squirm."

The real surprise is Donnie Wahlberg who for me proved he is an actor after showing signs of it in his cameo in the Sixth Sense. He impressed me much more than I expected. By the way, the ending really does rock and sets up even more sequels if they want to do them.

It was a devilish cocktail of a great plot with many turns and thrills, solid acting, impressive cinematography and most of all, psychotic frightful tests Jigsaw made his ""patients"" go through. ""Saw II"" feels a bit off from this, trying hard to maintain and even surpass the level of ""Saw"", but the bar the latter set is surprisingly high and although this movies mainly sticks to the same formula (it was even made for peanuts of a budget like the first one) the intensity and originality are GONE!!! No doubt this is because a different director took over, which is NEVER good with successful movies-I will die of shock when a sequel not made by the same director as the original is better.<br/><br/>""Saw II"" holds on fairly strong (especially considering the above statement), but the characterization of the ""test subjects"" (for the lack of a better word/expression) is nowhere to be found. This, later on in the movie, doesn't prove to be a wise choice because I just couldn't care less who would make it out alive-compared to the original where I broke a sweat before Cary Elwes even started tightening his shirt above his ankle. I will applaud the plot, and the way it's going to progress into another sequel, but somebody lost all the imagination that made the ""tests"" in the first one so chilling to watch. That was the best part, damn it! Overall, ""Saw II"" feels as if I've already seen all of this before somewhere and that's what makes it fail as a sequel. The cast doesn't stand out (which it probably even shouldn't, but their performances are weaker than not), Beverly Mitchell just feels all-the-way wrong among them going for that ""don't want to be type-cast"" thing, and Jigsaw could have had a script worthy of his screen presence to enlighten us with his fu...d-up philosophy of appreciating life.<br/><br/>7/10-Appreciated the plot unraveling, thought the rest was weaker than in the original."

","Jigsaw is still on his conquest to help change the human race; one person at a time. He believes that we all lack that instinctive sense of survival, testing us to see whether we will shed as much blood needed to keep our lives. In the opening we see his newest victim come to a bloody end, but he was part of a bigger attack; Agent Matthhews. Jigsaw has a new batch of victims; but instead of two its eight people this time, including Matthews son. They are trapped in a house and are breathing in a deadly nerve gas. Now they must all play their set games in order to receive an antidote or die a slow painful death.<br/><br/>The first saw movie had one of the most original concept ideas for a movie in a long time. But the overall film itself was a let down. Though it had a winning formula to it. For Saw II, they just took the same formula, tweaked it abit and gave us a rehash of the original. The only thing really different is the increase of people in jigsaw's game and a location change. Instead of elaborating on the concept they played it safe to give us what we have already seen before in the first one.<br/><br/>The acting is so flat, they don't evoke much sympathy for their characters. You don't care what really happens to them, no matter how brutal or bloody of an end it is. Darren Lynn Bousman's direction is a complete copy of James Wan's direction of Saw, instead of giving it his own distinct style, which would have separated it more from Saw. The mood is dark and dirty, but it doesn't have that claustrophobic feel to it, so its not that intense. This does have a lot more violence in it, but its not that disturbing; its to over the top so it lose that impact. The most disturbing scene, 'the needle in the haystack', was the one with the least amount of blood, there was hardly any blood, and it worked so much better for it.<br/><br/>Just like the first Saw, i was stumped by the twist. It does come right out and punches you in the face; but the twist here wasn't as hard hitting. You have some of the ending already pieced together by the end, but its still surprising, and it does once again leave it open for a third saw to come.<br/><br/>I give this film though the benefit of the doubt, its still one of the best ideas in a film, but the overall package just doesn't give it the impact and disturbing nature it was aiming for."

I was disappointed. The creativity and complexity of the first movie was gone and replaced with formulaic good-looking people. Not that the acting was stellar in the first movie, but the characters were as believable as the story allowed them to be. ""Saw II"" contained very static characters with a weak string tying them together. If the characters themselves weren't flimsy enough, they were put through a plot line that did not require so many victims, making it confusing. I had no idea what most of the main characters names were, only grazing the surface as to why they were put under the circumstances that they found themselves in.<br/><br/>Overall, a huge, involved plot was set, then managed to resolve only a few of the problems, while at the same time staging a virtual segue into more sequels. The film either should have spent another half hour finishing off the characters (which I hope will be the extended Director's cut DVD when it gets that far) or cut several of them completely from the script. The first movie was intriguing and complete, while this sequel tried too hard to be complex, and that left it feeling a little over-produced. Disappointing."

","Whereas the first Saw movie left a lot of people impressed by the ingenuity of the deaths carried out on the victims, the sequel will leave many people questioning why they even bothered rolling the cameras. There is little effort made to create even vaguely credible characters, the scenarios are poorly conceived and the camera work often ill-judged. Whoever persuaded the director it was a good idea to speed up the film as vehicles drive around corners needs their head examined - it looks like a scene from the Keystone Cops! There are no deaths with the imagination of the first movie and often there is violence merely for the sake of it to push the film to its end. Despite the dire circumstances the characters find themselves in and the options offered to them I find it hard to believe that they would react by beating each other to death and hacking body parts off left, right and centre. This said, the final ten minutes are worth watching and you'll find it difficult not to watch it with a sly grin on your face. You should have seen it coming and yes, there will be blood."
"uninv1sible","6","0","0","28 October 2005"," Not nearly as exciting as the first Saw.
","If you go into Saw II expecting to relive the excitement that the first one brought on, it won't happen. I guess I went into the theater with the wrong attitude - and perhaps I expected too much. But Saw was a diamond in the rough of contemporary horror films.<br/><br/>The beauty of the original Saw was the opening sequence. Knowing as much as the characters in the movie know is what made it that much more frightening and intense. Where are these people? Why are they locked in a gritty bathroom stall? This technique is something that really set the tone for the rest of the film. Saw II has none of this.<br/><br/>Saw II opens with a gristly scene that is sure to get the audience going, and it seemed to work fairly well. Unfortunately, the dialogue and acting that follows throughout the rest of the film suffers greatly. Being eased into the father/son relationship was somewhat painful to watch, and a few people in the sold-out show laughed at some of the commends made on- screen by the father.<br/><br/>I was also annoyed at the writer's choice to keep 3/4 of the film within a house. I understand the fact that they have to take a step forward from the original, which I remind you was generally kept within a small room, but it just feels like they opted for the house to fit more victims into it - and therefore, to please the audience with more death. Why do sequels always have to involve MORE? I couldn't help but think that they only reason they do is to rake in the cash from the success of the first, and that's exactly what Saw II does.<br/><br/>I was also bothered by something else which other film buffs probably noticed as well. The three girls cater to a fairly wide range of men's taste. We have the slut wearing a thin shirt and no bra, with large doe-like eyes and a fairly well-fed ego. There's the cute and somehow sexy girlfriend who squeezes her breasts together for your viewing pleasure. And there's the messy-haired large-breasted drug addict from the previous film, showing off a bit of mid- drift and some chest bounce, again for the viewer's pleasure. For the girls, they throw in the ""adorable"" shy-but-not-incapable son, the rippling (if half-insane) Latino, and a black man who manages to avoid the common Hollywood curse of dying first. Obviously I picked up on the idea that they were desperately trying to connect the audience to these stars in more of a visual way than an acting way.<br/><br/>Anyway, without spoiling the ending, you'll either love it or hate it. I hated it. Either way, you'll come away from Saw II knowing that it satisfied your lust for blood and maybe some female (or male) eye candy, and that is really Saw II's only saving grace. I gave it a 6/10, and I gave the original Saw a 9/10."

","Well, saw2 does surely beat saw specially for all those who loved saw. I mean this time the plot gets more intense with identity of the jigsaw killer known there is a sense of tension among the viewers of what he'll do next. But with all do respect................one thing if i may point out is , due to more people in this movie as in the 8 people in the room...........it might confuse.......because we don't know much about the characters. But then the jigsaw killers games are so sick , inventive and bloody the viewer forgets about character development. All in all i guess everyone who liked saw(of course), Mindhunters(good thriller) , scream , and all such movies involving a mixture of suspense and horror which gets the viewers thinking will surely love this movie.

","Saw II starts as detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is called out to a grisly homicide scene by his ex-partner Kerry (Dina Meyer) who is now working full time on finding the notorious serial killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), at the crime scene detective Matthews sees that Jigsaw has left him a message. After managing to track Jigsaw down to a warehouse the cops think that his reign of terror is over but Jigsaw still has one last sadistic game to play as he has placed eight total strangers in a secured house that is slowly filling with poisonous gas which will kill them all within two hours, that is unless they can work together to solve Jigsaw's often fatal & always very painful puzzles & clues which will lead to both their freedom & the antidote for the poison. Things turn personal for the cops & detective Matthews in particular when Jigsaw reveals his teenage son Daniel (Erik Knudsen) is one of the eight...<br/><br/>The first sequel to the surprise horror thriller hit Saw (2004) which was apparently rushed into production to capitalise on the original films huge success Saw II was co-written & directed by Darren Lynn Bousman based on a script he had written which was originally called 'The Deperate' which went unmade for years until enterprising producers though of turning it into the next Saw film with the writer of the original Saw Leigh Whannell brought on board to turn it into a 'proper' Saw film. Like most good sequels Saw II takes what made the original work & expand on it making it more of a spectacle & more elaborate on a grander scale, to be honest I actually didn't like the original Saw as much as some did & I have to say in my opinion I think Saw II is a significant improvement on it. The first Saw had just two people trapped in a solitary room while true to expectation Saw II sees eight people trapped in an entire house littered with deadly booby traps, the first Saw kept Jigsaw hidden & mysterious but since that won't work here he is given a major role in the film & his background & motivations are fleshed out a bit & while the original Saw had a fairly amusing if flawed novelty twist ending I have to say I think the twist ending to Saw II is fabulous, very clever, very well thought out which dovetails the ending of Saw rather nicely & I certainly didn't see it coming at all & I doubt anyone else will either. With a larger cast of character's this is one aspect of the film which is fairly poor with some really poorly fleshed out character's that are there either for exposition purposes or simply to be killed off to bump the body count up.<br/><br/>One aspect of Saw II that I am not a big fan of is how it's shot in a very raw documentary style with a very shaky hand-held camera feel & some annoyingly quick editing although having said that it's not as bad as some films & at least I could always make out what was happening. The main attraction of a film like Saw II for most viewers are undoubtedly the gore set-pieces & torture scenes. The opening Venus fly-trap kill where a spike embossed two piece helmet snaps shut around some poor guy's head is a great way to kick the film off, besides that we get someone tossed into a pit full of needles, a gory slashed throat, some cut off skin, a baseball bat with nails hammered through the end is stuck in some guy's head, someone is shot through the eye & the back of their head is blown off & someone is burnt alive in a furnace. Apparently the whole film was shot in one building in a mere 25 days.<br/><br/>According to the IMDb Saw II had a budget of about $4,000,000 which is no money at all for a major film & it opened 30th October 2005 with over $31,500,000 which was almost the same amount Saw V (2008) opened to this weekend just gone. Filmed in Toronto in Canada to keep the budget down even more. The cast do a decent enough job but some of the lesser character's feel a little faceless as the actor's are given little material to work with.<br/><br/>Saw II is a fine sequel to a surprising smash hit horror film that I actually think is better than the original in just about every way, I liked it a lot & put together a terrific twist ending & some cool gore & torture sequences what's not to like? Followed by the equally as good Saw III (2006) & Saw IV (2007)."
"The_Void","5","2","5","20 November 2005"," More of 'Saw', only not as good.
","Despite it's massive over acclaim, extremely poor acting and MTV-style direction, the original 'Saw' was quite a good film. It's good points included a tight and thrilling storyline, some great ideas and a twist that worked through its amazingly simple surprise element. The sequel, on the other hand, feels like writer Leigh Whannell simply jotted a few ideas down on a scrap of toilet paper after hearing of the success of his first movie. The traps here aren't nearly as imaginative, the twist is simply thrown in at the end, the characters are clichéd in the extreme; and the 'drama' surrounding the central character and his son is boring, underdone and impossible to care for. Leigh Whannell, basically, does a terrible job of making the audience care about what happens; but luckily for Saw 2; the style is there, and this is the film's saving grace. The under wrought plot follows a trap-laden house full of people. They're inhaling a deadly toxin, and the antidote is hidden somewhere in the house. If you weren't already excited enough about that, you'll also be glad to know that there's the 'estranged son' subplot, which is ham-fistedly worked into the film.<br/><br/>Even though Saw 2's bad points outnumber it's good ones, I still hesitate to call this a truly bad film. For what it is, Saw 2 is an enjoyable movie. It's not on for long, so the stretched plot line doesn't quite run out of steam before the final credits; and there are enough characters in the film to ensure that there's always another death scene on the horizon. The characters, however, are the film's main downfall. While we cared about the two characters in the first film because we were plugged into their plight; here, we're bombarded with far too many all at once, and this makes it very difficult to care what happens to any of them. The fact that they're all clichéd doesn't exactly help either. Tobin Bell stands out amongst a cast of nobodies; but really, he's just on autopilot. The simplistic plot does a pretty good job of hiding the fact that this is a very shallow movie; as does the dark styling throughout. Director Darren Lynn Bousman does a decent enough job of enforcing the macabre element of the film in every scene, and Saw 2 does have a very repulsive edge to it. On the whole, if you liked the original Saw; you'll probably like this one too. It's not a great movie, and most will probably come out of it feeling a little cheated; but I would say that it's almost worth seeing."
"bfppaw","9","2","5","31 October 2005"," the short list of sequels better than originals just got longer
","Saw II is a wonderfully wicked continuation of the saw story. This is a throwback film to the days when horror really meant something it hits you with a general feeling of unease and does an excellent job of creating empathy with the characters. The climax of the film builds on the story of this film as well as its predecessor as strongly if not stronger than any other sequel I've ever seen truly inventive and as close to anything original we have seen in ages.Without saying too much let me just say that this is one nasty queasy cringe inducing flick that accomplishes everything it sets out to do, it is right up there with my all time favorite horror flick THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 1974 do yourself a favor and go see it with a crowd for maximium enjoyment."
"et60515","8","2","5","31 October 2005"," horror has returned....
","From the beginning, you see that this movie is taking no prisoners. Horror movies have been on a steady decline in the past decade or so, with the exception of remakes like the Ammityville Horror. This sequel not only matches the first in terms of gore and intensity, but surpasses the original with suspense. It is an edge of your seat thriller that literally leaves you guessing until the final frame. For those of you who enjoyed the ending of the first, the second is mind blowing. While the film may not focus on strict scare tactics the entire time, the edge-of-your-seat effect makes up for it tenfold. I highly recommend this film and possibly even a second viewing."
"godjunior71","4","2","5","29 October 2005"," Barely holds a candle to the first film
","I was quite impressed by the first ""Saw"", and thrilled to hear that a sequel was in the works. The more I thought about it though, I began to worry that the second film would turn out to be an uninspired, inferior, money-driven counterpart. While one could definitely do worse, I'm sad to say that Saw II falls drastically short of it's predecessor.<br/><br/>The movies starts off very well, with a disturbing ""victim"" scene that evokes the same feelings of nauesa and suspense as the first film. However, after the credits roll, the sense of dread and terror disappears, and Saw II turns into a second-rate, though technically impressive, thriller. This time, instead of two men chained in a bathroom, the Jigsaw killer (Tobin Bell) has locked a large group of strangers together in a decripit old house. There's a poisonous gas wafting around the house and the prisoners have two hours to find antidotes before the toxins kill them. And of course, the house is rigged with Jigsaw-worthy booby traps. While all of this goes on, Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) has corned Jigsaw himself, and thinks that he has the killer's scheme all figured out. But what would a ""Saw"" film be without twists? Unfortunately, in the case of Saw II, I thought that the plot twists actually hurt the film in the end, as well as a lot of other things. First and foremost is the cast. What drove the first film was the development of the two main characters. I cared about them and wanted to see them escape from the bathroom. Not only are the characters in Saw II underdeveloped, but most of them are either so bland, obnoxious, or despicable that I couldn't wait to see most of them meet a grisly end in one of Jigsaw's traps. This, is not a good thing. Jigsaw himself is well played by Tobin Bell, but the fact that he is presented in person throughout the film actually makes him less frightening. The Jigsaw from the first film was more than a slasher villain, but at the same time, he was no Hannibal Lecter. He was a brilliant, sadistic philosopher/killer who was only seen at the very end of the film. The Jigsaw in Saw II just doesn't seem quite perverse enough.<br/><br/>As for the other characters.....Donnie Wahlberg gives a decent performance in a role that doesn't command much sympathy from the audience. Shawnee Smith returns as Amanda, and does a good job in the part. I don't know the word to describe Franky G's acting, but let me just say that I have not encountered a more beligerent and annoying horror victim (I couldn't wait for him to bite the dust, again, not a good sign). Overall, the acting isn't atrocious. It's just that none of the characters are remotely interesting.<br/><br/>The direction from Darren Lynn-Bousman makes me cry for James Wan to return to the series, for Saw II sorely lacks the edge and I daresay the mean spirit of the first film. Fortunately, there are some nice nods to Saw in the second film. The first kill, the cackling doll on the tricycle, and another scene which I will not give away. The film is well shot and lit, and the production design is nice, but the fast-paced, MTV-esquire editing that occasionally popped up in the first film is everywhere in Saw II, and often detracts from what little horror there is.<br/><br/>And finally, there is a big twist in the end of the movie, but it's not a very good one, and feels more like plot revlation recycled from those of other movies. The whole film seems to be building towards the inevitable twist in the end, and the pay-off is far from satisfying. Indeed, the plot of Saw II has more holes than a wheel of Swiss cheese, and much of it is very hard to believe. At first I found it hard to believe that Leigh Whannel (and although uncredited, apparently James Wan) penned the script with Bousman. But then I realized that Saw II is exactly what I feared it would be. An unnecessary, hollow sequel that was probably made with the promise of reaping huge profits from the box office.<br/><br/>If you want a good film that will make you squirm uncomfortably, check out ""Three...Extremes"". If you're a fan of Saw like I am, you'll probably be quite disappointed by the sequel."
"sunset-at-night","8","2","5","30 October 2005"," Saw II is a Decent Follow-Up
","I am a big fan of Saw I. So when I heard a sequel will be made, I had mixed reactions. On one hand ..I love Saw and it would be cool to see how Saw II turns out but on the other hand most horror sequels suck. But let me just say... Saw II will not disappoint.<br/><br/>...This time around we have 8 people being played by Jigsaw in a house and have to find antidotes to an deadly gas they are breathing. Out of the 8 people trapped by Jigsaw,... Amanda and Xavier are like the only characters that makes Saw II memorable. The rest, I can really give a damn about. Donnie Walhberg of New Kids fame who plays Detective Mason actually did a decent job in this movie but his character was not likable enough for me to root for and maybe that is the way it was intended to be.<br/><br/>The high points of the movie is you never get bored. And oh yes, there is blood ..plenty of it. Not to mention, the last 30 minutes of the film is an awesome roller-coaster ride and have some cool twists and turns but still in my opinion cannot top the twist we saw in Saw I.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is not all bed and roses ..some low points for me is that it lacks that gritty fear I felt Saw had. I guess because this time around not only do we hear Jigsaw's voice but we actually see him and get to know him for the whole 90 minutes. And by golly, actually feel sorry for the guy. I am glad we got to know Jigsaw but seeing him throughout the film made the film less scary. What made Saw I really creepy was Jigsaw's voice and we had no face to match it to ..now we do. Imagine Michael Myers and Jason without their mask for the entire movie.<br/><br/>Overall, in a day and age where most horror sequels suck. Saw II prevails. So, get popcorn, get soda, watch the movie and enjoy!"
"ukman842002","9","2","5","28 October 2005"," New Dimension of Horror
","Not every series of movies are capable to keep it strong in all it's part. For example, scream series or Friday the 13th were not all impressive, although we enjoyed them. But SAW and SAW II are equally impressive and well directed. I find SAW II more thrilling as Jigsaw was caught it at the beginning and that thing gave a very strong signal to the watchers, the signal is ( More is coming ! ) SAW II was more focus than SAW I as all the events occur between the cups and john in one side, and the victims in the other side. <br/><br/>I find SAW and SAW II are the best movies from this kind since (Seven). Movies that keep the watch sharp and on the edge and it ends it with stunning end. <br/><br/>I'm still thinking what more to come in SAW III as I'm very sure that they will make one."

","So I just got back from seeing ""Saw 2"" and I feel about as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I loved the first edition because quite frankly it was so bad it was good. I mean that with utter respect- it was a high quality B horror flick with a fantastic ending. Needless to say I was a tad cynical that the sequel would live up to the original. Specifically, would this movie deliver a wham-bam finale? I have to say the sequel delivered with flying colors. Needless to say, you hafta hang in there. The majority of the movie does not have the same tension as the original; mainly because there are many more characters to consider. However, keep the faith... the ending is brilliantly twisted, and will have you counting down to the inevitable ""Saw 3""."

","I just saw the movie! Does the movie make the cut? I found Saw 2 a dull blade compared to the first. The first movie is built on suspense which the second maintains, but saw 2's repetition loses the tension of the predecessor. The lack of character development along with too many characters , and the unlikable characters ruin the re pore with the audience. The elevator ending was stupid. The moral judgment of a sadist on other is a hard and de-humanizing display. Jig-saw lecturing the cop on morals is like Stalin lecturing Hitler on governmental responsibility. I cannot buy this! I like the first movie when the killer is just sick with a twisted logic. The doctor is a likable man a good formula, hard for the makers to improve on. 6 out of 10"
"jboothmillard","8","2","6","19 April 2006"," Saw II
","The first one was superb, and this sequel is just as good for acting, mystery, suspense and bloody gore. Basically, the cops have tracked down the location of sadistic killer, Jigsaw, or John (the cool Tobin Bell), but they also discover from video cameras that he is holding many people in a secret shelter, including the son of Det. Eric Matthews (Ransom's Donnie Wahlberg), Daniel (Eric Knudsen). Jigsaw tells him that if he talks to him, he will help him to get his son back, while the cops are tracking down the location of the shelter. In the shelter meanwhile the victims, including Xavier (Franky G), Showgirls' Glenn Plummer as Jonas, Emmanuelle Vaugier as Addison, Beverley Mitchell as Laura, Tim Burd as Obi, and returning victim, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) (the one who had the jaw trap), are going through all clues and traps to find their way out before they are killed by the slow acting nerve gas. The great end has Amanda and Daniel reusing the saw in the old bathroom (from the first one), and the big twist is when Eric finally loses him temper and threatens Jigsaw to take him to his son, this is when the cops find out the video broadcast is not live, the countdown in Jigsaw's place was for the release of Daniel in the locked room, and Eric finds out the hard way that Amanda has not only played before, but she is to be Jigsaw's replacement when he dies of cancer. Also starring Lyriq Bent as Rigg, Noam Jenkins as Michael and Billy the Jigsaw Puppet (LOL). . Traps include: (the opening) a guy with a timed death mask that will close unless he gets the key from behind his eye, the door with the key triggering a gun, the oven activated by a pulling a chain (with antidote on it), a pit of needles with a key for a timed door, and the hand trap of broken glass with antidote in it.

","I didn't go to SAW II expecting very much. The first SAW was an instant classic, an amazingly well-done horror film that only suffered from a few faults, if any. If there's one thing I hate, it has to be quickly dished-out sequels, so I was a little hesitant about whether or not I thought SAW II looked good. God, was I mistaken!! SAW II is one of, if not the, best horror film I have ever seen. And trust me I'm quite the movie buff. My horror collection boasts over 396 titles, some of which I loved, and others of which were utter garbage. And I have to say that SAW II is the first horror film I've seen opening night that received a round of applause once its ending title sequence rolled around.<br/><br/>Anything that seemed wrong with the first film is perfected with this sequel. And, surprisingly, SAW II surpassed the original by far. It had great deaths, and managed to keep the character-driven aspect of the story intact even with all of them. Some of the scenes in SAW II were so chilling and graphic that I cringed in terror. Which is to say that SAW II is definitely a hard R rated film, never holding back in any areas. There is EXTREME, realistic gore contained here! There were also several nods to the first film, and SAW II even included comedy in with the carnage!!! <br/><br/>SAW II had a very good plot, and never seemed to slow down for longer than a minute. This was one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen!!! During the last act of the film I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack. In the end, everything, including the twist ending, makes perfect sense, and it even manages to tie up almost all of the loose ends from the first film. A great, highly recommended film. <br/><br/>Any horror film fan should check this out, whether they liked the first SAW or not. If you're planning on going to the movies for a horror flick, don't waste your money on the horrible remake of THE FOG. See the best horror flick of 2005, second to none, SAW II."

","Creating a successful movie on amateur actors, inexperienced screenwriters and low budget is quite an accomplishment in itself. Following such a film up with a strong sequel within a single year is an even greater challenge. Somehow, Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman delivered the goods and offered a movie that kept the grisly tension of the original movie and added some depth to old and new characters. Even though this sequel isn't as creative as the first installment, it comes surprisingly close and underlines the significance of this contemporary horror movie franchise.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around four strong lead characters, including two old and two new ones. The film gives an insight how the mild-mannered John Kramer became the cold-hearted Jigsaw and elaborates upon the twisted philosophy behind his actions.<br/><br/>Survivor Amanda Young who had a rather brief appearance in the predecessor is a very important and unpredictable character in this sequel who has to play another deadly game with a group of seven strangers who must uncover what they have in common in order to survive.<br/><br/>Police investigation is more important in the sequel than in the predecessor. The viewers are introduced to two officers with completely different philosophies who complement each other perfectly. Allison Kerry is a factual, pragmatic and realistic investigator who always follows the rules by the book in a nearly emotionless way.<br/><br/>Eric Matthews on the other side is a brutal, emotional and pitiless investigator who regularly breaks the rules and clashes not only with colleagues and superiors but also with the criminals he has to deal with and his own family members.<br/><br/>This is an important detail since his estranged son is among the serial killer's eight test subjects. The investigator and the serial face off in a psycholigical duel that may decide upon life and death which leads to a showdown with unexpected twists.<br/><br/>If you appreciated the first entry in the franchise, you are also going to like this surprisingly rewarding sequel as well as all other installments. This second entry is even less graphic than the predecessor and can genuinely be described as psychological thriller. It convinces with diversified characters, sinister locations and a twisted plot that offers an elevated number of surprises for the gripping finale. Once again, this entry in the franchise finds the perfect balance between grisly and intellectual elements that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."

I really liked the first one so I decided to see this one in theaters and im glad I did. This one is better then the first with a more involved story line, better actors portraying much more dynamic characters. There was much more action and a lot more suspsense.<br/><br/>This movie is about the jigsaw killer who sets up a game for a shady cop to play. How he does in the game depend if people live or die. He is forced to play because one of the kidnapped people is his son.<br/><br/>Overall I say this movie was better then the first one.

","Saw II, the 2nd film of the 7 movie franchise, is in fact, one of the worst films in the series. Its not bad, but just not that good. The movie is in fact the most boring of the series and after a great opening the rest of the movie except the last 20 minutes is a big borefest. But the last 20 or more minutes are great and really suspenseful. The twist ending is great but not as good and the very unexpected ending to Saw. Saw II focuses on a Detective who finds Jigsaw's ""lair"" and finds out his son is in a game, he must play Jigsaw's other game to find his son. The game in the house, is where these I think 5 people are in a house with poison gas which will kill them in 2 hours. They must escape the house but must play by the rules and watch out for the traps. Saw II is an okay movie but as I said, very boring. I give it a 6/10."

","Darren Lynn Bosman takes over from James Wam for the sequel to the immense popular horror movie 'Saw'. The climax of the first movie gave way for a follow on feature. James Wam turns executive producer. The 'Jigsaw' killer returns making the lives of more people a misery as his puppets are a group of individuals. Those looking for more victims will be pleased with this movie. There are more than 2 individuals who become at the mercy of Jigsaw's intentions. However the element of violence is not higher due to a larger body count. But the emphasis is more on the plot. There is more focus on the jigsaw killer. His morals and principles are reflected upon. We get a deeper insight in to the background of his character. His conversational scenes are fantastic. This is indeed a highlight in the movie. Tobin Bell playing jigsaw is impressive and convinces in his role.<br/><br/>SPOILERS A detective played by Donnie Wahlberg has a son who is kidnapped and placed in a large booby trapped house along with 6 other individuals. The jigsaw killer informs them with the instructions to find an antidote to the lethal nerve gas that is being inhaled by them. If they do not accomplish this in the set given time, they will die. Simultaneously Jigsaw's hideout is discovered by S.W.A.T and he is constantly persuaded by Wahlberg to tell the whereabouts of his son. The surveillance footage of the individuals in the house is also found out. They attempt to discover where the location of the captives is. Many of the individuals in the house either pass away because of the gas or get killed by the traps. Some also turn against each other in pursuit of escaping alone. Eventually Jigsaw gives in and tell Wahlberg the location. But all is not what it appears to be. END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>For a sequel I was slightly disappointed. The whole setup in the house was vaguely reminiscent of 'House on haunted hill'. It is NOT my intention to say it is a rip off, but the thought of the movie instantly came to mind. But the capture and interrogation sequences of jigsaw redeem the movie in many ways. His subplot supports very well. My movie is devoid of genius killer traps. I hoped to see more of them as it is one element that makes the franchise unique. The twists are unpredictable and enjoyable. Jigsaw also has a accomplice. Given the fact that jigsaw is 70, this is acceptable. I felt that Dina Meyer could have had more scope. She is a wonderful actress and could have been involved to a larger scale."

In the beginning where what's his face (the guy with the key in his eye); first of all I'm pretty sure that to insert something into an eye without removing it takes great medical skills. And referenced in the first movie Dr. Gordon was a doctor, i.e. surgeon. And also when the police find jigsaw he's hooked up to a ventilator, an IV, and there's all this medicine in cabinets.

","Twisted serial killer Tobin Bell (as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) is back, from the first ""Saw"" (1904), and he's out for more blood. Last time, as you recall, Mr. Bell trapped two men in a bathroom, with leg-irons and ""Saw"". This time, he's locked a bunch of people in a dirty house. To make it WORSE than the first movie, the house seems to have NO bathroom at all. What happens if you have to go? There is a way for the characters to get to the bathroom from the original film (but I'd rather go in my pants). Anyway, ""Jigsaw"" is also releasing a deadly gas in the sealed-up house; it makes the trapped cast cough up blood, and wear dark eye makeup...<br/><br/>""Saw II"" is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman with continuity assist from co-writer Leigh Whannell. It is a great thriller - and, more importantly as this is obviously now a film series - an excellent sequel. They do just about everything you need to do to build a successful franchise. The neatly constructed plot weaves Shawnee Smith (as Amanda) from the first film with corrupt cop Donnie Wahlberg (as Eric Matthews); his estranged son, curly-haired Erik Knudsen (as Daniel), is among the unsavory types trapped in Jigsaw's puzzle. The cast is wholly entertaining.

"Jacques98","10","1","2","21 September 2008"," A continuation of perfection.
","Someone apparently didn't tell the men and women behind the Saw franchise that thrillers had to be about terrorists, boobs, and have a clichéd social commentary that we've heard since we were 3-years-old. That's why the Saw franchise is easily the only truly original movies being released todaythey break every genre rule you think you know.<br/><br/>Saw II takes the same formula from the original Saw and spins it, making it bigger and gorier. It allows you a much deeper look into the mind of Jigsaw, and further shows that Jigsaw himself defies any and every cliché you thought a villain must abide by. What makes him so complex is that he isn't a villain at all; in reality, he's the only good guy in the entire franchise.<br/><br/>Also, Saw II proves thrillers can be thrilling. I simply cannot remember a thriller that actually had something going on from beginning to end, without a single dead spot in the entire movie, but that is exactly what Saw II is. There are no pointless conversation scenes that plague every thriller/action movie because the director thinks he's so original, when in reality the audience understood the movie from the first trailer. Saw II gives the audience creditthank God someone, anyone, understands how to tell a truly adrenaline-pumping story.<br/><br/>Gore-wise, the movie excels. In an era when Hollywood has turned to generic, family-friendly gore, it's insanely refreshing to see a series that actually makes gore disturbing again. People often compare the Saw franchise to Hostel as far as gore, and all I can say is this: Saw blows Hostel out of the water here. Hostel uses cut-off camera scenes, where NONE of the gore is on screen, and all the gore is generic and boring. The Saw series, specifically Saw II, does not cut the camera away for ANYTHING. Everything is on-screen, and everything is disturbing and cringe-worthy. Saw II is easily the most brutal of the Saw series.<br/><br/>None of the five plot twists in the end of Saw II match the single plot twist in the end of the original Saw, but there is the thing: the movie has five plot twists! It takes a lot of thought just to inject a single sub-par twist into a movie without making it seem gimmicky, but Saw II does five of them with perfection. Once again, how can a movie get better than this? Like I said when I wrote my review for Saw and Saw III, how can a movie get more perfect? The action never stops or even slows, and the plot puts most every movie of our generation to shame. Saw II makes every other thriller I have ever seen, including Hostel and it's sequel, look just downright cute.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Jigsaw is back to his old cat and mouse gruesome antics, despite being captured by the police during an investigation into his murderous ways by jaded, divorced, and nearly burnt-out Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg). Rather then see this as a setback, Jigsaw calmly informs him that Eric's son is now trapped in a booby-trapped house with 7 other people whom all share a secret past. I didn't particularly care for the first Saw , so imagine my surprise when i found this one marginally better, much better acted, and more gripping. It also has a better ending in my opinion (although i still hate cliff-hangers as a rule). I've only seen the first 3 films in the franchise thus far, this is my favorite as I think the third one is complete and utter excrement. Don't get me wrong Saw 2 still isn't a really good film, merely a better one then the others in the series (from what I saw) <br/><br/>My Grade: C-"

"gabrielbergmoser","10","1","2","5 September 2007"," The Best Thriller Of Its Time
","With more gore, more twists, more characters and more plot, Saw II manages to trump even its own predecessor at the thriller game.<br/><br/>Where Saw had rare dull points, Saw II moves quickly. The traps are more gruesome and inventive, and we find ourselves with surprisingly well drawn out characters; and a plot that works fantastically as both a standalone and a sequel that expands on everything that was great about the original. Saw II really establishes the 'Saw Mythology' that fans have come to love, and as a film seems to do everything right. It hits the perfect balance between plot and action, and for the first time Jigsaw really comes into his own as a character, rather than just a scary voice on a tape recorder. Indeed; by the end of the first we still felt we knew nothing about Jigsaw, with only a couple of sparse glimpses of the man.<br/><br/>No such qualms here. The psychological duel between Jigsaw and the haunted Detective Matthews recalls 'Silence of the Lambs' in its brilliance and intensity, and, in what is surely rare for this kind of film, we actually feel something other than annoyance and hatred for our characters. Even the killer seems human and almost likable.<br/><br/>Now when was the last time you can remember a film with such qualities? It was mentioned earlier in this review; need I say more.<br/><br/>I'm not lying. Saw II is that good. Now go watch it."

If gore makes you sick then this movie isn't for you, if you like gore and people getting their heads messed with then this a movie for you this movie is a masterpiece and a must have to any horror movie fans. In my opinion this movie was legendary it got everybody talking and was just a freaking great movie.

And i think Franky G, is cool (his name in the movie is, Xavier), he is a smart thug, that can think straight and isn't afraid to do what he has to do, to survive. The set for this movie, to me is very creepy, scary, and jigsaw like. but man that guy is getting old. The thing i really noticed about this movie is that, well they didn't have to show scenes of nudity, or people smoking crack for twenty minutes...no, this movie shows the true horrors of life, and testing people and there survival instinct.

Instead of a delima between people, jigsaw has set up a game involving a group of people who much escape a house that is filling with nerve gas. First, they must find an antidote or they will be die before leaving. Jigsaw is caught early in the film and his interrogation plays a big role in his ""game"". He wants to teach Detective Mathews a lesson. It seems all the people in the house have something in common, they were set up by Matthews by planting evidence. And as part of the game, Jigsaw has included Matthews delinquent son as part of the house game.<br/><br/>Once again, there are some imaginative deaths and creepy choices. Do you crawl into a furnace? What about a pit of needles? And the game Matthews must play at the end with the saw blade and being chained to the wall was all the more great.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it.

But you don't necessarily have to watch the first part to get the second part, unless your really confused. Another thing that I liked about this film was that we actually get several conversation pieces with John, the Jigsaw Killer. However the odds of the film out weighs the evens a lot more in Saw II. The ending is the exact same ending of the first Saw movie and coincidentally it takes place in the same room. Another odd is that we really could care less if these people live or die because they all are nasty to each other where it gets to the point where you want them to get trapped."

I also thought that Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell did very well. I didn't really like some of the characters but their performances were lifted thanks to the first three I mentioned. While I disliked the first one because of it's total unbelievability and unoriginality (""borrowed"" heavily from SEVEN and CUBE) and terrible performances by all of the leads, with the exception of Tobin Bell.

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","8","1","2","10 August 2006"," A worthy sequel, but nowhere near the original
","*****DISCLAIMER: DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM WITHOUT SEEING THE ORIGINAL, FOR THIS WILL SPOIL THE FIRST ONE TO A LARGE DEGREE. THERE ARE SPOILERS TO THE FIRST SAW FILM IN THIS REVIEW*****<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, 'Saw II' is the best horror film of its year. The main difference between these two films is that the first one is more of a psychological thriller with an amazing twist at the end. This one sticks to a typical horror theme, but still pulls it off with great ease. Standing alone, 'Saw II' is excellent, but not even in the same dimension as the original.<br/><br/>Jigsaw is back and better than ever, coming up with more clever traps for his unsuspecting victims. His intentions are more narrow now, having a detective's (Donnie Wahlberg) son captive in a room with other people in an unknown place. They must hurry to escape, for they are breathing a deadly nerve agent, and there are antidotes within the house. They must also beware of the many traps Jigsaw has scattered along the house. All this goes on while the detective in question interrogates Jigsaw in Jigsaw's warehouse.<br/><br/>Like it's predecessor, Saw II boasts excellent sound and lighting, which are so crucial to a horror/thriller film. Saw II is filled with much more blood and guts than the previous one, including a disturbing needle scene. Also like the original, Saw II suffers from mediocre acting outside of Tobin Bell's Jigsaw, who gives a masterful performance as one of the best villainous characters of our time. Despite how physically weak he is, you will never forget that he is in charge the entire time. Donnie Wahlberg is okay in the film, but I honestly think he could have been better. You just want so much more from the character when it's over. He gets the job done though. The rest of the cast, including Franky G, Beverly Mitchell, and the return of Shawnee Smith is okay, Smith being the best.<br/><br/>There is a new director behind Saw II, Darren Lynn Bousman, and I have to say that he does a great job of keeping the spirit of the original. I like him a lot and I'm also anxious to see what he does with Saw III. Bousman directs the film better than any horror film of recent memory, keeping the psychological aspect of the series intact and well, while adding more blood and gore than in the first. His writing is nowhere near that of Leigh Whannell, but again, Bousman is not bad at all, rather, the writing from him is very similar to the style of Leigh Whannell, making the resemblance in the two movies very visible. Bousman provides a clever twist at the end that some will guess, but the other twist is, like the first film, unpredictable. This sequel does the job of keeping you entertained while scaring you a lot. The best part about the series is that we can expect a great thriller and psychological mind bending every Halloween. I recommend Saw II to anyone 16 or older, and to any horror fan. Great film.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"

","Like many others I was riveted by the original Saw from start to finish.The hallmarks of gore, sadism, horror, innovation and tight storytelling are back with a vengeance, although the physical setting lacks some credibility, this is more than compensated for by another ripping yarn.<br/><br/>It is difficult to believe that the Director, Darren Bousman, is only 27 years old. My only concern is that he should have the courage to walk away after the forthcoming Saw 3 to develop his talents outside of this stunning formula, and not become bogged down by it.<br/><br/>There are not many films which have me closing my eyes and recoiling in revulsion whilst still being compelled to watch. This is such a film.

","I'm an avid horror-movie fan but after endless disappointments (The Grudge, The Ring, The Hills Have Eyes, etc, etc, etc) I almost was about to give up on being a horror fan. All it took was a psychological thriller like ""Saw II"" to get my mouth watering.<br/><br/>Now, i haven't seen the first one. Honestly, I judged a book by its cover, thought it looked stupid, wrote it off as obvious senseless gore and violence that revolves the movie around blood and guts rather than a storyline. Someone convinced me that this movie would at least be ""kind of clever"" so we rented the DVD.<br/><br/>The first scene did something to me that no other horror movie has done in YEARS.... it riddled me with horrifying anticipation about the rest of the movie..not about seeing ""yucky things""...or ""boo.... AH!"" type horror.... but the desperation of characters, panic, impending doom/death and seemingly hopelessness of the situation had me tensed up from start to finish.

We're then introduced to the main character of the show 'Donnie Whalberg'. When the torture begins Jigsaw is already in police custody, heavily guarded by a set of SWAT men and being talked to by Mr Wahlberg. What he doesn't realise is Jigsaw is playing with him to. Unlike the original where Jigsaw makes a brief appearance at the end John (Jigsaw) is in this movie from the start to the end. Being a little worse for the wear he also spills why he is devoting the rest of his life to testing human frailty. Not one to be missed if it is a decision between this and The Hostel pick Saw 2. There is a lose storyline to follow and it's typical Saw ending of fast pace and even another twist in the tale. Oh yes there will be blood.........."

","After seeing the first movie, I was excited to see the sequel. After seeing it, I was disappointed. Really disappointed. I was expecting a lot more from it but I guess they are too scared to push the envelope.<br/><br/>This film is about Jigsaw locking a few unlucky people in a booby trapped shelter and they must find a way out before they inhale too much of a lethal nerve gas and die. But they must watch out, for the traps Jigsaw has set in the shelter lead to death also.<br/><br/>The beginning starts off good but it went downhill from there. The movie is weak. There are more people and more deaths but they're not good enough to make you happy. We don't care for some characters. We don't even care what happens to them. Then at the end, there's this twist. I heard the twist in IMDb before I watched this movie so maybe that's one reason I don't like this movie. Saw was such a great success that this sequel feels so sad, it shouldn't even be called a sequel.<br/><br/>The plot is repeated for this sequel.The score for this film is great like any other Saw films. The energy and suspense from the first film did not came back for the second. It's not thrilling, suspenseful, nor scary. Fortunatley, there are moments that makes you cringe including the needle pit scene. Saw was just a great crime thriller that this must be the opposite.<br/><br/>This is an OK movie. It's not that bad that I hate it. It was that I was expecting much more than just deaths and more people and twists. If you're a big fan of the original, this might disappoint you."

","Having seen the first saw movie, I kind of knew what to expect from the second one. The bad guys plan goes off without a hitch and the final twist of his plan is so far out that it isn't worth trying to predict. I must say, I had some sense of satisfaction when I turned out to be correct but then I thought about the premise of the movie and got angry. (Here come the spoilers) <br/><br/>The drug using girl who survived jigsaw's trap in the first saw movie has the strangest epiphany. It goes something like this. ""I am so happy to see the faults in my drug using ways. I will turn my life around by trying my hardest to become a crazy self-righteous psycho killer like jigsaw. I won't stop there; I will put my own life on the line for no apparent reason by directly acting like one of jigsaw's victims. I love you crazy man who has killed so many before and almost killed me in a most grotesque fashion.""Also there is something about jigsaw's philosophy that bothers me, ""Those who don't value life don't deserve life."" According to that, it sounds like only those who are suicidal or cold blooded murderers should be forced to play his games. People with family problems or other small time crooks, like the ones dying in the movie, shouldn't count. Furthermore, Jigsaw claimed to never have killed anybody, but as one person already put it, ""it seems to me that putting people into a situation where they will almost certainly perish is grounds for a murder charge.""<br/><br/>Sorry, enough complaints about the logic of the movie. Maybe the truth is I am just angry I watched another cringe movie. Cringe movies should have its own section. I mean, a man getting killed by having nails slammed into his head has the same effect on me as a man getting hit in the nuts on accident. Its not scary it just makes me cringe.<br/><br/>Finally, I would advise Hollywood they need to stop making such garbage, but looking at the surprisingly large number of positive feedback this movie got, it seems they are doing something right. So before I make anybody who I haven't already made angry, angry at me, I will end my review here."
"moe-103","5","1","2","6 June 2006"," Review & Possible continuity issues
","I noticed two possible continuity issues, but I'd like some clarification from other viewers; I wasn't entirely engaged in watching the movie and may have overlooked something.<br/><br/>1) After Obi's tape informs him that ""(inside the case) there are two antidotes"", one guy says ""we don't even know what's in those syringes"" and a minute later Obi says ""i guess i'm going in there to get those needles"" - up to that point (as far as i recall) they had not been informed of how they were expected to administer the antidote or the form it would take; it could have been tablets, vials of liquid, etc.<br/><br/>2) When Donnie Wahlberg enters the house and is in the room where everybody had previously awoken, there is a syringe filled with antidote to the right of the safe, on the floor. How did it get there? If it was just laying on the floor throughout, why didn't anybody take it? As for the movie as a whole, I wasn't particularly impressed. The version of the DVD I got spelled ""Donnie Wahlberg"" as ""Donnie Wahlburg"" on the cover. I was further disheartened when I saw the spike mask used to kill off the guy in the opening scene. It was well done, but except for some minor details it's the same kind of contraption that the junkie girl survived in the first movie.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog was pathetic and occasionally contradictory. The black guy tells the hispanic drug dealer, after some discussion about the viability of an antidote ""you've been in the joint, you've talked to the wardens that run the chambers: you know there ain't no antidote for this (elided)"". These are two petty criminals, not death row inhabitants, and this is after the allusion that the gas involved is sarin, not cyanide. It's not meaningful dialog, it's an attempt to divulge the history of the characters in the cheapest possible way, with a minimum of effort. Later, a conversation transpires between the same two characters in which the black guy says (paraphrase) ""we can treat each other like we're in the yard, or we can find out who is doing this to us"". His next comment is ""I know people like you, you're always trying to find an enemy"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first movie a lot, but I don't think that the sequel really has much going for it other than the fact that you get to see a bunch of morons killed in compelling circumstances. I'm no snob: it gets 5 stars for that, which is half-way there, but I feel like this movie was riding on the novelty of the concept behind it's predecessor, without really adding anything enduring. The stylistic appeals-to-authority used to hurriedly execute the final scene without the audience feeling cheated (same theme music as Saw, same quickly-cut flashbacks, same set, same catchphrase, etc) indicate that this movie isn't something that can stand by itself - it's a footnote."

","Saw 2 revolves around a ""not-so-straight-and-narrow"" cop who gets involved with the serial killer Jigsaw's latest game of horrible torture and death.<br/><br/>Saw 2 tries to do things a little differently than the first film. Saw 2 has a house full of teens (or near teens) locked up in a spooky house where one by one - they meet an unfortunate death (a la traditional slasher film) but all done in the style of the ""Saw"" franchises death traps.<br/><br/>Although there are some nice plot twists (in the original Saw's style) - possibly the final twist (who the killer is) is a bit half-baked and unbelievable. The references however to the first film are quite ingenious (where the final scene takes place)...<br/><br/>The acting (like the first Saw) can be a little half-baked too and some of the ""death traps"" aren't so ingenious as the first (eg: instead of a reverse-facial-beartrap we get a spiky-mask...).<br/><br/>Overall - OK masochistic fun if this is your cup of tea...<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

Then he gets into the house and screams a lot more.<br/><br/>I don't usually like sequels and this one is no exception. There is no reason to like or relate to any of the characters. So it's like watching a series of vignettes, each one involving a different mechanical booby-trap. But I didn't care about the characters, so it's more like reading an issue of Popular Mechanics.

","Honestly, I wasn't a big fan of SAW. I liked the twist-ending, but felt it took too long to get there and didn't really hold my interest that well. The acting also seemed kind of wooden and unrealistic - but I will admit that I did enjoy SAW 2 quite a bit. This is the film that I was expecting the first one to be and was disappointed, the sequel did what it needed to to amp up the whole SAW concept and add some more dimensions...<br/><br/>Same basic idea as the first film: JIGSAW puts people in life-or-death situations that ultimately those playing the ""game"" have control over - if they are willing to go all the way to ""win"". The main difference is that this one has several ""players"" as opposed to just 2 from the first film. This keeps the action more dynamic and fast-paced, and offers the audience a look at a wider variety of inventive ""traps""...<br/><br/>I feel that everything about SAW 2 was superior to the first. The action was better, the ""traps"" were better, the ending was suitably twisted, and the acting was all-around more believable. I don't know where the franchise will go from here - but obviously by the way the end was handled, it's apparent that a part 3 is in the works. I guess we'll see if they can keep the ball rolling in a believable and interesting manner - but if the next one is nearly as good or better than part 2, then it should prove to be a damn good horror film...8.5/10"

","Just a quick comment on this one, even though it's not really worth it: This movie has very *amateurish* acting and poor direction + weak script and dialog. And what is the point with all that obscene language? We are starting to get very very fed up of finding it in almost every movie released nowadays. I mean, I'm not really offended or anything, but it throws no punch if it's just sprayed out in every sentence (plus it just sounds silly).<br/><br/>First Saw movie had something special, this movie is just sad. Think it could have been made something decent out of this, but the whole crew of actors (ok, maybe except the guy playing jigsaw) + director would have to be replaced and the script would need some ""tightening up"" to make it more sane. Also never got the feeling that people in this movie were really trapped (like in the first one) - you could see through the barricades on the windows for gods sake!? I really hated all the actors in this movie, except the jigsaw guy cos he had a bit of intensity and presence, and I wanted them ALL to die.<br/><br/>Another thing that I'm starting to (sadly) realize is that: <br/><br/>RATINGS ON IMDb CAN'T BE TRUSTED! <br/><br/>I'm 100% sure that movie studios/companies (or some ""whatever person"" related to this movie (and others too) ) are hiring people to write untrue reviews and give false ratings. Well, who can blame them really after spending millions of dollars on a movie..but still..I don't know, it's just sad {again} I suppose.<br/><br/>I give this a 2.

Even after you watch it, you'll want to see it a few more times to see if you can catch anything you missed. It has great acting and characters, excellent story and a few well thought out surprises. Saw II is a great remedy from watching a lot of the other trash that has come out recently and called itself a movie.

Definitely the best horror movie ever made."
"3-D","4","1","2","26 February 2006"," See Saw? Naw.
","I moderately enjoyed the first Saw movie, so naturally, I was bound to check out the sequel. It seemed to be getting a lot of praise for being the ""greatest horror ever,"" and ""much better than the first,"" so I obtained a copy and checked it out.<br/><br/>After it was over, I was kind of like, ""..meh."" I really failed to see how it was better than the first. It was a kind-of-OK horror movie, with many, many problems holding the enjoyment down.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting was so and so. I have to say that some of the actors gave fantastic performances, but there were just as many who were sub-par in their roles. But, you can never expect top notch acting when watching a horror movie. It actually can add to the camp value of the horror, but ONLY when the movie is a cheesefest. Saw II was attempting to be ""serious"".<br/><br/>The ""gore"" was not nearly as good as hyped. In fact, the gore is almost non-existent. Okay, so there's a throat slash here, reminiscent of the first movie. But that's about as bad as it gets. The rest of the violence is more mild, with nothing that I would call ""gory"" (a blood puddle here and there isn't exactly gore). Basically, if it wasn't for the language, this film could have scored a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Sadly, I also have to say that it really wasn't scary. You know, at all. I realize there are many others out there who somehow consider this to be the scariest movie ever made. Granted, I've seen at least a billion horror films by now, so my standards are probably higher than normal. So, I guess if you don't normally watch horror movies, this film might be scary for you, but if you're into horror like I am, you most likely won't be scared at all.<br/><br/>All of that can still be tolerable, however. It was the STORY that really brought this movie down. The premise was great. A group of strangers are locked up inside of a house, all poisoned, and they must find antidotes that are hidden throughout. So, it's Cube with a ""search for the antidote"" twist to it. Not a bad idea, I thought.<br/><br/>The problems came in from trying to link it to the first one. Every tie-in to the original movie was far too coincidental, making the movie seem like a horror-themed sitcom. Throughout the movie, I kept having to tell myself, ""Whoa, what a co-wink-a-dink."" The big ""twist"" was a betrayal of one of the characters who is actually B.F.F. with the jigsaw killer. This ""twist"" shoots the entire movie to hell, because it raises too many, ""Well, then why did..."" questions that just seem to make the entire story no longer make sense at all. But I think the biggest question I had was, ""If they just wanted to capture the cop, then why did they go through the trouble of kidnapping a bunch of other people, building all these traps and doors, and recording the footage? Why not just capture the cop in the first place?"" Seriously, it's not like they needed to do all that to capture the cop. They've proved that they can kidnap anybody at any time, regardless of who they are.<br/><br/>Apparently, the script was written as a different movie, but the writer was told to change it into Saw II because the first movie did good in theaters. I have to shake my head as I think about how much better this movie could have been had it been left in it's original form, because it was really the links to the first film and the sitcom-like twists that were way too coincidental (even for a movie) to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie for big fans of the horror genre."

It is not all that interesting to see several steapid people running around in a house. OK, no, let's put it this way, it could be interesting and scary if the director would not only use the 'scary' effect of flickering scenes (several takes/ scenes per second) and screeming dummies. A bummer, but bad movies have to be made to get to the good stuff, forget this one and wait for Saw III! *spoiler* 'You wouldn't know the things you loose when you're locked away'--> How about that!!

Invariably, he manipulates them to kill themselves with his hand-made contraptions. I will not spoil the movie and go into this further.<br/><br/>The original Saw was more intense and real. it sucked you in and didn't let go. this second one was almost a parody of the first- gratuitously gory, with a storyline lacking direction. the only cool thing about the second one is that you get to see who jigsaw really is.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, the man who plays the detective and the boy who plays his son do a good job with their parts. i wish i could say the same for the other actors.<br/><br/>Bottomline: don't waste your money on this Hollywood fodder, but do check out the ORIGINAL SAW!!!!

","In SAW, the original and first film about the ""jigsaw-killer"", you really had suspense. There was this exciting ""relation"" of the Dr and Adam, that always changed, and the end of SAW - be honest - was absolutely amazing and just great. Of course, SAW was pretty bloody and sadistic but there was something like a story, which I was looking for in SAW 2. What is this in SAW II? It seems like several movie makers put their home-sadistic-dreams together and looked how they could surpass the violence of the first part. It's just sick: The idea of the first (unnecessary) victim and his ""mask"". ""Cut your eye out, take the key and free yourself in 60 seconds - HA HA"". Always this damn stupid laughter of ""jigsaw""! Why? I'm very upset about many movie continuations (Matrix 2 or 3 were horrable, Jurassic Park 2 and 3 were also very bad, Scary Movie 2 was unbelievably bad...) but I hoped that SAW II could be good though. Very disappointing, SAW II. The most upsetting fact is that the ex-junkie that survived the first trap of ""jigsaw"" is now again in a ""trap"" for her and she really wants to go on these insane games because ""jigsaw helped"" her. Could it get any worse? Hollywood wants to make a lot of more money with ""jigsaw"" or his ""offspring"", nothing more. The 3-vote of me is because of the surprising end that gave SAW 2 at least a very little ""updraft"". If you saw ""SAW"" then don't watch ""SAW II"" - better remind yourself of some good horror, something special, not on a stupid continuation."

I got to see it expecting a worthy successor of SAW I, which was great in script ( e.g. shocking scenes and idea) and building up a certain plot of suspense. The characters were authentic and interesting, the story was plausible (considering the overall strangeness of it, of course). The script of SAW 2 is very, very poor, the acting extremely (!) poor and the few plots tried for are in any way totally incoherent with the rest of the story line. I think of it as deeply insulting. Question: What came to the minds of the people who made this one? Do they intend to annoy us? Do they even care? Recommendation: Don't spend any money on this movie!"

","If you haven't seen the first ""Saw"", I think you'll enjoy this movie big time! It has a nice and somewhat more complicated story and also some interesting twists. Don't forget about the gore either. All in all an intelligent horror/thriller movie. <br/><br/>However, if you did see the original ""Saw"", you might find the movie a bit more predictable (this does not include the end, for we're used to a nice and surprising ending). You might also see some similarities to the movie ""Cube"". I also find the acting in ""Saw 2"" slightly disappointing: having seen ""Saw 2"" right after I saw the first ""Saw"". Most characters have sort of a predefined role to play and they do just that from start to end (with minor exceptions). In ""Saw"", you really didn't know what to expect. This is different with ""Saw 2"". But I guess this is the case with sequels most of the time.<br/><br/>As I already mentioned however, the ending is more than welcome and comes with some nice flashbacks. This makes up for the predictability of the rest of the movie. If you haven't seen the first ""Saw"", I really suggest you see that one first, being the better and more original of the two. After that, ""Saw 2"" will keep you interested. However, it won't leave you with the same WOW!!!! you'd have after seeing the original ""Saw"" for the first time."

","If you enjoyed Saw, I have a feeling you will enjoy Saw 2. After watching both movies on the theater screen, it was hard to judge which one is best. After all, when you watch the first movie of any series, the story is new and therefore less predictable than when it is developed into a sequel, but I think I've finally decided that the second movie is the best, mostly because there is a lot of movement. Though the confinement in the first movie creates an interesting tension in the theater, the second one creates an overwhelming sensation as you watch the characters travel from room to room. I also like the idea of putting a whole group of characters together in such a creepy situation. The expectation is that they will work together to get out, but this movie shows you how members of a group against each other when their lives are at stake. I also like how viewers are presented with the idea that a group of people who seem very different can have more in common than they realize face to face. The twists in this movie are great! I hope a third movie can be developed from this storyline."

It was well paced, kept you guessing, and (more importantly) kept you interested in the answers.<br/><br/>The same is not so for SAW II. The all-knowing Jigsaw is back again and he couldn't be more of a bore. Although the movie clocks in at just over 90 minutes, it drags woefully in spots. Watching how the kidnapped victims react to the booby trapped house (and each other), it wasn't long before I was hoping Jigsaw would kill them all quickly.<br/><br/>Donnie Wahlberg steps up and delivers a solid performance.

Back in the 80's you could make Texas Chainsaw Massacre 27, and Friday the 13th part 15, and even multiple Nightmare on Elm Street movies. The formula DOESN'T work anymore. The first Saw made you think... the second did until the end. Then it made me cringe in horror - at the mindlessness of the writers.

Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer make a great detective team. Beverley Mitchell and Franky G are both fantastic, Shawnee Smith is very good, and Tobin Bell, as 'Jigsaw' is very creepy.<br/><br/>Be warned though, this film contains some seriously disturbing death scenes, lots of blood, plenty of jump scenes, oh and a reference to ""The Last House on the Left""."

","damn, and yes damn, I love this. We are still left with a feeling that we don't know who Jigsaw really is. not this cancer patient who was unable to defend himself against an angry cop. this same person who escaped and ran and fled so healthily in the 1st movie.<br/><br/>I don't see why we couldn't have Danny Glover (even in a cameo) to provide some continuity with movie number 1. Mr Wahlberg was so cro-magnon looking! I thought he was wearing some sort of weird special effects make-up appliance on his forehead.<br/><br/>Had he over trimmed his eye-brows? In certain scenes I couldn't stop watching them change from shot to shot. He looked like a damn caveman! I thought he was the missing link in a few scenes.<br/><br/>Wahlberg is a bad cop gone worse. The opening scene grabs you into Jigsaw and his world and won't let you go until the end credits roll to let you go. the way the movie returns to the scene of the 1st film is very nice indeed.<br/><br/>This killer invisible gas that Jigsaw describes sounds like the Ebola Virus. This guy is a cancer patient who has gone through a car crash and being impaled. Where did he get a nerve agent like that? It's not exactly a thing you can just pop off down to the chemists for is it? Anyway. Some of the puzzles and traps are really crappy. Like the ""X marks the spot"" garbage. Also the key in the syringes. The fact that they don't even find the hole until they have virtually no time left. We really should have been given a chance to find out what was behind that door. Did no-one think of entering rooms through walls? The spiky baseball bat would have helped there. The idea of the video feed not being live was fun.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was like Cube and Cube 2, It left me wanting to know when the next one is out.<br/><br/>Loved it."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The second in ""Saw"" series has many more victims involved - this time some outside the game. First time director (and co-writer) Darren Lynn Bousman teams up with Leigh Whannell (from the first one) to try and take the series to the next level of evil.<br/><br/>Returning are (the always juicy) Tobin Bell as John/Jigsaw, Dina Meyer as the detective (Dina - time to take your career out of horror films)and Shawnee Smith who returns as Amanda. Adding some punch to this one is Donnie Wahlberg who is always solid as the almost normal, quietly off-center cop. Also among those added to the mix are Glenn Plummer (the guy with the dog in ""The Day After Tomorrow"") and Beverly Mitchell (from the recently canceled ""7th Heaven"").<br/><br/>The same formula is used, but we have more desperate types in this one. Time, again, plays a crucial role and as you would expect, things are not always as they seem. I do tend to enjoy the evil cat and mouse game, but be prepared for a gore fest.<br/><br/>You know what to expect and ""Saw II"" delivers."

","Absolutely fabulous film with a series of strange twists from beginning to end! would recommend the film 2 anybody who watched the 1st and enjoyed it. Very well created! WOULD Definitely WATCH AGAIN!...... Not 4 the faint hearted! Brilliant carry on from the previous films with as much as the old characters as possible! Very gory but not making the films look too fake! Just the right amount of jumps and scares! A lot of sick deaths and murders. Also can be very confusing at parts but helps with the twist of the film... every thing not understood is then explained at the end! I could tell how the film was going to be after seeing the guidance 18!! Couldn't wait to watch it though! would recommend to you all!"

","this film is the most twisted film that i have seen. the ending was totally unexpected, but very very well created. i would not suggest this film to people who don't like gore and don't like jumps because believe me, this film has both. the tag line for the film, ""yes, there will be blood"", well didn't they get that right. i was just totally shocked at the imagination used. i was expecting this to be just a money spin off the 1st SAW film, but if anything this film is better. If you did enjoy the first SAW then without a doubt this is the film for you. i was scared for many nights after i watched this film and was replaying the events over in my head many a time. this was just one totally amazingly directed but twisted film i have ever seen."
"gnobnit","7","1","2","13 November 2005"," Welcome to the new age of horror thrillers!
","Welome to the new age of horror thrillers! ""Saw"" and ""Saw II"" have surely set a new trend and style of horror/thrillers. No more brainless muscles/skins running from killers with weapons - here comes you psychological game of survival.<br/><br/>I just watched ""Saw II"" even though the trailers told me not to. In the movie trailer of ""Saw II"", I saw ""Scream 3"", ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" or...you got the idea - one of those several-mixed-gender-and-race-characters-getting-killed-one-by-one Hollywood horror films ever since the early 90's. But I was terribly wrong.<br/><br/>The trailer is NOT the movie. ""Saw II"" is one of the rare squeal that allows you to further relate to the previous film AND further appreciate the both. ""Saw II"" carries on most of the ""Saw"" spirit and definitely adds more spices of horror. It successfully brought itself into a great horror film without destroying the suspense-based reputation of ""Saw.""<br/><br/>The squeal started where ""Saw"" was ended. In ""Saw II"", the infamous ""artist"" Jigsaw is continuing his work for the people who, in his opinion, do not appreciate life - ""Those who do not appreciate life do not deserve life."" The great rawness in the opening scene will refresh your memory with Jigsaw's personal-tailored ""games"", carefully-selected players, and most of all, his twisted torture that makes people voluntarily lose blood and/or self in order to win back their lives...<br/><br/>The plot was mostly very smooth and well-developed, yet with some commercialized, so-so moments. To avoid spoilers, I will not describe the scenes. There are some stomach-turning-popcorn-dropping horror moments, and they were not done by the disgusting deaths, but the terrifying struggle for not dying. Again, the great rawness that ""Saw"" brought to us a year ago skillfully lived on through the squeal.<br/><br/>The squeal also ended where ""Saw"" started...Few twists around the last 30mins+, the ending will surely make you jaw drop like Jagsaw's victims.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Saw II"" is made 75% for the ""Saw"" fans and 25% to keep the new and/or general audiences and the box office satisfied, which is an excellent proportion for any squeal, especially horror thrillers. This movie kept you thinking during and after watching it. Let's cross our fingers and hope that the ""Saw"" series would never become ""Scream"", or the ""Nightmare"" series. Hope the producers either preserve the quality, or know when to stop.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>T"
"DJAkin","7","1","2","13 November 2005"," I saw this movie
","This movie was OK, and it delivered a few goods. Just about as good as the FIRST ONE. I liked the part where that guy almost burned to death in that incinerator. The odd thing is that the guy was 1/2 way out of that burner and for some reason, the others got scared and refused to pull him out? And the DEATH MASK! Oh yes, that part was gruesome. I loved the way they are leaving it open for a third installment. Donnie Wahlberg delivered the goods a a COP. That dude from 24 was good as JIGSAW. He was so intelligent yet very evil. His booby traps were obeying reproach. They were ingenious!! That stupid Hispanic drug dealer, Xavier, could have just asked for the back of the neck numbers instead of acting like Jack Nicholson from THE SHINING. And what about that stupid girl who got her HANDS TRAPPED in the glass? She could have used her OTHER hand but instead a bad case of the stupids got a hold of her. All in all, a great flick!!!"

","I am a fan of the first Saw. Many people tried to tell me that Saw 2 was better than the first and that i would love the sequel. I had to see the movie simply out of curiosity. I didn't expect a quality movie, and I was shockingly surprised. I would rate the first saw with an 8 out of 10. But Saw 2 narrowly edged it out with a 9 out of 10 in my book. The movie keeps a faster pace than the first and has more twists and turns than I could keep track of. I suggest seeing Saw right before going to see Saw 2, any fan of Saw will LOVE this movie!<br/><br/>P.S. Don't eat anything heavy before you see the movie, it might end up on the guy sitting in front of you"
"badgrrlkane","8","1","2","13 November 2005"," As good of a sequel as the original,but is a totally different movie.
","Saw 2 though not done completely by the first 2 creators of the original Saw is as good as the 1st film. You get the same aspect of a game being played as the characters wake up after being drugged or beaten over the head, to wake up in a house they do not know, & find out they are locked in breathing a very toxic nerve gas that was planted by the serial-killer Jigsaw. Throughout the movie I kept thinking, if Jigsaw is so cancer-stricken how in the hell did he,if he's so sick booby-trap the house, lock up the place as you see in this film,he's breathing through an oxygen-tank & is barely able to walk. The answer you find out at the end of this film & it is a shocker! Very cool plot twists just like the first film. More gorier (which I really appreciated!) & just as suspenseful.Donnie Wahlberg,Dina Meyer,Shawnee Smith & Tobin Bell did awesome jobs throughout. And, the scene where Frankie G's character cuts off the back of his own neck to be able to read his number to open the safe which has his number of the combination on it, was most brutal & will have you squirming in your seat most definitely. Also,the guy who plays Obi, I was surprised to see wasn't Steve Railsback, as my god he's a dead ringer. And,one other question I have is the scene where Shawnee Smith's character Amanda & the cop's kid Daniel are running through the underground portion of the house & they come upon a door where upon opening it, they find the abandoned bathroom that Cary Elwes & Leigh Wannell's character were in, in the 1st film. So,how come if they were in there, you see Leigh Wannell's corpse decaying on the bathroom floor still connected to the pipe by the chain, but you also see another body lying on the floor decaying as well & what i want to know is, was that Cary Elwes character Dr Lawrence Gordon, who in the first film crawls out of the bathroom when the door's is opened by the man who kidnapped his family,and after he's killed,larry goes to go get help,even though he had to Saw off his own foot & was bleeding to death? Or, did they forget that Jigsaw was the guy laying in the middle of the floor, & that he got up after Larry left,when it was just him & Leigh Wannells character in the room,closed the door & Said Game Over?Or,did he find Dr Gordon & drag his\m back in the room, & let him bleed to death? Never was answered in Saw 2. Very cool way to end this film & leave it open for a Saw 3 which they are already promising us in Halloween of 06. Also,if you love this film,check out the new comic series from IDW Publushing, that continues on the Jigsaw man quest for making us ingrates appreciate are lives much much more. Very cool film. I was a little worried when I initially fount out it wasn't the original creators writing it but this writer was just as good, as initially this was supposed to be a different film altogether, that had nothing to do with the Saw franchise whatsoever, & Leigh Wannell came in & helped the guy re-write it so it would fit the Saw storyline.Very cool if you ask me. **** out of *****"
"vravina","7","1","2","13 November 2005"," Saw II = entertaining
","Man, I love the two Saw films. It's because I'm a sucker for twist endings, basically. Twist endings are my favorite. I like to be blown away by something that was right in front of me the whole time, but I still managed to overlook it. It's a little bit like magic. The magician misdirects your attention while performing a secret move that you don't notice. The only difference is that with a twist ending, they're like ""Look at this secret move I did while you weren't looking, earlier. Awesome, huh?"" and then I'm like ""Wow, that was awesome."" Anyway, in addition to having a twist ending, the first Saw was quite original. Taking place almost entirely in a bathroom, with the two main characters chained to the walls and still managing to be engaging was impressive and not something that had been done too many times before. Phone Booth, a movie which takes place almost entirely in a phone booth, is reminiscent of the first Saw.<br/><br/>The second Saw, the one I'm supposed to be reviewing, is more mainstream horror/thriller. It takes place in a house, where eight people have been placed and are breathing in a terrible virus. Jigsaw (the killer, played by Tobin Bell) has placed antidotes in various places in the house. Also, there are a bunch of traps everywhere and they kill people, sometimes. Plus, there's a twist ending! The acting is pretty OK, nothing too fancy and that's goes for the entire film, I'd say. It's not an amazing example of exquisite film-making. It is, however, terribly entertaining. If you liked the first Saw, it's likely that you will like this one. If, however, you cannot stand gore, you probably won't like this film. If you dislike horror movies, rejoice, because the two Saw films would fit into the genre ""very bloody action/adventure""."
"ixluvxjamesxfranco","8","1","2","13 November 2005"," definitely worth your while
","Before I review this movie, I must say, I've never seen the first Saw. However, there was little confusion, mostly because the person I was watching it with had seen the first one, but also because they contain references, which catch you up a bit, and make you want to see the first movie if you hadn't yet. It's not like an entirely new beginning. At the end of the film, you realize they tie the two films together. I don't want to give too much away, though. There was one character I completely despised, however, because he did pretty much everything the Jigsaw told him not to. It was a really enjoyable film, though, the type of horror film that gets high reviews because it's not just all about blood and gore, it's about using your brain, something Jennifer Love Hewitt and all the other idiotic teenagers who have come before her, who have survived solely for their good looks and pathetic helplessness. This movie did make me disagree with some of its points, however, which I liked. It wasn't trying to be fair, and have a happy ending like Scream 3 did (Jesus, I should really go watch some better horror movies); it's about death at its worst. Death doesn't kill the dumb blondes and leave the slightly-intelligent brunettes. It has its own opinion, that you only live if you're worthy. Or not."
"mrrick37","10","1","2","12 November 2005"," Who says sequels suck?
","Three of us went to see Saw II and were just blown away! The teasers on TV do NOT do the film justice! A lot of people have been asking me about it and I smile, shake my head and say, ""You just have to see it, you just have to see it!"" It has always been said that the sequels of most movies leave you wanting more, or in some cases, asking why did they even spend the money? This one had every aspect of the horror movie you paid to see: blood, violence,creativity, intriguing characters (Jigsaw is the MAN!), and enough twists and turns with just a touch of imagination from the director that had three hardcore horror fans sitting on the edges of our seats! This man has a truly brilliant, disturbed mind...and I thank him for it!"

","fantastic movie. parts of it were a little bit predictable, but even though i knew roughly what was going to happen at parts, it came as a shock to see it on screen, and even then an extra twist was thrown in. and the way he targeted each individual person and manipulated their weaknesses was genius. i spent the entire movie huddled up in my chair hugging my knees and clutching the armrest. it didn't help that i have an intense phobia of needles. It fit so perfectly with the first movie i couldn't believe it wasn't by the same guy. some might label this movie as too violent or just unnesccesary but the movie caries the plot without having to rely on simple shock value. true, there was plenty of shock value(for those who have seen the movie i am referring to the scene where the guy can't see the number on the back of his neck and he has to resort to...well....)and some of the things they did i still haven't figured out how they did it. and the son of the police officer was really cute. the look of desperation and the bloodshot eyes didn't detract from his appearance."
"kizimaji","10","1","2","12 November 2005"," Oh Yes, There Was Blood
","This movie was SO amazing! I saw Saw 1 and Saw 2 wrapped it up beautifully, but now there's more to the story... Not only was this movie truly frightening, it had a plot line! After the movie, my dad and I debated the story all night- you can't debate Godzilla. It makes you think what you would do in similar situations. It makes you ask if what's happening is right. The cast is fantastic as well. The story hits the ground running and you're along for the ride with the characters, loving them, hating them, and screaming along with them. You can never figure out the end- the twists will drive you bonkers trying to figure it out!"
"seifex","8","1","2","12 November 2005"," I was in shock the rest of the evening
","For everyone who said this was not as good as the first, I disagree. It may not be as astounding in the same way, due to the fact that the first one did a fine job of desensitizing you to Jigsaw's ways, and because with four times the characters this time, you can only grow so attached to each of them to certain extents. That said, this will do everything the first one did to you (other than surprise you) even worse.<br/><br/>The gore, like in the first one, is about 90% in your mind. The films both do great jobs of only showing a bit of gore, yet putting a shocking, vivid, and highly disturbing image in your mind of what is happening. This film also takes twisted and wrong to the next level. If you thought the barbed wire room, the reverse bear trap, and the candle guy were horrible, you should probably go to this movie on an empty stomach.<br/><br/>I would be lying if I said this movie's most important plot piece isn't fairly predictable, but that doesn't mean that the other 99% of the movie won't catch you completely off-guard. Like the original SAW, the ending completely ties everything together in a brilliant twist that has your mind mulling it over for the next few hours.<br/><br/>Basically, this doesn't reshape the world of psychological horror the way SAW did, but--unlike most sequels--this keeps everything on a sure, steady footing. 8/10 with the highest recommendation"
"Badger-20","9","1","2","11 November 2005"," Beyond my expectations
","I expected ""Saw II"" to be Pretty Much Just Okay. I wasn't sure how it could surpass the original, considering the original film's Final Twist(s), and the trailer for this sequel didn't have me jumping up and down to see it. But ""Saw II"" surpassed any expectations anyone might have. While I wasn't surprised for Dina Meyer to reprise her role from ""Saw,"" and I was pleased she has more to do here, I was even more pleased to discover the return of Shawnee Smith from the first film (my being a bit of a fan of this expressive underrated lovely and talented actress notwithstanding). But in this awesome sequel, the twists keep a'coming, and this film had me more on edge by *far* more than even the first. The tricks and traps are a bit more creative, and I love movie villains who have various contingencies covered. Which side is thinking ahead of the other? ""Saw II"" keeps the viewer guessing and stays true to the flavour of ""Saw."""

One thing that didn't make it perfect was the fact that the movie showed you what happens with the people, like, showing death. Now what made the first one perfect was because it didn't show you how the people died, which made it even more bloodier, but this one is worth watching. I loved the actor who played the Jigsaw killer, i also didn't like some of the characters in the house, and some of it was more annoying, like the guy on steroids, he just kinda took everything too fast, but if your in that situation, i guess taking things fast is the answer."

","While I'll admit that I couldn't watch some of the scenes (I'm squeamish, that's not that hard), I do have to strike down any serious comparissons that this series draws to David Fincher's SEVEN. Unlike SAW, SEVEN had a few things going for it that this series never had, but namely great actors (three Oscar winners), and David Fincher. You can argue about Fincher's talent all you want, but his stench can clearly be seen all throughout these two movies, particularly this installment. The death trap house might as well have been a soap factory at 1537 Paper Street and have had the names of the seven deadly sins written around the place.<br/><br/>SAW II is a steaming pile of crap, completely exploiting the unexpected success of a movie that was originally intended to go straight to DVD. The first movie had some credible and talented actors, namely Cary Elwes, Danny Glover and Tobin Bell (an accomplished actor who had long before paid his dues in bit parts for over twenty five years). While Tobin was obviously going to be featured in this film, his character was relatively undeveloped from the end of the first film. It also seems the folks in charge were unable to line up established actors, so they settle for Marky Mark's little brother in his first high profile since his (two minute) roll in THE SIXTH SENSE, and two quasi-known actors rounding out the cast of newcomers are Glenn Pummer (SHOWGIRLS) and Beverly Mitchell (7TH HEAVEN).<br/><br/>But who cares about who's in it? The question is whether or not it's worth your time and money. When you take this thing down to the brass tacks we have an un-intriguing story that sells itself short by trying to make us flinch, cringe and squirm in our seats by building tension that is never relieved, and grossing us out with practical and CGI special effects. So I suppose by those standard, this movies is successful. Unfortunately for this franchise, the ending isn't clever ... well neither was the first one, but this one is even less so than their last attempt at an USUAL SUSPECTS twist. The characters have as much depth as a cookie sheet. Never once do any of the characters try to think their way out of a situation, they simply stumble around from one blatantly obvious trap to another. Just about the only thing that would make this movie less cheesy is if they'd cut through the crap and have Michael Myers, Leatherface or Jason Voorhees jump out wielding a machete. This movie isn't a thriller, it's a glorified snuff flick. I've seen movies made for the Sci-Fi channel that had better writing.<br/><br/>My final verdict is that you might as well save yourself from the $20 outing and go rent RETURN OF THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or FACES OF DEATH, or even read a Dean Koontz novel. Nearly anything would be better than wasting your money on this pitiful excuse for a horror flick. While this movie may inspire its own imitators, this series will ultimately collect dust at your local movie rental store with the occasional passerby reminiscing with his friend, ""Dude, you remember those movies? God did they suck."""
"dpedal1","8","1","2","7 November 2005"," A taught thriller that ties perfectly to the first movie.
","The first two Saw films have certainly found its audience and is inevitably here to stay. I have heard that they are already beginning production on Saw 3. And why shouldn't they? Saw was great tense thriller and the second one was as well. The two films tie in perfectly creating a whole, which is very rare in the horror genre, because most horror movies you can watch each film without having seen the predecessors and still enjoy it.<br/><br/>Saw II begins with a man in a room with a ""DeathMask"" around his face. Jigsaw, the infamous killer from the first one, appears on a television screen in the room. Just like in the first one, he wants to play a game; he explains the rules to our friend in the chair and then begins the timer. I won't tell you what the game is or what happens, I will leave that to you to discover and squirm in your chair as I did.<br/><br/>After the opening scene we see our main character. He is a detective who does not have the best relationship with his son. He stumbles along some hints that lead him to Jigsaw and soon discovers that he will have to play a game of his own. A game that involves his son and about four or five other people trapped in a house full of lethal nerve gas. They only have two hours to find the antidote to the nerve gas. Each of the antidotes is placed in a trap, so you can image the carnage that ensues. As our hero-the father played by Donnie Wahlberg-plays his game with Jigsaw, which consists of him simply sitting there and talking to Jigsaw while this group stumbles through the house killing themselves through the traps, the intensity builds and I found myself on the edge of my seat just like the first one.<br/><br/>I have been asked why anyone wants to go and see a movie like this. It is a sadistic film, and I have joked about how the writers need to be locked away. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the writers are ingenious. The writers have put together a taught thriller that draws you in and you find yourself biting your nails. That's what a good movie does; it puts you in the fray. I also feel like it is ingenious because it is basic human nature to want to see things like that. We are a curious people and when we here about people being put in situations like this, we want to know how far they will go.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. I loved the first Saw and to see how the two tie together makes them that much better. This is a series that draws you in, makes your heart pound and your fists clench. When a movie has done something like that, then it has accomplished its goal. Allowing you to leave this world for a few hours and enjoy something new altogether."

I know Jigsaw is my boy for life. he gave everybody the okie-dok. i remember seeing the Saturday after it came and i immediately called my brother, who is excited to see the movie, and i told him you got to see this movie. I must admit though that a couple parts may be a little cheesy but that can be overlooked. I know the acting was a lot better.

","Not a big deal but I just want to point out this inconsistency.<br/><br/>Jigsaw always maintains that he did not kill anyone, they made the choice themselves.<br/><br/>But what about the gut in the first movie who was stuck in the room full of razor wire. He had no choice, if he stayed there he would have been locked in forever. He tried to escape, but he still died. The way I see it, jigsaw killed him. He played the game the way he was supposed to play by sacrificing some of himself and enduring pain in order to live, but he died in the process.

"nbgmad","6","1","2","5 November 2005"," Saw I Very Good, Saw II Not so
","After watching Saw earlier this year, i was hoping that the movie would not have a sequel. Given the history of bad sequels for great movies, my expectations for Saw II was low. After recently watching the movie, my expectations were met...and the movie actually went above them...but not enough for me to warrant a recommendation to watch it in the theaters.<br/><br/>The first movie, in my opinion, is a classic suspense/thriller that was smart, innovative and knew how to make the most out of little. The theme was clear, well developed and thoroughly connected to all the events in the movie. The second movie simply rode on the coat tails of the success of the first.<br/><br/>The movie contained gratuitous blood and gore. The first movie, believe it or not, really did not (contrary to what people may think given the movie poster). The many, many scenes of the victims vomiting blood and puke, the overdone deaths of the characters and the infamous scene at the end with the knife to the back of the neck...all were not needed (as well as the gratuitous cussing). Additionally, there were far too many useless characters. In Saw I, each character had a role to play in the movie...and their roles made sense. In Saw II, not the case. Who is the girl with the pale face? Why is she with them? Just to scream and cry a lot? A lot of the characters were simply used to add to the gore effect. Saw II took the nuanced elements in Saw I and over blown it. Sort of what Ring II did with Ring I.<br/><br/>Also, the sterile, urbanesque feel of the first movie was diminished markedly in the second. A lot of it had to do with the marked increase in characters...and the annoying and useless SWAT scenes.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, the movie was an OK suspense thriller. The ending was not obvious and caught most by surprise. The jigsaw theme was still evident. If you didn't see the first Saw, you will likely think the movie OK. If you did see the first (and liked it), you will likely be disappointed with the sequel."

","The only credit I will give this movie is that it is better than the first one. Anyone who has seen the first one knows that is not saying much. The acting is not nearly as bad as the first, however it is hardly believable. I will give these C and B actors some credit, they didn't have much to work with. The script dialog sounds like it was written by a high school student. A movies plot shouldn't have to be believable...thats Hollywood, but the way the people act and react to situations needs to feel real in order to let the viewer into the characters. In no way would real people in any of these situations act or talk the way they did in the film. Aside from primitive dialog and poor character development, the plot went far astray from what makes a successful horror film. Whats with the Law and Order feel to this movie? Is it a cop drama or a horror flick? In order to chill and awe an audience, you have to put them in the mind of the frightened victims. I merely watched them from afar as the scenes changed point of view too often, between character victims and the police. Never once was I able to feel what anyone in the movie felt. Every death I saw coming miles away. At no point did I jump or cringe. In fact, the only means of death I found original was the one that opened the movie. My overall thought is that they spent a great deal of time on a complex story, but did nothing in the means of backing it up.<br/><br/>P.S.- If you want to watch a real horror movie, go rent the simple...yet brilliantly successful High Tension."

The only movie that is really scarier than this is Saw one. the plot is great. I won't tel the plot, only that it is similar to the first. The acting is OK, but the action is simply staggering.

","This movie rocked. My only disappointment was there were too many people in the theater when I went. I like to go after scary flicks have been out for a couple of weeks so the theater is rather empty. If it's a good horror flick, this really adds to the movie. I saw Fear.com and there was only one other person in the theater. Very cool.<br/><br/>On to the movie. I thought this was a great flick. Initially I was rather upset that they revealed Jigsaw really early on, but this eventually became one of the smart parts to the movie. He is a watcher, but this time, he could actually affect the characters in ways other than leaving tape recordings and clues on how to escape. He actually was interacting with the main pawn (matthews). It was somewhat comical when he was getting the heck beat out of him since he is rather aged and deathly ill, but I guess when your kid is in dire straits, you would do anything to get to him.<br/><br/>I can't wait until the next installment.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was when the guy went in the incinerator, even though you pretty much knew what was going to happen."

","The game: six seemingly unrelated people are thrown in a dilapidated house with two hours to figure out how to get the antidote to the poison gas that has infected them. Only a detective with a major stake in the action can unravel the mystery. The jigsaw is back and his game is even more intricate and twisted this go around in this sequel to the highly successful sequel to the 2004 highly imaginative original. <br/><br/>I deliberately avoided reading stuff about the flick (thanks to an incident on the Horror board last year that revealed the twist of the original) so I would enjoy this one hopefully more. It would be hard to replicate the original since the cat's out of the proverbial bag and the novel approach to Saw (2004) was unrepeatable. But the filmmaker's do a good job continuing the story of the first one. The games are more intricate and the action is bloodier. The look of the film is pretty much the same as the original, dirty and grimy. The grit and grain cover the whole canvas which adds to the action. They did go a bit overboard with the choppy editing (especially in the final reel) but that's the brakes. The acting is pretty strong with several recognizable faces: Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer with Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell returning from the original. The action gets pretty intense at times and some of the death traps are pretty gnarly (ugh, needles) and to no surprise there was a twist ending (supposedly five endings were shot to hide the true ending) and could spin this into a full blown franchise.<br/><br/>In short this is a fine sequel and if you're a fan you will dig it. It channels many things from the original so that would be a wise place to start but if you've not seen you could probably see this one. <br/><br/>3/5 or 7/10"
"royale_w_cheez44","8","1","2","2 November 2005"," As good as the first Saw was, this is even better
","Everyone who watched ""Saw"" had one of two opinions on it: either they loved it or they hated it. I for one LOVED it and so I was stoked when I heard that Saw II was coming out just in time for Halloween. I was a little skeptical, however, for Saw came out only a year ago. The sequel, however, surpassed my every expectation. And yes, there is plenty of blood and guts to go around! All of the problems from Saw were fixed in Saw II. The crappy acting of Danny Glover and Carey Elwes does not carry over to Saw II, in which most of the actors are believable and don't have crappy accents. Tobin Bell is superb in his role as the dying Jigsaw killer and Shawnee Smith is wonderful a recovering drug addict stuck once again in Jigsaw's puzzle. Donnie Wahlburg also gives a decent performance. My only complaint with the acting is Franky G. Honestly, I think they could have gotten a better actor for the part, he just kind of annoyed me.<br/><br/>Overall, the film plays out in a way that expands upon the original's premise and creates a creepy and tense atmosphere on its own. Trust me, at certain moments in the film, your jaw will hit the floor. It's still shocking. And the ending is a fantastic and unexpected twist that leaves the door open for a Saw III. I personally can't wait! Another thing, if you plan on seeing this movie, DO NOT miss the opening scene. That's all I can tell you."

","This movie could have been wonderful. A house with lots of traps and some potentially interesting characters. But what did we get? A house with lots of traps but we hardly see many of them and many characters, yes, but most of them have the depth of a saucer.<br/><br/>The sequel was very disappointing. The character development that made ""Saw"" was missing and this fault really sabotaged the film. We didn't see enough of the traps and puzzles. In the end, all that we saw was the characters stumbling about the house and not doing very much-a bit frustrating when we consider what they could have been doing! Trying to solve and complete the game.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film was a wasted opportunity and if a sequel does go ahead then I hope they make it a lot better than this film."

The second one was very interesting and I wasn't totally disappointed but the ending could've been better and the whole twist with Amanda (Shawnee Smith) was, well, kind of stupid. Personally I thought that could've been done better. But the rules of JIgsaw's game with Det. Matthews and certain comments (Like ""He's in a safe and secure place"")were cool and the cryptic messages was awesome. I thought the role of Xavier (Franky G) was a little overdone, but then again I'm not a psychologist so who knows how a person will act under those conditions. All in all the move was pretty good, but if they make a part 3 (like the ending suggests) then it will have to go above and beyond the first one to attract my attention."

","I just seen the flick for the third time last night and I've got to say, it doesn't disappoint. It offers all that the first one had to offer and then some. My only gripe with the film is that it had too many center characters. With the film running at roughly an hour and a half, it's hard to focus on all of the cast and give them their own story. So if and when the next one comes out, I'd suggest keeping it down to three or less central characters (with side character killings ala Saw 1) or bump up the length to around two hours. All in all though, it was a great movie in a genre that seems to have ran dry of ideas. I give it a 9/10."

","I remember a few weeks before this movies release my friend and I were discussing what was going to happen in this sequel. He stated as a joke that it would be Amanda who'll take John's place in his sick games. The sad part was.. he was right.<br/><br/>After sitting through the movie I enjoyed every second of the film but what upsets me the most was the ending. In the first you don't know who it is so that what kept me occupied. In the second, we see that it is Amanda(who is the only one to survive Johns deadly games)who is learning John's ways.<br/><br/>How did a heroin addict become fascinated with the jigsaw games. Wasn't she scared half to death when she was in one? I'm sorry but I just don't see her character coming to take the place of John. I personally just saw her as the only victim to survive, nothing more. Now, they decided to reuse her character and make her part of Johns games. I didn't buy that. Her character in the first one did not seem psychopathic in anyway. However, these writers are getting carried away with their ideas and that just destroyed the ending for me. I was expecting something else rather than ""Amanda"" who isn't even really seen that much in the first one and is now a main character in this film. <br/><br/>I tell you, thees writers must've thought they could pull this off.. they were wrong.<br/><br/>A man as a live or die game creator sounds more scary then a heroin addict who survived one of the games and has a stupid voice. It's almost like a kid pretending to be the Jigsawkiller. She's horrible. The idea was horrible. the second one will never be as good as the first. Enough said."

What was the point of Dina Meyers character? To bore the hell out of me! She brought nothing to the movie and was a waste of time. In my point of view the director successfully scared me but underestimated my ability to look beyond the gore. For example not being able to get out of the house..get real! You could fall out the windows. Being stupid and falling for every request..I know lets climb into the oven and get the serum. Stupid! The ending also wrecked it for me.

"Moviguy","8","1","2","31 October 2005"," Man, this one surprised me!
","I have to start this by saying that I am not a fan of the first ""Saw"", but the second one looked interesting, and I liked the set up, so I gave it a shot. Man, I'm glad I did. For starters, the one thing that I hated in the first film, the acting, is a lot better here. Donnie Walhberg has his moments of hamming it up, but for the most part he keeps it restrained. Dina Myer is given a much bigger role this time around, and impressed the heck out of me. The stand out though was Shawnee Smith as Amanda. Her character was fairly well developed, and I was rooting for her the entire time. The rest of the cast also did a great job. The actor who played Jigsaw did an amazing job. The same goes for the actor who played Donnie Walhberg's son. The rest of the victims in the house aren't given much to do other than scream and cry and run and die, but for what they had to do, they did it well.<br/><br/>The acting was better, and so was the pacing. The first film dragged in the middle, but this movie... no chance. There is non-stop action the second the story moves to the house. At no point was I thinking ""just get on with it"" already. Everything moved quickly, and there are some great edge of your seat moments.<br/><br/>And the violence in the movie is what you would expect. Unrestrained, nasty, and mean. The traps are no where near as complicated as the first film, but are still very effective. There are some moments that just had my jaw on the floor. The movie is very brutal, and doesn't cut away (well... I'll talk about that later). The effects are also very well done, and very realistic. So, this baby earned it's R rating. For gore fans, this is a plus. For the weak stomached viewer... you already know to stay away. I mean the tag line is ""Yes... there will be blood."" Come on! The ending of the movie (which I will not mention here) also impressed me. It tied the first film in perfectly, and had that nice little bite to it that I was expecting. That's all I'll say about that.<br/><br/>On the negative side... well, the editing is insane. I mean, when something violent is happening, it goes nuts with cuts so quick that I was worried that someone would have a seizure from the rapid rate of the images flashing on the screen. It doesn't really detract from the gore, but at the same time, it makes no sense. Also, the script isn't always the best when it comes to dialogue. Still, no where near as bad as the first film.<br/><br/>So, this is probably the first time I've ever really loved the sequel and hated the original. If they do a third (and I have a feeling they will), then I hope they continue to improve. Maybe they should take a little more time developing the next one though. Cause while I loved this one, it was kind of obvious that it was rushed."
"eckhouse24","9","1","2","30 October 2005"," Saw II Delivers the goods
","It's been awhile since I have given out a review.<br/><br/>Saw II is a film that follows in the tradition of the original. It is sick, it is bloody, and it is smart. Smart in that the film pays attention to it's own details. Unlike the first Saw, we know who the bad man is. A surprise like that is hard to duplicate but what this film does is go into more detail into why Jigsaw does what he does.<br/><br/>Like the first film, there is nothing predictable about Saw II. Just when you think you may know the answer your find out your dead wrong. There are twist and turns in this film and unlike some of the other horror films these days, these twists make sense. And the film also manages to answer some questions from the original film.<br/><br/>The acting is a bit better in this film, but thats probably cause it took them 7 more days to film Saw II than it did the first Saw. The first Saw had the director filming rehearsals and using those shots in the actual movie. This film has a slightly bigger budget which definitely helps. This film is not weakened by a script that took less than a year to write and get on screen.<br/><br/>The ending is a different kind of surprise yet it still works for me. All in all, what makes this and the first Saw great horror films is that it plays upon the viewers fears. The film knows and respects the genre and it respects it's audience. At not one moment does Saw II shortchange their viewers. That in it self makes this a successful horror film. Throw in a good plot with good dialogue, good acting and a hell of a lot of blood, scares and tension, and you have made yourself a film that will be talked about for years. And now they have done it twice."

They are both bloody, gory thriller/mystery movies. The Shining is a horror movie, as is The Exorcist or Amityville Horror. TCM is again just a bloody slasher flick. Horror movies should make the viewer go home scared, go home making you want to turn n every light before you go into a room. Saw is not that movie, I don't go to bed fearing that I will wake up in a dank room with poison in the air. However, when I watch The Shining, Poltergeist, or even the Freddy movies, I still get creeped out even after the movie is finished.

For those who did like ""Saw,"" I highly recommend the sequel. I went to the movie expecting a crummy effort at mediocre sequel, and could not have been more surprised. I was kept on the edge of my seat (not quite literally) throughout the whole film.

However, I was never able to leave my seat and take myself away from what I was seeing. It constantly keeps you guessing about all sorts of things, and I found myself trying to decipher ""Jigsaw's"" riddles along with the captives (for the most part, without much success). Many of the film's scenes are just as, if not more intense than those of the first, and for the fans of ""Jigsaw's"" infamous traps and ""games,"" well you're in luck, because there is a whole new array of sadistic contraptions and situations, some that I found quite difficult to watch, that are quite up to par with those of the first.

","SAW II (2005) **1/2 Donnie Wahlberg, Tobin Bell, Dina Meyer, Erik Knudsen, Shawnee Smith, Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Tim Burd, Beverley Mitchell, Lyriq Bent, Tony Nappo. Somewhat disappointing sequel to the first SAW with basically more of the insane same from serial killer Jigsaw (the always creepy Bell) who this time cranks things up to the 8th power : he has abducted 8 strangers (including police detective Wahlberg's teenage son Knudsen) and placed them in a condemned building with a 2 hour time period to get out of their nerve gas inducing predicament as the game is a foot. Bloody good executions are only undermined by the headache inducing editing of Kevin Greuter, the mind-assaulting music by Charlie Clouser and the overkill directing by newbie Daniel Lynn Bousman (who collaborated with original film scribe Leigh Whannell on the screenplay) in the more-is-less style of bombastic film-making."

","It seems that a 'Saw' sequel was always on the cards before the release of the original in October of 2004. The original surprised many people, as it was complex, intricate and full of suspense. As well as grossing over $100 Million on a meagre budget of only a million dollars. 'Saw II' ups the ante, not in terms of tension, but blood and gore.<br/><br/>Not many months have passed after Jigsaw's test in the last film and this time he has taken a turn for the worse. He is in a warehouse rigged up to a drip. Detective Matthews and Kerry discover the location of Jigsaw's most recent test, that takes place at the start of the film. The person that is involved in the test that Jigsaw addresses through a video tape is what he calls ""an informant, a rat, a snitch. I call you unworthy of the body you possess, of the life that you've been given."" Jigsaw informs him that the device that he is wearing, is hooked up to his neck and when the time expires will encase his head, effectively killing him. ""Think of it like a Venus fly trap"" As opposed to the first film, where at least half of the victims survived, this one does not. Eric Matthews investigates the scene and comes to the conclusion that this is once again the work of Jigsaw. Eric's son Daniel is disobedient and in trouble with the police on a regular basis. Matthews' finds Jigsaw's location and realises a terrible truth, his son is currently in a test of his own with several others. The house is filled with toxic gas and only antidotes scattered throughout the house, via completing the traps offer the gift of life. Daniel and the other victims must work together if they are to survive the next two hours. Meanwhile, Matthews' interrogates Jigsaw in the hope of figuring out the location of the toxic gas house, before the time expires.<br/><br/>The most apparent element about 'Saw II' is that the characters apart from Eric Matthews and Jigsaw have no character development, a lack of motivation and are atrociously acted. Jigsaw is the best element of 'Saw II' because we are provided with a larger background of his character. We now know that he is a cancer patient, with not long left to live. This partially explains why he does what he does. He wants other people to appreciate what life they have got left to live. Still, I'm sure there is a more effective way than putting people in traps. He must have spent his entire pension on the mechanical devices themselves. Don't ask. Now he is able to perform surgical operations on his victims. We as an audience are not supposed to think too deeply, it is after all a horror sequel.<br/><br/>The main attraction to the gore thirsty faithful is the variety of deadly traps and how they play out. Apart from the aforementioned Venus Fly Trap and the needle pit, there is little ingenuity and invention on display here. Even if some of the other traps do display an amount of this, it is cancelled out by how stupid the characters are. Jigsaw gives his victims instructions and they fail to carry them out, yet the answer is right in front of their face!<br/><br/>The films length is just over 84 minutes which helps 'Saw II' substantially. It never becomes too dull and a short runtime means that it is not painful to watch. At least for people who like gore and nice little twists at the end to keep them occupied.<br/><br/>'Saw II' is nowhere near the terror of the nightmare inducing original, regarding clever plot nuances and depth of character. It provides fans with higher levels of blood and gore, but a lack of tension almost undoes its impact completely. For fans of blood filled horrors though, what is on offer here may be more than satisfactory."
"FilmMan47","8","1","3","12 September 2014"," Slow But Second Best Film In The Series
","I swear this is the second best film in the series but due to censorship the editing was messy it is quite unexpected but good film altogether if you forget the flaws.<br/><br/>The story goes as jigsaw finally comes face to face with detective Eric Matthews as he trapped some people in some hidden area the police try to find the place but Eric must listen to jigsaw as his son is also trapped inside.<br/><br/>The cast members were amazing specially Emmanuelle Vaugier & Shawnee Smith gives one hell of a performance the scene where she gets thrown in a deep pit full of injection with open needles is quite scary i love her since this film.<br/><br/>It's got some intense scenes not for weak hearted and new traps jigsaw is one cool guy i just hated him first but that's what makes him most awesome the only one who can end jigsaw is agent 47 that person is a psycho who just don't respect this world.<br/><br/>I wont go in must detail or discussion over this but i have to say this i have never ever liked critical reception and never will it kills cinema this is a purely audience entertainer so forget what anyones says just enjoy this.<br/><br/>Overall Saw 2:2005 is another great film for horror fans way better then evil dead series my rating is 8/10.Recommended."
"MaximumMadness","7","1","3","17 February 2012"," Though I always found ""Saw II"" to be a bit over-rated, this is still a fundamentally solid, enjoyable sequel... It just has some big flaws...
","Now that the series is sort-of officially over, looking back on the seven ""Saw"" films, I get a nostalgic feeling. They were a huge part of my teen-aged years and my early 20's, and it was my Halloween tradition. And so, I am looking back and writing this review for ""Saw II"", a film that is actually a very solid, fun ride, despite some big flaws. I still feel it's slightly overrated, but it's still a good film.<br/><br/>Release in 2005, ""Saw II"" is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (who would go on to direct the next two entries in the series, as well as the cult favorite ""Repo: The Gentic Opera""), whom also co-wrote the script with Leigh Whannel. (""Saw I-III"", ""Dead Silence"", ""Insidious"") The film stars Tobin Bell as Jigsaw/John Kramer, Donnie Whalberg as Detective Eric Mathews, and Shawnee Smith as Amanda, a returning survivor from the first film.<br/><br/>Detective Mathews is a cop with a shaky past- he has a history of violence and may have been involved with evidence-planting, whom is lured into a new game with the infamous ""Jigsaw Killer."" Mathews and his SWAT team actually capture Jigsaw in the beginning of the film, but when it becomes clear that his son Daniel is trapped in a house loaded with booby traps, surrounded by other people who are connected to him (including Amanda, the survivor of the iconic ""Reverse Bear Trap"" from the first film), he is forced to play a game of his own with Jigsaw, in order to save his son.<br/><br/>The film was of a higher budget than the original, and the scope is vastly increased. The number of traps, as well as their complex nature, is greatly increased, and this is the first entry in the series to truly live up to its ""gorey"" reputation. (The original film had very minimal gore, to be honest, and is unfairly labeled as a ""splatter movie"", when it is actually a tense psychological thriller.) There is also a greater number of characters, and the film employs numerous flashbacks to flesh out the story of our lead ""villain"", Jigsaw.<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly decent for a horror film. Tobin Bell shines as Jigsaw, and his role is astonishingly well-played. Despite being the series villain, he actually comes off as a tragic and misguided figure, driven mad by the circumstances of his life. I remember hearing more than one person in the audience around me commenting that they felt bad for him, and sympathized with him, despite the terrible things he does. That is the mark of a great actor- someone who can really make the audience question them, and make them feel differing emotions. Donnie Whalberg is good as Mathew, and Shawnee Smith is outstanding as Amanda, who is a very tense person with a lot of secrets of her own.<br/><br/>The film is decently directed, though there are some very sloppy scenes, mainly due to the tight budget, quick shoot and the first-time director. This is also the first film in the series to use the hyper-kinetic quick-cutting that became a series stable in later films. Editor Kevin Greutert does a fantastic job, and the music by Charlie Clouser is iconic and haunting.<br/><br/>There are a lot of flaws to the film, however. For starters, as I mentioned, there are a few sloppily directed scenes, and you can tell they didn't get all of the footage they needed. In addition, though this is arguably the most ""fun"" entry in the series, a lot of the secondary characters are very blank and are not fleshed out in the least. Finally, the film moves a bit too quickly, and as this was the first entry to use the quick cutting and ""hyper-gore"", it felt too different from the first film at times. This was the ""transitional"" film in the series- the first entry to employ a lot of ideas that became regular in later films, which is where it fell apart for me.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a very fun film, and it has a decent plot and great acting. I give this a good 7 out of 10. Not the best entry in the series, but far from worst."
"greywolf_1991","10","1","3","8 February 2010"," one of the best movies I've seen
","I love this movie, unfortunately I saw it on SYFY so it wasn't as good as it would have been if I would have seen the normal version, but it was still good. I wouldn't really call this a horror movie though, it's not that scary. it was mostly just really violent and suspenseful. I think the actors were really good, as well as the special effects. this is definitely the most brutal movie I've ever seen. very violent and there were a lot of things I didn't expect to happen, most of them happened in the old warehouse where the people were trapped. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who like violent and suspenseful movies."
"arahman","5","1","3","4 March 2007"," As far as the horror/ thriller genre goes, this is above average but don't expect anything special.
","The Horror/thriller genre is a very difficult genre for film makers to succeed at. Creating a sense of reality and atmosphere are key ingredients to actually scaring your audience and it is far too easy to go down the slasher blood and guts route which in most cases results in an automatically desensitised viewer. However, some recent titles have done well at creating the appropriate level of intrigue and suspense (e.g. the Ring) or shocking level of atmosphere and gore (e.g. Texas Chainsaw Massacre) to truly frighten cinema viewers. Saw was one of the few serial killer horror movies that worked and actually brought something new to the table in terms of plot evolution and twists. Saw 2 follows in its predecessor's footsteps with a variation on the reality TV big brother premise with the backdrop story of one individual (the talented Mr Wahlberg) that exhibits significant similarities to the first movie. Sadly however Saw 2 whilst entertaining and exciting is weaker than the original in many ways. It lacks the suspense of its predecessor, has a weaker plot and script, more mediocre acting (especially from those stuck in the house) and is less realistic since there appear to be a number of plot holes and moments where you ask yourself, come on you jokers would that really happen? The crazed muscle bound hot head is totally irrational. Faced with the task of getting the numbers from the back of his fellow inmates heads he chooses to go on a killing spree (haven't you learnt anything from Prison Break?). Okay, um would it not be easier to just ask them for the numbers? And then shock horror when he is finally faced with the conundrum of getting the number from the back of his own head he slices off the his skin! Come on mate, ask someone for gods sake! There is also the premise that Jigsaw has left clues in the house with a puzzle that his victims must solve in order to survive. In reality however people just move from room to room and die in graphic bloody variations which becomes less and less shocking to the point where you think, haha there's blood all over your arms, you deserve it. This is coupled with the fact that we see limited character or back story development for anyone other than Wahlberg supports our apathetic attitude to their graphic slaughter. This sequel also continues to dwell on Jigsaw's motivation for murder, he wishes to make his victims value their existence by some form of torture, otherwise they do not deserve to live (why don't you just show them an episode of Oprah). In the first movie you could see the method in his madness. With a drug addict, fair enough, you come close to death you value life etc. However now his message turns to ramblings and you doubt whether there is any basis for his methodology (I held hope that he was a nice guy all along). This is solidified by his selection of Wahlberg who isn't happy with his life. He seems fine to me, a burnt out cop with issues with his son. Oh right, that's tough, why don't you try working in the city jigsaw, see what your perspective is then, you might be reaching for the safety blades yourself then my friend! There is also said to be secret linkage between all the victims. Ooooh what is the enigma? This is quickly found out and bears little relevance to their attempt at survival so big deal Mr Director. Overall Saw 2 is entertaining and will keep you interested throughout but its predecessor set high expectations which this film does not live up to. Having said that it is not just another mediocre horror flick so and will keep fans of the genre happy (just don't expect anything special). Like the original there are also some twists in the movie but they are certainly less surprising and interesting than those in Saw which was the predecessors primary strength and the basis for its originality."
"JimmyZappa","8","1","3","12 July 2006"," Wow, now this is how you make a thriller!
","Jigsaw is back and it seems that he's improved his technique for this sequel.<br/><br/>Saw II is one of those rare Hollywood sequels that capitalize on the success on a small time film festival winner and somehow actually make it even better than the original. The story is primarily about a father and a son, Eric and Daniel Matthews, with the father being the cop who's thrown into Jigsaw's twisted version of Mousetrap.<br/><br/>For those who've seen the original, things get touched on a bit here in the sequel and it expands the story even more from it. Its pretty much beneficial to see the original (which is a good movie) as you can gain more insight on the soon-to-be trilogy, otherwise you'll be kind of left in the dark on some of the key events.<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the story or the nice little twists here, just see the movie for yourself or read other spoiler reviews. I'll just say its entertaining enough to keep your attention the entire way, but I was a little disappointed on how the story strayed away near the end from what's suppost to be its main purpose. But just a little, you'll see what I mean. As for the characters themselves, i'd say its overall solid. The acting was good and almost all of them served their purpose well.<br/><br/>The meat and potatoes, the actual traps, are more intense this time around. While you can tell why there were limitations in the original (it was a small time flick), the bigger budget implemented on Saw II meant they needed to be better this time. Thankfully, they actually went ahead and did that. The new traps actually look more agonizing this time, including the ""shock"" flashbacks too. Everything I wanted to see was all pretty much here, they delivered the goods.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought it was a great movie. Well worth my time and also the first recent movie in awhile to actually shock and keep me at the edge. I hope Saw III carries on the tradition, especially the way things are chugging."
"EdwinTetlow141","6","1","3","10 July 2006"," A reasonable sequel, yet lacked certain essential elements
","I recently watched Saw II and was gracefully horrified at some of the tortures, and traps in the movie. However what i felt really dragged the movie downhill was the amount of characters in the movie. From memory, there were about 8-9 characters initially in the house. This somewhat detracted from the over all horror of the movie. What this movie should have learnt from the original 'Saw' was that concentrating more heavily on maybe 2-3 characters was far more effective. <br/><br/>Also i didn't feel as though Saw II was really executed the twist as perfectly as the original. In the original, it built and lead viewers into a possible twist, then in about the last minute or so, it went 'snap' and shocked all viewers with an amazing twist. In Saw II, it wasn't more spread out, and didn't create that shock, which was an essential feature of the first 'Saw'. <br/><br/>Having said this i was satisfied with the overall effect and award it 6 stars. All I can say now is bring on Saw III and make it a good one. Also I give my best regards to James Wan, who is also the cousin of a mate of mine. <br/><br/>Any questions or comments on my review, email me at EdwinTetlow141@hotmai.com"
"Bunuel1976","5","1","3","16 March 2006"," SAW II (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2005) **
","SAW (2003) was a modest, effective and innovate undertaking which seemed to please a lot of people at the time. On the contrary, the obligatory sequel is excessive in practically every way: an excess of victims (we have 8 against the first's 2), an excess of bad acting and unintentional humor (the drug-dealer character is especially guilty of both here), an excess of clichés and an excess of stupid dialogue.<br/><br/>The only reason to keep watching is the expected (and gratuitous) display of sadism and the shameless borrowing from older (and better) films: we have a police detective who frames suspects to bring them to justice (a' la Hank Quinlan in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL [1958]), a psychopath who lures a S.W.A.T. team into a deadly trap (SPEED [1994]), a psychopath who punishes other ""sinners"" for throwing their lives away (SEVEN [1995]) and, most perversely, a terminally-ill patient deciding to take stock of his remaining days, spend them on a useful purpose thus justifying his existence and, ultimately, ensure that he is remembered after he's gone (Akira Kurosawa's IKIRU [1952])!! <br/><br/>This time around, however, even the ""twist"" ending (which packed such a wallop in SAW) doesn't work because the incongruity of a character's abduction (given that she had already been a victim of the same psychopath in the first film) gives her easily away to perceptive viewers."
"strange_black_kitty","8","1","3","6 December 2005"," it was good
","I personally found this movie to be rather good, after a lot of people said that it wasn't. There are, however a few things that i found very predictable, such as, it was incredibly predictable to know that Obi was going to burn to death in the incinerator, and that the connection between all of the victims is that they were all convicted by Detective Matthews, and Daniel (his son) was there for fun. I found it pretty predictable to find out that the cameras were all playing a tape to the Police. I could see that one coming a mile away. Apart from all the times of predictability, i thought it was a great movie, and i think things can only get better, so congratulations to the writers. I hope there is a Saw III"

","This was definitely an awesome film! I, personally, am very judgmental and harsh towards films, but this one is right up there with the best. This movie delves into the deepest fears of human nature. Put yourself in their situation. What would you do? As in the first, you get that unexpected twist at the end, completely unprepared for. You would have never seen it coming, although, once you know what the twist is, you realize there were subtle hints in the film that give it away. However, it is more intense with a wider variety of people in their separate jigsaw situations and a slightly more satisfying ending than the first, making it all the better. Sure, it is quite a bit gorier, but the psychological aspect balances it out. So, yes, there will be blood..."

","Brilliant.<br/><br/>Absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>The film is steeped in the existential; beckoning the viewer to re-assess the commitment with which he/she engages in life and further introspectively seek and define the motivations and urges that characterize the human mechanism that is choice.<br/><br/>I would dare call the film ""beautiful,"" albeit disturbing, for the alluring and gut-wrenching philosophical dilemma with which it forces the viewer to contend. Upon the commencement of the closing credits, speculation, which only vaguely haunted me during my engagement with the film (for there is not much room to both deliberate and appreciate the film concurrently) gripped me immediately: would I do that? How could I? The ""what-if's"" are nearly infinite in number--an intense 2 hour conversation later, I concluded: the film is superb.<br/><br/>Incredibly well-written. Intricately executed. Mind-numbingly perturbing.<br/><br/>I do not recommend watching this alone, however, simply because Saw II's most worthwhile aspect is the probing thought and discussion it forces after its viewing."

When I first heard that Saw 2 was coming out, and viewed the previews, I KNEW I had to see it. If anything it was just to see Shawnee Smith in another movie.

The story will blow you away - in a bloody and gory sort of way. The last 10 minutes - like the original one, tends to be the most exciting and mouth gaping part of the movie. I truly recommend this movie for those moviegoers who want to see truly original thrillers and suspenses. Its villain Jigsaw, brings a breath of gory fresh air to the thriller movie history.

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","3","3 November 2005"," ""Once you're in hell, only the devil can help you out.""
","I came into Saw II with pretty low expectations, since the first film was so good, but only on the first viewing, and movies these days tend to go precipitously downhill with every sequel, especially horror films. The opening sequence in Saw II is some of the most brutal stuff I have seen in a horror film in years, and it just gets more and more painful from there. Other than the first film, I don't think I have seen a true horror film, in the classic sense of the word, since Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses, which as far as completely ignoring all modern, accepted forms of aesthetics, even has something on the Saw films. <br/><br/>I was immediately impressed by the opening sequence, but then even more a few minutes later when the police busted into Jigsaw's crazy house and found him sitting there calmly, offering them to sit down and chat with him. It reminded me of the scene in Seven when Kevin Spacey's John Doe walks into the police station covered in blood while Mills and Somerset were in the heat of their search for him. When something like that happens, you have no idea what to expect, and finding yourself with no idea what to expect is something of a treat when it comes to watching a horror film.<br/><br/>Here you have this decrepit old man, dying of cancer and unable to stand under his own power (again, I had no idea what to expect when he apologized for not being able to come to them to talk, since he couldn't get up  I was sure he was sitting on a timer or a detonator or something), constantly having to breathe through a respirator, and he is surrounded by able- bodied police officers and investigators who are completely powerless to do anything to force him to tell them where the house is where the people are dying on television screens before there eyes. This is how you set up a horror film that people cannot take their eyes away from, no matter how cringe-inducing it is.<br/><br/>Despite a massive overuse of wild clichés like ""Shut the eff up"" and ""I'll rip your effing head off"" and other such nonsense, as well as something of a cheesy twist at the end of the movie, Saw II not only compares but quickly and decisively passes up its predecessor. I remember watching the extra features on the DVD of the original film, and I was really surprised to see that it was just a couple of guys, about my age even, who had sat down and written the movie, which had become so successful. With the release of the first of what I imagine will be at least two sequels, it has become clear that there is some serious new talent making horror movies in America, which is a good sign that I haven't seen in years.<br/><br/>By the way, just before I started writing this review I realized that in my review of the first Saw I mentioned that it reminded me of some of Wes Craven's earlier films, like The Hills Have Eyes and Last House on the Left, which is strange because in Saw II, when Jigsaw gives directions to the house where the mayhem is taking place, he gives the last piece of directions as ""It's the last house on the left."" I have come to think that one of the marks of a good horror film is when it can be effective on its own and still pay homage to the classics without stealing their conventions, even though thematically the films are remarkably similar."

","See this movie! This is one of the best sequels ever made... Fine: now that I have your attention, let me tell you about my experiences with this movie. It starts of with an incredible opening scene that definitely sets the tone for the entire movie. Thank God the sequel to the finest horror/thriller creates the same atmosphere and fear of the first movie. There are enough twists in the movie that'll keep you thinking for hours and hours after the movie credits rolled down the screen. Without spoiling the plot for you I guarantee you that the twist at the end of the movie will turn your world upside down. Take this together with the sick atmosphere, the paranoia, and the creepy instructions of Jigsaw and you got yourself a movie that will not only be recognized as one of the best sequels ever, but also the second part of a new horror-franchise that will shock you, and other people for years to come..."

","I thought the first film was just a big sick joke, an over the top gory horror-comedy, but it has nothing on this sequel. It's a better film than the first, but it's also probably the funniest film I've seen all year.<br/><br/>This is the kind of horror movie you have to go into with a sick sense of humor to really, truly enjoy. I have a sick sense of humor, and my friend joining me has a twisted sense of humor. I don't get why people would be so offended that people would find this kind of movie to be funny. It's so entirely over-the-top, from the acting to the over-stylized directing, to the saw-it-from-a-mile-away twist ending. You can't help but enjoy ""Saw II"" as a bloody, campy good time. And I don't write this because I think it's a bad movie.

It's better than the first one; I didn't think it was possible but wow it happened. I have to congratulate the writers on this movie, AMAZING it's nothing like I have ever seen before. Intense is the only word I can really come up with at the moment that describes some of the action in this movie. It kept me at the edge of my seat. I even had to put down my Peanut M&M's; my friends know how hard it is to take chocolate away from me.

","This part 2 of Saw shows how hard it is to top or to even come close to a first movie which had a great climax in the end. In my opinion saw 1 gave the same stunned feeling the climax of the usual suspects gave.<br/><br/>In part 2 most of the stuff that made part 1 very good is there. We have the deaths with the first being the very nasty best, we have jigsaw who is a little sicker then last time around.. his physical health that is not his mental health and the all over feeling is all the same as in 1.<br/><br/>And perhaps that is the problem because you keep expecting the same climax as 1 gave you and that is not going to happen. The payoff in the end is not a surprise and the events leading to it in the house feel like they tried to copy the feeling of the cube movies.<br/><br/>So all in all it is still better as most of the crap other.

","Sad, sad, sad. With such a great inital movie how could they go so wrong? I believe fans of the horror genre will most likely enjoy this film, but that said they more than likely enjoyed ""Cabin Fever"" and any of the ""Scream"" movies.<br/><br/>Fans that were surprised to find themselves's enjoying ""Saw"" with be greatly disappointed. The movie come's across as a pathetic attempt to continue and ""milk the cow."" As if some studio exec went to Leigh Whannell and said... ""We need another!"" and he replied ""I don't't have another."" Then they told him the payout... and shortly thereafter a senseless script was submitted and approved.<br/><br/>Why am I bucking the ""lovefest"" for this movie? Well, the first movie succeeded in creating a thriller that made you think, that made you evaluate yourself, and foremost it made sense. Sense in the fact that character's used logic and rationale for their actions. I call it the ""Why the h*ll are you doing that syndrome?"" Most thrillers are based on the premise that every character is a complete moron and are barely smart enough to know when to breathe. ""Saw"" was not most thrillers... thats what made it good. ""Saw 2"" is! Throughout the movie logic and sense will be disregarded in order to continue the feeble plot. Simply put, if you come into the theater seeing this as a continuation of the greatness of the first, you will be angry, like I. If you never say ""saw"" and enjoy the afore mentioned movies you be ""blown away."" On a side note, acting in ""Saw 2"" as it was in ""Saw"" was horrendous. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover = BAD... but Donnie Walberg = VERY BAD. You can't help but sing a New Kids On the Block tune when you see his pathetic screen presence. Save your money and rent ""Saw"" again or go see ""The Weatherman""... it was MUCH better!"
"haley1-1","8","1","3","2 November 2005"," Awesome movie until the last few minutes
","First, I have to admit something...I didn't have high expectations for Saw 2 when I first found out that they were doing a sequel to Saw. Most of the time, sequels do not fair well compared to the original and Saw was very original. I decided at the last minute to see Saw 2 (the advertising for it helped in that decision). When the movie started, it was pretty much non-stop action, blood and gore and there's nothing wrong w/ that, is there! Well, I would be lying if I said that I wasn't blown away by the fact that the kid was in the safe the whole time and by the fact that all of the events in the house had already taken place and had been taped. This was pure genius. BUT...I did have a feeling that it would be revealed that Amanda had something to do w/ all of it. I feel that the ending could have been a little better. I think that when the detective woke up, it should have been JOHN'S voice on the tape saying something like ""Hello Detective...you didn't follow the rules...GAME OVER!!!"" and then the audience sees Amanda shutting the door. Only then would we know that she was in on the whole thing. Overall, I give it an eight out of ten...pretty good movie, but needs a better ending. I don't feel that people will want to see Amanda as the next Jigsaw Killer. Just my opinion."

Saw II is truly a piece of gruesome art. Although the violence meter has reached an all time high, it all just seems to fit into one big puzzle. The Jigsaw killer is back again, and is looking for more victims to throw into his game. So watch out. This would definitely be at the top of the top 10 lists of movies to see in the Halloween season. Since I cannot reveal too much, all i'm going to say is that you'll be seeing some old friends again, as well as all new characters. I'd describe the movie as ""shocking,"" but with a little flavor.

","Simply put, this movie was absolutely amazing. As a film student, I admired the interesting shots and time-laps frames. The great direction and imagery is unmatched by any other. This movie just seemed to bring more the the table then its prequel. The acting was sharper and the film seemed to flow better. The writers also thought up some extremely creative ways to kill off the small cast (some of the best death scenes ever invented). If the opening scene of the movie doesn't do it for you, just wait until the characters explore the house. Of course, gore fans will love it, but if you're into suspense and odd plot twists, this is a must see."

I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, I was just hoping that the second one wouldn't be worse then the first and ruin both for me but i had nothing to worry about because they matched if not did better with the second one.

Lovely to watch on a Halloween evening. However, if you like being shocked, and/or go to a ""horror"" or ""slasher"" flick to be frightened, this movie is not the greatest (for that), as I found it to be rather predictable. I saw all but one thing coming, course, I would say I'm pretty decent at guessing movies. I can't say if it is or isn't an improvement over Saw. I would say I lean towards the first film, as this, sadly, kinda turned into the teen slasher type flick, complete with stereotypical characters -- something that tends to bug me, but this movie had more blood and guts to it. I think Saw had a much stronger concentration on the psychological factors than this one did.

","Saw II was in some ways a major disappointment, and in others truly remarkable. First off I must say, this may be the single goriest movie I have seen in quite a while. The amount of bloodshed is just disturbing. So please, those with weak stomaches please steer clear of this one. What Saw II does manage to pull off better than any movie I have ever seen is that disturbing, yet satisfying feeling that just makes this movie a thrill to watch.<br/><br/>To me the major disappointment of the sequel was the plot. This sequel is no where near as plot driven as the original and that takes away almost all curiosity to what may be happening to the people in this twisted game or why they are there. The plot twists are not nearly as dramatic as the original, nor as interesting. The ending also leaves much more to be desired and that was a let down due to the fantastic ending of the original.<br/><br/>Saw II has moments of absolute brilliance that I felt the original had almost completely throughout, but the plot twists and ending are less than expected and may leave you wanting more at the conclusion of the movie. The movie will definitely give you PLENTY of moments to talk about for weeks, and is all in all a good movie. I just had such high expectations for this movie that I was let down just a bit. Still the disturbing amount of gore is reason enough to watch this movie just for the chill factor.<br/><br/>7/10"

It was vivid and a great performance. I really liked the back story they gave on him and understanding what goes on in the mind of a mad man. There was familiar faces in this movie and ones you just meet. The only thing about the movie that I did not like was that in the first one he let you see a lot of different people making choices and getting killed for those choices. In the second one there was not many that you see. This movie comes very close to the first one but does not quite surpass it. The action was very good and the pace of the movie was excellent. There was never a dull moment in the movie and it was always keeping you in tuned. I would go see this movie again but I really do not think that it would have the same impact as the first time seeing it.

I have never seen a movie do gut wrenching scenes like this one. The opening scene of 2 you see a man get his face done up in a nice new mask. In 1 you see a man cut his foot of to live. This is why I go see a horror film. I want to feel like I could vomit. My point is if you don't like horror don't go see it and stop talking about it and let the people who like movie's comment on here. That is why we read this.

"JamesCanz","8","1","3","29 October 2005"," The Definition of Sequel: Saw 2
","Horror movies have been very weak for the longest time. With 2004's release of Saw, a new light was shed on the horror genre. Saw was everything a horror fan could have asked for, putting up enough competition to be categorized for being as good or even better than 1995's Se7en. The first time I heard that there was going to be a Saw 2 and even with a new director, I thought that Saw would be forever ruined. After James Wan did a fabulous job on Saw, how could newcomer Darren Lynn Bousman even compete with him? So many questions were going on, but on October 28, 2005, all of my questions were answered.<br/><br/>Like many other horror sequels, Saw 2 starts off with a big bang to get your blood flowing, but unlike other sequels, Saw 2 gives you the same adrenaline rush throughout the entire movie. Not only is your blood flowing, but so is the blood of the characters of the movie. As promised, there was blood, and plenty of it to satisfy any horror fan, but that's not what all horror movies are about right? There's got to be more than just blood and guts, and there definitely is.<br/><br/>Saw 2 focuses mostly on Jigsaw. What happened to him in the past, how he got to be like he is, and what his motives are. Unlike in Saw, Jigsaw (played by Tobin Bell) is now one of the main characters, which is rare in most horror movies because you usually don't get to see the killer until the end where he or she is finally revealed, but we know who the killer is, or do we? Saw had one of the greatest endings I have even seen in a movie, I still get goosebumps when I hear the music in the background and see Jigsaw stand up. My main concern was that they would fail in creating an ending that could compete or even be better than Saw's ending. I was wrong. In many past horror movies, the famous twist has dealt with a split personality. Saw 2 didn't take the easy way out, the ending was creative, and most likely you won't know what happens until you see it, which makes it so powerful.<br/><br/>Saw 2 was next to flawless. Saw had very few flaws, and acting was one of them, but not this time, not in Saw 2. Every actor's role was very convincing and realistic. Not only did Tobin Bell play an excellent villain, but all eight characters trapped in side the house did a stellar job as well.<br/><br/>Saw 2 is everything I didn't expect it to be: awesome. Tons of blood, edge of your seat thrills, awesome characters, even a better plot, and just as good (or maybe even better) ending as Saw. See this movie any way you can, then you can see for yourself how awesome this movie is. My advice if you do see it, try and guess the ending because I bet you won't. This movie is like a jigsaw puzzle, it isn't complete until the last piece is put into place with all the others."

"coolguy824","8","1","3","29 October 2005"," A seemingly well-thought out sequel to one of the sleeper hits of 2004.
","I just got out of a screening of Saw II. Well, I didn't just get out of it, but you know what I mean. It's the 28th, meaning opening night. Considering the level of enjoyment I had when I first saw the original, I went into this movie with rather high expectations. I feel confident when I saw that they were met.<br/><br/>The basic plot revolves around Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), a cop who tediously walks the line between light and dark. He has done whatever it takes to bring down the criminals he's gone after, even resorting to planting evidence and physically assaulting them for information to get the job done. When one of the informants he deals with is found dead by way of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), he's convinced by Kerry (Dina Meyer, reprising her role from the original) to take on the case. They track Jigsaw down to an abandoned building where his latest 'test' is revealed: eight individuals are locked inside a house. The door is set to open in three hours, but due to a nerve toxin they're breathing in, they only have two hours to find one of the multiple syringes of antidote hidden throughout the house or they die. Among the test subjects are Detective Matthews' son Daniel (Erik Knudsen) and the familiar face of Amanda (Shawnee Smith, reprising her role from the original).<br/><br/>The acting, in my opinion, was of a higher caliber than that of the original. Tobin Bell's voice sounded so perfect every time it was heard, and had that creepy Master of Ceremonies quality in it. He played the part of John/Jigsaw with the same enthusiasm that he seemed to have in the original. His philosophical rants, while not for everyone, do expand upon what we were told in the original, and explains his motives for putting on his tests.<br/><br/>Donnie Wahlberg did a good job with what he was given. Though he wasn't quite able to portray him as a three dimensional character, he was able to show more than one side to him. He was more than just a cardboard cutout of a character, which is what this archetype of character tends to come off as. He's come a long way since his first role of note in ""The Sixth Sense"".<br/><br/>Shawnee Smith did a fine job as well, considering most of her dialogue was exposition. She brought just the right level of fright and understanding of the situation to make it believable for me. The character turn she takes at the end makes sense, and didn't throw the character development from both movies out the window.<br/><br/>And now, for the most important part of an analysis of this type of movie: the scare factor. Now I have been watching horror movies for as long as I can remember, and I am fully confident when I say that I have never been truly scared by one. While that still hasn't changed after watching Saw II, there were a few cringe-worthy moments. One at the very beginning (the first scene, in fact), and two at almost the very end (one of them being the second last scene). The various traps and devices used were creative. The death mask 'venus fly-trap' device in particular caught my eye.<br/><br/>The false (twist) ending has been a cornerstone of both the original and the sequel. Unless you're paying attention, you may not completely understand the reasoning and explanation behind it, so keep your eyes peeled. The sequel also does a nice job of tying together with the original, and the final scene is a bit of a callback.<br/><br/>All in all, a well executed movie.

","This movie beat all of my expectations. I was ready for a horror movie that actually pushed the limits, and went beyond the 'norm'. This was it.....not only was I clenching my teeth the whole time but I was also on an adrenaline high! I am a HUGE movie buff, and horror happens to be my favorite genre. I feel that horror movies have gone downhill since the classic originals such as Friday the 13, and Nightmare on Elm Street, I have been very disappointed with the quality of recent horror movies and until the first edition of Saw I wasn't sure there were any real scary movies left. Being under the impression that sequels never surpass their originals I was overly enthused that this one somewhat defeated the first. Smart writing, fabulous ending, overall.....great, great, great movie!"
"xiomar___","9","1","3","29 October 2005"," I underestimated Bousman.
","I figured that this movie would suck. Most sequels do. Even more sequels do when they don't have the same director. I was very wrong. This movie is better in nearly every aspect. It's gorier, it's more serious and it's a bit more disturbing. Not only do you see a new side of the situation, it ties up the loose ends that the first movie was unable to answer. The movie did have it's giveaways, though. From the beginning Amanda knew exactly what to do. Although she's played 'the game' before, she's playing a different one this time. Also as the movie progresses you can see that she never once shows signs of being affected by the nerve gas. Meaning she obviously was given an antidote before the game begins. It's not so much as scary as it's disturbing. It doesn't have pop out surprises. Nothing you might not expect. It's a thriller, not a horror movie. I did rather like the ending. Well not just the ending, the last half hour of the movie, more than anything. The idea of having John (Bell) explain every reason for why he has done what he did, like I said, ties up the loose ends of the first movie because although we know who he is and we can see his reason, we don't exactly know why his reasons are what they are until we watch this movie through. I speculate that since Amanda (Smith) is carrying on his work, that there will be another movie. Let's hope it doesn't disappoint. This one didn't.<br/><br/>Better than the first.<br/><br/>9/10."

","After watching Saw II, I was trying to think if I had seen a better sequel in the history of horror movies, and I couldn't come up with one. Not that horror movie sequels are very stiff competition, given the shortcomings of sequels from Halloween, A Nightmare of Elm Street and Friday the 13th. However, this is one of the few sequels in ANY genre that could actually survive as a stand-alone film on its own merits.<br/><br/>Saw II somehow manages to maintain the same edge-of-your-seat suspense and action of the original, while inserting totally new characters, new ""games"" and yes, new twists, particularly at the end. As usual, Jigsaw's tape recordings are always providing the viewer little clues about the terror ahead.<br/><br/>While the editing sometimes gives the movie an unnaturally high-energy atmosphere at times, and while the gore is probably very excessive and unnecessary, Saw II avoids the trap that most sequels fall into: a lame and boring plot lacking substance and new ideas. Saw II carries the same jolt of creativity of the first one, while leaving the viewer with plenty of optimism for what a third movie might look like. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"TheScottman","7","1","3","29 October 2005"," One of the better Horror Sequels
","I will start off by saying SAW 2 moves fast. The first scene in the house was poorly written, but the rest of the movie makes you forget that. FRANKY G. that plays Xaiver is great. When he turns in the middle of the movie it's great. For once there is a character that in the beginning could go either way (good or bad). I have to say even though I was supposed to hate him, I enjoyed his character as much as jigsaw's character. I however didn't like that they didn't give reasons why some of the people were there. I also like donnie, but that could be because I favor people from the boston area. So over all I say go see it. It's worth ten bucks, But if your still on the fence go see it during the day and pay 6-something."

This story could go on forever!<br/><br/>They made it so that even if you did not see the first movie, you can go and see the second one. They do make reference to the first on, but it's OK if you don't get it.<br/><br/>This movie is INSANE! Its 100 times better than the first. There are more twists, more games, and more blood.

I'm a huge horror fanatic, and I must say, this was just amazing. I don't want to give away anything, but those of you who want to see a great movie, and a great sequel, don't listen to anyone who says this is bad, because they probably thought the first was bad as well. don't listen to people like that, I'm telling you right now, this was truly phenomenal, a must-see and you better see it!"
"iamkilgoretrout","8","1","3","29 October 2005"," Oh yes, there was blood...
","First off, wow. It is not too often that I find myself sitting in a theater saying ""Oh my god"" to myself. If and when it does occur, it is always for one of two reasons; I am either extremely upset with the movie I am watching and am anxious to leave, or I am completely blown away. In the case of Saw II the latter is true. I was finding myself amazed at all the aspects of the film every couple of minutes. The camera-work, editing, acting, script... all were equally wonderful. <br/><br/>In some ways, Saw II picks up right where it's predecessor left off, and in some ways acts as a prequel to the original. The story not only tells us of the 7 people inside the house, all victims (if it fair to call them that) of serial killer (if it is fair to call him that) John aka ""Jigsaw"", but also explains the reasons for Jigsaw's sick, sadistic behavior. <br/><br/>As with the original, the only part of the movie I disliked was the car chase scenes. Both movies seemed to be showing driving scenes as a sort of homage to David Lynch's Lost Highway, but in neither movie is the tribute pulled off with much to praise. This aside, Saw II is actually almost better than last years Saw. The devices used are much more grisly, the acting (on everyone's part) is a little better and the story is far superior to it's predecessor. The last 30 minutes of the film reveal so many twists and revelations I found myself in a constant state of awe. Saw II is without a doubt, one of the best sequels I have ever seen and, in all honesty, one of the best horror movies I've seen in quite some time."
"leilapostgrad","10","1","3","29 October 2005"," Austin Movie Show review (the Godfather Part II of horror)
","I could never compare the first Saw movie to The Godfather, but when it comes to stellar sequels, I believe that Saw II is undoubtedly the Godfather Part II of the horror world. The first Saw movie had some great ideas that were poorly executed, but this sequel knocks the first one completely out of the ballpark. It is horrifically genius! The terminally ill serial killer named ""Jigsaw"" has struck again, and this time he's out to teach a group of criminals (as well as an abusive cob) not to take their lives (or loved ones) for granted. The multi-layered storyline is brilliant and original. We dive further into the psyche and history of ""Jigsaw,"" and we also slowly begin to realize how all the characters fit together into a terrifying puzzle. Not only is Saw II smarter and more imaginative than the first, it's also hideously more disgusting! I'm not going to tell you everything to expect, but if you're afraid of needles, you may want to cover your eyes when the girl is thrown into the pit of syringes!!! Saw II is one of the best movies I've seen this year, out of any movie genre. It is not to be missed."
"infmzboi","10","1","3","29 October 2005"," SAW 2 is exactly what was expected.
","""Saw"" was one of the most original horror movies I had ever seen since i can last remember. Nowadays it is all the same thing with these slasher flicks or mutant freak horror movies. It tends to get boring. A lot of people believe ""Saw"" used the same idea from the movie ""SEVEN"" which is another excellent movie. In my opinion ""Saw"" is what brought ""SEVEN"" to the next level. ""Saw 2"" could not have been a better sequel.. the movie's pace was faster, acting was better, more action, suspense, gore, and to top it all off the finale which makes you love the movie. If you have not seen the movie yet expect an amazing plot twist. I went to the last showtime at my local theater last night which was 12:45 it was sold out luckily i got tickets in advance. Now remind you i had a meeting at 7 am the next morning for work. Was it worth losing sleep? IT MOST DEFINITELY WAS!!! ""Saw 2"" was exactly what was expected and what it should have been anyone who tells you different is just not a fan of the genre. I know with the success of this one part the trilogy is just around the corner."

The movie spoke best to me as it continued the legacy of the prequel. The more you find out the more you don't know. I was wondering if the movie would live up to the brilliance of the first one. In my opinion this is as good if not better then the first one. Since the first gave a few pieces to this jigsaw, this adds a couple more pieces and a legacy has begun. I believe if they decide to make a third one, as long as they can keep the twists coming and unpredictable, they can just keep on going."

Whoever this Leigh Whannel is, he's an absolute genius! Perfect script, and perfect villain(s). I'm not giving anything away, but again, WOW!!!! The writer and producer of this movie and the first may be in line to join the ranks of Stephen King, Wes Craven, and others if he keeps this up. I hope to hear a lot more from him and soon, too. The way he's going, he could just continue writing scripts for future ""Saw"" movies, but I'd like to see what else he can come up with. This is truly an amazing hour and a half, and if you were even remotely interested in the first movie, this is a must see. You really can't go into the theater for ""Saw II"" without seeing the first, but both of them are wild, wild rides, and well worth the price of admission. See this movie today!!"
"psychotic_deity","7","1","3","28 October 2005"," Good, with some issues.
","Saw II works as a very effective sequel to the original movie. Although it is as clever as the first one as far as interesting plot turns go, the characters weren't nearly as well-structured. Certain characters carried out certain actions that just seemed either unreasonable or pointless. Some characters don't seem to have any point to why they're in the story.<br/><br/>That isn't to say its an unsatisfying movie. Although I knew there would be some sort of twist ending, i had never guessed what the outcome eventually was. Even then, it wasn't that shocking.<br/><br/>My point about the structure of the characters is that they completely screwed up on what they had gotten perfect in the first movie: two people who need to learn something about themselves and why they are in the room. This movie just had a bunch of annoying characters in a house frantically working independently among each other. I suppose you could argue that ""the rejection of listening to your peers will lead to your eventual doom"" is the moral of the story, but for God's sake, did Beverly Mitchell REALLY need to be in this movie!? My last issue is that there wasn't enough creativity put into the self inflicted dooms of ""victims"". I know that sounds a bit sick, but it was part of the attraction of the first movie for a lot of people. The beginning death was just a rehash of what the character Amanda (Shawnee Smith) had to go through (though the key behind his eye was a nice touch)."

The only thing I was disappointed in, was Jigsaw. Is he going to die? Amandas voice isn't as far as creepy on those tape players. I give huge props to the directors...they must be geniuses...I mean, who would of thought of all the surprising twists,turns,and surprises....GREAT JOB. If anyone can help me figure this out let me know... Jigsaw said the clue to the order of the numbers for the combination is ""over the rainbow"" all I could conclude from this was we all received five numbers: 8,9,11,16,2. ....I believe those were the numbers..not positive though....

They were just too incredible and sick to imagine. The entire game itself was very well thought out by the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Every character in the film has an interesting personality, role, or background that helps add plot and spice to the movie. Although the original 'Saw' was more mysterious and original than the sequel, 'Saw II' is still worth watching because it definitely gives you a new perspective outlook of the original. <br/><br/>I must warn you though, the ending leaves you questioning and confused. I know it did to me. But taking some time into it helped me understand more of the film and appreciate it. So I'm not saying to not see 'Saw II'. Go see it!

The director throws you straight back into the mix at the very first scene as a reminder of what the Saw films are all about. As with the first film my girlfriend and i racked our brains for the solution to ""jigsaws"" puzzle. They give you enough info in the film to make you think that you have almost cracked it and then at the end blow all your theories wide open.

However unlike the first one the major trap involves many (starts with 8) people in a house.

This movie is full of surprises and keeps you guessing until the end. There are subtle clues through out, but most are impossible to pick up on the first time you see it.

But this gets a 7.5 rounded to and 8.<br/><br/>Why? Because this one has more substance to the plot. Many scenes from Saw, hereafter called ""Saw-1,"" were dug up from odds and ends including original black and white tape used by the crew during filming and practice. Many plot holes were filled using newspaper clippings b/c I read they were over budget& time and needed more filler to tell the story. But, in Saw-2, they shot what I consider to be one of the best of the torture-porn genre. I'm not going to tun through the storyline here; I believe most people reading this (all three of you, including the admin who approves this!) already knows what this is about. We get to learn much more about poor Jiggy in this one --what makes him tick. I also believe the major plot twist at the end of Saw-2 is better than Saw-I. Clever and a great way to set up and open doors for the next movie in this franchise. However, the acting was below average, though, thus, this teacher gives that a C- /D+. But as a film of it's genre, I believe it earns a solid ""B."""
"badfeelinganger","10","1","4","7 March 2015"," In every way superior to its predecessor in terms of performances, story, characterization, gore, and climax.
","One of those rare sequels that surpass the foundation it was built on.The rare sequel that improves upon its predecessor, Saw II is an exploitation flick with style and skill to go along with its stream of red stuff.Less than a year after the original hit theaters came Saw II in 2005, a decent sequel that's saved by a spectacular denouement. In the week of its DVD release, this sold over 3,000,000 units making it Lionsgate's fastest selling DVD. The sequences revolving around Matthew's interrogation of Jigsaw are extremely fascinating - primarily thanks to a pair of fantastic performances from Wahlberg and Bell. Bell, in particular, deftly steals every single scene he's in, effectively transforming Jigsaw into one of the most deliciously sinister screen villains this side of Hannibal Lecter. And then there's the film's conclusion, which is simply astounding and comes awfully close to matching the original in terms of sheer shock value. In spite of the film's few flaws, Saw II remains a worthy sequel - if only for Bell's wonderfully entertaining performance and the jaw-dropping finale.Saw 2 gives talented, creepy-looking character actor Tobin Bell the chance to shine again as the cancer-ridden serial killer. Delivers on the promise made on its poster--oh yes, there will be blood. If you saw the first ""Saw,"" you'll want to see ""Saw II,"" too.Saw II is bound to give fans of the original a real buzz.This solid sequel employs the same cruel puzzle logic as the original 'Saw', toying with the audience in much the same way that serial killer Jigsaw (brilliantly played by the pale, soft-voiced Tobin Bell) does with his imprisoned victims.Saw II' achieves a level of horror and cruelty – both physical and psychological – that is inventively modern and atavistically medieval."

Not once does he actually kill anybody with his own hands - he gives them a task,a chance to live, and if they pass it they live. If they fail, they die. Everyone in the house has something they shouldn't have done in the past which affected others' lives. By setting them a challenge is payback and a way of making them suffer the way they made others suffer. Everybody in the house inadvertedly knows each other through their past actions. <br/><br/>Everybody has the part that grosses them out - the headtrap, the needle pit, obie trapped in the furnace...

It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and at the same time as providing gore and deathly situations, it also makes you question your own life and what you would do, if you were put in these 'twisted' circumstances. Saw 2 is a must see if you are a huge fan of Saw 1. I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen Saw, to watch this first before seeing Saw 2, as it provides a basis for you to understand the film more, and if you do not enjoy Saw, then do not go see Saw 2.

This movie has different director from the first movie. This director by no means does a bad job, because like I said, the movie is phenomenal. However, it is clear that the new director tries to imitate James Wan's style, but doesn't quite do it justice. It was a little distracting for me in like one or two parts when he tried to do the speeding up of action that James Wan did so well in the first movie.

I really did think the first one was a work of genius and that the writers were very, very clever in having me fooled for the whole time. Maybe the reason that I'm going to rate this film so highly is that fact that I so enjoyed the bloody, gory torture of Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon. Even though reviews have slated Saw II, I do truly believe that it's one of, if not the, best sequel ever! <br/><br/>Oh yes,there will be blood Jigsaw warns at the beginning of this film and oh yes, he doesn't lie! This time, Jigsaw is back, and yes - he's still wearing that ghastly serial killer cloak. But don't let that image soften you - he's still deadlier and messed up as ever. This time, instead of leaving two strangers in a bathroom together and telling them to kill each other, he's locked a lot of strangers in a house together and told them they're going to die anyway. <br/><br/>However, in true Jigsaw style he's given them a chance to redeem themselves, they can escape with their lives, but only if they deserve it. Donnie Wahlberg plays crooked cop Eric Matthews, who goes along to investigate the crime scene of an unfortunate victim of Jigsaws, quickly noticing that perhaps he's connected to the killer in more ways than he'd like to think... He's called out to raid Jigsaw lair, and this is when the film really begins - Matthew's realises that his son is one of Jigsaw's unlucky victims and as he and the S.W.A.T team watch the slow demises of the house's occupants he is powerless to help. This film concentrates more on Jigsaw rather than the victims who he's putting through their paces but still is only a wee bit less gruesome than it's predecessor. The film is great, right up until the end when the film become absolutely fantastic! Prepare yourself to the best twist, since Saw!<br/><br/>I strongly advise you to see Saw, before you see Saw II, just so you can understand the true and absolute horror of the ending.

","This is definitely one of the better horror movies that I have seen. It is kind of a combination of the movie ""Cube"", ""Se7en"", and the original ""Saw"". I say it has elements of Se7en because of the involvement of Jigsaw in this and how he asserts his idealistic reasons for the things that he does, as well as his setup at the end. There is enough character development to develop a concern for some of the character's well-being and the plot line makes you keep anticipating more.<br/><br/>This movie is also one of the most sadistic movies that I have seen. I do not cringe while watching movies often, I have been in some pretty bad situations and seen some pretty bad things in my time, but the syringe scene, the wrist-trap machine, and the neck-cutting scene did the trick.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the first movie or any of the other movies I mentioned in this."
"ShaanChaudhry","6","1","4","29 October 2005"," Finally...a horror sequel that gives the audience what they want.
","SAW blew my mind the first time I saw it in theaters. The movie had a strong plot, great characters, and really dark, creepy imagery. Not only was it from a new director, its budget let the world know that money means jack squat in making a great film. It also didn't hurt that SAW had one of the greatest endings I've ever seen in my life. That movie became a phenomenon for me the way The Ring did when I first saw it. When I found out about SAW 2 being in production, I was pumped up because from the start it was already in a good position because work began right after the first one. Not only does this keep the story fresh, a lot of the thrill that people got from the first one was still retained going into SAW 2. I was a little worried that the director was different but got some relief that Darren Lynn Bousman is a close friend of James Wan. I got total relief after I saw this movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the same in-your-face shock factor approach of the first one and immediately draws the audience's attention. Within the first 5 minutes I knew this was going to be a worthy sequel. Everything that made the first one great was reflected on this one times three. The puzzles were more complex, the characters trapped by Jigsaw were not only great but they were in larger numbers, and the imagery was as dark as you can only see in your worst nightmare. The puppet on the tricycle is one of the most insane and creepy characters ever. Most people have always had a fear of dolls when they were little and the fact that they used this puppet as a backbone of Jigsaw was genius. Though this movie contained a lot of gore, it was used to fit the plot perfectly. Nothing was overdone to make the movie undesirable or cheesy. Its amazing how directors can use excessive things in movies such as special effects in horror movies. It just makes me sick seeing a decent movie go sour after seeing very unconvincing and useless shadows flowing all around the room and through the ceiling or ungodly amounts of blood and guts. It just makes the movie look very fake. Movie makers should know by now just how much gore or special effects to use. Saw 2 used just enough of everything to remain relevant.<br/><br/>One of the biggest compliments I can give to Saw 2 is the fact that when you watch this movie unfold, it truly gives you that feeling like this really took place right after the first one. This makes the movie so much better and makes you appreciate the sequel and gives true meaning to the word as well. Many sequels have been made a long time after the first one and several ended up horrible. As for all those people that think you can't shock the audience with another twist like the ending from the first one, think again. I was proved wrong after I watched this movie to the end. After the extremely disappointing sequel to The Ring, I was very anti-sequel for a good while until I saw this. This movie is a must see for any fans of thrillers and will add tons of fuel to the fire for all the fans of Saw 1."
"TopperHarley25","4","1","4","29 October 2005"," Saw 2= (my opinion, more in-depth)
","it sucked.<br/><br/>here's my logic: (CONTAINS SPOILERS)... <br/><br/>1. In the first movie, i cared about the 2 guys and what happened to them. All the characters in saw 2 were poorly developed. Pretty gory when they died, but i didn't miss the characters after they were gone.<br/><br/>2. In the first movie, i was completely shocked at the twist ending. In saw 2 the twist was too unrealistic. Brutal premeditated psychotic murders are almost exclusively done by white males, look it up.. The idea that that girl wanted to take up the killers work, laughable at best..<br/><br/>and my final point...<br/><br/>3. In the first movie, there was a medical doctor as the main character. We watched him go from his calm collected state of rational educated logic to try and figure out an escape... Then as the movie progresses he slowly goes back to his instincts/ emotions, when he cuts his leg off.... and i went through the same kinds of feelings watching the movie. At first i was like OK horror movie, blood, violence. Then it gets sicker, and grosser, more gory and suddenly i was kinda taken in by the moment, and really kinda going through that same ""logical thinking"" to ""emotion thinking"" transformation as the medical doctor character.<br/><br/>in saw 2 there was no such theme transformation, it was a typical horror movie, nothing really special.."

","OK, I won't give anything away except only the ones who are completely devoted to Saw and trying to figure everything out will even come CLOSE to being able to guess how this one ends up. For me, this was just a notch above the original. What it lacks in character development, it makes up for with an amazing plot. You get a much better glimpse into Jigsaw in this one as well as get a fair amount answered that left you hanging at the end of Saw I. If you even liked Saw just a LITTLE bit, you will love this one even more. Very well written and emotion packed. Everyone at the theater was on the edge of their seats trying to contain themselves as the journey came closer and closer to its conclusion. Must See!! NOW!! STOP READING THIS AND GO SEE IT!!"

This is a film that is an experience with one of the best written story lines of all time, but to be honest i don't know if watching this film was the best idea as all other films now just seem below par. From the moment go this film never lets go of your attention and everything is well thought out. Suspense (tick) Action (tick) Excitement (tick) it just has it all. I really cant get it over enough how amazing this film really is. Do me a favour and go see it in the cinema now as i want there to be a 3rd one.

"kylemcdavid-27399","6","0","2","29 October 2017"," Not good as the first, but not that bad of a first sequel
","Saw II, the first of the several sequels in the Saw's franchise. Is it any good as the original, well that would unfortunately be false, but does lives up to it's hope, well let find out.<br/><br/>Basically after the events of the previous film, the actual Jigsaw Killer have been revealed to the Authorities as former Factory Worker and dying patient John Kramer, and they track him down to his factory/home, but right before they even Apprehend him, Kramer reveals he have already kidnaps 8 more people, all of which are trapped inside of an unknown building, that seems to be an abandon apartment, and Kramer refuses to reveals the Address. One of the newly victims, is just so happened to be the lead Detective's Juvenile Delinquent of a Son, which soon worries him, and making this be more of a bigger business to him. Meanwhile, the 8 victims who are all different from each other based on their Criminal Records, have no choice but to make it out alive together or else the Nerve Agent that Jigsaw puts inside the Building will kills them, and the goal for them is to find the Antidotes they need for their Survival, and while on the way, they comes upon deadly traps based on the Occupations of these Criminally-behaved Victims.<br/><br/>This film is in-fact a good flick, but is different compared to it's predecessor. The use of Characters I will considered Mediocre, some of them such as the lead detective is a-bit of a Jerk but that the meaning of the character much like the doctor from the first film (Now by-a-way, if I sound like I'm bringing-up an Spoiler, well I'm not going to as I'm not trying to either, what you just read wouldn't be anymore as I say something bad to this character, but I'll not mentioned how, that you have to see for yourself), but some of the other characters like some of the victims now I kinda understand they should act like this because they're Bad people and all, but they kinda took the roles too far into making them another group of unlikable characters, with the exception however with the Lead Detective's son, Amanda Young (Who returns in this film from the previous one), the African-American Gangster, and Xavier, the Hispanic Drug Dealer. The son of the Lead Detective was I would say an Emotional character, somewhat related to some, and Amanda was nice to see in this, especially as a main character now. The gangster was a-bit emotional to see too, I loved the scene between him and Xavier, just a very powerful speech, and speaking of which, Xavier was great to see as an secondary Antagonist, he was quite menacing to watch by the end of the film so. One last of the Victims, I want to bring-up so is an Pyromaniac named Obi. He didn't do that much in this movie so, only have one scene, and than boom, he finished, but he was a-bit of a cool character to see, quite quiet which builds him up here, and I wished he was shown a-bit more, like I wished they gives a-bit more of a Personality. The one last character I bring up in general, is no other than Jigsaw himself. It was neat to see him as a main character this time too, and Tobin Bell who did a fantastic job like always, just playing a sick, dying old man. The traps are well-done in this one, my favorite when one of the main victims in this movie, opens a door that he not supposed to open because there's a gun that shoots him through the eye, just brutal. There is one complaint I do have however beside some of the characters, which is pretty much the unrealistic use of Nerve Agent, now Nerve Agent was also what Jigsaw gives to one of his victims in the first movie too, which I didn't brought up in my review of that one because I didn't think it was unnecessary, but I'm bringing it up now because it's a big part of this film, just how come through-out the film, it feels these people are in their for 2-3 hours, they should've dies already because of the poisoning. But oh-well, this did sorta overshadowed by what we seen in this film.<br/><br/>So over-all Saw II is in my opinion is a fine sequel, just not the best in the series, but it is worth to watched."

"ajourneywithjake","6","0","1","21 October 2017"," Near as good as the first film
","Building off of the brief appearance in the past film, Jigsaw takes a very large role in this film. This time, the primary focus is a group of people trapped in a house that features a variety of traps for them to overcome. Meanwhile, audiences watch as Detective Matthews has a battle of wits with Jigsaw himself in an effort to get his son back. When on screen together, these two characters have some very good scenes together. I found Jigsaw to be a very interesting and engaging villain who, instead of just being a depraved serial killer, takes the approach of trying to help people in his own disturbing, convoluted way. It was also interesting to see the series' lore expand, integrating some of the characters in new and unexpected ways. I did still find the traps to be very cringe-worthy and some of the deaths to be downright traumatic and disturbing to watch. If it wasn't for the plot being as engaging as it was, I probably would have stopped watching. The sets in this film are also much like those of the first film. This time they have a broader scope since they take place in a house versus a single room. The producers again did an excellent job of creating the practical and special effects, making the gore seem very real on screen. On the whole they did a pretty good job creating this film and managed to avoid delivering a bad sequel like so many horror franchises succumb to. I put it as slightly just under the first film in terms of quality. While Jigsaw is an improvement, the emotional stress just doesn't have the same weight behind it as Cary Elwes's character did in the first film.<br/><br/>You can read this and other reviews on my blog at https://ajourneywithjake.wordpress.com"

Twist at the end, that's maybe even better than in prequel, revels to us a puzzle more complex than last year's.

"jtindahouse","10","0","2","16 July 2017"," The best in the series - and that's saying something
","There are some films that you never forget seeing for the first time, and 'Saw 2' is one of those for me. Having already been blown away by the brilliant original, to have a sequel that was not only equally as good, but likely better, was incredible. Everything that was so good about 'Saw', the intelligence of the story, the brutality and the themes and messages, were all not only apparent in the sequel, they were amplified. The 'twist' was astonishing and made perfect sense. It made everything that had happened up until that point nothing short of mesmerising. There is no question that this is one of my favourite films of all time.<br/><br/>At the time of watching the original 'Saw' it obviously seemed incredibly brutal in its nature. It wasn't until 'Saw 2' came out that we realised just how much leeway they still had to work with. Some of the traps in this film can make even the most hardened veterans of the genre squeamish (I know because I am one). The creativity involved never ceases to amaze me either. Some of the traps like the one where you reach through with your wrists only to be caught there are barely given even screen time, and yet other movies would kill to think up something so devilish and original.<br/><br/>The best part about the film though does have to be the story. It's so much fun. The premise works on so many levels. Also if you ever actually stop and think about the message 'Jigsaw' is trying to get across, to appreciate life and live every moment as if it was your last, it's a truly enlightened one. I think this message actually gets lost to a lot of viewers because there is simply so much else going on in these films. This is a film I will never forget for its ingenuity and genius. If you've never had the pleasure of the seeing it, please do yourself a huge favour and do so. A masterpiece."

","The second part of the ""Saw"" franchise, ""Saw II"" is surprisingly good because of the plot twists and masterful use of non-linear storytelling. ""Saw II"" gives us a bigger set of victims, 7 stuck in a building filled with deadly traps and puzzles, plus 1 more ""victim"": a cop (played by Donnie Wahlberg) who happens to be the father of one of the 7 victims. Caught in serial killer Jigsaw's (played by Tobin Bell) twisted plot, Wahlberg must do as Bell commands in order to have a chance at seeing his son alive again. But can Wahlberg, a notoriously brutal cop, follow Bell's rules and keep his cool long enough to ensure his son's safe return? <br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Saw II"" is the scene when Bell's timer for his ""game"" counts down to zero, revealing a shocking secret, and proving that all ""players"" must follow his rules.<br/><br/>I am very impressed with ""Saw II"" as it goes above and beyond the typical ""torture porn flick."" But it does suffer from several shenanigans such as: police procedures in raiding Bell's hideout; Bell allowed to stay in his hideout because of what cops see on video monitors, giving the bad guy the advantage of being in his home turf; and a lowly Detective with anger management issues is put in charge, further jeopardizing the entire case and potential victims with his numerous bad judgments and decisions.

","My expectations towards ""Saw II"" naturally weren't the highest. There have been too many plain stupid second parts of successful movies to be all too excited about them. I especially feared, that the splatter element of the series could become dominant and thereby force the more thought-through thriller elements in the background.<br/><br/>Luckily I can say that didn't happen and more so, I am even pleasantly surprised about how much I liked the second movie. Yes, it is not as fast and steadily thrilling as the first part, there are sequences that seem a bit long and make you ask yourself whether this couldn't be shortened. But especially the end, that at least I didn't see coming, makes up for these scenes and gives the whole story a new dimension and plausibility.<br/><br/>I know that ""Saw"" has developed into a quite controversial series. Many people seem to dislike it, even more so when it comes to the later parts. But for me, if you let go of some minor mistakes like quite lucky timing etc., ""Saw"" unites many of the aspects I'd like to see more frequently even in less brutal or spectacular thrillers. The series was a commercial success. But for me at least the first two parts are seriously underestimated when it comes to their quality."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","16 September 2016"," A Step Down In Quality But A Step Up In Extremity!
","A step down in quality but a step up in extremity, the follow-up chapter to James Wan's Saw may not be as impressive & gratifying on storytelling scale as its predecessor but it still succeeds as a worthy addition to the franchise that expands upon the premise of the original while exploring the backstory of the notorious serial killer, Jigsaw.<br/><br/>The second instalment in the infamous series, Saw II finds Jigsaw being apprehended by the police but he points them towards a set of computer monitors that show several people trapped inside a house, and one among them is the arresting officer's son. With time running out quickly, this officer has no choice but to play his game if he wishes to see his kid again.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, this second chapter adopts the narrative style & visual design of the original but shifts a gear or two when it comes to the violence, gore & sadistic games. The plot is interesting, albeit a little far-fetched at times, and makes use of few flashbacks that covers our serial killer's backstory and briefly explains why he became Jigsaw.<br/><br/>The booby traps are cleverly imagined although not all of them work out in the story's favour. Also making a surprise return is Jigsaw's only known survivor who's thrown into the game along with the rest. The performances aren't any good but Tobin Bell does leave a positive impression in his role while Charlie Clouser's score only gets more intense as the plot nears its conclusion.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Saw II lacks the freshness & compact structure of the original but attempts to make up for those shortcomings by levelling up its violence & other extremity elements. Although it's no instant classic like its predecessor, it nonetheless works as a fine entry in the series and will delight those who came here looking for some good old-fashioned torture & body mutilations. Worth a shot."

Xavier figures out there are numbers on the back of their heads that they need possibly for a combo. He doesn't tell anyone you he just carries a knife and threatens them to turn around. Yea that is sure to go well. That ends up in a fight with one of the other characters and Xavier kills him and get the number off his head and once Xavier corners Amanda and the kid she tells him he still doesn't know his own to which he cuts it off his neck. Who does that? I know hes wobbling around and crazy but he did stupid stuff earlier too.

","As with any Saw movie this is just a snuff/torture porn movie that been all dressed up and nicely packaged. 8 idiots wake up in an abandoned house with no way out and they will die in less than 2 hours unless they complete a series of gruesome and sadistic challenges.<br/><br/>It's also where the storyline in The Saw saga begins to become confusing with constant jumps in time and explanations of how this and that came to happen. It gave me the impression that the writers were just making it up as they went along and doing very poor and rushed patchwork in the story to make it all seem nice and neat.<br/><br/>I didn't care about any time-line of events, I just wanted to see how these people escape or die and that is that, but some people demand a story or they write a movie off as being senseless garbage, which was an obligation I guess the writers were trying to fulfill."

","Well, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) returns and gets thrown into a pit of syringes, Donnie Wahlberg joins the fray as a corrupt cop, and Lucy Camden (you watched that show, admit it) has become a convicted criminal in this plodding continuation of the Saw franchise.<br/><br/>For those who came in late, this movie series is based on a serial killer (and in spite of his protests, yep, he IS a killer) who uses his skills as a civil engineer to try and teach people life lessons by putting them in traps that will kill them if they can't escape in time. We find out in the first film that this serial killer John Kramer, dubbed 'Jigsaw' by the media, is a man dying of cancer. We also see a drug addict named Amanda who is able to solve one of his deadly puzzles. To recap my own misgivings with the film, which I liked, Jigsaw IS a murderer and his traps are inconsistent in intent. In what would become a tradition in Saw films, this one starts with a trap. Some guy has to cut his eye out to retrieve a key that will release him from a deadly mask. He can't do it and dies. Turns out the guy was a police informant working for Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) a New Kid on the Block (oh, you just try not to use that pun) in the Saw series, who receives a phone call to come down to a warehouse where they have found Kramer. in Kramer's lair they don't find his diorama from the original but do notice (I'll go on record right now as saying the cops in the Saw series are, generally speaking, the most inept and unobservant police officers ever put to film) some huge TV screens showing 8 people in a house. Amongst the group are Amanda, (at this stage we are told she is Jigsaw's only Survivor but by the last film I think they've forgotten all about this and plenty of people have survived his traps), and Detective Matthew's son Daniel. In the house is a nerve gas that will kill them all in two hours, with various antidotes hidden around the house. In the meantime Matthews is asked to play a game: talk to Jigsaw for the next two hours and his son will be safe.<br/><br/>The film goes back and forth between the house and the mind game between Kramer and Matthews as we learn that everyone in the house, apart from Daniel, is a con who was put away on doctored evidence by Matthews. We get to see these cons get burned alive, bled dry, thrown into syringe pits and run around like maniacs trying to kill each other. With his son in peril, Matthews eventually loses it and starts whaling on Kramer and forces him to take him to the house where all this is happening.<br/><br/>Spoilers!: upon reaching the house, Matthews learns that it is the house from the original Saw film, with Adam's dead body still in the basement. He also learns that the footage he was watching, and we were seeing, had all happened earlier and he had been watching a recording. His son was out of the house, locked in a safe that opened once the two hours expired. We also find out Amanda has been working with Jigsaw, and has essentially become his apprentice. At the end she chains up Matthews in the same room the original film started in and says ""Game Over"" as she slams the door shut, but doesn't lock it, a fact that would become important in the later films. I must admit this movie got me twice, I wasn't expecting the taped footage, or Amanda being a nutcase, though I probably should have as I'd seen Shawnee Smith in Becker.<br/><br/>The kills in this are more elaborate than the previous film, in typical sequel style they've upped the death count and number of lives in peril. As is often the case though this is done to the detriment of character development and story. We never really learn properly what some of these cons are supposed to have done, and with the exception of Daniel and perhaps Amanda, we are given no reason to care if they survive or not. I thought the twists worked better here than the original, in the sense they weren't as dumb. I was unimpressed with the veteran actors in the first film, I thought only Tobin Bell as Jigsaw really did himself much credit here. Donnie isn't a bad actor, and as we've seen in Blue Bloods, his deficiencies are easy to hide in an ensemble, but he's not given much to work with either. Shawnee Smith does alright as Amanda. All the rest I can take or leave.<br/><br/>Saw II seems to make more sense than many films in the series, particularly the later ones, but the pacing is slow and the characters not likable. They try and compensate for this by having some creative kills at regular intervals, but it still left me a little cold and a bit bored. Effective in what it set out to do, but the third installment really needed to pick it up. Could they find a good veteran actor, characters the audience could engage with, an effective mix between an elaborate game with grisly traps and true character development; and a genuinely unsettling twist for the third part? You won't believe how close they came..."
"skybrick736","8","0","2","13 January 2015"," Saw II
","Saw II is an outstanding follow-up to the first Saw that introduces the fantastic Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. Jigsaw's reasoning is a bit absurd but his methods and traps are always unique and cringe worthy. The story revolves around Detective Eric Mathews played by Donnie Wahlberg who did a terrific job. The mix between the two different sub-plot, the first being Mathews and Jigsaw, with the second being the house prisoners was intense and well-written. The characters inside Jigsaw's house played the script well even though it was noticeable that these weren't polished actors and actresses. The traps inside the house were the best part not knowing what the traps were capable of and seeing how the characters reacted to them. With the first Saw having a shocker of an ending, the second had to set the bar once again. There was multiple twists at the end, some the viewer could easily see coming and a couple that were surprising. Watch the Saw series in a row because it's a continuous story, you won't be disappointed with Saw II (8/10)."

","I thought this was about as good as I expected a sequel to be. It has a slightly different feeling compared to the first Saw. The first one was darker and grittier, whereas this was more devious in terms of plot. Overall both movies met a nice balance.<br/><br/>As the tag line suggests, there is more blood, some of the violence is kind of almost slapstick though. However, I don't think this was a big problem and the movie is still very enjoyable. There is a lot of stupidity from some characters in certain scenes though, which I won't spoil.<br/><br/>The movie starts out nicely, with a typical Jigsaw trap: ""The Venus Fly Trap"". However we soon learn the victim is just a warm-up to the much bigger game, involving Detective Eric Matthews, a brutal cop who must let go of his impatience and brutality if he is to save his son.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say the plot flows smoothly, with some nice dialogue which reveals some nice stuff about Jigsaw's back story. The climax is nice with a good twist which I wasn't expecting at all."

"neil-476","7","0","3","6 October 2012"," The law of diminishing returns
","After the original Saw movie proved so successful, the producers came to the conclusion that the reason for its success was not the original script and intense, claustrophobic suspense engendered by the awful predicament of the two protagonists. No, it was because of the Jigsaw killers ingenious and gory methods of despatching his chosen victims. And so number two in the series - and all the subsequent numbers - involved assorted victims enmeshed in a series of predicaments which required savage and bloody self-sacrifice in order to stand a chance of survival.<br/><br/>Tobin Bell, as Jigsaw, is the main link with the original film, but the movie establishes mild ongoing plot links backwards and forwards. But mostly it eschews the brilliance of its forbear for a formula which then holds for the remainder of the series.<br/><br/>One question - the planning and expense must be huge: is it really worth it? And fancy being so Machievellian that you are plotting such traps 6 films ahead! OK, two questions."

","Leigh Whannell was back in business to write part 2. But times did changed due the original Saw. James wan had left the building in came Darren Lynn Bousman who also did a bit of writing. He stayed until part 4. Torture Porn, as the genre was called was the next big thing so they had to focus more on the gore. And they did, Saw II started of immediately with a device killing a victim. Back again was Jigsaw, and here he took the most important part of the story, it stayed that way until the end of the franchise. <br/><br/>The focus of the story was here more on one of the coppers who's child is captured by Jigsaw. On the other hand, we had to go back to the devices made by Jigsaw. And here we had a bit of the feeling like in Cube. Cube was also very original but part 2 failed because you have seen it all before so here we got a bunch of scum being hold captured by Jigsaw. To survive they had to play the game. There is a bit that naturally had to do with the captured ones but it is a bit too focused on them. There's a part that in fact nothing has to do with the story. And the weird thing is that Shawnee Smith was back again as Amanda and was captured again by Jigsaw, it looked so stupid but wait until the last minutes. Again, the writers decided to keep the best for last. The best acting was done by Tobin Bell again followed by Donnie Wahlberg. Dina Meyer wasn't convincing for me as a copper, sadly I have met her and congenial wasn't her middle name. <br/><br/>But they brought in more devices and more blood and even more torturing done on-screen. The most creepy device was simply the syringes being used as device. Saw II was something completely different from part one but it was more a horror than a police story with an unpredictable ending.<br/><br/>End for the horror buffs, again two references towards old school horror, one is a picture hanging on the wall with a kind of pinhead design, the other is when jigsaw is showing the way he answers, the last house on the left...<br/><br/>Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5"

","Predictable movie and Mark Wahlberg's brother can't act his way out of a paper bag. The Original Saw was ... well it was highly ORIGINAL. All you heard was Jigsaw's Creepy voice and all you SAW was the deranged puppet (along with the deaths). In part one, they didn't show the actual man that much until the very end. In Saw 2, they REMOVE the MYSTERY of who Jigsaw is by showing the actual man way too much! In Saw I, Jigsaw is MORE THAN A MAN (something like what Ra's Al Ghul told Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins).<br/><br/>As soon as Amanda removes the bricks and finds the tape recorder, the viewer knows that she is in cahoots with Jigsaw a.k.a. John Kramer (yes they even gave him a last name completely removing the mystery & horror of the 1st Saw).<br/><br/>I was thrilled with Saw. I was even working at a movie theater when it came out back in 2004. I loved the audiences reaction! Saw was true horror! Now, Saw II is not completely abysmal & it does have some redeeming qualities. Sexy Shawnee Smith reprised her role as Amanda & she was spectacular as Jigsaw's apprentice!! Some of the deaths were decent with the very first one standing out. The ending is a 360 with Eric Matthews inadvertently returning to WHERE IT ALL BEGAN!!! The first Saw has an IMDb rating of 7.7, Saw II 6.7, Saw III 6.2, Saw IV 5.9, Saw V 5.7 ... DO YOU SEE THE PATTERN? The series went on a Downward Spiral until Saw VI 6.1, but alas Saw: The Final Chapter took the series back down again with a 5.5 IMDb rating. THE POINT HERE IS: Nothing beats the Original!

After I purchased it I looked at the DVD case and I looked very close and it said Saw ""2"". I thought that since I loved the first, I could try to watch it. But, actually, it was a lot better than Saw 1!! But it was HARD to find. I digged and digged down in the $5 bin. I finally said ""to the heck with it"", and looked for any ""Saw"" movie. Even though I only seen the first Saw, I kept wanting to get Saw 6, because it ""includes Saw 1. But, I highly recommend this one. So far, I have only seen (the great) Saw 1 and 2. I am headed towards Saw 3's way. I am only 11 years old and I can actually very easily handle this gory stuff. I am very, very excited to see Saw 3! The main thing that scared the crap out of me was the Jigsaw ""puppet"" and its creep bone- chilling laugh. If you are looking Friday or Saturday night FUN movie, rent Saw 1 & 2. It's so extraordinary!! A man who is not killing people but testing them to see ""how much blood they will shed to stay alive"". All I'm saying is see Saw.

But I was glad when he had died because he was a sore loser and a bum to all who were in the home with him. <br/><br/>I was glad that Amanda was back in the film because she has experience from her last encounter with her near death 'game' and the fact that Daniel looked up to her as a savior or as a leader to save everyone in the house. <br/><br/>My favorite traps in the film were the needle drop pit trap(it was for the big dude but he threw Amanda in to find it instead), the box cutter trap(had antidote inside it but girl got stuck in it and bleed to death), and the overall nerve gas trap(within the home).

The message of the Saw series movies are clear -- don't abuse yourself, don't abuse others, control your emotions, and be fair. Do not take drugs, do not smoke, do not cheat or lie, do not frame others, try to forgive, do not keep vengeance, control the obsessions, do not make profits on others death -- Follow the Rules, and you will win in the end. Do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome/ heinous. There are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are TESTED. But I think its a glimpse of hell, what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life, because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues. <br/><br/>Its not a game -- Make Your Choices! Cherish Your Life!<br/><br/>When the Legacy was handed over from John to Detective Hoffman, it all started going in the wrong direction. He tried to fulfill John's Will, but as he had lesser human side, and was going himself against the rules. He became a Victim to be Tested by himself.

What i really liked about the movie was how you can enjoy the story as well as the horror, which is in my opinion, awesome for people who love storytelling and then those who just love violence. I will recommend though that if you don't like blood, this movie does contain A lot of blood, so if you have that problem, don't watch this movie. The only reason i wont give it a perfect 10, is because it was a great film, but ultimately, i felt like the ending was weaker then the first one. the first one really threw me off, this was did too, but it just didn't have the same ambition, it slipped alittle.

","In this follow-up to the 2004 original, Saw II sets the formula that is to be used in subsequent films. One could say that Saw (the original) started the formula and they would be correct, however, the original Saw used the formula on a smaller scale. In Saw II many more people are involved in Jigsaw's plans. Even though Saw had a huge plot twist in its finale, Saw II offers a more complex plot-twist for the audience. We are also formally introduced to Jigsaw/John and his reasons for doing what he does. We find out that he is not as much of a raging lunatic as he is a down-to-earth guy who just wants to change the way people are living their lives in order to help them lead better lives.<br/><br/>It's tough to review any film series and keep each film's review interesting and thoughtful as the series progresses. Having said that, the writing, once again, is the single best element in this film. We are not graced with the presence of the best actors but in this case (as not in all cases) the writing transcends any of this film's acting flaws. It's absolutely amazing how the writers weave the plot of crime, mystery, thriller, and horror and bring it all together in a conclusion then slap the audience in the face and say 'no-way, we are not done yet.' Honestly, when I viewed the original film, one of the first things to cross my mind after it was over was, 'there is no way there can be a sequel, but if there is a sequel, there will definitely not be a saga and here we are on the brink of the release of the 7th and final installment in the franchise. The traps are fresh, the twists are fresh, and frankly the change of pace In the film is welcomed. This story has a faster pace than the original. This is something I did not expect because I could not perceive this franchise making film after film and somehow make them unique so that the audience is not left saying 'we have seen that before.' Now, back to the aforementioned film formula. The formula for these films become generically as follows: a larger group of people are the main focus of the film while there is a 'spectre' within the film's background basically carrying out Jigsaw's plan. There may be a few hostages or 'insurance policies' around somewhere but that is the basic formula. Oh, did I mention it is still as fresh as the apple pie I baked 5 minutes ago?

The actors and actresses did a fantastic job of making the audience feel for the characters and the situation they were in. The direction was just as good as the first and the script is also the same quality. The cinematography and the special effects were fantastically done and the traps were inventive. There are some scenes such as the traps, which are done brilliantly and the blood and gore and makeup is realistic but I'm afraid that it didn't keep the mystery like Saw did. Don't get me wrong, the ending was clever and wasn't predictable but in the first Saw movie, you were asking questions such as ""Who would do this and why?"" but in this one, you just hoped they would survive.

However, in saying this, Saw II is better than most horror sequels out there today.

","I give this movie a 9.5, not because it's a great movie, but because it manages to stay decent. It doesn't try to go ''Hey I'm better than the original'' like most sequels, but instead it stays true to the original recipe. The film differs a lot from the previous one: Instead of having two men chained to a wall, you have a group of people trying to stay alive by finding an antidote to the poison who will kill them in two hours. Personally, I found this to be a well-made attempt by Darren Lynn Bousman. He manages to give us another twisted story who can be understood through all the gruesome murders, and brings some new, and some familiar characters to the story. The visual effects aren't all great and the characters sometimes prove themselves to be dumb. The acting isn't all great either, except for Donnie Wahlberg, Tobin Bell and Lyric Bent whom we only see for about 10 minutes as a background SWAT officer. But on the positive side, the script is well-written and concludes itself in way as twisted as the original and the confrontation between Tobin Bell and Donnie Wahlberg reminded me of Foster/Hopkins in the Silence of the Lambs, though we can seriously notice a difference in the quality level. People should like this movie, it's the closest thing we get from Saw (besides Saw VI, which I will review sometime later). If you're not lighthearted, this movie is for you, and you really should check this series out. 9.5/10"

","I loved Saw. It was a fantastic crime/mystery/thriller/horror. I think that this movie definitely should have been made which I don't usually think with sequels. Saw II had a good storyline and helps you understand Jigsaw a bit more and why he does all of the traps and I was genuinely interested in the story. But I think this film would have been sooo much better without all the unnecessary gore. Maybe some of it was necessary but I think they could have (exscuse the pun) cut most of the gore out. I mean, the bit when Xavier cuts off that skin off the back of his neck to find out his number is not needed. He could have easily asked someone else to read it to him. Or maybe thats just his character. Which leads me on to the acting. Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) Great actor. The people locked in the house, terrible actors. They made it seem like another typical horror, which it isn't.<br/><br/>All in all, good film, good storyline, unnecessary gore. A fairly worthy sequel. 6/10"
"KineticSeoul","8","0","1","27 October 2009"," The sequel that made the ""Saw"" franchise popular
","This is a satisfying and worthy sequel from the first, as a matter of fact this one is more entertaining than the first ""Saw"" and even has a better twist in store. This time it has more characters that are trying to survive in some mansion where they can't escape and to top it off they have poison running through there bodies and the main part of the game is to get the antidotes by playing a game that has some bloodshed to go with it. The death were actually cool and there is more at stake compared to part 1, the puzzles are a lot more elaborate as well. I especially liked the conversation between Eric Mathews a cop and Jigsaw himself, cause you get to learn more about Jigsaws motives and what makes him tick, also some of the stuff Eric Mathews says to Jigsaw actually makes sense in a debating kind of way. The main disappointment of this film is that the characters make some really dumb decisions that don't make any sense. And they spend more time arguing and yelling at one another than actually trying to beat the game. Personally I am in between Jigsaw's motives, I think some people deserve to be part of his game and some don't, but I really don't think he should be the one to test the worth of human lives, just cause he got screwed himself plus he is an old fart so it's natural his time should be coming to an end. But some of his victims you can't help but feel they deserved it. Especially when most of them in this film is actually pretty stupid, I especially disliked the character Erik Knudsen played, his role was the son of Eric Matthews. Not only did he have a douche face, but there was just something about him that I really didn't like. He even tries to hit on a girl by trying to act like he cares for her while thinking he just might have a chance with her, some might disagree but it's actually quite obvious. He is also bratty and annoying and you want him to die in the most painful manner possible, even if they don't really portray him as the bad guy. I also didn't like the fact that you don't get to see every one of Jigsaw's puzzles that is set before each of the victims. Anyways this is not a scarier film compared to the first but it is more shocking and cringe-inducing, while being entertaining at the same time. I personally think it's better than part 1.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Saw 2 is a great horror film. It is not a great achievement or anything, but its has all the elements to make a great horror film, or a thriller. The Saw franchise, while being a lot of things, is clearly not brainless, despite some haters. The first Saw did have a moral theme to it, one that surprised me, and one that rang throughout the sequel. How much are people willing to sacrifice to save themselves? How much do people have to appreciate their life, or in how much danger should they be in before they actually start appreciating it? The film provokes a lot of questions like these, and while it is flawed, it is very entertaining. It has a lot of blood, and a lot of scenes are disturbing, a job well done! The editing is what makes the Saw films stand apart from others. The editing in this film is very flashy, very quick, and there are a lot of transitions every scene. At the beginning it makes the first scene be 'less' scarier than it should have been, but besides that, I like the editing. It makes the twist be what it is. The acting is good. Tobin Bell and Donnie Wahlberg deliver the best of their scenes together. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Shawnee Smith are also good, as is Beverly Mitchell. The guys are the problem. Franky G delivers a very one-dimensional performance, as does the rest of them. Some might not like this film because it is concentrated a lot of being shocking and repulsive, and thus why some call Sae films 'troture porn'. But how could they be torture when they are actually good? I have only seen Saw and Saw 2, and while the original is better, the sequel is pretty close. I love the direction of the film, something that also pisses people off."
"thesar-2","7","0","1","26 September 2009"," The Return of the Haunted House
","Let the games continue. 'Saw II' had one great thing going for it: it brought back a true ""haunted house."" Since I don't believe in ghosts, let me explain – the worn-down house in 'Saw II' that the multiple victims need to navigate through is truly a ""haunted"" house, in my opinion. They seemed to want to up the ante from 2 victims in the first movie to 3-4 times that and have them all solve another puzzle by Jigsaw simultaneously creating a Hannibal/Clarice scene between the now practically on his deathbed, Jigsaw, and the father of one of the test subjects. That's probably a better term than ""victims,"" as anyone who's seen the 'Saw' series, knows there's always a reason the people are there, and if they're victims, they really only did it to themselves. This is their wake-up call. Do I agree to the extreme measures Jigsaw puts these people through? Not at all. But, I didn't create the (now) long-running series. Previously mentioned, I said they up'd the ante, and they did with gore but more importantly, plot twists. Where part 1 almost started up too many twists/turns, this one is practically tripping over themselves to introduce multiple story lines (obviously setting up the inevitable III, IV+) but that's part of its downfall. While it's fun to try and solve the mystery/whodunit, it's almost exhausting to keep up with everything flashed in front of you in music-video-style. That said, I did enjoy the movie, loved some of the revolutions and it was nice to see more of Jigsaw interact, almost to the point of feeling sorry for him and wondering if he's the smartest person in the room. Perhaps he is, but putting ourselves in the opposite character's shoes, it would probably be hard for us to act differently."

"LuckyMatt93","7","0","1","18 July 2009"," Very good
","Saw II is a more than worthy sequel to the superb original and also a solid horror/thriller on it's own. The traps are creative (one in particular is absolutely horrific; it involves someone having to dive into a pit of needles), and the twists are both shocking and brilliant. There's also something that most Hollywood horror films are missing nowadays: character development. Jigsaw is explored deeply and Tobin Bell delivers a chilling performance. The character has become a famous horror icon, ranking up there with Freddy Krueger, Norman Bates, and Michael Myers.<br/><br/>The suspense is there and hardly ever let's up. Saw II doesn't have the BEST suspense (the best would be in Saw and Saw III), but it's still impressive seeing how most horror films today lack in that department. I was on the edge of the seat the entire 90 minutes.<br/><br/>The subplot that goes on is very interesting and ties perfectly into the rest of the story. There are a few flaws though, and that's what kind of bogs this film down from getting a higher rating. The characters in the subplot are for the most part stereotypical and underdeveloped. Plus they're given some pretty mediocre dialog throughout. If the number of characters was reduced and there was more time spent on developing them and improving on the dialog, I probably would of liked it a bit more.<br/><br/>Even with those few negative aspects though, it's still very good and easily one of the best sequels in the Saw series."
"happyendingrocks","8","0","1","24 June 2009"," Throwing up blood doesn't look like much fun... but it's certainly entertaining
","Since this sequel came out a mere year after the original Saw, it's easy to imagine that this film was a quickly developed and largely rushed attempt to cash in on the numbers and continue the franchise while the blood was still warm. However, considering that Saw II is almost as good as the original, it's a safer bet that this script was already underway, and the success of the original Saw only made the green light that much brighter.<br/><br/>While the original was a modest little thriller that took place mostly in a single room, Saw II is a film that sets up the launch of an entire franchise, and the numerous story arcs that are developed here are fodder enough to launch a full 10 Saw films. It seems that Jigsaw is going to be busy for a while, and the knowledge that Saw VI is close at hand confirms that the film-makers here knew they had a good concept and had the common sense enough to run with it.<br/><br/>The set-up is considerably more complex than that in the first Saw. Here, we're not dealing with two victims, but a whole slew of potential trap-finders. At first, it seems that these characters are just on tap to ensure an inflated body count, but as the story unfolds, we learn there is strength in numbers, as the widened palate of personality types lends itself to a fascinating study of human reactions to perilous situations. Of course, things play as a bit textbook, and we end up with at least a few of the most common horror film archetypes (the aggressive alpha-male, the panicker, etc.). But the film is interesting and intricate enough to make the ride itself worth any bit of familiarity discomfort.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if there was any societal commentary on the minds of the film-makers, but there certainly seems to be a callous study of human nature on display here. The results are more than a bit misanthropic, but sadly, the events that unfold because of this ordinary set of humans thrust into extraordinary conditions ring very true, and unlike the ancient horror phenomenon of a potential victim hiding in a closet instead of exiting to safety, every action taken by the characters here makes sense in its own twisted way. Humans are all animals at their core, no matter how civilized we deem ourselves, so watching the cast here squirm in Jigsaw's elegantly designed trap, and kill each other if necessary to escape it, lends a keenly voyeuristic eye to a set of circumstances that any of us might lack the elegance to face with any more dignity and humanity than we see here.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to over-analyze a film that is clearly meant to be a gory and fun bit of escapist fare, especially since it is definitely that, if nothing else. But realism is something that lends definite credence to any horror film, and the dark and foreboding sense of man's inhumanity to man on display here plays very well against the grainy, almost documentary-style feel Saw II unfolds in.<br/><br/>Of course, Jigsaw is the central force in this franchise, and Saw II is notable for first beginning to lend the character something resembling understanding. Of course, something is lost there, since the more we comprehend our villain, the more the villain loses its potency. No, there's nothing added here that somehow makes the happenings of Jigsaw's intricate death-traps more frightening, but having a better sense of the character certainly bodes well for future installments, especially if you know there are already 3 more films to catch up on, as I did when I first saw this.<br/><br/>Sequels, by their definition, imply a recycling of ideas, and this one definitely doesn't pack the same punch as the original. We've seen the Da Vincian death machines at work already, so the few glimpses of Jigsaw's handiwork we get here don't quite hit the gut the same way as before (although, dude must have a Masters degree in engineering, so it's certainly admirable when you ponder the logistics of his creations). But, by moving the sole focus from Jigsaw's game to the dice rolls of each of the players, we find ourselves simply enjoying the happenings and not pondering how many man-hours it took to rig an abandoned house with the abundance of homicidal hardware found in Saw II.<br/><br/>You know there's a twist ending in store here, and upon initial viewing, the implications are dicey at best. But, I'm reserving my judgment on this until I see the rest of the films in the franchise. Something very interesting could certainly be done with the curve ball the closer serves up here, and until I see where they go with this, I can't determine whether or not the stunning finale is manipulative or brilliant.<br/><br/>In any case, simply seeing how well this film unfolds, and how it doesn't lessen the sting of the stomach punch delivered by the original Saw, is enough to deem that ""franchise"" isn't always a bad word, and some ideas are strong enough to explore in multiple films. They didn't just squeeze more blood into this one and hope you didn't notice that they bilked your bucks and made you sit through an exercise in film studio scammery... although the body count and fluid ounces of stage blood here are certainly at least twice what we saw in the first film. (Mind you, I'm not complaining).<br/><br/>Two down, and three to go (until October 2009, when Saw VI is unleashed). But, I must say that when sequels deliver the goods as strongly as this one does, this job doesn't really suck that bad."

Well they didn't, not exactly but this is a must if you were a fan of the original.<br/><br/>John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer(Tobias Bell), is still on the loose, the police haven't found him and they have no clues leading to him, that is until Kerry(Dina Meyer) finds a criminal informant Michael(Noam Jenkins) dead at the scene of another trap set by the killer. She calls in Eric Matthews (Donnie Wallberg), a ""dirty"" cop that Jigsaw calls out at the scene of Michaels game, he soon figures out where to find him and they all are soon dragged into one of Jigsaw's games. They find out that Eric's son Daniel(Eric Knudsen) is trapped in a house with 6 other people who happen to have a connection to Eric, Jigsaw just wants to talk, but will Eric listen and save his sons life or will he fail the game and never see his son again?<br/><br/>This story is much the same as the first one is, they have a game all they have to do is figure it out and they will survive, simple you would think, but as always things aren't so cut and plain as they seem. The movie is a little more ""Hollywood"" than the original and has a lot more blood than the original which is where my two points off come from, because in the first one it was dirty and grimy and a little more real to me, plus i honestly don't like a lot of blood but then again the movie uses the blood in a point not a ""bloodbath"" sort of way. The cast is superb in their roles, and the characters display a lot more emotional range than the main ones in the first one(sorry by Leigh Whannell should stick to writing not acting).<br/><br/>Again this is another 'thinking man's' film, not just a blood bath intended to gorge the appetite for the gore lovers, though yes it does get bloody at times yes this means that this movie like the one before it is not for the weak stomach crowd.<br/><br/>All and all the 'Saw' series is shaping up to be one that will be in our memories for a long time.<br/><br/>so Shall we play another game?"
"jzappa","7","0","1","10 November 2008"," Making a Sequel to Saw Without Being Redundant Would Do What Saw II Has No Choice But to Do, Which is to Air Out the Mystique That Made the Original What It Is.
","This is the sequel to the horror film that mortified me more than any other horror film to this day. That horror film's sequel is the shocker that has come closer to making me ill more than any other horror film. It is either chance or a universal understanding of certain disgusting things of which I am hyperaware. As Twisted Pictures's $4 million survival horror sequel opens, someone finds out that a very important key has been implanted behind his right eye. He finds a scalpel nearby. The biggest doozy is when a group of victims comes upon a pit filled with thousands of used and bloody hypodermic syringes, with a key to an antidote hidden within. I have never come so close to passing out during a movie. And I have seen one whole hell of a lot.<br/><br/>Saw II is a lot of impact in its brutality, but does not compare to its predecessor in terms of sheer fright. James Wan and Leigh Whannell's original Saw is claustrophobic, fear of the dark, fear of clowns, a horrific villain we only scarcely know thus one we only scarcely understand thus one that scares us. Making a sequel to this film without being redundant would do what this film has no choice but to do, which is to air out the mystique that made the original what it is.<br/><br/>It is a very enjoyable film because the film features the Jigsaw Killer finally being apprehended, but trapping the thoroughly unscrupulous arresting officer, played by Donnie Wahlberg, in one of his own games while showing another one of his twisted machinations involving eight people in progress at the same time. It also explores Jigsaw's philosophical back story, which seems to feel more coherent in concept rather than in execution.<br/><br/>Co-writer and director Darren Lynn Bousman, the Splat Pack newcomer who, beginning here, was tied to the Saw franchise for three of its outings, gives the film a brooding graininess and relentless grit, and frankly he does not resort to unnatural editing to manufacture a peak of intensity like James Wan did with the original, though Wan made a better film. There is, nonetheless, a feeling of expediency given to Saw II that undercuts the intensity anyway.<br/><br/>Characters like Xavier, played by bouncer-turned-actor Franky G, a ruthless drug dealer among the eight victims, provoke shock and angst from us but that doesn't stop him from being ridiculous. Consider a character who, having abandoned the other seven, realizes that one number of the combination to the safe which holds an antidote they all urgently need, has been written on the back of each of their necks. He begins to endeavor upon stalking and killing them to see the numbers on the backs of each neck, rather than hastening their escape by notifying them all of what he knows, which would have them all working together as quickly as possible to achieve their common interest to survive this nightmarish situation. I can understand a character who is cold, selfish and ruthless, but I can't understand why such a person wouldn't keep his fellow captors alive if it would benefit him.<br/><br/>By and large, Saw II is pure gorefest entertainment. There is more ferocious cruelty at a higher frequency than its ancestor, and less of a chill by the end which you cannot rationalize."

The story is by no means original- people are stuck in a house, they have to find an antidote to escape before a deadly gas infects their system, a cop and a Swat team are looking for them, the cop gets worried and goes on the run to find the people and then he gets locked up and Jigsaw (apparently) survives. Character wise its practically similar to those in Saw. Gore wise, its 100 times worse than the original. But when analysing this gory sequel no aspects really outdo the originality of it's predecessor. And so Saw 2 really comes down to originality and being able to surpass the technical and cinematic excellence of Saw.

","The first saw put thrillers and horror films back onto the map and restored , atmosphere and tension to a genre which it seemed had become dull and bland. And although as the way things are going these days, it was a only a matter of time before a sequel was realised to the genre and one had to be aware as sequels can totally ruin a genre completely i.e. The Hills have Eyes part 2. On the other hand I was very pleasantly surprised with Saw 2 , as Jigsaw promised us from the start that there will be blood and yes he promised us. From the grizzly opening sequence we are reminded of who Jigsaw is and why he put saw on the map, however just like Hellraiser we taken into the world of the charther and we are given a background and like Pinhead , Jigsaw comes across as a philosophical character who was played pretty well by Tobin Bell. It seemed that someone actual took there time and studied well at what would make our skin crawl and trust me there were at least 2 parts in the movie that my flesh crawl and I don't squirm that easy . The film moved at a fast pace and the the fact that it has been thought through and it is not some dull formulaic teen slasher flick is what keeps you hooked. The only down thing about the movie is that the acting is not the greatest and there were supposed to be some gory moments which just end up being funny for me . On the whole I thought that Saw 2 was a flick that was aimed at a brainless teen genre but it ended up being one of the best thrillers/horrors I have seen since Se7en , a must see although if you watch closely enough you might just catch the twist however on the whole a great movie and a good way for Jigsaw to place him-self with the likes of other great horror movie icons like Pinhead and Hannibal Lector.<br/><br/>SAW 2 : 8.6 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>'Oh yes! , THERE WILL BE BLOOD'!"

After the first trap at the beginning. It has Eric, and his son. The film is all based around them. his son is in a trap with loads of other people. This trap goes on, and on, and on. It gets extremely dull. I really got bored watching it because it was so obvious what was going to happen. Someone will die and someone will go insane etc. Unfortunately i watch SAW III before i watched this, so i knew already that Amanda was the person helping jigsaw. The ending of this film, in fact all the saws are amazing, but i think the ending of the first film is the best.

Considering this was such a low budget movie, I really respect how realistic and amazing the graphics were. I had heard that the Saw franchise was notoriously gory, but I was completely amazed at how perfect many of the scenes looked, almost as if many of the scenes were real, even though we know thats not true at all, but excellent set designers and make up artists. Saw's traps are ingenious and really boggle the mind when you find out what's really going on near or at the end. Jigsaw actually makes you think in strange and twisted ways you never thought possible, something I haven't seen in years since ""The Sixth Sense"".<br/><br/>In some ways, ""Saw"" is like M. Night Shamalaun's masterpieces; unpredictable, beautiful, and leaving you with many questions until near or at the end of the movie, something that is very rarely done in our day and age. The only gripe that I had with Saw 2 was I knew exactly where the cop's son was the second Jigsaw said ""Your son is in a SAFE place."" If only Jigsaw had not emphasized the word ""Safe"" so much and there had not been a safe placed so close and placed in the shot so conveniently, it would've been the perfect sequel to an already excellent franchise. The part that did surprise me though, was when the tape had been previously recorded and the SWAT team had been watching nothing but events that have already occurred, and that really made up for what I already knew, which showed once again the ingenious work of the directors and screenwriters. Overall, I really liked Saw 2 I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the franchise or is looking for a great movie for Halloween, but when renting, remember: There will be blood, and lots of it!"

Also like the first, no one was super-strong, super-smart, or invincible. THis time around however, the killer is actually able to talk to the police since they were revealed in the first movie.

","Saw II is a better film than the original 'horror class'. It's more layered, tightly paced, and has elements of suspense as well as ghastly horror that exceed its predecessor. It is not, however, for everyone, and particularly not the squeamish. For the fans of the ghoulish, it has more cringe elements than the first and most of the horror films i've seen, although such visceral elements here fit the logic of the film rather than being gratuitous.<br/><br/>Nevertheless Saw II is a satisfying horror film, as nasty as it is. It's hard making a good horror film. A comedy can score on half its jokes and that would be a success. Horror, however, has to keep you on edge throughout otherwise it gets boring and/or silly, and on this point Saw II scores.

Several things in this film Bousman develops even more disturbing games for his victims, which are now mostly ex-convicts and makes them all move throughout his game trying to free themselves of a deadly neuro-toxin which is now in their blood. My biggest problem is that Jigsaw seems to challenge the individual, not a group. More importantly, every task in this film seems to be accomplished if they just work together, which obviously because they're ex-convicts, they don't. Nevertheless, there's still a lot of scare potential in this film and come the end there's another mind-blowing twist that knocks you completely off guard.

","The first SAW amazed me with the writers' clever ideas but SAW II felt a lot different from the first one. I mean, it's a good sequel, but it feels like there's something missing in this one...<br/><br/>SAW II starts off by John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer (Bell) testing Detective Matthews (Wahlberg) by having a conversation face to face when his son is in one of Jigsaw's games along with other victims. And somehow, all these players, including Matthews, have something in common that they will discover near the end of their journey. Its just a matter of time who will survive longest to find the missing puzzle piece of this sick game.<br/><br/>I think what bothered me the most in this movie could be because too many people are involved in the new game which lead me into confusion and never gave a lot of background from each character. But as I said before, It's a pretty good movie. The ending has a twist as usual and a pretty cool one it is. Let's just say I never ""saw"" it coming haha.

The twists were still great and the storyline was still brilliant. I feel that what really carried this movie, was the gore and twist.

"Antagonisten","6","0","1","10 July 2007"," Worthy follow-up
","How do you follow up on a shocking success? Or should i say a successful shocker? Any which way, much of the allure of the first SAW-movie was it's rather original take on the splatter/serial-killer genre. And original movies seldom lend themselves to good sequels. So does this suck? No, actually it doesn't.<br/><br/>The film-makers decided to open this movie up a bit more. So there are fewer scenes from a confined space, more characters in the mix and more of a story to follow. That was a good choice, seeing another movie basically following people trapped in a room would have been tedious. It worked great in the first movie but we've seen it once and that's enough. Here instead it plays out as a mix between the first movie and a regular race-against-time thriller.<br/><br/>The biggest problem as i see it is the legacy from the first movie, which is of course a classic Achilles-heel for sequels. Here they have tried to remedy that by twisting the story one step further. Making the traps and tests more disgusting, the deaths more gruesome (and plentiful) and of course the characters more deranged. In a way it does work, this movie kept me on my toes for the duration. I didn't really feel there was a need for all that extra blood though, although some of the more disgusting traps were delightfully sick.<br/><br/>In the end this attempt at a follow-up works pretty well. It's not that far behind the original movie in entertainment-value. Sure, much of the originality that made the first movie great is gone. But instead they have tried to give some background to the characters and events, some additional story to the script and more interesting and plentiful characters. Also they manage to include a twist-ending that's not quite on par with the first movie, but still nice.<br/><br/>I rate this 6/10."

The guy can act. It didn't seem to end too well for him. They didn't really fully explain that, they didn't really answer that in Saw III either. They just sort of hinted at a couple scenarios.<br/><br/>There is another big unanswered question, what happened to Dr. Gordon? In the first one, it certainly did look very bleak for him. I'll be the first to admit, I thought for certain he was toast. That said, I watched this movie very carefully and I never saw a body. Whether his body would be ""recognizable"" as him I don't know? But where was he? They were most certainly in the correct building and even in the very room where he took his own leg off. What happened to him? There's definitely two very logical situations but neither of them is played out in this one nor in Saw IV. Hopefully we'll find out in Saw III. Also, I really hope to see Donnie Wahlberg reprise his roll in Saw IV. He was a very valuable asset to the series."
"SteakSalad_101","7","0","1","8 July 2007"," Absolutely brilliant--can't remember the last time a sequel was this great!
","To be completely honest, I had VERY low expectations for Saw 2. I had watched the first film, and LOVED it. I loved how James Wan and Leigh Whannell were able to create such a creepy film with such a simple set. I loved the brilliant psychological warfare between two individuals who start out calm but grow angry with each other soon after. I loved the flashback sequences. Truth be told, I loved everything about it, and I was upset to then learn of three sequels (and probably a fourth) to such a classic horror film.<br/><br/>But anyway, since I had loved the first so much, one day I found myself at Blockbuster and decided to give the sequel a chance. I had nothing else to do. I could barely speak after watching it. I had just walked out of my home theater room with the memory of one of the best and most well-made sequels I've ever had the pleasure of watching.<br/><br/>""Saw 2,"" quite simply, is basically the first film on steroids. From the very first scene (which, by the way, was so revolting I had to set my giant movie theater butter popcorn bowl on the table next to me) Saw 2 will take your hands and lead you into a world of nightmare that you can't escape from until the end credits arrive on your screen 90 minutes later.<br/><br/>The story is simple to follow yet complex to dive into. Jigsaw locks eight people in a house full of traps, and they have two hours to find a way out before a lethal nerve gas flowing through the house kills them like the EBOLA virus. Meanwhile, Detective Matthews, a cop, apprehends Jigsaw with a team. And, it just so happens, one of the eight trapped in that house is Eric Matthews' son.<br/><br/>Saw 2 has everything the first film had and beyond. The gore is up there as a 9 or 10 on the gore scale, while I'd give the first film maybe a 7. Remember the psychological warfare that ensued between Adam and Lawrence in the first film? Well, it's magnified 100x in ""Saw 2,"" between Jigsaw and Detective Matthews, and the eight unlucky individuals trapped inside the house. The acting is incredibly top-rate and soars past the first film in acting talent. Everyone in the cast does a GREAT job and makes the film seem that much more realistic. The direction and editing is superb (better than the first) and we now seriously know Leigh Whannell can seriously write a damn good movie, even though the screenplay for the first film was better. Apart from that, the only complaints I could have for ""Saw 2"" is that it isn't as creative or inventive as the first was, but who says it has to be? It's a sequel--it is merely carrying on the story where the first left off. The second complaint would be that it isn't scary...at all. It's just a brilliant suspense film that will have you cringe in disgust at the deliciously cleverly twisted film before your eyes. And for me, that's enough.<br/><br/>The twist at the end is also one of the biggest shockers I've ever witnessed watching a film. You think the one at the end of ""Saw 1"" is big? You ain't seen nothing yet. And go ahead--keep trying to guess the ending throughout watching ""Saw 2."" I guarantee you it'll go in the exact opposite direction of what you're thinking of.<br/><br/>Overall--do what your love for the first film tells you to do. See ""Saw 2,"" disregard your thoughts of how a sequel could never be as great as the first, sit down, and put this movie on. You won't be disappointed! My only worry now is the third film possibly living up to the caliber of the first two. Leigh Whannell and James Wan prove that ""Saw"" is not one horror film saga for recent years, it's one for the century."

Now, detective Matthews is stuck in a much larger, much more complicated, much more creative game of Jigsaw's, which in the end proves to be an immensely enjoyable surprise for everyone, as it, as the original, turns everywhere you'd never expect.<br/><br/>My full respect and my full commendations to Leigh Whannell for this wonderful sequel to his own masterpiece. You can't find things like these very often."

I expected it to be another ""part 2 in a trilogy"" which usually means the movie is not the best of the three (Empire Strikes Back syndrome). I had rented it and had it sitting here for a week when I noticed Donnie Wahlberg was in it. Generally, I happen to like the pieces he chooses (same with Ed Harris) so I put the movie in.<br/><br/>My friend knocked on the door about 20 minutes into it. I jumped a mile. I was so scared, and she needed to de-stress so we ended up watching it together.<br/><br/>What a movie! We had a ball. It was so much better than the first, which was a 8 star movie in my book. The twists and turns kept coming, yet somehow I kept up. The only time we didn't was toward the end, and you could tell by the film making that we were not supposed to ""get it"". That is a good director. There is what I call an ""MTV"" sequence at the end, where things are laid out in a flashback type manner. It was also pulled off well, I didn't feel like I was being force-fed the movie back at me because I was too dumb to ""get it"" the first time. This is also a sign to me of good film making, which you just don't get in horror films these days.<br/><br/>Finally, I must say I laughed out loud at the reference to Blue Velvet (when Jigsaw was doing his oxygen thing).<br/><br/>I highly recommend the film."

After watching the first Saw I read a synopsis of it on Wikipedia and the story summed up in about 10 minutes worth of reading made me wonder why anyone bothers.

It boasts multiple story lines, chief among them a desperate cop's quest to save his son from a madhouse set up by the evil Jigsaw. The writers managed to maintain the feel of the original while offering up plenty of surprises. You'll spend a lot of time cringing, but that's part of the game Jigsaw wants to play with us, the audience.<br/><br/>Another intriguing element is our first real exposure to Jigsaw, played brilliantly by Tobin Bell. In the world of horror, Jiggy's a true original. He's a force for pure evil who can still draw our sympathy. In a sick way, we can even relate to his ideals of ""punishing the ungrateful,"" especially since Jigsaw himself has suffered so much. We know he must be stopped, but unlike Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger, we won't delight in it.<br/><br/>By now it's clear that ""Saw"" will buzz its way into a multiple-sequel franchise.

","""Violent. Gory. Pointless. Needless. Entertaining. Thoughtles."" It's very easy to right off the Saw series if you haven't actually seen it yourself. The way that it is portrayed and talked about by some people just makes it seem like a needless bloodbath of imaginative deaths, occasionally flavoured with some headache inducing twists and turns that bring up more questions rather than answering the ones that have already come up. Sure enough, the latter is often frustrating and seems to have become a popular trend. It's either a sign that the writer's don't know what they are doing or that they have a far bigger picture in mind. The fact that there will be at least 5 saw films perhaps points to the second option.<br/><br/>Saw II is quite different from the original. This is perhaps inevitable since it not only was made by someone else, but wasn't even a Saw sequel originally. Therefore it's easy to think that it might become a Blair Witch 2 type tack-on-easy-money-farce that it could well be. The Saw films are very clever, and this is often brought up by those who appreciate it. However the violence gets more publicity, and the simple truth is that it arouses enough curiosity to convince people to go and see it. The original Saw wasn't actually that violent. Much like Se7en, a film it is compared to but frankly isn't in the same class as, most of the nasty events are left to the imagination of the audience. Even the most famous scene, where Cary Elwes saws off his own foot, you see absolutely nothing. Saw II changes it's style, and is hard to stomach on occasion. However, the film gets it's nastiest death out of the way straight away. A protagonist who seems to be a snitch and a voyeur, much like Adam from the original, has what is described as a Venus fly trap round his head. It will slam shut, crushing his head, if he doesn't unlock it with a key before a minute runs out. The key happens to be behind his eye. Although he never goes as far as to get the key, the idea in itself is disturbing. After this the deaths aren't particularly gratuitous. In fact the scenario, solve puzzles to find a cure for a nerve gas destroying your system, is more horrifying then the way in which most of the people die.<br/><br/>The plot itself is simple and well defined, and newcomer Bousman makes sure that the film doesn't go off the rails and lose it's focus. Donnie Wahlberg, in excellent, and as usual, understated form, plays Detective Eric Matthews, the principle main character. His son has been kidnapped by the infamous 'Jigsaw' killer, and he, along with a number of unfortunate souls who have an unseen connection, are locked up in an old house. The only hope that Matthews has of saving his son is by finding out from the old and dying Jigsaw where he is. There are the two main stories that overlap each other, of Matthews and his team at Jigsaw's workshop, and his son and the other victims in the house. The formula allows an opportunity for the characters to grow themselves, and one of the understated values of the film is the characterisation. Matthews at first simply seems burnt out after a tough career, but it soon becomes clear that he is far from the perfect cop. The man on the floor (or house, as it were) who seems to take control and act as a leader, Xavier, is in fact a selfish and overbearing drug dealer who cares about no one but himself. It would be easy for the makers to drop good characterisation and get down to the bloodletting, as many feel is the case with Saw III. It is a credit to Bousman that he appreciates the most important aspects of making a great film: plot, characters, dialogue, atmosphere. By keeping these as a priority, and it makes the film easier to appreciate and makes it seem less like a popcorn movie.<br/><br/>Another important factor in making a good film is usually down to the actors themselves. Whereas this could have B-Movie performances, all the displays are solid and excellent. The fear, frustration and anger flows in a way that really surprises you. From the genuine terror and panic of the opening scene's character to the deep emotion of Matthews, the characters are believable and aren't just cardboard cutouts. Singling out Wahlberg as the star performer may be harsh on a quality cast, but the fact is that he has the hardest character to portray and pulls it off with flying colours. It's miles away from his performance as another cop, the earnest and honest detective Joel Stevens in Boomtown. Ultimately though, the film works so well because all the elements come together and create a film that isn't just entertaining but is also believable and terrifying. <br/><br/>Inevitably, most people probably think that the Saw series is pure popcorn and gore, and in many ways it is. Indeed the premise is sick at best. But in Saw II you have a film that shouldn't be THAT good but is, and it more than matches the original for atmosphere and drama. It's well worth it watching not just for the entertainment, but also for the great way in which it has been made. That is, of course, if you can stomach the violence."

","Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and stars Donnie Wahlberg as tough Detective Eric Matthews, Tobin Bell as brilliant psychopath Jigsaw aka John Kramer and Shawnee Smith as Amanda Young. This sequel to the first smash hit Saw is about a group of people held captive inside a house full of traps especially made for them by Jigsaw. While Jigsaw is being held by the police, Det Eric Matthews tries to squeeze out information from Jigsaw as to where the house might be. It turns out that the house is filled with lethal nerve gas that kills the people inside (unfortunately, Det Eric Matthews' son, Daniel is also inside) within two hours. A door will open after three hours so that means that they can't live that long when the door opens. So, Jigsaw has scattered antidotes all over the house so they can live and escape the house. With the clock ticking, Det Eric Matthews must save his son and the people inside before its too late.<br/><br/>Great twisted plot and a twisted ending makes this film stand out from the rest. Great acting by Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Donnie Wahlberg. This films keeps you hanging in a balance and it keeps you guessing till the end. Also, Adam's carcass gives a special participation and so is Zep's rotting body and Dr. Gordon's foot. And yes, the infamous bathroom from Saw will be featured in Saw II. 8/10"
"drownnnsoda","8","0","1","3 November 2006"," Worthy Sequel.
","""Saw II"" begins with another poor victim of the relentless Jigsaw serial killer (Tobin Bell), who is part of another ""death trap"" that will squash his head like a pumpkin unless he can remove the key - from behind his eyeball. Need I say more? We then are introduced to a group of more victims placed in one of Jigsaw's horrible traps. They each awake in an old, rundown house in a sealed off room. Disoriented and confused, the helpless people don't know what to do. Then, they find a tape player that explains the deadly nerve gas they are slowly breathing in, and how they must find the antidotes that can save them. Among them is a previous victim, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who is familiar with Jigsaw's games. It then becomes a constant battle of life or death as the unlucky people begin to turn on each other.<br/><br/>I have to admit, this was a pretty good film for being a horror sequel. In most cases, sequels don't even come close to meeting the expectations set from the original movie, but ""Saw II"" comes really close to it. The thing I liked most about this film was how there were more characters to interact with each other - there wasn't a whole lot of character development per se, but it was interesting how all of them interact and ultimately turn on each other. Just goes to show how much will some people have to save themselves, and how selfish some people are. I really liked that aspect of it. <br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad at all, I thought everyone involved did a pretty good job, so I really have no complaints there. Good performance from Donnie Wahlberg as a cop, and Shawnee Smith as a returning victim (?) of Jigsaw. The script was clever and the ending was a little bit of a shock for me, and the film ended on a note quite similar to the original. There's plenty of violence and elaborate traps for the ill-fated characters (even more elaborate and grotesque than what the original film had featured), so gore hounds should really enjoy this stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Saw II"" is a worthy sequel that comes close to meeting the standards that the first film set. It was clever (as expected), suspenseful, and cringe-inducing, as this series should be. Fans couldn't have asked for a better sequel. Not bad, not bad at all. 8/10."

","For the true horror fan who loves to cringe at ones worst fears this movie is for you. I've seen so many horrible horror movies, many of them homages to older horror movies. Saw broke the mold and Saw II has only carried on its legacy. Amazing opening scene, that kicks the movie into overdrive from the beginning. All the death scenes are so visceral, which makes it that much better. My favorite scene, which also freaks the hell out of me is the pit of needles, it makes me uneasy just thinking about. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the psycho in the house, he seemed a bit over the top to me. In the end though I felt satisfied Saw II and thirsty for Saw III."

The movie no change from the first of course is a bloody foul language film that under 17 is a must to watch flick, but no nudity to what I recall. Of course Jigsaw is still trying to play the playful life tester that is only getting worse by the minute. The introduction of the first chapter of the film is captivating and it's a simple sample of what more is coming. I believe this film might be a little more gruesome than part I and a lot more games are played.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to the horror loving audience now if the sight of blood the feeling of nauseous arises I suggest to think twice about the film. There is action, suspense, twist and of course thrill that makes Saw II one of the best in my opinion."

"dee.reid","8","0","1","24 October 2006"," ""Saw II"" horror feature ups the ante second time around
","It's truly amazing what the right amount of hype and the right kind of audience can do for a movie; ""Saw II"" embraces its following so that genre veterans can be full-on prepared for another grisly gore-fest designed to test the human will to simply survive. This time, the Jigsaw killer (Tobin Bell), is out in the open, and does not speak to us through a gruesome-looking puppet or a tape recording.<br/><br/>As we remember from ""Saw"" (2004), Jigsaw is technically not a serial killer, at least in the traditional sense; he often sets up elaborate methods for his victims to kill themselves (i.e., a man rubbed down in flammable chemicals must find the combination to a safe etched in a wall before the candle he's holding ignites him, or another victim must crawl through a yard of barb wire to an exit before a timer runs out and the door slams shut).<br/><br/>This time, Jigsaw sets up a funhouse for eight unknown people (including Shawnee Smith as ""Saw"" survivor Amanda, back for round two) who are all somehow connected, and it's up to dogged cop Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) to figure out where they are and save them. As for the poor souls in the booby-trapped house, they have three hours to locate the exit, or antidote, before they are all nerve-gassed to death. They're all the typical undesirables who have to prove their worth if they are to survive by playing Jigsaw's twisted game. Matthews takes it personal because his son is one of Jigsaw's latest victims in the house.<br/><br/>In the director's seat this time is newcomer Darren Lynn Bousman, who shares a screenplay credit with original ""Saw"" screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who played one of Jigsaw's victims in the first film. ""Saw II"" is at least clever enough to roughly follow the same pattern as its predecessor, but is even more clever to at least build on those ideas and not repeat itself. Whannell and Bousman's script still has that rare distinction of being simultaneously brilliant and god-awful and the players are still unlikeable, but Bousman is able to keep enough of a firm grip on the material that it never slips into mediocrity or stupidity.<br/><br/>The nightmarish, funhouse tricks & traps scenario is something straight out of an S & M fantasy, highlighted greatly by tripped-out editor Kevin Greutert and David Hackl's twisted, goth-inspired production design. I'm sure that for this casual horror fan, ""Saw II"" has still provided sufficient, delightful pre-Halloween entertainment, just as ""Saw"" did two years ago. I would guess that ""Saw III"" can only bring about a thoughtful conclusion, if that is indeed what Jigsaw has in store for us later this week.<br/><br/>8/10"
"barrydwriter","9","0","1","24 October 2006"," Twists and turns - expect the unexpected!
","I can't make a decent review of the movie, so I'll just share some of my thoughts on it. Here goes nothing: First of all, this was NOT a ripoff of CUBE. True enough, both movies involve a theme of strangers being trapped in a mystery house full of traps and dangers; however, the similarities end there. Okay? Now shut up about it, if that's what has been holding you back from seeing it.<br/><br/>By far and wide, there were definitely some scenes in this movie which were hard to watch, but they worked in the aspect of the movie. It's a perfect example of gore being used to further the horror of a situation, rather than exploiting it for that purpose. Needless (now I shudder at how similar that word is to another one...) to say, this movie was less a splatter film and more of a psychological mystery - JUST like the original SAW.<br/><br/>One slight problem I had with the movie was a fault entirely of my own. For quite some time now, I knew something about how this movie was going to end. No-no, don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away; but basically I'll use this analogy: Let's say someone in 1983 who never saw the original two STAR WARS movies hears about RETURN OF THE JEDI coming, and that there's something about Han Solo having to get rescued. They get curious, and they watch the first movie. Then, shortly before RETURN comes out, they see EMPIRE, but already they know that Han Solo gets into some kind of trouble. Carbonite, et al, happens, and it's just not as effective, but it was still a good movie.<br/><br/>That's what my situation was with the SAW movies; I watched the first one, loved it, and as I waited and waited for II to come out on DVD in its uncut edition (I'm a dork, I know), I keep hearing things about the third movie which began to make me think. I prettymuch had the end to SAW II figured out for a while, and the whole time I was watching it, I was hoping to be corrected. Unfortunately, I was right...but you see, there are TWO twists to this movie, which both happen back-to-back and within one another. I wasn't sure what the *other* twist was, at first, but reading some of the spoiler-heavy posts on the message board after watching the movie, I suddenly got slapped in the face with that other twist...and needless to say, I spent a good few minutes laughing at the shock of it. So, I got my awesome twist ending after all...even if I knew one aspect of it already.<br/><br/>I did give this movie a 9 out of 10 star rating, and that was because of a few problems I had with it. One of them was my above ""spoiled foreshadowing,"" but that hardly is a reason to dislike the movie. My problems were mostly in a couple of the characters. Here you have such complicated and profound characters like Jigsaw, and this movie does a really good job at exploring them; and then there's Xavier and Detective Eric Matthews. Some of the decisions they make in the movie work only to further the plot, and are either very unprecedented or disagreeable. Something Xavier does at one point is so left-field and horrendous, and it really bugs me that he did it; but then again, it helped the plot along, and I guess that makes up for it. On a further note about him, I liked Franky G in THE Italian JOB, and I thought he was a very talented actor there; seeing him in this role made me feel like it was a bit of a waste for him. Oh well, he's getting more famous now, anyway.<br/><br/>Oh, speaking of actors, I really enjoyed Shawnee Smith. She was basically the star of the movie, to me; her character of Amanda, from her reaction to waking up in the house and screaming her horror, to...other, later points (gah, I swear that pun was unintended!), was executed with real conviction and talent. I, for one, am a fan of this actress now. And Tobin Bell...he has set the high bar on what a villain is like, and I, for one, thought he did splendidly as the awesomely complicated Jigsaw.<br/><br/>So in retrospect, this movie was full of thrills, twists, and tons of scares. It was every bit as good as the original, and even a bit better at times. All in all, SAW II was a perfect example of a psychological horror movie done right, and an excellent follow-up to its groundbreaking predecessor.<br/><br/>A-"

To think that someone could even think of these things for a movie is hard to think about. All I know is that it made for a great movie. <br/><br/>I felt i had to watch this movie with the new Saw 3 coming out and it definitely lived up to what I had been hearing.

","Exasperated with people taking life for granted, the cancer riddled sadistic killer, Jigsaw, is back for a second bout of intricately engineered games of death, designed to make his victims prove they are worthy of existence.<br/><br/>Saw, released in 2004, achieved cult status through its innovative approach to the horror/serial killer genre. A cleverly worked script with twists and turns overcame some dodgy acting and turned Saw into a triumph. The inevitable sequel builds on the premise of the first by introducing ever more elaborate schemes for the victims to die, in Jigsaws twisted little games. Half the fun is trying to figure out how the next trap can possibly outdo the previous one in terms of violence and 'look through your fingers in disgust'. Yet each time the deaths get ever more depraved.<br/><br/>The tag line says it all. If you can't handle the blood then stay the hell away. This is not one for the faint hearted. I deny anyone to watch this film without feeling tense and uneasy. It's chilling atmosphere sends a wave of foreboding and fear flooding through your veins as you expect something horrible round every corner. In terms of pure fright Saw actually fails to deliver many jumps and jolts, purely because you are generally expecting the worst. But in terms of sustained grimace and horror for what the characters are going through, Saw lets your blood boil, forgetting about the off switch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Saw is let down by some painfully poor acting which seems to have been unceremoniously accredited to the horror genre. Part of the reason the original was so highly regarded was the gritty interaction of its two main characters working with and against each other in their desperate situation. With a larger cast its successor loses all notions of character development and portrays a group of impossibly dumb individuals and, therefore, a very unbelievable bunch of idiots.<br/><br/>Although it loses the original impact of its predecessor, Saw II is a commendable but significantly weaker sequel. It still manages to blow the majority of modern horror films out of the water, delivering some of the most memorable and haunting sequences of recent memory. However, it isn't a patch on 'The Decent' when it comes to the terror department."

"boy_in_red","6","0","1","24 August 2006"," Worth watching, though lacks the intensity of the first
","Saw II is certainly worth a couple of hours of your life, but you will come away with a sense of ""been there, done that. bought the t shirt already."" Yes it has a couple of novel new and horrid ways of killing/ torturing people but all in all it is a retread, and not necessarily of the first Saw film alone. The group dynamic, in needing to solve puzzles to escape with their lives, is very reminiscent of Cube, a much tighter thriller in my opinion, perhaps only because it never cuts away from the central action- there is no let up.<br/><br/>The vast majority of the characters in the house remain cardboard cut outs- we don't really see beyond their criminal activities. So we have ""the ex junkie"" ""the drug dealer"" ""the prostitute"" but you'll be surprised if you remember their names, or anything else that made them distinctive. Perhaps this is deliberate- you get the various guilty pleasure of watching them die in numerous ways without really caring for them as people, but in reality it removes a sense of intensity and tension which I found in the first Saw movie. We actually care about the doctor in that film.<br/><br/>The character of Jigsaw/ John is demystified here also as we get to see too much of him. He lacks the presence of, say, Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter so it feels as if the more we see of him the less impact he has, the less fearsome he appears, though at the same time it isn't as if these feelings are replaced with sympathy or pity. He's just there.<br/><br/>I won't say too much about the twist (well twists I guess) at the end, other than they felt silly, whereas I remember my stomach lurching when the final twist in the original film was released. I'm a bit concerned about Saw 3 and the direction one of the twists implies it will take the series. I'm not sure if I can take it as seriously- it feels more like a vehicle for extending the longevity of the film series, rather than something that is important in terms of plot. Time will tell I guess! <br/><br/>To summarise, it is worth a rent, perhaps a blind purchase if you're a big fan of the first or a completist. It certainly isn't an atrocious sequel, but it does feel a little paint-by-numbers detective/serial killer/ horror at times. It's a fun way to pass a couple of hours though, and I certainly didn't find myself bored, though perhaps a little less involved than in the first film."

","i rented this movie (missed it in the theater unfortunately) with high hopes, having really liked the first one. And i wasn't disappointed, although Saw 2 is an entire different movie than the original.<br/><br/>The first major difference is: we now know the killer, which initially is a bit of a let down because the search for the identity of ""jigsaw"" was what made the first one so great. But from the moment detective Matthews finds Jigsaw and we discover that his Son is in Jigsaw's house of ""fun"", The movie became really interesting. Jigsaw's proposition to Det.Matthews to just sit there and talk, seemed strange but made you wanna watch the movie a bit more to see where all this was gonna lead to.<br/><br/>The second difference is: except for the (really strong and awfully gory) opening sequence the victims aren't individually trapped, but are all together in a big booby trapped house, from which they have to find a way out. Although it reminded me a bit of the movie ""Cube"", i found this to be a fresh new perspective of the killers games. it seems like the victims have a choice, while in fact everything that Jigsaw has planned for them, actually happens (ofcourse in the climax of the movie is revealed who of the ""victims"" we have to thank for that) The third difference is that this time, the movie IS very gory. While the first movie wasn't all that explicit as far as the violence is concerned, the second one shows all the nasty things in all it's glory.<br/><br/>The acting, again, isn't top notch (Although Tobin Bell and Donnie Wallberg do an excellent job) but this time the victims are so annoying that you could't care less what's gonna happen to them. As far as i'm concerned this made the movie a little bit less exciting to watch. But the ending, although not as brilliant as the original, again really amazed me and lifted the movie far above average as far as i'm concerned.

","I'm what you could call a horror film fan myself, yet very few films scare or shock me anymore. I remember when i watched the first ""Saw"" I was so impressed because the film hit a deep nerve, it did what no ""horror"" film had managed to do for a long time. Well i have to say, i was even more impressed with Saw 2- there were moments in the film where i actually gasped allowed, and the narrative twists and turns kept coming. And once again the ending leaves the viewer with an eerie sense of dread. The character of Jigsaw himself is masterfully created, to the point where you almost want to say you agree with what hes saying, or you can see his point of view.<br/><br/>I must say that the general standard of acting in this film, is much better than the original. Hopefully the director will move onto other things, possibly in the same vein as Saw, psychological horror is doing well right now and id love to see him try something in this genre again."

","This is a worthy sequel, although it doesn't measure up to the first one, its still better than 90% of films in this genre. The direction is pretty good, and the acting is also pretty good. It was actually funnier than the first one, which i don't know is a good thing or not because its not a comedy. The only thing that made it not measure up to the original was the fact that i could see the twist coming and could actually kinda tell where the film was heading.

Anyway, it involves 8 people trapped in a house, including the son of a detective that has just busted jigsaw. Jigsaw is not only playing a game with the people in the house, but also with the detective. As the story progresses you learn more and more about the people and why their there. It does keep you hooked and i would have rated this movie higher had it not been for the ending. SPOILER AHEAD,<br/><br/>As it turns out, Ammanda is Jigsaw protégé, which sets it up for saw 10000 or however many their gonna make of these, end up ruining the series of course.

"tohu","7","0","1","21 May 2006"," Reasonable but not as good as the original.
","It seems like such a cliché to say it but I have to go along with the majority of other reviewers who seem to be agreed that 'Saw II' is basically not as good as the original. That still leaves a lot of scope however, given that 'Saw' was such an excellent film.<br/><br/>It may just be that sequels never work (Godfather Part II being the exception that proves the rule!) But it is always disappointing when you have enjoyed the first one so much, to finish watching the second with a feeling of letdown.<br/><br/>That said, Saw II is not in itself a bad film. It only really suffers in comparison to its predecessor. The pace of the sequel is good, the original premise is retained but with interesting new twists and the acting is, in general, better than average - without any one performance worthy of being singled out as excellent (with the possible exception of Tobin Bell's menacing portrayal of Jigsaw).<br/><br/>One of the main problems here is that the script is crammed full of too many characters, and so there is little time for developing these and giving them real depth, with the result that a few of them are really fairly one-dimensional, about whom it is difficult to care too much. (This is a mistake that was very much NOT the case with the original!) <br/><br/>Overall, it's OK. Go and see it. But just don't expect anything miraculous - and I'd certainly say that you should not see this film without seeing the original Saw first."

","Saw 2 is that rare thing. A sequel that is better than the original. That's my opinion anyway. If you are a fan of horror movies this is one you want to see. It is unpredictable with many twists and turns which will have you glued to the screen. It has all that was contained in Saw 1 and the action is similar. One drawback I had with the film was that I found it particularly gory. Some parts I just could not watch.( I hate seeing cruelty). If you liked Saw 1 you will love this. It is a film for all horror fanatics and I think that the story line is very good. This film could be enjoyed without seeing the first but I advise seeing the first to enhance your enjoyment of this film."
"ExpendableMan","6","0","1","13 May 2006"," Decent follow up
","Gory as hell and proud of it, Saw seemingly came out of nowhere to grab cinema goers by the throat, shake them violently and vomit blood into their faces. Thanks to it's success a sequel was inevitable but when it followed the original in less than a year and still turned out to be a decent follow up that in places surpasses it's older brother was about as expected as the Spanish inquisition. And as the tagline boasts the level of depravity reaches all new levels.<br/><br/>Setting the tone instantly, the first five minutes sees Jigsaw's latest victim having to make the decision between having his head splattered in a giant metal trap or carve his own eye out in order to retrieve the key to open it. True to the hype's promises the claret is gushing in seconds and when the cops arrive to investigate this rather unpleasant demise, the story properly kicks into gear. Bursting into a warehouse, the police led by detective Eric Matthews (Donnie ""New Kid On the Block"" Wahlberg) corner Jigsaw in his den and all seems to be neatly wrapped up. Before you can say ""Gee, that was a very brief and concise short film"" however the villain plays his ace in the hole; he has eight people locked up in a house riddled with traps who are slowly dying from breathing in air tinged with a tissue destroying virus and one of them is Matthew's delinquent teenage son.<br/><br/>What follows plays out in two separate strands - Jigsaw plays his game of cat and mouse with the police while the eight victims of his scheme try to escape the house and meet all sorts of nasty ends along the way. Revealing too much more would give away too many of the twists and turns the plot takes along the way, but rest assured fans of the original will find plenty to relish in here. Spiked baseball bats, bladed hand traps, booby-trapped ovens and a pit filled with thousands upon thousands of used needles ramp the level of unpleasantness right up and there are none of the irritating flashbacks to disrupts proceedings like in the first film.<br/><br/>It's not perfect of course. Grim and depraved it may be but 'Seven' it most certainly isn't and once again, every little twist has to be painstakingly explained but as far as squirm-in-your-seat film making goes, it's certainly effective. Jigsaw himself also has a far more active role this time round and makes a decidedly menacing presence but it is the link to the prequel that really seals the deal, a final act revelation so delightfully messed up it'll be with you for days."

","Saw 2 is not your average horror film. Like its predecessor, you will not see teenagers having rampant sex and you won't be screaming at the screen ""Don't go there, moron!"" Saw 2, however, is also not all that scary in and of itself. It is a gory movie, which might scare some people, but where the fear comes into play with the Saw movies is that they are, ultimately, plausible. Unline many horror movies.<br/><br/>""Jigsaw"" is back. The first scene of the movie is, in my opinion, more gory than the entirety of Saw. This time, Jigsaw gets caught early on in the movie, but that was his whole plan in the first place. The story that unravels is filled with twists and half truths, and what befalls a certain detective could have been averted by simply listening.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit obvious, but the plot is excellent."

","I WILL give this film full marks, simply because I think it is one of the few horror/thriller films that actually shows originality and flair, and has a twist that you actually DON'T guess until pretty much the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I think that Saw was could be defined as the better of the two, although obviously that's only because its the first. But sequels are far too often made-for-profit to the extent where they lose sight of trying to provide adequate value for money - the Saw franchise does (see my review of Final Destination 3 to see one that doesn't).<br/><br/>I like that it shows continuity from the first film, neatly tying in the cliffhanger ending without ripping off what made the first one successful, and even though you may guess the twist a little more easily second time around, it is no less exciting. I definitely recommend this film for those people who hate spending money on movies they 'know' they won't enjoy. If you like horror, suspense, mystery and an all round mental challenge when viewing movies, then Saw I and II are the ones for you. Looking forward to the Saw III!"

Anyway, if you get past the grimace making realistic mutilation (excellent effects and make-up by the way) there's a neat twisty turny double helix of a plot unwinding with a relentless pace and some style. You become acclimatised to the squealing horror of the film at roughly the same speed that The plot develops, which is smart, and it has a climax worthy of all the credit the film has received. It's a clever film, blending blood and plot to titillate you even beyond the final credits, as you mentally piece together the loose ends - and they all fit together rather nicely. I enjoyed it immensely, but it took me a while to realise it.

Parts I didn't like in the movie was the people playing the game were just plain stupid they didn't take it seriously... compare to Saw 1 Adam and Dr. Gordon took it seriously and tryed to figure everything out.. but these people were plain dumb.. only smart ones were Amanda(well we know why) and Daniel.The twist at the end... well i didn't expect it.... it was unpredicatable in my eyes... i never thought the tape wasn't live and jus VCR and his son was behind Jigsaw the whole time and Amanda turns out to be behind the whole thing... kinda realized that part when she made those eyes at Daniel... but anyways Saw 2 is a better movie and I think more unpredicatable....Get the Saw movies and enjoy!!"
"mattthomsen","7","0","1","14 April 2006"," Inferior to the original but contains similar mind-blowing plot-twists
","Decent sequel to the brilliantly horrific ""Saw"". At the start of the film Jigsaw has eight would-be victims captured in a house together, with various riddles and traps to negotiate if they hope to escape. Whilst we see them all busy being tormented by Jigsaw's trickery, and one another, Jigsaw himself has been caught by the police, at his own hideout. Wahlberg plays Detective Matthews, who, with his police pals, is trying to extract from Jigsaw the whereabouts of the house to save his son, who is one of the eight trapped.<br/><br/>The movie clicks along alternating between these two broad aspects. The far better of these are the scenes outside of the house. As Jigsaw and Matthews progress their cat-and-mouse interaction we learn about Jigsaw's motivation and history, and Tobin Bell is near-perfect in this role, just utterly cold and creepy. Wahlberg's performance is only decent, certainly not great, but probably didn't need to be anything more given that this part of the movie is all about Jigsaw in any case.<br/><br/>The scenes in the house in the main feel like padding out time in anticipation of a big finish. We learn almost nothing about most of the captured, to the extent that most of them didn't really need to be given a name beyond ""victim #3"" or such. This pretty much applies to the first four characters killed.<br/><br/>The traps or their links to their intended victims mostly aren't as clever as those in the original, and this stuff has certainly lost some of its impact and almost become gimmicky in the sequel. Still this is a horror movie, and if you can't respond to what you'll see with ""cooool"" you're probably in the wrong theatre anyway. My stomach did turn in delight at the truly horrible scene involving the character Amanda (who returns from the original) in the ""pit"", about halfway through the movie. Worth making an effort to get through your munchies before it. Better still don't attempt to eat and watch - the opening scene of the film is also deliciously gruesome.<br/><br/>A few people die, a few don't, and the movie does build to a big finish and two big final twists. Not much can be said without giving it away, suffice to say the last five minutes were brilliant, and, like the first film leave you thinking ""oh yeah.... so that's why that happened"". Particularly the twist involving Wahlberg's son....wow. I was taken aback by the cleverness of the writers and the little hints along the way which didn't seem to mean anything at the time. The ending, and the performance of Bell, really did make this movie and for me saved it from being average to poor horror schmaltz.<br/><br/>You do need to see the original first to best appreciate this movie.<br/><br/>Frustrating to review really given that I can't say much about the best thing about the movie, the ending. The way the story has been left after this one, I can envisage Saw III being an absolute disaster. We shall see...."

Whenever a character had a ""way out"" it was obvious a nasty surprise awaited him or her. The Sixth Sense had these qualities- my favourite film for sudden scares, and my favourite film of all time actually...<br/><br/>The ending leads the way to Saw III and it couldn't be worked out by anyone, I imagine, because it seems a bit ridiculous, but hey, you have to leave your reality sense at the door anyway!<br/><br/>If you liked Saw I then this is a film to watch, every bit as good, if not better."

Who wouldn't want to watch and hear people (in a horror movie, of course) kicking and screaming their way out of death. And what's with Beverly Mitchell's death? She died in a freaking hallway with absolutely no blood relating to her death. Why didn't they give her a bloody game? She always plays the stupid little ""tehe"" roles, like Seventh Heaven? Come On!! I will admit that the guy who burned in the oven was pretty disturbing. Needles, not so bad. Razers, meh! She was already going to die soon anyways.

","I had a soft spot for the first Saw, which went away after I saw it a second time. This one didn't even generate the goodwill that I have for nearly all horror movies. While there are a few sequences that are good, that are especially horrifying, there are a few major drawbacks. The characters are almost entirely two-dimensional. The methods of creating depth to characters seems to be that they'll deliver a hint at a back story, but there's little to no acting involved. Only one of the secondary characters has any traits. The situation is painful to watch because the people seem to be entirely ineffective individuals. The second problem is that the ending betrays the biggest point of the series - the villain (who has reached cartoonish super-villainy) breaks the rules of his character by performing an (implied) straightforward murder. Yes, it's passable for a rental, but it is hardly re-watchable."

In both movies you slowly see the rude and disobedient people get sucked up a tube or down a drain in Willy Wonka and burned to death or have their head shot off in Saw II. At the end of each movie only the guide and the polite well behaved person survive.

"kitty757_1","8","0","1","27 March 2006"," Good movie; not great, but good. Third movie may mean room for redemption in the eyes of some---
","The first movie, although extremely gruesome, was brilliant. It showed us just how much people take life for granted--- all of us do, there isn't a single soul who can fairly and rightly say that they had never at least once in the most tiny way taken advantage of the life they were given.<br/><br/>This movie, although not quite meeting the expectations of many, was good. Great? That's all a matter of opinion of every individual. But it WAS good.<br/><br/>There wasn't a whole lot of character development--- we basically learned that each person did this or that in their past, and how they were connected--- through Daniel's dad. They all had evidence planted against them by his dad. Really, it was only the kid (Daniel) and the girl (Amanda) that I wanted to live. Why? Well, because Daniel is what he is--- a kid. Not a little four year old kid, but still not an adult. Amanda? Because she at the moment seemed to be the only one who actually was willing to do anything to survive Jigsaw's game.<br/><br/>The characters were way bad. This one guy goes around killing people or leaving them to their deaths... doesn't make much sense to do so at the start. Wouldn't it be smarter to keep them around to help you find an antidote, and then kill them so you will ultimately be the survivor? But he goes around and bashes them on the head and what not.<br/><br/>The movie was good, but it has a lot of room for improvement. I have to say that I didn't expect the ending--- I really didn't believe that Amanda would carry on Jigsaw's torture game for those taking advantage of life. I just thought, oh, so she escaped but returned to her taking-advantage-of-life-ways and he brought her back. Then we learn that she in fact, is the new Jigsaw. And it makes sense--- in a weird way. She survived it, so she knew it was possible. She was already once a drug addict and in jail, so nobody ever accused this girl of being some brilliant genius of a human being in the first place. And Jigsaw always had to have a front row seat, remember? Amanda, starting on her very first 'game', had a front row seat. She was one of the supposed victims stuck in the house.<br/><br/>There are a few things we have to consider--- Jigsaw had cancer, so he was dying. Was it likely for him to fix that house up so that it had all sorts of traps like before? Not likely. What is most likely is that Amanda, with some help, did it all. Either that, or it was done before the game. Amanda and Daniel were in the bathroom that we first saw in the original Saw movie--- so its possible the whole place was rigged for different times, different games set up for different people caught by Jigsaw taking advantage of life.<br/><br/>As I said, this movie wasn't great. It had its flaws just like all movies usually do--- but its still worth a watch at least once, when you're considering what movie to rent. Or if you just see it on a movie channel--- its not something you will always want to watch over and over. Its something you should for sure want to see once. The rest is all just... a matter of opinion.<br/><br/>This movie left an opening for a sequel, with the new Jigsaw. This was Amanda's first game... she has room to improve, and by the third movie if they do follow through with it, she should have already gone through with the game a few times before the movie starts. A good movie with flaws, and has room for redemption."

I could see that from a mile away.) then I recommend this... also, I am happy that they didn't give me a reason to hate one of my favorite Mudvayne songs, on the soundtrack (""Forget to Remember"" from the Lost and Found CD). and this time, they had ACTORS!

","Saw was an inventive low-budget shocker that ultimately succeeded due to its clever narrative and ability to disgust.<br/><br/>Despite attempts to emulate the elements that made the original work so well, Saw 2 fails to successfully repeat the formula, ultimately feeling like a quickie cash-in sequel (albeit with better acting).<br/><br/>The story is basically a retread of the first film, but this time around twisted sicko Jigsaw wreaks havoc on a larger group than before. These protagonists act with little or no logic, undermining any tension wrought from their situation and, in some places, their stupidity beggars belief (the oven victim and the girl who reaches inside the perspex were particularly moronic).<br/><br/>I also found the direction and editing extremely tiresome; so many horror films these days feel the need to add choppy edits, distressed and grainy effects and hand-held camera shots. Such gimmicks are not necessary if the director has a tight control of his film and the script is strong enough. These showy techniques make me feel like the movie makers are trying to detract the audience from the lack of a great plot.<br/><br/>I sat to the end of this one hoping that the final denouement would be sufficiently clever and unexpected for me to forgive what had gone before - it wasn't!"
"secoc127","3","0","1","3 March 2006"," Obnoxious and irritating
","When ""Saw"" first came out in 2004 there was much buzz surrounding the film. Some called it the goriest film ever made and the premise sounded intriguing. I so saw the film with some expectation and was very let down. The good plot had so many missed opportunities and the acting was dreadful all around, it also did not help that James Wan is such a poor director and used way too many MTV-music video style directing techniques. But it made a butt-load of money and one of Lionsgate Films highest cost to profit films. It also made way for many more extremely gory horror films like ""High Tension"", ""Wolf Creek"", ""Hostel"", and the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"". It also brought along ""Saw II"", which is just as bad. Since i thought that the gore was not all gross in ""Saw"", they really upped the anti with ""Saw II"", its just one sick movie. I know some people really love these movies and others wanted to be shocked when they first see it so I wont say anything more. I could not believe it when I was watching it but the acting in the second film is even worse. Maybe some of the worst I have ever seen. Screaming does not count as acting, its just annoying. Also the Darren Lynn Bounsson directs this as if he was directing a punk rock music video. The result is so obnoxious that it's hard to sit through. I do have to give ""Saw II"" some credit because the story is not half bad, the twist is better and I was surprised how well they linked the two stories. But besides that there is no redeeming value to this piece of garbage. ""Saw II"" is ultimately an obnoxious and irritating movie going experience, at least for me. Genre fans no doubt love his film and I can't blame them, they are the ones Lionsgate Films made this for and the target audience loves it. But for me, this is one of the worst films I have seen from the year 2005."

","**1/2 Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Erik Knudsen, Dina Meyer, Franky G, Glenn Plummer. Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman<br/><br/>Despite the doubt of a sequel surpassing the original (which it doesn't) or the attempt to measure up, ""Saw 2"" does. Leigh Whannel going out on a limb with out James Wong but substituting for him director Darren Lynn Bousman. A fine choice indeed. This time friendly serial killer and life teacher Jigsaw (Bell) pits eight strangers in a house while they breathe in deadly nerve agents. While Detective Mathews attempts to hunt down his son who is also one of the eight. ""Saw 2"" doesn't fail on blood and creativity but it does the exact opposite, it brings wholesome torture and life back to killings on the screen. Most horror films fail to deliver the goods or a decent story line, ""Saw 2"" packs both. No it's not as good as the original but a lot better than I would think for what it is. My final rating 7/10"

","A bunch of people wake up and groggily get to their feet. They're in a creepy looking room. They don't know each other. Then they're informed they have to find a way out of the house in a matter of hours, or the nerve gas they've been inhaling will strike 'em dead as a doornail. Naturally, some booby traps aim to prevent this.<br/><br/>This follow up to the 2004 original could have lapsed into typical sequelitis and just been terribly derivative and dull. You know the drill: Kill a whole slew o' people in horrible, disgusting ways that in no way further the plot. But Saw II doesn't quite stoop that low. The horrible, disgusting killings do indeed further the plot.<br/><br/>I am reminded of an old radio program called The Shadow. You might recognize the name, since Alec Baldwin played the titular hero in a 1994 movie. But it began in radio, and there was one episode called ""The House That Death Built."" In the episode, people were offed in creative ways by booby traps, such as a gas chamber and a series of shotguns.<br/><br/>It's usually difficult to translate the unseen horror, like radio can, to a full-length feature film, and indeed most movies fail to do so. But Saw II does do so. You know right away these aren't characters we're meant to find appealing, or root for. No needless attention is paid to their backgrounds; all that you get on each character is all that you need to put things together. No dialog is especially wasted, and that - along with the always-fun gore - is what makes this movie work.<br/><br/>Of course, if you don't like blood in your film, you're going to really hate this one. It's everywhere. People spurt from all sorts of orifices, plus some new ones. But things don't seem to be done with the intent to shock, another point in the movie's"

There is definitely more twists in Saw II, and more to think about. We find out what makes Jigsaw tick, and why he puts a jigsaw on each of his victims.

","** Minor Spoilers ** <br/><br/>I'm not the type that likes shocker horror films - just not my thing. I also loathe ""dead teenager movies"" where the point is to see how a gaggle of teens can be killed off, one-by-one, in increasingly sensational ways. So after researching Saw I was excited to see something that was more suspense mixed with a little horror - and to my surprise and delight is was a wonderful film, properly gritty with just enough gore (mostly off-camera) to let you know what happened without making you watch it.<br/><br/>Saw II is not that kind of movie. While it has most of the flavor of the first, and even a couple of characters return (both alive and dead), there is much, much, more gore here. In fact, many of the puzzles seem to be to inflict torture and pain than to present any solvable situation - and we get to watch every agonizing moment of it.<br/><br/>The endgame is extremely clever and satisfying - I never saw it coming. So, although glad I watched Saw II, I thought the deliberate bent toward the 'dead teenager' genre a cop-out in direction. Saw III is listed for a Halloween 2006 release - hopefully it will bend more toward the original than this one."
"sullibrandon","8","0","1","13 February 2006"," Good Gory Movie Fare
","I must say that Saw II did not disappoint. For those of you not familiar with the original Saw, it was about a serial killer who puts victims in situations where they kill themselves in their efforts to get out. It was a masterful movie, a taut, tense, psychological thriller, with a sense-jarring, rug-out-from-under-you, sixth sense type ending.<br/><br/>It was also unrestrictedly gory, and what was good about it was that the gore added to the tenseness of the story, instead of distracting you from it. I was afraid that the sequel would still be okay as a story, but nowhere near the original's impact.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. Saw II avoids most pitfalls of sequels, such as following the same basic storyline, the same sorts of stunts, and just making it bloodier and more action filled. The original Saw was made up of mostly flashbacks with calls back to the present time, where the main story was. It was a very creative way to tell a story, and the second one told it in a creative way also. Of course, it is a sequel, so it is not as good, but the filmmakers did not, to their credit, attempt to make it more bloody, or more action-filled. The traps Jigsaw (the main bad guy) sets for his patients are more creative, but not to the point of trying to completely outdo the original. The filmmakers have a clear understanding that, as a sequel, they cannot hope to overshoot the original, no matter how hard they try, so they do not try too hard like so many people do. All in a all a wonderful story, though it is not for the weak of stomach, as it is filled with gore. Another thing I liked about the sequel was that the ending was also sixth sensish. Here's some advice to those of you who have yet to see one or both of them: Don't preoccupy yourself with trying to figure out the story. Ride the whole thing with the characters, and let the realizations come to you as they come to them. You will enjoy the storyline much more if you immerse yourself in what they are feeling instead of analytically analyzing every detail to figure out the plot twist. Go see Saw II, and if you haven't seen the first, go see the first, and then the second. I definitely suggest seeing the first one first, because the effect of the ending in the second one is all the more enhanced if you see the first beforehand. These are two wonderful masterpieces of gore-film-making, while still effectively focusing on proper character development, a rarity in most Hollywood horror flicks. These are definitely not films to miss if you are a movie fan, and especially if you're a gore/horror fan."

It is not your typical comedy horrors like Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, etc., but it has some really good elements to it. The opening scene is excellent, more towards reality than the cavalier attitudes of the ""victims"" from the first movie. The rest of the movie is all in the subtleties of suggestion, clues and manipulation that gives this movie a good viewing. Unfortunately, the characters are not exactly intelligent. I suppose that fear removes all sense of logic and makes seemingly intelligent people not notice/listen to clues or words that are given. The ""victims"" are your typical ""i'll do stupid things until I die"" type of people. The ending is excellent though, very nicely done. It is a good movie to watch."

","SAW II is an improvement over the original SAW, as a group of young people and adults find themselves trapped in Jigsaw's house of horrors. The traps and deaths are clever, the gore quotient is upped, and the action never stops for a second. Add to this the fact that the cops have found and captured Jigsaw almost from the outset, but find themselves powerless to stop his latest game. Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell are back from the original, and the ending of this ties itself back directly to the original in a highly satisfying manner. Highly recommended for gore hounds who thought HOSTEL and HIGH TENSION were too tame."

","Much better than the original. More cohesive, less contrived, more brutal. Tobin Bell is solid as the unmasked Jigsaw and manages to elicit a shred of empathy. The premise is similar to the first (several characters search for an exit before death visits), but there are enough surprise revelations, gory, inventive confrontations and a moody score to keep the structure from becoming predictable. Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Bousman and James Whannell, one of the original's writers, it connects directly with the first film while expanding on the concept. Climax is frantic and final image is one of grisly horror. Made by true horror fans for true horror fans. A fine achievement considering how many plates it's juggling."

"Alien_v1","9","0","1","4 February 2006"," Diagnosis: Sick!
","My review contains some spoilers (and even major ones for SAW, the prequel). This is obviously one of those movies you can enjoy most when you know the least of them in advance. So, if you didn't see it yet and just want to know if it rocks - it does! Go watch it and stop reading HERE.<br/><br/>The surprise is gone. We all know by now, who the Jigsaw killer is. His final entrance in SAW was the last and biggest jaw-dropper of the movie, opening the most brutal ending I can remember - ""Game over"", and then Adam screaming in the dark - it's not always the most violent moment that gives you the biggest creeps. John's identity no longer being secret is a typical sequel problem and most of us probably were curious, how that would be solved without falling behind the thrill established by the predecessor.<br/><br/>SAW II selects an offensive and very successful approach. By having the police ""capture"" John early in the movie, by placing him before our eyes right from the start, it makes clear: this is not about finding the killer, this is not about hunting the killer, this is not about someone puzzling about who the killer may be. Which artful discriminates from the prequel, and at the same time leads to the same old well known question: what is this actually all about? So while Eric tries to figure out the location of his son and the imprisoned people try to find their way out or to the cure, the viewer feels, the viewer knows, that there is more beneath the surface, that there's some master-plan behind this apparently simple setting. And, of course, there is. This way, curiosity returns to a seemingly resolved plot.<br/><br/>SAW focused strongly on it's main characters Lawrence and Adam, partially Detective Tapp, made us like them, want them to succeed. Even when watching it these days, I still have to remind myself, that there will be no happy ending, that this is not the kind of movie where the protagonist hugs his little daughter and beloved-again wife in the end, accompanied by top-lofty music. SAW II does not create such feelings. You wouldn't actually grieve, when almost everyone involved (well, probably except Amanda ;)) would be killed. For several reasons.<br/><br/>Eric, the apparent main character, isn't likable at all, even long before we learn, why exactly we should dislike him. When it comes to the people in the house - we're not really given any chance to get to know them. Of course, there are the ""rather good"" and the ""rather bad"", but we receive almost no background, no personality, no development. Not even everyone's cassettes are played (or even found). The only thing that seems to matter about them, is some mysterious common ground, which furthermore turns out to be the reason they are here. John on his part wins either way. You're never worried about him. You never doubt, that he did see this coming, exactly like it does.<br/><br/>Such approach to character development can be viewed ambivalent. On the one hand - it serves the purpose. Going other ways than in SAW makes the sequel more than a repeating of the old scheme. And, as we learn later in the movie, most of those were really just meaningless pawns in a game, which itself was just one move in a bigger game - which is probably exactly the feeling the viewer should obtain. On the other hand - not having an attachment figure automatically reduces the tension, takes the possible fear factor. You're not afraid of what could be behind a door, if you don't really care about the one who opens it.<br/><br/>However, SAW II isn't much about being scary anyway, even less than SAW. The genre says ""horror"" - but this horror is not meant to scare, it is meant to shock. And shock it does. Not because it shows blood and violence, but by showing pain, by showing suffering - corporal and emotional. It's not just ""you're hit"" and then the one lies on the ground unconscious, covered by soft-focus. It's ""you're hit"" and then it actually hurts.<br/><br/>It shows hopelessness and desperation. It shows people acting in the face of death so proximate, you're almost past the tunnel and the light. The probably most unsettling sequence in SAW was right before Lawrence starts to saw off his foot. Not the sawing itself, but those seconds, when you see him freak out and know, what is about to come, when you sit there and go like ""no, no, please not, please don't do this, don't"" (just like Adam by the way). And afterwards, you see his pale skin, you see him shaking, you know he's bleeding to death. Those are the moments when a movie gets to you, when it makes you feel uneasy.<br/><br/>SAW II is full of such moments. Do you remember Dr. Silberman's short but great appearance in TERMINATOR 3 when he finally sees the terminator and flees in horror? Amanda's awakening in the house reminded me very much of that scene - of course without the humorous and with much greater agony factor. And since one identifies with old-known Amanda right from the start, her displayed desperate fear, that ""oh no, not again!"" feeling directly transfers to the viewer. Gooseflesh, again, when you least suspect it.<br/><br/>And, of course, SAW/II is about twists. So, the last 5-10 minutes turn everything upside down in a literally traditional and surprisingly surprising way. Even having guessed bits and pieces (but mostly discarded them since it seemed just too freaky), I was totally overwhelmed.<br/><br/>A very felicitous sequel and a very good movie. Diagnosis: Sick!"

","It's a movie that scared thousands of people senseless last year. Made on the cheap with two unknown, 20-something guys at the helm, Saw is the kind of horror movie that has re-defined what scary movies are all about An ultra-violent, industrial-strength piece of gore and guts, Saw's brutal, grimy rawness was a monster hit in 2004. From the get-go, the film's twisted storyline, rapid-fire editing and jarring soundtrack pushed audiences' tolerance to the limit. Full of incredibly unsettling images, sounds and action, director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell hit pay dirt with their surprise mega-hit. The film's style -- a gory music video that wouldn't be out of place with industrial musicians like Nine Inch Nails or movies like Seven -- was nothing short of revolutionary. Everything from metal machines that threaten to rip a woman's jaw off, self-mutilation and sawing legs off are now gross-out classic moments. The combination of the film's gallows humor, shock violence and eerie tone brought the big bucks in.<br/><br/>After Saw grossed more than $100 million at the box office last year, it was inevitable a sequel would be released. Saw 2, co-written and directed by newcomer Darren Lynn Bousman, comes out this week. Wan is staying on as producer and Whannell is Saw 2's co-writer.<br/><br/>And oh yes, there will be blood. Lots of blood, according to Bousman.<br/><br/>""Saw was a dark, disturbing film. This film Saw 2 isn't a sugar-coated candy movie. It's an assault on the senses,"" promises Bousman.<br/><br/>""There will be a lot more blood; a lot more violence. It's a bigger game. You have no clue what's going on. We're also going to find out what makes Jigsaw tick."" Jigsaw, the psychopathic serial killer taunting his victims with elaborate games that force people to kill each other, is the main focus of Saw 2. Picking up right after the first film, the significantly larger sequel stars Donnie Wahlberg (The Sixth Sense, Band of Brothers) and a significantly larger cast than the original.<br/><br/>Wahlberg plays Detective Eric Mason, a cop investigating the gory results of a brutal murder. All leads point to Jigsaw -- this time, there's much, much more at stake, including Mason's own son.<br/><br/>Instead of two main characters, there are eight people locked in a room that's gradually spewing out toxic nerve gas. The terrified group all have to figure out how to escape before the nerve gas kills them. Trouble is, Jigsaw has created an even more sadistic house of horrors this time around, full of booby traps and other devices that test the characters' sanity and survival.<br/><br/>Some rumored new gross-out moments? Automated gun fire, metal gougers and other instruments of torture.<br/><br/>Bousman is thrilled to be involved in Saw 2. Based on a script he wrote before Saw was released called The Desperate, Bousman says some of the best compliments he gets from Saw 2 is the fact some people come out of the movie enraged and upset. It is already receiving much attention for its strong violence, gore and horrifying images.<br/><br/>""If you liked the first film, you're going to love the second,"" says Bousman.<br/><br/>The director knows he's got big shoes to fill. But he says he's happy to have had a star like Wahlberg in his film -- a cast addition that gives the film a huge boost.<br/><br/>Bousman says he went out and rented Band of Brothers before filming began for Saw 2 and was hugely impressed with Wahlberg's performance: ""I was just blown away. He has this presence about him."" Bousman also says he's lucky to have had such a supportive studio like Lion's Gate backing him. The studio is known for pushing the envelope with movies, distributing other grisly cult hits like House of 1000 Corpses.<br/><br/>""Lion's Gate was amazing. They were so supportive,"" he says.<br/><br/>Bousman's future looks especially bright. After the huge success of Saw, he's crossing his fingers the sequel hits it big too at the box office.<br/><br/>""The most difficult part is living up to the first film. There were no expectations with The Desperate. This isn't the case with Saw 2. There are huge Web armies that loved Saw. There are higher expectations with Saw 2,"" he adds. The film gets two thumbs up. Okay, fingers."

","there's too explicit violence, but the end is fantastic!!!!!!in the first part the characters don't play enough and I find it not good, and the director show too violence, that in the first there isn't!!! I think that the first is better because you are shock for the violence, but it doesn't show nothing, you imagine what kind happen!! but the last ten minute are fantastic because the film change the card and you can exit from the cinema that you continue to think about the movie and about the bad.

Although it did have many parts where I wanted to leave to go throw up. But the story plot was so good I couldn't leave my seat. It had many twists and turns in the plot, and it was so carefully written I would have never guessed what was going to happen next. The scenery was also pretty good. The director choose his background nicely and his actors as well. Everyone did their part to make the movie that extra better. So if you love scary movies, this one is gor you!"

","I have to say that lots of scary/horror movies are very strange. And when I say that I refer to the fact that they don't have a good plot. The movie starts nice, some action, some people doing something and after that everybody kills everybody. And I don't like the way it loses the most important point: the plot! That is crucial to really scare you. Something has to put your mind to work cause seeing a lot of blood is not the secret. ""Saw II"" has the ingredient of the good scary movie. It makes you say ""Oh, my God!"". And, like the first one (Saw), doesn't let you see too much of what will happen next. That is a good thing because saying at the end: ""Oh, yeah, I've seen it coming"" just makes you hate it. Good movie for the passionates, bad movie for the faint of heart."

","In a general sense, it's not uncommon for a sequel to take a swan dive head first into the floor (Cruel Intentions 2 as a prime example), so I have to admit that I was surprised with this film.<br/><br/>It seems the larger budget didn't take away from the ""grungy"" feel I saw in Saw 1, which was great for continuity alone. Having said that, the original story line is carried further throughout this film and developed into something a little meatier. Initially you could be mistaken and think you were watching another run of Lethal Weapon...fortunately not!<br/><br/>The cast was much larger this time around, as did the range of the sets and props used. And by props I mean booby-traps.<br/><br/>A fair share of blood and gore might keep you cringing a little, but I found it to be quite realistic which was pleasing in a weird kind of way.

","A good year ago my friend made me watch the first one on DVD and I was pinned to the bed during the whole movie, especially with the surprising end !

To watch terrified friends sitting next to you, buried in there ""protecting coats""... To really have the SAW Experience !<br/><br/>Did it disappoint ? No. The film started off with an EYE-catching opening scene, revealing that ""no, I'm not a serial killer, they do it to themselves"" evil plans master Jigsaw is still alive and kicking !<br/><br/>Thanks to a hint left in the video message of Jigsaw's first new victim, police are able to track him down.

Not yet, shockingly our cancer man was expecting the police and oh yeah, he's got something planned for them. To sum up : the life of several people, stuck in a mystery house, depends on the good behaviour of Officer Tough Guy, starting off a series of actions leading to a yet again shocking end.<br/><br/>Saw II was as scaring as the first one, at times disgustingly grosse, over the top, but that's how we like it.

","Saw2 still is one of my favorites, although it will never touch the flabbergasting plot-end of the first movie... And it does not have to...(what am I saying? I ended flabbergasted again, I suppose...) This is a different plot: a view inside the mastermind's kitchen... and it will not bring you any closer to what's REALLY going on! Even up-close and personal you'll find yourself TRICKED by the master... Things that cannot be constructed better, can -luckely enough- be constructed again! Hope the guy doesn't die of cancer before his third movie... I must say that the after-effect of SAW2 is the same as in SAW: in the hours following after you finished the movie things pop up and you'll see clues which I will not mention here. What a great script these people wrote, almost like a musical piece of Bach: you feel tired when finished! Such an intelligent form of weaving and tricks of the mind...

The last minute revelation that Amanda was the killer shocked me. Also the plot was revealed at an excellent pace so the movie wasn't too slow or fast. However i don't' t think that the cops son being in the safe for about six hours seemed a little strange. The directing was excellent. The director of Saw 2 is also directing Final Destination 3. So if you enjoy this you'll enjoy that. I felt that the props were believable. I also felt the challenges really tested the characters will to live.

"ab-2","5","0","1","20 December 2005"," Saw II: Another Mediocre Sequel
","Sequels, especially to horror films, seem to pop up every year. Many are unnecessary, like the Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequels. It is hard to judge these films on their own merits, especially while comparing them to the film they follow. Saw II is a very uneven film with many highlights, but also many downfalls.<br/><br/>For those who are not familiar with the plot of Saw, it is about a serial killer who puts his victims in life and death situations. For example, a character will wake up chained to a pipe and be forced to kill the person who is also chained across from him if he wants to live. If he does not commit the act within a certain timeframe, both of them will die.<br/><br/>In this sequel, Detective Eric Mason (Donnie Wahlberg) finds out his delinquent son is one of the few unlucky people forced to use their intellect and cooperation in a booby-trapped house. The catch is that all the victims have inhaled a nerve gas that will kill them within a few hours if they don't escape. Mason has to cooperate and play Jigsaw's ""game"" if he ever wants to see his son again.<br/><br/>The movie works well within the conventions of the horror genre. It has the violence and murders that the audience expects from horror films. The unique deathtraps in this movie will, doubtlessly satisfy gore-hungry fans.<br/><br/>The acting is also quite impressive for a horror film. All the actors seem to understand the parts they play and play them with great realism and human emotion. Wahlberg is believable as a detective who can't balance his work and troubled life. He depicts the pain of a father whose life seems to be at its worst. Tobin Bell is very creepy as Jigsaw. From his cold stares to his devious smile, this man, who considers himself a prophet, is quite obviously a psychopath and finds pleasure in seeing others fight for their lives.<br/><br/>The actor who is the most impressive out of the ensemble of victims in Jigsaw's game is Franky G, who plays a Puerto Rican drug dealer. The fact that the actor, who has a very macho physique and demeanor, plays him with such depravity and cowardliness lends a realistic desperation to the character: the scene where this is most evident is when he has to find a key in a pit that is filled with syringes in less than two minutes. Instead of going in himself, he throws a woman, who is a part of this group of victims, in without any thought.<br/><br/>The attempt of the director, Darren Bousman, and cinematographer, David Armstrong, at giving the film a low-budget look and feel should be applauded. While it is quite obvious that this movie had quite a hefty budget behind it (unlike the first film) the attempt comes with clear artistic intentions.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not everything about this movie is milk and cookies. Quite a few aspects of the script are very poorly written. A few times, the technique of scaring through a ""jump out of the closet"" is used, which is quite annoying and gains absolutely nothing in terms of scares.<br/><br/>Another terrible aspect of this film is the scriptwriters' decision to reveal the killer, Jigsaw, so early in the movie and spoon feed the audience his motives.<br/><br/>What made him such a great character in the first film was the fact that the audience barely knew anything about him. In this movie, his motives are explained so clearly that it completely ruins what Jigsaw was all about. Imagine if Alfred Hitchcock had revealed Mrs. Bates in Psycho. Would the movie be worth watching? This unfortunate little detail takes away so much from the movie. It doesn't ruin it, but it is a detraction. He becomes a caricature instead of a character.<br/><br/>What's worse is the ""twist"" (if one could call it that) at the end of the movie. It just does not fit Jigsaw's profile. Without giving too much away, the end is completely unrealistic and dumb and contradicts the first movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to decide who should see Saw II. While the film is clearly for fans of the horror genre, it should be noted that this movie does not even come close to the psychological terror the original achieved so well.<br/><br/>This movie is, without question, for people who enjoy seeing lots of blood and violence and are perhaps even turned on by it.<br/><br/>For those who really loved the first one, it's hardly worth shelling out hard-earned cash to see the sequel. Perhaps these fans should instead wait for next Halloween and rent it.<br/><br/>Final Grade: C"
"RobZombie01930","8","0","1","19 December 2005"," A very gritty, violent, disgusting, brutal........ masterpiece?
","Plot: The Jigsaw killer returns, this time even more bad ass and sick than before. He decides to set up a few people inside a house, each room with a specific trap for a specific person. The people inside must find a way out, or the poisonous gas being put inside the room will kill them. Along the way, they must also find the antidotes to the poison in their lungs. Meanwhile, Detective Matthews must deal with the finally ""caught"" Jigsaw killer, is he wants his son to stay alive. Problem is, his son is in the house with all the traps, and Detective Matthews is losing his cool.<br/><br/>Review: Pretty damn good. The plot itself is decent, but if done the right way can be really really good. And, it is. The plot develops nicely, giving twists and turns along the way, and watching both sides of the situation became fascinating, quickly. I found myself listening intently almost the whole time, and the other times, I found myself squirming uncomfortably as the gorgeous gore brought itself out on screen. Which, of course, I loved. <br/><br/>The Characters, sadly, are under-developed, and really don't go anywhere, aside from being shot, stabbed, gassed, burned, cut, and smashed. They're also very cliché' characters we've all seen before, and, sadly, they seem rather flat. The character Xavien is way too quick to go crazy-psycho-killer, and it almost made me roll my eyes. The writer's seemed too quick to get on with the horror/gore, and decided not to let us know nor care about the characters, but rather watch them die in grisly ways. This, of course, is entirely different than in the original Saw, where we got to know the characters incredibly well. If it gave us a bit more time to get to know the characters, it would be better. Besides, we got some good ol' horror right from the beginning, that let me tell you, made me smirk evilly, at the same time squirm uncomfortably. I loved it. <br/><br/>Anywho, the editing directing and all that good stuff was done rather nicely. The director did a great job at giving a grimy sadistic feel to the film ,and I just love that. The editing was well done during the horrific situation sequences, but some times seemed a bit slow, or a bit too fast at other times. The cinematography was very stylized, like the original Saw, which I just love. It, also, gives a very different feel to the movie than you get with most others. <br/><br/>As for what we see in the movie, be prepared to close your eyes, clench your fists, and not feel in the mood to make-out (which, for me especially, is very hard to do :P ) and to squirm uncomfortably through-out 3/4 of the movie. Also, look forward to, not only one, but TWO twists through-out the movie. It's a pretty good shocker!<br/><br/>Overall I guess, to be fair, I must give it a 8/10 (the original got a big fat 9.5) because of the few issues it had, such as the sometimes poor editing, the rushed feeling of the beginning, and the cliché' unexplored characters. It also, as per usual, does not live up to the original, but is still pretty damn sweet. <br/><br/>Things to Beware: 1. Not everyone can act :\ 2. Cliché' characters 3. Some poor editing 4. Squirmy uncomfortable feeling No making out :P<br/><br/>Things to Look Forward to: 1. Squirmy uncomfortable feeling (if you like that) 2. Gruesome deaths 3. Nice twist at the end 4. A really really really really awesome, best scene of the movie opening sequence 5. Pretty damn good directing<br/><br/>OVERALL: 8.6/10"

I found this movie, and the first, to be quite refreshing. Something new, exciting, and thought provoking. The idea that the bad guy doesn't actually kill his victims himself, and his motive behind the torcher is something to make anyone stop and think. Left open for a trilogy, which I always like anticipation. I'd like to Amanda mess something up in the next one and be killed and finally end the jigsaw killings, but who knows.

"raven_fire47","8","0","1","19 December 2005"," Same experience as the original
","Okay, people for those of you who are particularly familiar with recent horror movies I think we can all agree that one of the best ones to catch our eyes in recent years will be Saw. Considering the decline of horror movies in recent years its refreshing to see a new idea thrown on the table that breathes new life into a dying genre. What worries me is the way it does so. What Saw basically did was take up the violence level and take it up three notches. One more notch and you'd be watching a snuff film. Now truthfully I think we should all be worried about the fact that audiences are becoming so desensitized that filmmakers have to become more brutal to get any impact.<br/><br/>Now I'm not here to blam Saw, lord knows it is still a favourite movie of mine. If Saw didn't incorporate a good story with some good twists and some good characters in its mix of blood and pain, I would give it the biggest blam ever. Thank god it does have all of the above, thus making Saw one of the better if not best horror movies of recent years. <br/><br/>But does the sequel live up to the first one? Again I'm thankful to say it does.<br/><br/>Usually the word ""sequel"" is enough to put fear into the hearts of many film buffs. I'm still trying to get over the disappointment of Matrix Reloaded which in the matter of 3 hours killed of my 4 year love of the Matrix, not to mention I still cringe when I hear ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" *cringes*. <br/><br/>Saw 2 gladly lives up to the hype and the expectation of Saw. I can't say it is at all an improvement but what you are looking at is more of the same. Everything from the gritty atmosphere, to the downright macabre deaths, to the twists and turns in the plot are those that you would expect from the original. <br/><br/>I'm too tired to keep writing this review all I can say is that, this is one movie that lives to its hype. On the downside some of the acting sucks, but you'd be so caught up in the gruesome and unrelenting action that there's a good chance you wont care too much."

","Besides amazing, I'm not sure how to explain this masterpiece. If you have seen the first Saw, you know that it just throws itself into the film and there isn't that much story. Well, the second film also throws itself into the gore, but actually evolves into a great story that also shows us a little about Jigsaws past. We learn why Jigsaw (John) does what he does, allows people to play games of life that usually end for the worse.<br/><br/>Saw 2 isn't necessarily gorier that the first, but there are a few scenes that make you cringe at the sight of it (namely the needle pit). The ending to this film goes down as one of the best endings ever in cinematic history. It leaves it open for a third Saw that I can't wait for (due out October 27, 2006).

"mlnchly2","9","0","1","17 December 2005"," My Thumb is Up.
","I watched Saw II a while ago, but I never got around to putting my two cents until now.<br/><br/>I rented the first Saw film, and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. REALLY enjoyed it. Especially compared to other horror films, it was very good-It not only put people in frightening situations, which is what horror movies have to do, but also made the audience think. It stayed away from ""cheap scares,"" and instead went for raw suspense.<br/><br/>The second one, however, was just as good. I had no idea what to think going into it, but I knew that it would either be a very good sequel or a very bad sequel-it just had that sort of vibe about it.<br/><br/>I was thrilled to find that it was the former.<br/><br/>Many people have watched the movie and spent too much time thinking about the gore to realize that this movie actually is an intelligent one. Yes, they see that Jigsaw is one smart cookie even while being completely bonkers, but they don't see that the movie itself is very smart.<br/><br/>Far too many viewers see the house and immediately jump to the conclusion that the people in it are the main characters. The main characters in this film are Mathews and Jigsaw. Period. The characters in the house are merely props for the big idea, which is the ""game"" that Mathews is playing. In the first movie, Adam and Laurence were the main characters playing their game. The other victims seemed to be only for background, but they proved to be important in their own light. The same thing goes for the second, but the other victims are more emphasized. If you think that the house guests are the main characters after watching the movie, you need to watch it again.<br/><br/>The movie's twists were all very intriguing, even while Amanda being in on it all seemed a bit far-fetched.<br/><br/>Finally, a lot of people speak badly of the violence. Yes, this movie is very gory. Seemingly gratuitous at times. The fact is, however, gore is edgy. Edgy is suspenseful. Suspenseful is thrilling. This movie is a thriller. Get over it.<br/><br/>Well...that's all I have to say. If you disagree, well, that's none of my business anyway."
"MasterDebator5","7","0","1","10 December 2005"," The tag line boasts, 'Oh yes, there will be blood,' and oh yes, there was
","Saw II<br/><br/>Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman.<br/><br/>Starring Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell.<br/><br/>With a troubled son, a pending divorce, and a serial killer who asks for him by name, Detective Eric Mathews (Wahlberg, ""Band of Brothers"", ""Dreamcatcher"") is having a rough time. Matters only worsen when the aforementioned serial killer (a frighteningly matter-of-fact Tobin Bell) begins his new ""game."" The murderer, dubbed Jigsaw by the media, sticks several ex-con stereotypes in a booby-trapped house and watches the chaos ensue from his hideout. Mathews discovers Jigsaw's lair, and takes his team to bring the maniac to justice. When the detective discovers his son is one of the unlucky few inside the house, the case becomes a blurred line between Mathews' personal and professional interests.<br/><br/>With the departure of director James Wan (who helmed the first film), Darren Lynn Bousman, a relative unknown, fastens himself into the blood-encrusted shackles. Bousman does not stray far from the formula used by Wan in the original: quick cuts in times of panic, dizzying camera angles, overall confusion.<br/><br/>The tag line boasts, ""Oh yes, there will be blood,"" and oh yes, there was. ""Saw II"" requires from its viewers a high tolerance of gore. Knowing that no one can argue that it is a tame affair, the filmmakers try a little too hard to make ""Saw II"" more than it is. Much like ""Saw"", the film tries to cram as much guts as it can fit down the audiences' throats while also leaving them with something to think about when the credits begin to roll. Do Jigsaw's subjects deserve to live if they cannot make the necessary sacrifices? Does Detective Mathews' history of police brutality justify his son's torment? These are interesting questions, but are ultimately irrelevant. The filmmakers are more concerned with burning people alive or having them crawl through hypodermic needles than focusing on why any of it happens at all.<br/><br/>""Saw II"" is an above average horror movie, at best. It is memorable only to the fans that can stomach the blood and guts genre that is horror. It'll certainly keep audiences on the edge of their seat, but in the end it falls in line with typical frightful fare. Most enjoyable to watch with friends late at night, just make sure you don't have to walk home alone.<br/><br/>Final Grade: C+"

"amber-117","8","0","1","4 December 2005"," good film yet some plot holes
","After seeing 'Saw 2' (2005) I came out from the cinema thinking it was the best horror movie I had ever seen. It contained everything I liked about the horror genre in it; scary psycho killer, psychological horror, riddles and of course a major twist at the end. <br/><br/>However I did find that a lot of the riddles in the film I had already guessed the answer to, which was probably because I had seen the first 'Saw' so was expecting them. <br/><br/>This leads me to believe that there possibly should not have been a sequel. It was a very good plot and I did think it was worth seeing, but it wasn't as fast paced as I would have expected it to be or liked it to be. <br/><br/>I thought the acting was exceptional and the camera angles throughout really helped to emphasise the horror. This was best shown when the girl fell in the pit of needles it went to an aerial view, which showed her expression, and her body surrounded by the needles. <br/><br/>Unfortunately I did notice a few plot holes. How did Xavier know which order to put the number combination in the safe? And the fact that Obi gets the syringe from the oven for someone else should have let him out as he has done his 'penance' by not being selfish yet he still burned alive? <br/><br/>Perhaps I am just thinking about it too much as the friend who I saw it with did not notice these. Judging from her reaction at some parts in during the film I can safely say it achieved a scream. until 'Saw 2' i had never bothered to look around at the audience but its actually really interesting looking at how people react. The most effective scenes at getting a reaction were those which preyed on people's general fears, such as needles and fire and lots of blood, especially when it slowly dribbled down someone's arms.<br/><br/>In conclusion I did feel that this was a great horror film yet it had too much to live up to as the first 'Saw' was so shocking. The shock effect and the art of the riddles did not impress a second time round."

","'Saw' is one of those movies that makes you want to run off and jot down a plot for your own Horror/Thriller story. The thriller factor is exceeded only by the originality and that feeling of 'what-will-happen-next?' This movie will keep you guessing until the very end, where the final twists unfold and will truly make your jaw drop.<br/><br/>'Saw' and 'Saw 2' are based around mental torture games performed by a serial killer known as Jigsaw. Jigsaw is not as sick as he is made out to be, though, as these torturous games are targeted at people who take life for granted. In the first of the 2 films, two men are chained to pipes in a bathroom in a seemingly empty lair. Between them is a dead body, and they have to find clues and go to hell and back to figure out how to get the hell out of there. What happens in the end? Well, if you are wondering that, why in the hell are you already looking at the sequel! <br/><br/>Saw 2 is more gruesome and mysterious than ever, with a whole bunch of new victims in the palm of Jigsaw's hand. Well, not exactly all are new, a victim from the first Saw is part of the group also, and is familiar with what is happening. But not everything is what it seems in this fantastic sequel to the thriller that is 'Saw', want to find out?

","Jigsaw's idea was to make people appreciate their life & to not waste it etc. However he failed to show this to the people in the house as all but one dies. This is not a message that can go out to the public like the serial killer (Kevin Spacy) does in the movie ""Seven"". Also Jigsaw is a complete hypocrite since he doesn't appreciate his own life by spending the last few years he has left making others' a misery. For whatever reason the traps were too hard to solve in time so instead of being an obstacle to overcome and appreciate & possibly from his angle gain living disciples in recognition for being a good teacher, he fails again by giving the victims self destructive alternatives to save their life. It just made me apathetic watching it as there wasn't any wins to motivate any of them to try & survive like in the movie ""Cube"". I didn't like how the Detective Mathews leaves Jigsaw in the car still alive whilst he goes off to be trapped like ""the Vanishing"". That was so obvious that was going to happen. I did however like how the cops allowed Detective Mathews to beat up on Jigsaw to get answers which is how we should treat these animals. Give them a taste of their own medicine. They don't seem to like that."

","I enjoyed the original Saw for its ability to build an atmosphere of discomfort and hold it for the length of the film. It was creative and disturbing and just a really fun horror film, and Jigsaw -- the villain -- was one of the most refreshing horror villains to come along in a long time.<br/><br/>Saw II does not quite live up to its predecessor in that it leaves too many plot holes and -- for the most part -- ends up resorting to having its characters just walk around endlessly for much of the film. Certain characters seem to hold no purpose and some questions are left completely unanswered, such as the motivations of some of the victims locked in the house by Jigsaw.<br/><br/>As well, some of the traps set up in the house are so obvious that the effectiveness fails. You are left in the same position as most bad horror films where you ask yourself of the main characters, ""Why are they doing that?""<br/><br/>However, even with all of these shortcomings, the film is a fun little picture to watch. Like the original, the setup of the film is unique and thus it is nice to see something in a horror film that is more than just more of the same.

"DICK STEEL","9","0","1","26 November 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Saw II
","I'm such a fan of the original - I like blood and gore, and Saw had one of the more intriguing and sick stories around, which saw the introduction of an original villain in recent memory, Jigsaw. What worked in the first film was the strange premise of 2 seemingly unrelated characters being put in a life and death situation, forced to compromise or die together. Also, the twist at the end was oh-so-nicely done, that it just begs for a sequel to be made.<br/><br/>But I was initially skeptical at how a sequel could top the original Saw. Sure, Jigsaw returns, but are we expecting more of his sick games to beef up the sequel, leading it predictably to more of the same? Surprisingly, it doesn't. Now, you have a group of 8 persons stuck in an unknown booby-trapped building in which they have to escape from. Needless to say, Jigsaw has the entire plan rigged right from the beginning, except that the audience and the players don't know how, or why. It's reasonable to say that you'll be expecting characters to die one-by-one, in bloody manner (so promised the tagline) befitting the original.<br/><br/>While Jigsaw was mostly heard and not seen in the first movie, here, he's seen and heard in full glory. Donnie Wahlberg plays detective Eric Matthews, who leads his partner Kerry (Dina Meyer) and a group of SWAT to take down Jigsaw. Playing a psychological game with Eric, Jigsaw taunts him while explaining to the audience a little bit of his own background, which tied to elements from Saw.<br/><br/>Fans of the original will squeal with delight when these tiebacks, settings and even a character make an appearance in the sequel. It links the two movies together very nicely, and I wonder why the local distributors didn't have a back to back screening this time, like what they did for Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Alas, the version shown here, despite its NC-16 rating, is a watered down version. Obtaining a decent box office returns would have ruled out the M18 or R21 cut. However, don't let this minor nitty gritty spoil your fun.<br/><br/>At times, this movie hums along and you find predictable elements (at least I thought it was under threat of becoming a so-so mediocre sequel), but the last 10 minutes will leave you at the edge of your seat, and deliver when you least expected it, applying a signature that says ""Yes, this is a Saw movie"". Another sequel, if there is any, will be in my list of must-watch."

"UTAnthony80","4","0","1","25 November 2005"," This movie does not teach anyone the value of life
","I'll begin my comment with a bias of mine--I am biased against a movie that leaves a disgusting, grimy feeling on me when I head toward my car having seen it. I'm no movie buff, but I consider a movie good if it consists of various elements of entertainment. A good plot, mixed with some light and heavy moments, depending on what sort of movie it is. Likable characters--always a plus. Overall, a balance which is hard to describe yet easy to recognize. So when I see a movie with no clear protagonist, not one moment of levity, and despicable characters all around, I'm apt to dislike it. The aim of this movie was to invoke two hours of uneasiness and revulsion. I'd say the entertainment value of this movie would be equivalent to staring at fatal accident victims or beheading videos. But at least there's some feeling of separation when it comes to the latter. Movies are different. They're designed to immerse its audience. Big Fish, now that's a great movie. Anyway, my point is give me something to work with, something I can use. Not two hours of filth. To the movie's credit however it did achieve it's aim. It did invoke tension. But where is the release? I suppose the release is when you realize it was just a movie. Now, you see, I hate that. If I'm going to experience something, I would at least like to take something positive out of it. The only positive part was narrowing in on what I don't like. And the cliché of appreciating life. Make every moment count. Not making every moment count is a part of life. Should people be, ""Oh my God, I'm going to die at this specific time. What do I do? I'm so scared!"" Or should people rather be, ""I now know I have two hours to live. I'd rather spend the next two hours calm and collected and then move on to what's next."" And anyway, Carpe diem means ""pluck the day"" not ""seize"" it. Make the best of opportunities given to you, not go on this ridiculous and constant high. Perhaps part of appreciating life is knowing when not to take it so seriously, because once you start taking life so seriously all the time, it ceases to become your life but contingent on ultimately useless and extraneous parts of a relative reality, which is the message this movie pushes. If someone really wishes to teach people to appreciate life, a good place to start is to teach them to appreciate death. That's the amazing part. Out of all the billions of lifeforms there are, you're just one of them, and like all the rest, you're part of the same cycle. And to just start there and listen to how quiet it is is more enlightening than any Hollywood pedagogy, especially the specious dogma Saw II prattles. And that's why I dislike Saw II and would not recommend it."

","I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, ""What? There's no way in hell that could've happened."" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that ""Jigsaw"" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.<br/><br/>The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.<br/><br/>Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.<br/><br/>Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't. But, hey, if you like that sort of thing, I'd recommend seeing it."

","Eight people, several rooms and again the incapable police. Jigsaw again came out with a plan and this time he decided to put eight people into a house with several doors (or so-to-say rooms). One of these strangers is to us well-known Amanda, who was the only one to survive Jigsaw's trap. Eventually they find out that they are all connected to each other somehow  they were all arrested by Det. Eric Matthews (played by Donnie Wahlberg), with the exception of Daniel who was his son.<br/><br/>On the other end we have E. Matthews and S.W.A.T. who broke into Jigsaw's place. Jigsaw, or as he introduced himself as John, wanted to talk to Matthews alone. On his opinion, he doesn't appreciate his son's life, so I guess that's the reason enough to threat Daniel's life. Anyways, John has changed so much since the last time we saw him in Saw, his face just wasn't the same, it was poor, it grew thin. Now I know that he has a cancer but I wouldn't say that they changed a person so much only because of that to shoot a movie. We can even see in flash-back, when he went to the doctor to find out that he was dying, he looked the same as in Saw II, not as in Saw. Now that's strange. And it just didn't seem believable that such an old man with a cancer, barely breathing, barely moving, would be able to come out with and ""direct"" such a brilliant game.<br/><br/>Well, back to those eight people who were reducing themselves one by one. The point of the game was as usual, to stay alive. Their task was to find an antidote (they were breathing in a deadly nerve agent) as soon as possible  they've gotten only 2 hours left.<br/><br/>In the mean time, Det. E. Matthews has almost beaten Jigsaw to death. Yes, good work, that's the way the police works. And again Jigsaw tricked them, again he was smarter than them  he won again. Matthews imposed upon the things that Jigsaw said, he was led into a wrong house by Jigsaw. He was looking for his son but has found himself in the wrong place. The whole time Daniel was there in the Jigsaw's place. This Jigsaw really likes to play games till the end  with cops too. And those tape-recordings that we see playing on computers in his room  they weren't even live. Kind of predictable, when he says to Det. Matthews not to worry about his son, that he's in a safe and secure state. John tricked the police again but this time he wasn't alone. He had a little helper, someone who was a former drug-addict. Oh, yes, his helper was Amanda herself. John has been her teacher and he's been giving her lessons of so-called life and appreciations of life. And since he's been dying, Amanda decided to carry on his work.<br/><br/>I must admit I knew about the ending all along because it was a rumor since the beginning. But even if I didn't know that, I wouldn't consider that being a twist. They so wanted to approach this movie to its original that they failed in inventing something new and so they've really moved from what Saw represented.<br/><br/>This movie lacks James Wan (the director of Saw) and of course Leigh Whannell as an actor (co-writer of screenplay). It basically lacks all the benefits that movie Saw had. I'd give a movie 7 stars because I can't just overlook Jigsaw's amazing and well-directed game.<br/><br/>7/10"

His character was the best thing about the movie. He's a real sinister, twisted guy, but he's one of those villains who's just so good at what he does that it's awesome. But the goods stop there. First off, the cast was terrible in this one (except for Jigsaw, of course). Very few of the actors could really act or make their characters convincing at all. I ESPECIALLY hate that big bulky guy Xavier. That character was one of the biggest morons in a horror movie that I've ever seen. Jigsaw is such a clever, crafty killer, he would have never picked such a clumsy fool for a victim like this guy. Xavier is no match for Jigsaw in the slightest bit, and you'd like to think Jigsaw would have found watching this guy completely boring. There's NO way this guy could survive Jigsaw's genius. Two, the elaborate and huge games in this one were totally unreal. I mean you'd have to have a legion of murdering psychopaths to pull off the stuff Jigsaw was doing in this one. That was kind of ridiculous. Finally, the twist at the end was AWFUL. Not looking forward to Saw III at all. Sorry guys. This one's just not that great. Okay, but not that great."

The camera was seizure inducing and erratic, detracting from the grossness. Half of the time it was hard to understand what was going on.<br/><br/>Now to the story where the movie falls apart. This is quite possibly one of the most predictable movies I have seen.

","Jigsaw (Tobin Bell ) is a psycho who makes good on his promise - ""There will be blood."" If inventive sadism is your idea of a fun night at the movies, ""Saw II"" delivers ninety minutes of relentless screw-tightening shocks.<br/><br/>In spite of its nonsensical conclusion James Wan's ""Saw"" was a engagingly grisly, brutally graphic thrill ride that delivered box office gold. With a twenty-five day shooting schedule forcing inventiveness and a tad more logic thrown into the mix, ""Saw II"" is a rarity among sequels: it's as good as the original. Instead of two characters and a corpse, we now have eight tortured victims united by one common bond.<br/><br/>Bad cop Mark Wahlberg can't seem to reign in his teenage son (Frankie Munoz substitute Erik Knudsen) who seems well on his way to a guest spot on ""America's Most Wanted."" That's all the impetus Jigsaw, a scientist when it comes to preying upon the weakness of his victims, needs to set the sequel's mechanics in motion. ""Saw II' plays a clever twist on the original by placing the hero and villain, instead of the two victims, in one room. With a handful of TV monitors broadcasting closed-circuit coverage of the action, Jigsaw delights in watching the detective squirm.<br/><br/>The gut-churning parade kicks off with a pre-credit sequence in which the key to freedom is surgically implanted in the eye of it's victim. Two choices: either pull a Bunuel and slice wide your retina or suffer the fate of a Mario Bava-inspired spiked black mask timed to turn its victim's head into a colander. A pit of hypodermic needles, gallons of coughed-up blood and thoughts on serial killers and their quest for immortality suggest a game of ""Clue"" gone terribly wrong.<br/><br/>Casting ""Saw's"" Shawnee Smith, the only survivor of Jigsaw's game, in a key role proves that a sequel was never far from the mind of the franchise's creator. Instead of limiting the gore to one room, ""Saw II' gives us an entire tenement in which to splatter about. Nerve gas, the film references the terrorist attacks on the Tokyo subway, is being pumped into the vents and Jigsawagrees to unlock the door one hour after the poison takes full effect.<br/><br/>With the exception of Tobin Bell, the rest of the actors were cast according to type. As the soft-spoken ringleader of carnage, Bell provides the prerequisite of every good horror yarn: a truly despicable antagonist. Quiet revelations of his gut-shot illness will have you cheering on the cancer.<br/><br/>It should come as no surprise that only a few characters live to see the final fade out and credit the filmmakers with devising several new sado-masochistic kinks. Not content to simply rearrange the narrative order of its predecessor, ""Saw II"" will not disappoint fans of the original."

I kind of knew this would be a ""teen slasher"" type movie and I was kinda right.<br/><br/>In the first Saw, it was so great because the main focus was on just two guys, and because most of the movie focuses on them, you got to learn lot about them both and see how the characters develop. In Saw 2 I barely know anything about the characters, one guy gets killed after he says about 3 lines. In the first Saw it was SO much more captivating, with both the story of the two guys in the room, the detectives on the outside world, and flashbacks, it created a bloody awesome movie, and thats why its my favorite.<br/><br/>Also in Saw 2, there were only about 3 cool deaths, the guy at the start,Obiin the furnace, and the chick with her wrists, the rest were either a guy killing another guy or something else.<br/><br/>Not enough happened in this movie, most of it was just the people trying to find a way out of the house. A lot of the time they were all intoxicated by the nerve gas and were stumbling around like idiots.<br/><br/>They should never have made this movie, the first Saw was brilliant in ever way and I give it 10/10, but making a sequel was poor especially with the simple idea of just having people in a house, getting killed in traps.<br/><br/>The fact that Saw was made by Leigh Whanell and James Wan, who are both Melbourne, Australia blokes, means a lot to me, as Melbourne is my home and to have such a damn awesome film come from them is awesome, especially with Australian talent just starting to emerge.<br/><br/>Saw 2 - basically not enough story line, not enough character development, not enough cool deaths and was not very scary in a psychological way, as was the first one.<br/><br/>Please give me your feedback on your opinions :)"

","While SmartTALX was a tad harsh in his assessment, it's still valid. But more importantly it is the whispered fragments of dialog that ""John"" or ""Jigsaw"" gives that do add some feature redeeming quality to this film. His flashbacks to the knowledge of his impending death, and the savor it adds to life, and the instinct of survival that he notes is lost amongst the common man. All of these fragments DO make a cohesive whole. I can say, without spoiling anything, that there is an opportunity for a ""Saw 3"". If some of the plot work tightens up, as SmartTALX suggest, with some fleshing out of this 'motivation' that John has this franchise will make the 3rd installment the best. It's well worth watching, for the essence of survival it hints at, not for the mechanistic methods of DEATH Jigsaw engineers for the violent prurience of the baser viewer."

","Saw II i thought was definitely a good horror movie but probably would have been better if it didn't have to follow the original Saw. I could definitely tell that it was a different director, everything about the movie was different. Unfortunately though, the movie constantly seemed like it was trying too hard to live up to it's prequel. It wasn't as creative, as suspenseful or as shocking. Every twist and turn seemed mediocre at best. Although, that may be unfair since everyone who had seen Saw I had already been exposed to all of these gruesome and horrific plot twists, and it is of course extremely difficult to top that.<br/><br/>I went into this movie expecting to be scared out of my mind seeing as how after the first one I couldn't sleep without my light on for weeks after. But i found instead that although I was mildly scared, it wasn't to the point where i was constantly checking my backseat to see if someone had snuck in. Saw II is a good horror movie on its own, but a bit of a disappointment in comparison to Saw I."

"FMACDONALD","8","0","1","7 November 2005"," Oh Yes There Is Blood...Lot's and Lots of Blood
","Saw II is not a movie for everyone. I mean you have to really like horror films to enjoy this flick. Hell even die hard horror fans might not like it because unlike the usual low budget horror films with a deformed man under a mask who doesn't speak at all, moves at a snail's pace and still manages to catch up to his victims, Saw II is a thinking man's horror film and I know horror fans hate to think. Saw II is a rarity. It's a sequel that is not better than the original but damn good. i think what makes these films so good is the originality in the serial killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). Jigsaw isn't a larger than life superhuman deformed man behind a mask. He's a cancer patient that kidnaps his victims and plays games with them. Unlike Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger, Michael Myers, Leatherface and Pinhead Jigsaw gives his victims a chance at survival, although it's a slimmer than slim chance. Jigsaw picks the scum of society for his victims. Drug dealers, drug addicts, hookers, etc., etc. basically people that society wouldn't miss. These are people that have done wrong in life and Jigsaw wants to show them the error of their ways. Of course this doesn't mean that what he does is justified, it's just what makes him different. Unlike the first film which had two victims Saw II has five kidnappee's all locked in an abandoned house. One of the victims is a kid named Daniel (Eric Knudsen) who is the son of police detective Eric Matthews (Cambridge's own Donnie Wahalberg, yes the same Wahlberg who is the older brother of Mark and danced on stage as a member of New Kids On The Block). Now Det. Matthews has two hours to save his son who has been notified via a cassette player, as all Jigsaw's victims, that the captives have been breathing in a deadly nerve toxin. However somewhere in the house they are being held in is the antidote. If they can find the antidote they will be alive when the doors open in three hours. if they can't they'll all be dead in two. Now Det. Matthews has to work one on one with Jigsaw or he never see's his delinquent son alive again. Saw II is creepy on a level unlike most slasher films, it could happen. There is a ton of sick people in this world and if someone like this Jigsaw guy exits I'm glad I don't know about it. Saw II like the first one had a twist I never saw coming, which is what I like about it. The victims are your typical victims. There's the sensible one Jonas (Glenn Plummer), the innocent one Laura (Beverly Mitchell), the annoying one Addison (Emmanuelle Vaugier), the expert Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the jerk who you can't wait to see bumped off Xavier (Fraky G, I hate when actors use dumb names like that) plus the Detective's son Daniel. However the typical horror victims aside Saw II is great. If you like horror films and are begging for something different, something the genre has only done with House Of 1,000 Corpses, The Devils Rejects, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (yes I thought the remake blew the original away, I mean how is the original so scary when you can't even see it because there is no lighting people!!!)then I highly recommend Saw II. If you haven't seen Saw then rent it first. Like the first one Saw II is the perfect hybrid of A Nightmare On Elm Street and Silence Of The Lambs. As I said before this film is not for everyone. It is graphically violent. After all what would you expect from a film that's tag line is ""Oh Yes, There Will Be Blood"" and has a poster that has two rotted fingers that make the roman numeral for II. On a scale of ten I give Saw II an 8. The original gets a 10. I saw this film with my wife and best friend and both my friend and I loved it while my wife didn't care for it. So there's two opinions in one review."

There was actually more suspense and anticipation on what was going to happen next. A lot a movies you can pretty much guess what is going to happen next, but this kept me guessing until the end. The writers need an award for making the movie audience sit on the edge our seats like that. I just don't see how they can make a better one.

"neon47","10","0","2","6 November 2005"," Listen very closely.
","Very very seldom does a sequel ever shine as bright as Saw 2. Very seldom does a sequel go above and beyond its other half... but Saw 2 does all of this. Fans of the first rejoice because Saw 2 does compare and sometimes outshines one of the most under-your-skin movies of our time. The blood has been kicked up a couple notches and some of the traps are even more harrowing than the last (i.e. the death mask or the Chinese ""blade"" trap). The movie starts as a kick in the pants (just like the first) and makes certain you're aware that the games are not over. The beginning can be a little slow for those who just want blood and gore, but I was able to stomach it. It's actually kind of necessary once you get a grasp on the story. Once we skip ahead to the house that the players are trapped in, the movie kicks into high gear. Slowly the characters are dying because of the nerve gas they breath in and, this in turn, blurs their sense of reasoning and, often times, logical decision making. The ending is not what I expected and that's a good thing. After the movie was over I knew I got my $8 worth. I highly recommend this to people who know what good movies are. I've read some paper reviews on this, and clearly those people don't know what a ""movie"" is. If you haven't watched the first Saw, don't worry. You can still enjoy this one with little or no previous knowledge of the first movie. If you have seen the first Saw then clearly you rock. Just heed my advice before watching: listen very closely."

"patchworkcat","4","0","1","6 November 2005"," Nothing special, trust me
","Seriously, I don't know how this has got a vote average above 7, I would think it over-rated at much above 5. <br/><br/>The key question to ask yourself here is ""Have I seen Cube?"" If you have, don't bother with this - it's got a similar approach with the selection of death-traps to be out-witted or avoided but these are inferior to those in Cube and the characters are significantly more stupid in their approach. If you haven't, don't bother with this - go and watch Cube which does a similar job with a lot more style and creativity. <br/><br/>How creative you view the deaths as here and how you view the ""I'm testing people's strength of character, will to survive, making them live"" speeches of the gimp running it all will depend entirely on your previous experience of horror (especially psychological horror) films. If you've seen a few, this will not rate highly on your list. <br/><br/>Stupid, illogical characters, pointless aggression and swearing, a tiresome ""philosophical"" villain (he keeps talking about how people don't value their lives and if they don't, don't deserve to live, but himself didn't appreciate his own until... well, wouldn't want to spoil it, but it makes him hypocritically stupid. And not just in a ""he's a flawed person"" type way, in a ""god this is stupid"" way). <br/><br/>I saw it with 2 other people experienced in watching horror films of all kinds, and not one of us had any more reaction than a shrug of the shoulders and ""that was a waste of cash"". I'm not so hardened that some films don't get to me but this one... Not one death or piece of action disturbed, upset, moved or excited me. There was nothing really clever in it or thought provoking (which is what they seemed to be pressing for with the old guy) or to leave you somehow ""cold"" or ""open-mouthed"" which is what they were also blatantly pushing for with the ""Usual Suspects"" or ""Unbreakable"" type method of detailing the ""twist"" ending. The twist is nothing to get excited about really. It's the only genuinely quite clever part of the film, but the final, final part... It isn't really anything more than a cheap set-up for a sequel. <br/><br/>Final point of note: Possibly one of the key flaws of the whole atmosphere This is one of those films done with so much use of filter, quick cuts, overly-stylised angles, etc that nothing feels ""real"". There is a feeling of detachment created which keeps the whole thing remote and destroys a lot of the potential for getting you to feel like you're there or there's any sort of organic realness to what's happening. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time or money on this."

","As a Christian I always find it funny when people accuse me of legalism, and hypocrisy. For don't we live in a world where everybody expects everybody to do and act the way we want them too? Don't we all at some point ostracize people for being a little off o r out of place? The freaks call the beautiful stuck up, and the beautiful pay no attention to the ugly. We flip off the guy who cuts us off and we hate him because he inconvenienced us for one small moment. We're all guilty of doing somebody wrong, and then when we are wronged we expect the other person to apologize. We want vengeance, and we want the world to think and act just like us. If not we hate them. Trust me we're all guilty at some point, even I am That is just one of the wild thoughts that permeated my mind while sitting through SAW II. Yes, I'll admit it's odd that I would have a somewhat religious epiphany while people are hacking themselves to pieces. But that's the beauty of Horror. It's about processing the horror into something productive, while enjoying the scares.<br/><br/>The Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bond) is back. This time he's locked a bunch of people in a gory fun-house of his own design. The house is slowly filling with a gas that will kill the inhabitants unless they can find the antidote. One of the Jigsaw Killers victims is the son of Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), a local cop. Matthews and the local swat team have the Jigsaw Killer in their grasp. What follows is a psychological game that matches the law with a man whose unafraid to die.<br/><br/>SAW II is one of those rare sequels that works because you get to find out more about the psychopath. In this film we get to delve into the mind of the Jigsaw Killer (who goes by the name of John), see a little more about why and how he operates. Tobin Bond keeps him creepy and yet charismatic enough to be believable. Like a poor mans Hannibal Lecter there is a method and meaning to his madness but he's not a cartoon. He's a man on his deathbed with nothing to lose, and a theory of life that is so practical that if he channeled his concepts into motivational speaking and not murder and carnage he could be a millionaire.<br/><br/>I liked that the movie didn't play fast and loose with the carnage and at the same time realized when enough was enough. In this PG-13 Horror movie world it's so easy to pull back to reach a younger audience. But SAW II is smart enough to raise the bar, and let you process the mystery. Whose holding the cards? Is it the Jigsaw Killer? Is it the cops? I also thought the ensemble in the house worked well together, I just wish the screenplay had given them more to do than just stumble around and scream at each other. I also thought the stunning revelation about ""X marking the spot"" came far to late for the characters to really care about who was in the picture. When your life is almost over you're not really worrying about who put you in jail.<br/><br/>Director Darren Lynn Bousman tries his dandiest not to make the same mistakes of the first film, by laying off the camera tricks in favor actually allowing the actors to act. Sure he wiggles the camera around a little, adds some quick cuts to places. But he doesn't use those devices to amplify action that's boring. My one little qualm was with the screenplay. I liked the stuff in the house so much more than the police procedural parts. I wished that the movie had delved into the whole numbers thing and the mysteries of the people in the house a little more.<br/><br/>SAW II is engrossing if you let it be. On the surface it could be construed as just another slasher knock-off. But the power lies in the Jigsaw character and how and why he's manipulating the background. It's also a film that explores our own dark side. Jigsaw's real beef with the people in the story is that their wasting their lives. Their killing their bodies, they're hurting other, and their tearing their families apart. But the truth lies in the fact that legalism, and your own pursuit to change another persons thinking can also be skewed. So the next time you cut that guy off, or the next time you cut off that guy. Just think to yourself, I've been wronged but should I really wrong back. Vengeance begets more vengeance. Sometimes it's good to walk away."

","Saw II marks Darren Lynn Bousman's debut as a director on a major motion picture (though he directed a couple independent films prior to Saw II), so I was a bit weary as to the quality in the direction of the film. After watching Saw II I realized that Bousman can do it (well).<br/><br/>The film takes place after the events of Saw and the film opens with a bone chilling scene (this definitely prepared the audience for what was to come). Bousman kept to atmosphere of Saw, recreating a dark, dirty, and crazy atmosphere.<br/><br/>The story? I believe the story was well written, though some parts could be questioned as to ""if"" the characters could get away with what was happening (but then again it's a movie). The ending came to me as a surprise too.<br/><br/>Acting? The acting was good at best (but a few actors of the cast members did a hell of a job).

Still, like in the previous movie, the clues are all there if you try to pick them out.<br/><br/>We already know from all the reviews that this time around, it's no secret to who Jigsaw is -- even though he himself claims he's not a killer (and ironically, he takes offense to the name ""jigsaw"").<br/><br/>Still, just as before, Jigsaw gives people tasks. Some bloody and permanently scarring -- some so simple you wonder how people can not do what he asks. And those who don't, well...they wind up gone.<br/><br/>Just the same, we learn more about the background of the illusive ""educator"", the person who cuts jigsaw pieces out of people to symbolize that they are missing a vital part of what should make them a person. As sick as it is, you find yourself rooting for him.<br/><br/>Sure, he's putting people in horrible situations. Sure, he's a few tacos short of a number three. But the simple cold logic he displays is almost irrefutable.<br/><br/>And then, we have the victims. Stupid, stupid victims. Yes, there is blood, but all the same, I took great delight in watching the squeamish leave the theater (and this film is not for those).<br/><br/>The movie does a nice job in making throwbacks to it's predecessor, with little subscenes that give you just enough of the impression to leave a pleasant aftertaste.<br/><br/>However, I found, that this movie showed a much broader puzzle than the previous, and instead of seeing the whole thing, I felt we were only seeing a couple of the pieces. We don't know all the characters, or how they fit, we don't get intimately involved as we did with the characters in the first. It still kept me glued to the screen.<br/><br/>But still, horrifically bloody (sick, twisted) fun."

Now stay with me on this...<br/><br/>In the opening ""death mask"" kill of Saw 2, Jigsaw directs Michael's attention to a video of his eye operation. Notice two things about this scene: 1.) Obviously the point of the movie is to enjoy it and not nit-pick every little detail that seems unrealistic. I'll give Jigsaw the benefit of the doubt for building his traps, but to implant a key behind someone's eye socket so they can still see takes MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE.<br/><br/>2.) The cloaked man operating on Michael is limping! I didn't believe it when a friend pointed it out to me, so i took careful watch the second time around. Is he limping on the same leg that Dr. Gordon chopped off? Obviously this theory means you need to suspend a lot of disbelief, but that's the flavor of the Saw movies. Plus, they take careful consideration to show Zepp and Adam's bodies, but only Dr. Gordon's foot. Think about it..."

When the film finally came out I decided to see for myself how terrible this was going to be. The acting was alright, not adrenaline rushing like the last one but pretty decent and the scenes that were supposed to make the audience scream with fright were just dead and cheap. I was waiting for that one scene that was going to make me scream and throw my popcorn up in the air like the last one, but no. There was no scene like that, just a bunch of scenes that were trying to be scary like a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. The film did as I predicted, it did leave me disappointed but I was impressed with the work they put into the script. It may not be a walk through the carnival spook house but it did have the twists and turns of that roller coaster that looks like it is touching the sky.

The story was great, I especially liked the entire purpose of why everyone was in the house. I can't understand why any horror fan would not see this flick. But I can in a way see why people would not consider this a horror movie; to boycott it though, absolutely not. This is, love it or hate it, the new genre in horror. Mindscape wants to boycott it because it isn't in his opinion, horror . It is and you my friend showed your hand too early. You like the 30's horrors and up to mentioning Argento and Barker. I think I remember people saying Hellraise should be boycotted too. The films of the 30's provided scares for fans because it was new to them. History moves on and things progress. People need a new type of scare and the guy in the closet isn't doing it anymore. This is where guys like Bousman, Takashi Mike, and Rob Zombie come in. They aren't the garden variety directors and writers anymore. There are great plot lines, stunning filming techniques, and bright, new angles and ideas in camera-work (Thank you Mark Romanek for that Nine Inch Nails Video).

Not a bad one at all just predictable to those who really pay attention to the first one. Here's why: In Saw 1 the girl who survived ACTUALLY survived and stated "" HE SAVED ME!!!"" Therefore appreciated what he had done to her because he had thus saved her from continuing to be a drug addict. So WHY would she be dumb enough to do it again and be back in the game. Only thought that came across my mind was that she appreciated him so much for what he's done, what better way to thank him than to help him have other people see why life is so fragile and important. But again was a good ending, just SAW 1 was completely out of left field and had u thinking that everyone was the possible killer up until the VERY end. What WAS intelligent was Jigsaw's rule concerning to just sit there and talk to him and he will see his son. That i did not see coming. Also booby trap ideas...VERY creative. That's what I enjoy most about the SAW movies in general. Plus Saw ! did not need all the blood to capture your attention. SAW 1 10/10 SAW 2 8/10"
"scottkpetersen","6","0","2","1 November 2005"," Lacks the ingenuity of the first, but still entertaining
","For those who ""saw"" and liked the first SAW, you will no doubt be entertained by the sequel. ""The Jigsaw Killer"" is back, with more dastardly, sadistic traps for his slacker victims.<br/><br/>This time, John is caught by the police right at the beginning of the movie. As usual, however, John has anticipated his capture and reveals video screens that depict his latest victims (one of whom is the son of one of the lead police detectives), trapped in a house filled with his deadly devices. John poses a simple test to the police detective: sit here and talk to me and I'll return your son, safe and sound. The problem for the detective is how to do that when the video screens vividly portray the suffering and death of John's latest victims.<br/><br/>SAW II lacks the shock value of the original because the gimmick is familiar to fans of the first movie. There are more victims in this movie, but unfortunately, the number of victims dilutes the suspense because we the audience do not get the opportunity to learn as much about them as we did the victims in the original. The victims in this film are little more than cannon fodder for John and, as such, we care very little for their ultimate fate. Worse still, the deaths of some of the victims (particularly Beverly Mitchell of ""Seventh Heaven"" fame) are, it pains me to say, boring, especially given what we've come to anticipate from the more ingenious death traps shown in the first movie.<br/><br/>Once again, even the ""heroes"" of the film aren't people one especially wants to root for, but again, the leads are so thinly drawn that the horror of their ultimate fate eludes us. It's one thing when the innocent are tortured, but when the guilty are punished, however horribly, it's hard to get too worked up about it.<br/><br/>The ""twist"" ending wasn't much of a twist, especially compared to the first movie and smacks of deriving too much from many a bad slasher sequel. The police detective's son's final fate was a bit less predictable, but ultimately unsatisfying, given that his father's fate seemed to violate the rules of the ""Game."" <br/><br/>In any event, the first movie was a far superior film, but this one still had enough shocks and thrills to make it worth a trip to the theater. For fans of the original, however, it will be somewhat of a letdown."

"T1Thousand","8","0","2","1 November 2005"," I'm Glad I SAW This Too
","I will begin this review by saying that I absolutely enjoyed Saw part one. I was surprised that it would be so different than the average horror/gore flick. I believe that it is the best movie of its kind in a long time. Now here is the sequel. If you know nothing of the first Saw or did not understand it, you will be confused, perhaps lost, and find this movie bizarre and maybe even dumb. But it is as genius as the first one. When the movie starts, we already know that we are in for something different than the first. It has a distinct feel and seems like a typical horror movie at the beginning. But as it goes along, the Saw feel returns and the tension begins. I cannot describe any more about the movie here without spoiling anything. The Jigsaw killer is awesome, his games are sick and twisted, and this movie is excellent. Forget what the critics say. I have come to realize that they cannot appreciate a movie like this for what it is. Look at their reviews for this and you will see what I mean. I mainly take into consideration how the screenwriter is a new guy (only other movie is Saw one) and he managed to come together with two first-time directors and produce a very different and interesting movie. Many experienced writers/directors cannot even do that. As the Jigsaw killer says: yes, there is blood here, and a lot of it. If you could not handle the first Saw, I do not know how your tolerance level will be here. There are a lot of moments of disgust. But if you enjoyed the first Saw, you will either find this too weird or outstanding. There is a lot of information about Jigsaw that gives us more of an understanding of who he is and how twisted his mind is. There are so many instances in which we even want to agree with him. I find that to be good writing on a character's part, and surprising to most, there are a lot of symbolic images here that involve the clock and the jigsaw piece that the killer takes from his subjects' skin. I'm glad I SAW this too along with the first one. It certainly lives up its predecessor (and most sequels do not), and I was afraid it would not. Go see this for yourself, especially if you liked the twistedness of the first Saw =) <br/><br/>8.2/10 Stars"

"chris-hergenhahn","4","0","1","1 November 2005"," Decent film, but failed to match it's predecessor
","I went to see this film last night in a cinema with only about 20 people in it and you could have heard a pin drop. It's always good to be able to see a film with like minded individuals who don't go to the cinema to catch up on gossip. You would like to think that anyone going to see this film would know exactly what they were in for, which in this case seemed to keep out those hoping to see some mildly scary 'boo!' shocker that we have seen before. Anyway, I digress. As a stand alone movie, this would have been far more effective for me. But, unfortunately, for someone who was trying really hard to enjoy it as much as I had 'Saw', it let me down in several departments. I guess a lot of that may have to do with the setting. Some of the atmosphere is inevitably lost in a cinema. In your front room with the lights down and creaky boiler, who knows, things may have been different. But from the start of this, the foreboding unknown quantity that heralded the first one was absent. Yes the Venus fly trap contraption was horrible and the dilemma was,er, unfortunate for the guy but I never really felt that shocked. That for me was about as evil as it got and the predicaments that others in the movie found themselves in never quite matched the initial one, nasty as they certainly were. I felt that there were so many other ideas that could have been used and that would have increased the cringe factor. I didn't cringe once! When you consider some of the devices of torture and death used throughout the centuries, is falling into a pit of needles really that bad! The acting was OK and was at an acceptable level, considering the material. It didn't need to be great because that's not what we come for, but all involved did fine for what was required which was to look and act scared / shocked / angry etc at the right time. The story has pretty much been discussed to death (ho ho geddit!) so everyone should know it by now. The story, however, is not as good as in the first 'Saw', and to my mind was never going to be. The environment was not as creepy and intimidating and there were more characters involved. The first 'Saw' was much more personal and intimate and you felt that you were in the same room to a certain extent. In the sequel, I felt that I was watching it more from a distance and did not feel as involved. To achieve the feelings of fear / anxiety / dread that all horror movies strive for (don't they?) you have to feel a certain amount of sympathy / empathy with at least one of the characters and build around them an atmosphere where you know and feel evil things can happen. In 'Saw 2', gory as it was, there was no real dread, just waiting for the next set-piece, which, if more elaborate and interesting, would have saved the film, but they weren't. I enjoyed the film and didn't expect it to live up to the original. I wouldn't advise seeing it before the first film as it will spoil it, but it is unfortunate that some of what made the first so interesting is missing this time. As an aside, as a 35 year old, I still can't get used to seeing Donnie Wahlberg as a Dad!"

","Last year I watched SAW for the first time and I didn't know anything about it, I just heard it's something with two guys stuck in a room. So, in that aspect, the first SAW handed me a plate of surprises, this one on the otherhand was just a Halloween night filler for me and my wife.<br/><br/>The plot was more heavily elaborated on and we get to meet and know Jigsaw, which in itself was much needed I suppose, without that you just have a pretty mindless viewing of a booby-trapped house that people fall prey to with no real 'movie'. (see ""Cube"") All in all, if you're a horror/thriller connoisseur with your roots planted in the likes of 'Halloween', 'Black Christmas' and 'the Shining', this film may be tolerable enough to be a ""B-side"" track on an album you really like, but not one that stands out. However if you get your charge with a straight on gore-fest, and can sit there and eat a plate of Padgett with ease while watching someone's brains get smashed and slurped up, this is a cant miss."

","""Could contain Spoilers""<br/><br/>Saw 2 opens with yet another doomed victim who lacks an appreciation for life - not a good character trait to have when the Jigsaw killer is hungry for gaming. In this most anticipated sequel, the first victim wakes in a grungy room wearing only an iron contraption around his neck and a pair of navy blue boxer briefs. Soon enough, a nearby TV turns on to reveal that creepy papier-mâché mask that we all have come to know and love. Through a brief explanation, we learn that some hours earlier, Mr. Joe Boxer had a key implanted behind his eyeball; the evidence of which is shown on the TV in an x-ray. The key unlocks the ""Death Mask"", a spring loaded spiked device, that he has woken up wearing. Armed only with a scalpel and a mirror, he must cut the key out of his head and unlock the mask before it snaps shut and kills him. To make matters worse, he only has 60 seconds to do it! Talk about a rude awakening! He's just woken up and he has a split second to decide if he would rather lose an eye or die When I first wake up, it takes me 3 minutes just to remember what day it is Rough day for this guy The TV turns off abruptly the game has begun. Does he perform this gruesome surgical procedure? Better yet, does he perform it within the given time? Seeing how this is the opening of the film, you should be guessing no. Bingo SMASH! The mask closes like a Venus flytrap on steroids.<br/><br/>Enter hero Donnie Wahlberg playing the role of Detective Eric Matthew. He walks onto the crime scene and after five minutes basically says, ""I'm outta here!"" What? Wait a minute are you sure? Maybe you want to find a clue before you leave? Eventually, he decides to look a little closer, which leads to the discovery of a manufacturer's label on the death mask. Calling all cars! Everyone heads down to the manufacturing plant where they discover The Jigsaw Killer. ""Gotcha"", says Detective Matthew. Yep, he's a smart one all right. Jigsaw tells Matthew to look in the other room. He sees a group of monitors displaying eight victims in an isolated, grunge infested room. To really hit home, Matthew sees that one of the victims is his teenage son. Let the games begin Detective.<br/><br/>Here's how the game is played folks  The eight victims are trapped inside a house. There is a toxic nerve agent in the house that is seeping into their bodies. The door to the house will open in three hours but within two, their bodies will bleed from every internal organ. Throughout the house are games that, if won, will yield an antidote, but usually just a single dose. This leads to one of my first major problems with the film. OK, you have a decent size house to explore and only two hours to do so. The first thing I would do is form some kind of a plan, look around the room very carefully for clues, etc What do these guys choose to do first? Freak out. Fine, we'll give them a few minutes to do that. However, I felt like they never stopped arguing. I understand that these eight personalities vary to the extreme but it was very annoying to see the clock ticking while they do absolutely nothing to benefit themselves. You have one girl on the ground crying half the time and another one telling everyone to shut up. Towards the finale, one of these characters becomes an even bigger threat to the household than Jigsaw very odd story choice in my opinion.<br/><br/>As you might have guessed, I really would have liked to see the characters working together more, or better yet, working together at all. I felt the script should have spent more time playing with what the characters knew and didn't know, as in the first film. You had two characters chained up in a bathroom. One of them would secretly read a note hidden by Jigsaw and instantly we know that Adam knows something Lawrence doesn't. Then five minutes later Lawrence reads a note. Then we watch them play against each other. The original film peeled away layers like the Iron Chef on crystal meth but sadly, the sequel did not. Towards the end, I was so annoyed and frustrated by the characters, I was eagerly awaiting their hopefully painful demise. You have this huge house with all these undiscovered rooms why on Pluto would you waste more then ten minutes showing them arguing. It was like watching Jigsaw's version of Big Brother.<br/><br/>The character of Detective Matthew was almost as annoying as the arguing. At some point in the film, Jigsaw says something to the effect of  all you have to do is listen to me and your son will be returned safely. That's it, nothing more, nothing less. Actually, pretty simple directions The maniac promptly launches into his mantra, talking about the value of life and how people don't appreciate it. Sure enough, in five minutes Matthew is rolling his eyes and calling the guy a crazy loony. Call me loony but if Jigsaw had my son and he said those words, my ear would be down his throat. Apparently, my viewpoints on a child's life are a little different from Detective Matthew's.<br/><br/>Overall, Saw 2 can definitely be fun and entertaining at times but it just wasn't what it needed to be. The movie is decent but when compared to the original, it did not shine as much as it should have. With all this being said, I still recommend Saw 2. I don't feel it's a must see but if you're a fan of the genre it's definitely worth a look."

","What the Hell is so scary about a cancer patient serial killer? Sorry. I liked the first Saw. A lot!! OK, the chick that survived the jaw-opening trap by cutting that dude's guts out in the first film is now a deciple/nurse-maid to the cancer patient serial killer. Nope!! Not scared. It began pretty intensely with choice of death, or slice out your own eyeball. Other than that it's mostly a fun house of death type flick. Nothing like the first one. Tobin Bell was scarier in Malice. In this film he pretty much admits that after he's been diagnosed with cancer and the bell is tolling on his life, he decides to become a serial killer. A common knee jerk reaction I'm sure. But not scary."

","It's just not as good as the original... for many reasons. I will include some here, but know beforehand that this review contains *specific* spoilers (including the final twist), so if you haven't seen the movie, beware.<br/><br/>OK, I saw this movie last night (Halloween) and was really pumped (mostly because I saw the ratings on IMDb matched the original), which may be part of the reason I was a little disappointed. The beginning hits it running, which is a good thing, since the movie is only 90 minutes long. Then it goes into this new story, with unsympathetic characters that it's really tough to give a sh about. Then it wastes about twenty minutes while the new detective figures out where Jigsaw is (which I thought was stupid, they show his face within the first 30 mins of the movie). He's terminal, and non-responsive, but we know the ""game"" is ultimately about the detective. If you pay attention, you notice Jigsaw in agreement (or at least non-argument) with the detective's contention that his son doesn't deserve to die (Jigsaw replies, ""But what about you?"", or something like that). At this point, I knew it would end with the detective's demise. Then, Amanda reveals her past affiliation, and she knows where the first key is, so you know something's up. But the thing that really gives it away is: SHE NEVER GETS SICK! Even my gullible brain can't miss this one. Here, the value of the movie is reduced to the violence and cringe factor of the crazy stuff they have to go through. This is the glory of this movie! the needle scene, the human BBQ*, the Chinese hand trap*, and the final throat-slashing are all brutal and really pretty awesome.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The language was noticeably gratuitous, the gore was entertaining, if at times unrealistic, and the twist was transparent. An entertaining movie, but not much like the mind-bending original.<br/><br/>* - Reminds me of Fear Factor...I could hear Joe Rogan in the background."

","I'll simply say that if you enjoyed the first one, then Saw II will not disappoint you. After reading many reviews and comments on this and other sites, the majority of which were condemning of this film, I'd advise one to just go out and see it, ignoring the bandwagon mentality that this film unjustly faces. Horror that has been processed down to a PG-13 and made for the sake of a test audience is not something I even remotely entertain. As a matter of opinion, I have no problem with sequels if they can be a continuance of a good cinematic idea. In that regard, Saw II is right up my alley. The shots are composed for maximum tension, the lighting is on par with the first-an effective tool used to shade your mood as a viewer. I could give spoilers, but that is something I can not stand about many of today's reviews. Bottom line- if you are a fan of independent horror, if you enjoyed the first Saw, the works of Bava, Cube, or Haute Tension you will do well with this."

I don't expect Oscar-winning performances. I want entertainment, pure and simple. This movie provides it on a silver platter. I found myself yelling out at the screen, and laughing my @$$ off at certain parts.<br/><br/>Like my title says, it wasn't as good as the first. It wasn't as scary, either. Saw II is more of a mind-f*ck. Since there are 8 characters, they aren't developed as much as they were in the first ones. You get a minor history of some of the major characters, but it doesn't go much past that. The acting is better than the first, though. The character who played Xavier had me hating him from the very start. The main police officer in the movie, Eric I think is his name, also did an incredible job.<br/><br/>The traps Jigsaw set were as ruthless as ever. The opening scene had my stomach churning, and it didn't really stop until the end. There is a LOT more gore in this one. A lot of cutting of the wrists/injections/slashing throats. To be short, When Jigsaw said ""There will be blood"", it was an extreme understatement.<br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers, do not leave the theater for ANYTHING in the last 15-20 minutes. Previous unanswered questions will be answered, (What happened to Adam and the Doctor? What the hell was the gigantic boar-head thing?) Just don't leave the theater. The last 20 minutes are filled with nostalgia at it's finest.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great movie. I'd highly suggest watching the first one if you haven't already. It will impact the way you take in the movie greatly."

","I went into this movie wondering how they will ever match the intensity, originality, and mystery of the first installment of this franchise (I am really hoping they continue in this path). While we cannot get the same 'surprise' as the first Saw, this one does deliver goods and an awesome twist or two (no spoiler here) a la Shyamalan.<br/><br/>I would say that the violence is either on par or up a notch from the previous Saw and there is not as much room for character development but again the intensity and psychological/guessing games remain in this film.<br/><br/>In short, if you even liked the first film a bit or like smart horror/suspense films with a 'good set of grapefruits' look no further.

Off course, there was some magic that night, considering the fact that there were hundreds of horror fans expecting a gory sequel to the Saw installment and they got served! Without stating any spoilers, let me confirm that the movie is packed with bloody action and gore at its best. Those who liked the Jigsaw's strategy of allowing him the chance of survival to its victims by giving them a puzzle to solve, this time it goes even further. From the start until the end, you'll be given puzzling situation in which you wouldn't like to be part of at any time in your life. Near the end of the movie, the twisted game gets even more spicy...<br/><br/>I wasn't used to hear people applauding at the theater and it created some kind of psycho ambiance in the room that I kinda really enjoyed. The sadistic approach of the Jigsaw killer is still pretty impressive! Without telling you more, go watch it with some friends that will be able to tolerate blood in gallons and you'll be served!

The second installment in the Saw series had a lot going for it that its predecessor didn't: More gore and...well that's it really.<br/><br/>Beside the fact that we can see more it still fails to deliver in the acting department. For some reason the critics are focusing on how grotesque the violence is, but in actuality, they should be appalled by the grotesque acting. Aside from Tobin Bell and Glenn Plummer, the performances were laughable at best and painful at worst.<br/><br/>Oh...just like before, Saw II delivers a twist ending that seems forced and elaborately over the top."
"NateAusTX","8","0","1","31 October 2005"," A worthy sequel, but a sequel nonetheless
","I remember watching Saw for the first time and being blown away by what a clever structure had been created in which to build a little house of horrors. The payoff of the first film was wonderful, and part of what makes it fulfilling.<br/><br/>Saw II has the obvious problem that they can't trick you as they had in the original, and I expected that to suck some of the life from the film. I was anticipating a significant increase in the deathtraps and gore to compensate. I was wrong on both counts! Knowing the villain of Saw doesn't detract from the visceral interest of the sequel, and the writers did an excellent job of throwing in equally clever story twists this second time around.<br/><br/>Sadly, there seemed to be a lot less cleverness in terms of the traps and victims. A few people do die from traps, and there is some sense of panic, but from a ""what would I do in that situation?"" point of view, this is far less interesting than the original. Several of the victims just die quietly or are killed by each other, with nothing novel about the situation, no difficult choices being made by them. It's a shame, because at least for me those horrible choices were part of why the original was so interesting.<br/><br/>Most horror/thriller sequels try to turn up the gore and the terror to make up for lost novelty (see the Cube series for progressively faster and more diabolical traps in each film). Strangely, Saw II seems to do the opposite -- it is in many ways more tame than the first, but if you enjoyed the original you will certainly like this sequel. It is worthy of the title, and has some interesting things to add to this story."

The one thing that movie had going for it was the final shock moment. The sequel on the other hand, is a fully-developed movie, with characterization and some good acting, from the likes of Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, and Glenn Plummer. Even Franky G, the loathsome drug dealer Xavier, turns in a pretty good performance. It is a gruesome movie, but I don't think it's a sick film, the way some critics have gone overboard in describing this as something fit only for borderline psychopaths. It's got a neat puzzle of a plot and it is all very logical and holds together quite well (that's another criticism I've read that has me scratching my head, that the film makes all sort of logical leaps, etc.). There's a reason for everything that happens and several neat twists and turns to the plot that we don't foresee. As in the first film, just when we think we know where things are going, we're suddenly clued into the fact that we have no idea where it's all going. If we could all just slow down and listen carefully to each other, and work together for the good of everyone, maybe these bad things could be avoided! On a side note, I was pleasantly surprised to see the theater ushers come in and make a group of 10 or 12 young kids leave the movie--it definitely isn't appropriate for them."

","Nasty, sadistic, and thoroughly entertaining piece of trash carried out with genuine skill and bravado. The return of the original cinematographer and editor bring a degree of consistency to the look of the movie, and the young Bousman manages to hold the whole thing together, keeping both the story and the direction tight and focused, admirably avoiding those annoying WTF moments that plague low-budget horror movies.<br/><br/>As in the first 'Saw', the acting is not the film's strong point, with Wahlburg in particular really struggling to bring any degree of depth or variety to the character of a confused, angry and conflicted father. Similarly, Franky G's knuckle-dragging macho-bullshit routine, while starting out true to character, soon becomes tedious and repetitive. The rest of the cast are merely adequate, but Bell is a standout; bringing a surprising level of menace and credibility to a serial killer that could easily become laughable.<br/><br/>There is an oddly compelling and original idea at the heart of these films, namely that they are serial killer/slasher film in which the killer never actually encounters his victims. Each death is the victim's choice, the result of either not following the rules, or simply not wanting to live badly enough. Despite the unrelenting violence, and hard-R content, they contain just enough intelligence and moral questioning to keep them interesting and thought-provoking. As such, both movies are far above any original horror movies in recent years, and unless destroyed by cynical studio chiefs, has the potential to become a long running, successful, and highly lucrative franchise."

But this does not apply to Saw II.<br/><br/>The first movie was mediocre, but very well done even if there was a little bit of over or under acting on Adam and Doctor Gordan's part, but Saw II definitely blows the first movie right out of the water. Questions are answered and there's enough blood and gore in it to please and delight. This is not a movie for the faint of heart though; if you couldn't make it through Saw 1 without squirming or feeling a bit nauseous, Saw II may not be a movie for you.<br/><br/>This movie has more surprises than most expect, leaving theatres of people gasping or jumping in surprise and constantly on the edge of their seat. Yes, the Jigsaw killer has really outdone himself this time with a house full of booby traps where if you make a wrong move or get too eager to ""escape"", you pay the consequences with your life.

Many of his gruesome tasks are close to impossible to complete, giving them very little chance for salvation. This takes a very complicated character of the Jigsaw Killer and makes him seem more like a psychotic old man. Although the character seemed flawed, I liked how Saw II showed flashbacks of the Jigsaw Killer's life and how he decided to become what he is. This helped his character development but still underachieved in what I hoped to be the creation of complex, sac-religious vigilante.<br/><br/>Once getting past the large amount of flaws and disappointments in Saw II, it is very easily enjoyed.

"Jonny_Numb","7","0","1","29 October 2005"," a sequel that's a cut above...
","The original ""Saw"" was a nifty little horror film wrapped in the grit and grime of ""Seven,"" whilst turning the clichés of the 'serial-killer-thriller' on its head by giving the murderer a modus operandi as severe as his condition. In the film, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) was not a killer per se, but more of a prophet preaching to his victims, who found themselves in elaborately-staged scenarios entailing some form of self-inflicted bloodshed to ensure survival. In a dank, abandoned bathroom, Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell were left with a horrifying proposition: hack through their legs, or remain in the room ""to rot."" ""Saw II"" ups the ante of this initial scenario by placing a handful of ill-willed strangers in an abandoned house, where a booby trap awaits around every corner, and certain rooms are suspiciously tailored to the vices of the victims (for instance, a drug addict is forced to fish a key out of a pit filled with syringes). Meanwhile, a harried detective (a surprisingly good Donnie Whalberg)--whose son has been involved in this game--interrogates the frail, soft-spoken Jigsaw.<br/><br/>While the victims aren't overly memorable (though a returning Shawnee Smith leaves quite an impression) and their backstories sketchily-shaded (but still tied together well), the real appeal of ""Saw II"" is its shocking relentlessness. In a way, the mounting tension in the final minutes of the original ""Saw"" has been distributed more evenly throughout this sequel. The cast reins in any severe overacting tendencies, and while generally clichéd, each victim puts forth a noble effort at two-dimensionality. ""Saw II"" is so intricately plotted, suspenseful, and surprising that the characters really serve as little more than fodder for whatever unpleasant shock is waiting around the corner.<br/><br/>My initial expectations for this film were fraught with skepticism: here was a movie coming on the heels of a sleeper hit barely 1 year old, which smacked of assembly-line studio product; worse yet, it was a sequel being helmed by a novice director (Darren Lynn Bousman). Bracing for another title to add to my ""I-Actually-Shelled-Out-Money-For-That"" list, I was consistently surprised and quite pleased with how well ""Saw II"" sustained itself as far as mounting suspense and cringe-inducing moments were concerned. Several uncontrived links to the original film were well-done, and Bousman's visual style--while sometimes prone to whiplash edits and camera moves--remained faithful to previous director James Wan, thus transforming ""Saw II"" into one of the more authentic sequels I've seen (a definite rarity).<br/><br/>I've said little about the plot, and for good reason. ""Saw II,"" filled with the kind of downbeat grotesquery that gave the original its bearings, needs to be experienced. Even the slightest hinting at the events that transpire would ruin the film. I resist the common urge to unmask villains and twists in films (due in no small part to the fact that I'm almost always wrong), and while the rushed turning point of ""Saw II"" elapses quicker than we can absorb it (and owes a bit to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Scream""), it does ultimately fit--and is no less contrived than the conclusion of the original.<br/><br/>But underneath the heinous violence and bloodshed that greases the gears of ""Saw II"" is something of a revelation: through the character of Jigsaw, Tobin Bell creates a murderous mastermind who not only favorably recalls John Doe (Kevin Spacey in ""Seven"") and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs""), but invokes a surprising amount of empathy; granted, the 'lessons' he teaches his victims are wrought with sadistic severity, but his condition, coupled with a soft-spoken, intelligent, world-weary demeanor makes him the appealing backbone of the film while the alleged 'victims' scream and brutalize their way toward survival. Though such irony is doubtlessly intentional, I was surprised--and a bit shocked--at how well it seduced me.<br/><br/>In summation: ""Saw II"" is a sequel that's a cut above (pun intended), and certainly better than most of the mass-marketed horror dreck plaguing your local multiplex.<br/><br/>(Side note: listen close for a delicious reference to ""Last House on the Left."")"
"mydukky","10","0","2","28 October 2005"," A breath of fresh air for todays sh*tfest of horror films.
","Many may think that the idea for Saw 2 is an incredible mistake. I personally thought the same thing until i saw the film today. Saw 2 takes the first film and makes it better than it could have ever been.<br/><br/>For the record, I really enjoyed Saw, but I felt that I was never connected to the characters. So when the pay off happened, I felt no different that I did in the beginning. The film had this original and stylistic vision that was different from most movies. The acting could have been better, but I don't blame this on the director because I knew that James Wan had only 3 days of preproduction with the actors. So pretty much every piece of dialogue was the first time they said it.<br/><br/>Saw 2 on the other had was completely different. The story involves more people, and generates outside of what we perceive. John, also know as Jigsaw is a character that is more developed. This film allows for the audience to create an emotional connection with John so that it draws them in a lot more. Tobin Bell was amazing, as he become a face in this film, rather than a voice.<br/><br/>The story about the people locked in the room draws you in very well because you discover certain things that attach you to whats happening outside. It makes you want more but the focus isn't nearly on them as it is Eric Mathews, played by Donnie Wahlberg. The most powerful aspect of the film is becoming emotionally connected to the character played by Donnie Wahlberg. Everhything he goes through, you go through, and wanting to know the outcome becomes more and more apart of the experience of SAW2.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is rather the same. The editing is fast and it has very interesting and contemporary transitions that allows the film to flow. a lot of the editing justifies parts of the big 3 part pay off at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Personally, before the film was release I felt that Darren Lynn Bousman was not the right guy for this film because he was fired from all his Production Assistant jobs in Hollywood, and never developed a good name with studio execs. I expected a badly directed film that would destroy what James Wan and Leigh Whannel created. Boy was I wrong. Bousmans direction was perfect for this sequel. He didn't leave things unanswered and helped answer questions of the first film.<br/><br/>Overall this film is a very good improvement of the film made by Wan. The pay off is a lot different, but unexpected (unless you read about it before, like me). Bousman makes a great debut, and creates a world that everyone can feel a part of, instead of disconnected by the rushed film that Wan made. I look forward to seeing what else he can do with his career.<br/><br/>Also one thing that really set the mood off for the film was the preview of Eli Roth's ""Hostel"". I suggest checkin that trailer out ASAP."
"goldenboy72","6","0","2","28 October 2005"," More Fodder For Jigsaw's Slaughter
","Saw 2 - More Fodder For Jigsaw's Slaughter<br/><br/>Did you like the first Saw movie? You enjoyed its jump-cut array of clever puzzles, decrepit settings, and inventive butchery? Me too. So I watched Saw 2 without any notion that it could be an improvement on the original. It isn't. <br/><br/>Nor is Saw 2 even in the same weight class of the first. How could it be? The powerful wallop of the first movie was packed into a fistful of originality so it's no wonder that round two lacks that sucker-punch effectiveness. But, come on, this is a sequel! People go to them to have their expectations fulfilled and if that's what you want in Saw 2, your wishes are granted.<br/><br/>More intricate puzzles, more feculent buildings, more blood and more fodder for Jigsaw's slaughter. The main premise revolves around 7 people waking up in a locked room. Some of them we know. Some of them are purposeless other than to be ground up into bloody bits. <br/><br/>Some are just plain idiotic. In fact so witless that you wonder how such a single-minded moron could reach adulthood and it's unfortunate that a great deal of the tension of the movie relies upon this cretin being an uncooperative mountain of muscle. You'll see what I mean. <br/><br/>The scares are not up to the standards of the first Saw which formed a deep knot of unsettling dread in my guts that lasted for days afterward. Saw 2 does not even come close to any sense of worry and the director (Darren Lynn Bousman) seems to know it so he tries to compensate by tossing off some of the lamest over-the-shoulder ""boo!"" frights ever committed to film. <br/><br/>It's never a good sign when the audience laughs aloud at the on-screen stupidity of the victims. You know you've gone wrong when human suffering is met with cackles and snickers rather than sympathetic gasps.<br/><br/>The de rigueur twist ending somewhat redeems the film and invites another sequel but was set up in such a way that I didn't mind. At least it made more sense than the last 10 minutes of High Tension.<br/><br/>Final word: In Saw 2 you get what you pay for. You're not going to be surprised in any way. You'll be painfully aware that you're watching a movie with characters that play by the same tired horror-movie rules. But if you're in to inventive gore you'll go anyway. But don't expect to be disturbed by what you see. Or saw.<br/><br/>SAW 1 - ALTERNATE ENDING? Does anyone out there recall seeing an alternate ending to the original Saw? I watched the movie in Japan and remember a short flashback scene that takes place in between the time when Dr. Laurence crawled footless from the toilet chamber and Adam was locked in by Jigsaw. This is at the very end. <br/><br/>I watched the DVD and it doesn't match my memories of what I remember from the Japanese theatrical version. I recall seeing (in flashback) the moments leading up to the beginning of the film. Short flashback scenes of Jigsaw setting up his own faked death and placing Adam in the bathtub with the penlight keychain. <br/><br/>Then Jigsaw ""kills"" himself to make it look like suicide thus placing himself at the centre of the room between Adam and the Doc. Only moment after Jigsaw gets into suicide position on the floor, Adam wakes in the bathtub (which is the beginning of the movie). <br/><br/>After locking Adam in the toilet, I remember Jigsaw stalking a footless Doc. Laurence down the corridor. Then the movie ended. <br/><br/>Has anyone seen this or am I going crazy? I only recall it because I watched the Saw DVD this week and when it ended I wondered, ""Hey, what happened to the other bits I saw in the theatre?"" Figured they might be on the extras but no dice. <br/><br/>Japan often has theatrical releases that differ from the N.American release. Perhaps the extra bits I remember are in the recently released ""unrated Saw"" DVD? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?"
"ratpac03","7","0","1","30 October 2005"," Brutal, twisted, exhilarating.
","I should preface this by saying I have been watching horror movies since age 4. I've seen everything the genre has to offer. From the old Romero movies up to Hide and Seek, I've got it handled.<br/><br/>Saw 2 is not a horror movie. It is far more.<br/><br/>I liked Saw a lot. One of my favorites. Knew it was flawed, but liked it a lot. The claustrophobic setting was beautiful and the twist was heart-pounding. I had my doubts about Saw 2, as the cast seemed ""contemporary"" and the setting of a house rather than a bathroom made me fear it would be too open to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>My fears were wrong, much to my delight.<br/><br/>A strong stomach IS required. The plot is already known from the previews, a bunch of people in a house and they need to save themselves with the clues as per the game. One of the best features is the lack of a recognizable actor save Amanda and Jigsaw himself (you might recognize Donny Wahlberg, granted). This gives the movie a fantastic ""anything goes"" feel where the audience doesn't feel as though any character is safe from Jigsaw's traps.<br/><br/>In addition, the nature of the house gives a horrid feeling of dread at all times, that a trap could spring from a doorknob or a tripwire that we don't see, and every idea that a character has to free themselves that doesn't seem like Jigsaw would have wanted it makes the viewer want to look away and wait for the loud noise and the scream. Saw 2 mastered fear, period. You wait for bad things to happen, even when they don't you don't feel as if the danger is gone.<br/><br/>Saw 2 is sadistic by and large. It's not the goriest movie ever, the bloodiest, or the darkest, but it is the most sadistic. It revels not in killing people, but HURTING them, causing pain both physical and mental. One thing of Saw (perhaps not the unrated version, I've not seen that yet) was that we weren't shown much of the direct actions. If we did, it was fast and brief. Not so here, we have to watch it happen right along with the other characters (group setting and all).<br/><br/>The plot is bigger here, more convoluted and the movie has more twists and turns. The games are harder to stomach and the characters, sadly, less developed. We only know of the characters what they tell each other, and they don't say much. That's the only complaint. An extra 10 minutes could have been spent giving us info on some of them.<br/><br/>I've never seen a movie as tense as Saw 2 (not even the aptly titled High Tension), and with the exception of Fight Club, I have never been so shocked at an ending (again, not even High Tension, or the famed Sixth Sense). Indeed, near the climax of Saw 2 was the first time I've ever made an incoherent noise in the theater out of my utter speechlessness.<br/><br/>I can't say the movie is flawless, as I said the characters are rather undeveloped, the traps will seem unnecessarily brutal for many, the entire setup will seem over-the-top for those who somehow thought Saw was more ""grounded"", and the twists may be too intricate for many people to pay attention to (the internet is alight with discussions on this).<br/><br/>For any fan of thrillers, horror, and those with strong constitutions, I say go see it. You won't be disappointed."

"Robert_duder","9","0","1","30 October 2005"," Yes there was BLOOD!! BRILLIANT!!
","Be still my heart, this series is GETTING BETTER!! And an even bigger rarity is that people seem to agree!! Now it seems to me that the original SAW which was drop dead brilliant got harpooned by reviewers on here for the most part. Now the second installment comes out and is faring much better with the crowds it seems which is awesome and completely worthy!!! Where to begin with this incredible sequel. First off new, and very young director Darren Lynn Bousman does an incredible job of capturing exactly the original setting, feel and emotions of the original. The world of SAW is so dark, twisted, gritty...it's like being in the mind of the Jigsaw killer. Bousman does that flawlessly and still brings over the sheer brilliant twisted mind that existed in the original. A real life criminologist could spend years examining ""The Jigsaw Killer"" as his motives and crimes are so real. The cast in this sequel has improved 10 times over. The shoddy rather campy acting of the original has been left behind by some real strong performances starting with Donnie Wahlberg as the detective being pointed out by the killer, and also fighting to save the life of his troubled son who has been kidnapped by the Jigsaw killer. Dina Meyer returns as the detective in charge of the Jigsaw case, and I can't honestly say I remember her performance in the original but she was good in her small role. The rest of the cast was the captives and this is really where SAW II becomes original compared to the first one. The first one focused on two main victims and a handful of lesser ones whereas in this one you have six or seven captives in a house where the game resides.<br/><br/>I still think SAW II made some errors, as they did in the original. First of all I think there was something lost when they did more than just a couple victims. There was something eerie and downright terrifying and claustrophobic about only have two victims trapped in a small room. Although each character trapped had a very specific personality trait and they all had their own ways of showing terror, I think there was too many. It also leaves the door open for the question...WHY?? Why did the Jigsaw killer take all those people when all he needed was the detective's son?? Sure they all had a connection and it made for some wicked death scenes but they were unnecessary. Right off the bat we have the capture of the Jigsaw Killer, he is unveiled so to speak whereas in the original he was a total mystery. Any time you unveil a mysterious character you're going to leave behind a certain feeling with the audience and I think that happened a little bit here BUT....Tobin Bell, who did play in the first film, is a deadly awesome killer. He spends the whole film bound to a wheelchair and yet is still frightening, maniacal, and evil. Everything is part of his game and you really get caught up in it.<br/><br/>With the minor plot holes, and a few odd choices you have what's left which is still one of the best horror films ever made hands down, and what is turning out to be one of the best horror franchises. The deaths in the film is gory and there is LOADS of blood. It was fun sitting in the theater listening to everyone gasp at the same things every time. This guy is beyond sick and twisted and the ideas they came up with for the traps and the ""game"" is indeed still original and horrifying. The pit of needles!! OH MAN!! The hand trap that in order to remove your hands, it would...well...remove your hands. Shot in the eye, bat to the head, poisonous gas that causes blood to vomit from the mouths of it's victims and all the while The Jigsaw killer insists ""I've never killed anyone."" Brilliant!!! They even managed to tack on ANOTHER surprise ending although I'm still not sure I particularly am fond of it, KUDOS to them for doing another fantastic ending that keeps you guessing. On top of all this they did something I think is a sequel absolute MUST!! Not many do it though. They brought back three members of the previous film ANNNND brought the film full circle BACK TO the room where the original victims were held and tortured...OH IT GAVE ME SHIVERS to see that cold sterile room again!! Ladies and gentlemen, you must see this film and most of all you must see the original and then this one...any horror fans will relish in this unique intelligent horrifying film. I compared the first to Seven which is no small feat considering I believe Seven to be the greatest psychological horror ever made. I continue to see the comparisons in this follow up which was even better than the original for once!! It's a trip to hell in a game that seemingly can't be won and if you do win...well it could still be a loss. This could possibly be the first horror sequel to be better than it's original. Go see this film RIGHT NOW!! 9/10"
"MihoSayuri","9","0","1","30 October 2005"," Better than the first
","Wherever you go, you'll see a movie that you loved. A sequel will come out, and most of the time, the sequels suck and ruin it for you. But this sequel.. the best I've ever seen. I strongly recommend this movie, as long as you have viewed the first, so the second will be more thrilling. Many of the situations that are used in Saw continue in Saw 2, making it more ironic and shocking for the viewers. Many horror movies attempt to show nothing but bloodshed, but both Saw and Saw 2 take the viewer on an emotional and horrific roller coaster into the minds of each and every character. It is more of a psychological thriller than a bloodbath, but there is definitely blood for all the gore lovers out there. It continues the journey of Jigsaw and his maniacal mind in Saw 2. Here you have a handful of strangers put in a death trap to find their way out. ""Oh yes, there will be blood."""
"bigjohn652001-1","8","0","1","30 October 2005"," Saw 2 good, not great
","Saw 2 is a great thriller.Not exactly as scary as the first, it will keep you on the edge of your seat. I went into this movie so excited that when the opening came, i was smiling from ear to ear. The first 5 mins had people cringing in their seats. And as a huge fan of the first Saw, i was loving it. As the movie went on, the concept and thought put into this is great, but along the way the movie takes a turn that it didn't need to take.The kill scenes are great, but none of the games are as good as the ones in the first movie.The ending is good, but not really a shocker like everyone insists.But it opens it up for numerous more Saw films. I think that they should bring one out every year a'la ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" because the have a great franchise on their hands.<br/><br/>Overallm,the movie is good, not as good as the first. But it is still very, very, entertaining.<br/><br/>P.S.-The killings are kinda edited out which means if you want to see most of the blood, you would need to get the unrated DVD when it comes out, kinda like Land of the Dead"
"Buff_17","8","0","1","30 October 2005"," Saw 2 well done
","I have to admit that when Saw 2 was revealed I was a little unsure of whether it was rushed and just a cheap grab at money I am thankfully here to tell you that it is not. I just want to state that even though Saw had couple of notable actors like Monica Potter and Danny Glover the acting in Saw 2 is much superior to some of the terrible scenes we get in the original. The increase in screen time from Tobin Bell as jigsaw is a very high note for the movie and it starts off well with a great scene. Donnie Wahlberg comes in as the new cop convinced into taking the jigsaw case. While investigating a homicide it leads him to a new trap of the jigsaw killer involving his son being displayed on monitors.<br/><br/>The new situations the characters face in my mind are not as brutal as Saw 1 however one that involves a pool is interesting. I suggest the movie to those who are looking to improve on the original saw and any of those looking for a great ending and suspense."

"suzukicycle13","9","0","1","30 October 2005"," It doesn't disappoint
","I walked into the theaters with minimal expectations. I was looking to watch a no brain sequel to a movie that I thought was amusing at best. After the movie, I realized I hadn't even touched my popcorn and the ice was all melted in my cherry coke. I was truly amazed by the movie.<br/><br/>I don't believe movies of the horror genre are meant to be meticulously picked apart. You must approach them with a somewhat forgiving attitude. With that in mind, Saw II delivers in every way and surpasses the first movie. It's suspenseful. It's gory. It's worth it. Where the Jigsaw killer was a mystery in the first movie, the character is well developed and carries the sequel without any difficulty. And because the writers decided not to hide the killer in the sequel, it doesn't insult the audience by falling into that all too familiar cookie cutter horror films.<br/><br/>Some people may be put off by the sort of open ended ending, but I argue that this is OK with the Saw series. And the reason is simple. In other horror classics (i.e Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm St., etc, etc) the killings were senseless. The victims' sins were nothing more than the fact that they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. And the killer's intentions are either not clear or flimsy at best (Jason is ticked because people are in his favorite campground?!). In Saw, the Jigsaw killer wishes to be the hand of god that punishes people who don't fully appreciate the lives that they've been given. The premise may be a little cliché (Seven?), but the method in which the Jigsaw executes his punishments and tests are what drives the movie. So instead of a particular key killer carrying the movie, it's the technique of the kills and the legacy that the killer brings that makes the movie pop.<br/><br/>If you're wanting to watch a fun movie that's worth the $9.50 that you paid and you like horror movies. Go watch Saw II. I don't think you'll be disappointed."

"sickgirlrockstar","7","0","1","30 October 2005"," Some Mistakes, But Worth Every Penny
","First and foremost, know this: Saw II is probably one of the sickest, twisted movies I have ever watched in my entire life, rivaled only by the first one. Having said that, let me also say that I loved it. Theater ticket prices in my area nowadays are ridiculously high, but even though I'd vowed to only ever see Harry Potter movies on opening nights, this was definitely an exception and it was worth every bit of money I'd dished out. (And all the effort I'd put into my makeup to make myself look over 18 so I could watch it.)<br/><br/>As soon as I left the theater with my friend, she and I were busy caught up in our fangirl squee-age about the brilliant story and plot twists, which can only have come from Leigh Whannell, who was the screenwriter for this part as well as the first (and starring in the first). I didn't see it coming. Did you see it coming? I didn't. Granted, there were a few scenes that were painfully predictable (-1) but the ending more than makes up for that.<br/><br/>What I was disappointed with, however, was the obviously different style of this movie from the first one. If you be so kind as to recall those jumpy, flashy scenes that look like time elapsed photography (like when the camera was spinning around and around Amanda while she had the jaw trap on); there are similar flashes but to me they seemed like watered-down versions of the originals. (Another -1.) It made me miss James Wan incredibly. Another thing was the inconsistency with settings. We all saw that the bathroom Adam and Lawrence were locked in led out into an abandoned work building, which is strangely altered in the second story. (The final -1.) <br/><br/>So that tallies up my final score to a 7/10, but other than that, this movie was the best. Despite what others believe as it being a crass artless pointless excuse to create scenes of unspeakable gore, it is far beyond that. My final words of advice would be: don't miss the opportunity to see this movie. =)"
"wwhitbeck","6","0","1","30 October 2005"," Forgot their own rules
","While Saw made audiences cringe and rethink how they interacted with the world, Saw II flounders.<br/><br/>In an attempt to capitalize on the first's success, a new version was quickly scrounged from an existing screenplay (NOT by the original writers). It shows.<br/><br/>In the original SAW the whole point of each victim's predicament was a result of their own actions, ie they deserved what they were getting. Saw II has forgotten this moral lesson. Rather Jigsaw is bent on punishing the bad cop played by Donnie Wahlberg. The problem is that all of the victims in the house are getting punished for his actions, including his own son.<br/><br/>While the trap in the opening, obligatory scene is rather interesting, it is played out in such a high speed that the audience is unable to fully savor the squirm factor inherit with it.<br/><br/>Also missing from this version is the flashbacks that the victims experienced to explain why they are where they are. We never fully appreciate if the people in the house are there for a good reason, or not. Their very bland and painful expository dialog is just painful to get through, where as in the original the flashbacks would have SHOWN the audience what really was going on.<br/><br/>All in all, this is one sequel that should have been slower in rushing to the theater and spent more time on the crucial element: the script."

There is no sense to talk about the acting, the plot, the music, directing everything was more than perfect. There is something more. When you watch a typical American action-movie, you think to yourself: ""This is not true""; ""He cannot do that"", ""It is impossible to happen"". SAW 2 is different. You don't wonder about the authenticity of a scene. You just trust the film, become a part of the story, and believe this is real. It seems to you as if you could hear the silence, smell the blood, and feel the pain, giving yourself over the fear. I will go to the cinema some more times.

So even if you have not seen the first one you should definitely see this movie because it does not disappoint.

Although some parts are could've been predicted, that didn't take away anything from the movie experience.<br/><br/>I can officially say that Jigsaw is one of the greatest serial killers in movie history, maybe even the greatest and topping Freddy. Jigsaw's technique of killing someone in such devastating manners without even touching them still stands fresh with some more added unique ways. There is no way you'll leave the theatre feeling something was missing. The game gets much more intriguing as the traps get more sickening.<br/><br/>Let's be honest, the acting will never be superb in a horror movie. I think there is an unwritten law that states that it is illegal to have good acting in a horror movie. With that said, the acting wasn't that bad. The cast did a wonderful job not giving us the dreaded teen-like performances (although there were only 2, maybe 3 teens). The director (Darren Lynn Bousman) did a wonderful job to showing scenes from the original to make connections between both films, which really made the sequel play out better.<br/><br/>Twists and turns, traps and games, and blood and death, what else could you ask for? Saw II works in ever yway imaginable. During the finally moments, I was on the edge of my seat, and when it was all said and done, I smiled and left the theatre with a very satisfied feeling. How much blood would you shed to see this movie? You better say a lot, because it was definitely worth it.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"mistressmoonlit","10","0","2","29 October 2005"," I thought it was impossible, but it was better than the first.
","Being a die-hard Saw fan, I was excited to go see the sequel, but I must admit I was anticipating disappointment. I was wrong. Saw 2 was, in many ways, better than the first. The situations were much more intense and frightening, (I, the brick wall that I am, watched several scenes through my fingers), the plot was thicker, more twisted, and although confusing was easier to follow than that of the first movie, and let us not forget the gore, gore, gore! Watching a man saw through his foot in the first movie was definitely gut wrenching, but there were several situations in Saw 2 that blew ""He doesn't want us to cut through our chains.. he wants us to cut through our feet"" right out of the water. Just thinking about a couple makes me cringe. If you have a weak stomach, it may just be too much for you.. and even if you're tough as nails like me, don't buy the large popcorn. You won't finish it. Saw 2 is a fantastic continuation of the first movie, and is deliciously horrifying from the moment the lights dim to when they come back on."
"skingfan03","9","0","1","29 October 2005"," Achieves what so many other horror sequels have failed to do
","I didn't see SAW in the theatre. I rented it and watched it at home, and it gave me the chills. It was a refreshingly original horror concept and the low budget of the film only made it work that much better, instead of working against it. Needless to say, when I heard and saw the previews for SAW II, I knew that this time I would have to see it in the theatre. Anyone who has seen SCREAM, or enough horror movies, knows some of the universal rules of horror movies. For example, is there more at stake in SAW II? Oh yes. Instead of two guys chained to a wall in a desolate room (and yes, we do find out if those two survived their trials or not), we now have six people trapped in a house full of booby traps and slowly dying from a nerve gas which they must find the antidotes for. Is it scarier? Yes...but there's also a lot more focus on John ""Jigsaw"" and how and why he became the serial psycho that he is (which also makes him more human and less of a dark mystery), and this is all very fascinating, but on the other hand you see more of the outside world and so this takes away a little from the chilling sense of isolation from all that is sane and normal that made the first one such a cult hit. But don't get me wrong...SAW II is DEFINITELY worth seeing!! Saw II exceeds where other horror sequels have bombed, and in some cases (Boogeyman, Darkness Falls, Alone in the Dark)where even the first horror movie failed miserably thus killing any need for a sequel. If you have any doubts about whether or not to see this one, I say: doubt not. It IS effectively dark, creepy, bloody and disturbing and supplies once again a ""Holy crap!"" twist ending! ************WARNING: If you haven't seen SAW II yet, read no further****<br/><br/>Just like to add that I thought it was neat that the one survivor from SAW (Amanda) becomes John's apprentice (you had to figure that this being a sequel, John was going to either suffer or, more likely, die at some point in the movie, and a man like him doesn't just let his legacy die with him) and thus makes room for what could easily be a very creatively evil SAW III. I kept wondering, too, why Amanda and the kid were the only ones NOT dying from the toxic gas, spitting up blood and convulsing. I liked that the cop's son was so close to him all the time and yet he never even knew it. As one commenter said, the images stay with you long after the movie's over. Deliciously evil."
"mattriley3","9","0","1","29 October 2005"," A great film with a fantastic twist ending
","This movie, while not as good as the first, was still a fantastically entertaining film and delivered a great amount of gore and terror that is visible in the first. The twist ending wraps everything together and if you pay very close attention, you can figure it out. Of course I won't reveal any of it but I will say if you liked the first, the second will be entertaining and provide a significant amount of horror.<br/><br/>One thing that most people will enjoy is the story. While it takes a bit to get going, it picks up and gathers momentum. Leigh Whannel has to be one of the most creative and talented writers in Hollywood and he's definitely an underrated one.<br/><br/>One last parting note...if you love horror with a story, this is one you will want to add to your collection when it comes out."

","I saw this movie today with my sister. We both love horror movies and loved Saw I, so we were really excited for II to come out. I was surprised at how the movie started out, definitely got my attention. And kept it throughout the entire movie. I kept trying to figure out what was going on and who was up to what and all that throughout the thing, but I could never get it all together. The ending was GREAT. Completely unexpected. There are twists throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Warning to anyone wanting to see this movie: If you are even the tiniest bit squeamish, DO NOT go to see this movie. It's gory from beginning to end, no stop on the blood and blood and blood. It's much more gory than the first."

","I went to see Saw 2 assuming it would suck, but to my surprise it rocked. I didn't think that I would leave the film shocked or wanting more, but I did. While I was closing in on the end, I felt that it was going to be predictable, but my predictions were incorrect. It is a must see. Unfortunately, many horror sequels end in disappointment. This film rates with the few successful horror sequels. It definitely deserves to be rated with such ""sequel"" classics as Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Scream. Luckily for us, it was not as disappointing as Nightmare on Elm Street part 2. When you see this film you will not be disappointed."

","I thought the first one was clever UNTIL I saw the second one. The first one pales in comparison. The simple fact that you get to see Jigsaw in the flesh, the real person and see his motives..well it was truly chilling. The ending was cool too but also kind of just a way to lead to Saw Three which I think might ruin the franchise. My advice-QUIT WHILE YOU ARE AHEAD....I Don't THINK IT COULD GET ANY BETTER...JUST DOWN FROM HERE. That being said, I hated the main character Eric. I didn't feel connected to him in any way. Beverly Mitchell was good at standing around and looking scared but her death was boringgggggggg. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and I loved it. I will definitely see again."
"Clownbaby124","9","0","1","29 October 2005"," A lot more better for a few reasons.......
","I thought Saw 2 was a great action packed and wonderfully acted movie. It had a few connections with the first Saw which made it really cool. The acting in this one was a lot more better. No corny actors, it didn't have any famous people in it an I think thats one of the reasons why it was so good. The traps in this one were incredible also. It had a few twists which made it really good too. Basically this movie was great. I walked in there thinking the worst, but I was impressed. WARNING, IF YOU ARE UNDER 17 AND ARE NOT WITH A PARENT, IT IS A BITCH TO GET IN. I walked in, i had my friend by two tickets at two different booths, then before we walked in the movies, they had to check our ID's and of coarse I'm only 16, so i had to wait until the teacher of my school got to the movies and me and 20 others walked in behind him. Then before u walk in to the real movie, they still check your ticket stub and all that jazz. But all that pain and suffering was worth it. I highly suggest seeing it."

","I'm just going to keep this short and sweet. Saw II was the perfect sequel film. If you thought the Terminater 2 was considered the best sequel to a movie hands down, now it has a competitor, and you can't argue with that.<br/><br/>The first Saw was perfect to begin with, but this takes it a step further and into another world, a world of hurt, and a world of redemption. You have to feel for these people as they play these ""games"". I can't imagine how the writer thought of these perfect tortures, and watching them occur is even better.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie and love it. You can't hate it, it's just perfection. Just remember one word about it: TWIST. One of the most creative twists in a movie ever and I'm still stunned. Let's just say, next October I'm ready for Saw III!"

","While this movie lacks the considerable intellectual development of its predecessor, it was still entertaining and thought provoking. The acting was much more realistic and enjoyable than the original; however this movie gave new meaning to the words ""gratuitious gore"". Yes, there was blood... a lot of it.<br/><br/>While I liked most of the movie, I found the ending ridiculous and disappointing. It didn't shock me; rather, it was so out of the blue and confusing that I could hardly even accept it. Overall, the movie was of pretty good quality, but it by no means exceeded or even came close to that of Saw, and I got the sense that the directors were trying to outdo themselves with every turn, especially the supposed shock value of the shoddy ending. There was definitely a perfect set up for a prequel, though."

","The rare sequel that is actually better than the original. We get to learn a little more about what drives Jigsaw to do the things he does and even how he chooses his victims. The killings were even more lurid and disturbing (I spent the first ten minutes just absolutely squirming in my chair) and Tobin Bell gives a beautifully understated performance as John/Jigsaw. My only real complaint was that for a man very near to dying of cancer, Jigsaw seems to have no problems when it comes to money to spend on his gruesome killing machines. There are plenty of red-herrings and the three (count 'em) three twists come at the end, they are even more effective than the unlikely twist of the first. Genre fans should rejoice that we have a new, smart horror franchise. For my full review of this and other recent movies, both in theaters and on DVD, please visit http://prosper761.blog-city.com"

I managed to predict that Daniels father was the one who'd arrested the former convicts in the house, I also managed to predict the whole 'pre-recorded' video stream. Although the twist with Amanda at the end had me struck, really good idea. Strangely all of this didn't affect my opinion on the film, I still walked out the cinema a happy man.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed this movie more than I did the first.

Very few movies today have an underlining story, especially horror flicks. This series has re-introduced the meaning to horror movies to the world. for 15 years the world has gone through a drought filled with crap. Finally it has ended. The best part is people don't have to understand what john is trying to get through to the people. They get the life scared out of them. literally and change their ways so they don't end up in a death mask. Life is hard for those who run the streets.

","It's going to be hard to talk about it without spoilers but I'll try to keep them as brief as I can.<br/><br/>The first thing I would have to say is it proved me wrong when I thought this film couldn't beat the original. I can imagine the first film being a cult classic in 20 years and I thought this would be like the 2nd Exorist or the 2nd Blair Witch films.<br/><br/>But surprisingly this film did actually beat the original by far.<br/><br/>A quick summary of the story would be that the film involves Jigsaw capturing 8 more victims. Keeping them locked in his house they have two hours to find a cure for a virus thats going through the air until it keeps them. On the other side it has a story like the first film where there are cops on the hunt for Jigsaw.<br/><br/>The film is not for the squeamish as it's gory.<br/><br/>The main thing that was wrong with it was mostly the ending, it did have a better twist than the first film yet it was a little confusing and took a while to figure it out. (By then the film had finished) This was mostly why it didn't get ten out of ten.<br/><br/>The great thing about it was that it was intense and exciting towards the end.

I like when they first open that door and you vaguely remember seeing it although there was no light. But when the girl turns on the light you see everything, including the corpses of the two previous victims, and their severed legs and arms.

If you've never seen the original, than you should know that this isn't the type of horror movie where things pop up every 10 minutes, it's about solving one giant puzzle. It is also good to see the first original one before you see this one because there are some moments and times where you go ""I remember that!!"" and it makes the story a heck of a lot easier to understand if you see the original one.

Anyways, from the cringingly typical start the film does OK with some nice thrills and look away moments. The only thing that really disappointed me about this one was that, unlike the first, there were only a few traps and contraptions even though the story allowed for way more. A half decent performance by Donnie Wahlberg playing an out of sorts cop who is equally backed up by Dina Meyer as his one time partner. Obviously the 'star(s)'of the movie are the situations left for us by Jigsaw which, as said before, are fewer than one would of expected. All in all, enough to keep fans of the first film happy."

","There is two ways this film could go. Firstly it could be a stunner completely out do the first film in every way, or it could go the way of most horror type sequels, which is straight in the bin. The film starts off with yet another enclosed room and a single guy that has to try and get out before his life ends. This then leads a police officer onto the seen who for some reason the 'jigsaw killer' has an agenda. This leads to a game being played with the officer and a group of people trapped in a house filling with deadly nerve gas, one of which is his son and one of the others we have seen before. if you don't know who that is i wont say. Its not by the way any of the guys that were trapped in the last one, you do find out what happened to them. This i'm a little disappointed about, I preffered not knowing, i felt it more fun to make up your own mind on it.<br/><br/>The film in the most part is fairly average and was starting to head the way of most horror sequels until we hit the twist. Ahh the twist yes this for me turned an average film into a good film, yes it happens with about 5 minutes of the film left but it is strong enough to lift the film to the score i have given it. In my view the twist was better than the one in the last film and leaves it open for yet another sequel. <br/><br/>Better than the first film? Probably not, but then that was an original film, whereas with this we know what it is all about. Still it is worth a watch and does enough that we can probably expect saw to be a Halloween regular."

One scene that you may find disturbing is, well all of them.

","While there are so many terrible horror movies that are spewed out that follow ridiculous formulas and have no relevance to society, this one makes a decent effort to say something meaningful and be original in the process. Granted, it is still an effort at entertainment as much, and probably more so, as it is social commentary; also, it doesn't always come out perfectly (including some unintentionally humorous moments and some small things that didn't quite add right), and it's easy to argue that many of the conceptual traits can be found in other, more respected movies (i.e. Se7en). Overall, though, it came off considerably better than the first one. It almost seems that this movie was the ""final draft"" of sorts, with the first being the rough draft.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the original Saw and can handle more gore than the first, this is worth seeing, if for nothing else than a great improvement in virtually all regards."

","After watching the first one, I went into the cinema to watch Saw II hoping to be as shocked, and that is exactly what happened. I was worried that they may ruin the first one by bringing out a sequel, as more often then not they are rubbish. However Saw II completely surprised me, it was not only far more gory then the first one (think of the scene when he saws off his foot then times that by 100 and your pretty much there!) but the twists at the end are genius! What I also liked about this film is it cut out all the boring bits of when he kidnaps the wife and daughter, and is replaced by twisted scenes that make you feel very uncomfortable! If you're a big fan of Saw I, and even if your not you have to see this film but believe me this is not for the faint hearted, few bits where I had to cover my eyes! Jigsaw is back!"
"sagentx2005","6","0","1","28 October 2005"," When in comparison with the original-BETTER
","I was a fan of Saw last year. Even though similar plot lines have developed before (the superior se7en comes to mind), Saw still felt original and twisted enough to maintain my interest and when combined with an awesome ending- I was won over. Now it is a year later and the story of the Jigsaw killer continues. This movie is not some lame sequel, yet a worthy follow-up of its predecessor. The acting was far better in this movie. The gore was amped up. And above all else, Saw II managed to maintain a feel of obscure discomfort and unease while watching. I had my doubts at first, but after seeing it , I am very glad this sequel was made. If the quality (by quality i mean -good disturbing psychological thriller material) of these films can remain, then I would gladly welcome more sequels in this series. PS-don't let anyone ruin the ending for you!"
"Carr299","10","0","2","28 October 2005"," In a word...WOW
","Let me start off by saying that I really enjoyed Saw. Sure, the acting was a bit off at times and the twist ending took some suspension of disbelief to accept, but it was an original, engaging film. I was worried at first the the development team of Saw II was going to make some slip-ups because of their rush to release it before Halloween. Thank God that I was wrong. This movie was absolutely amazing. The acting was a huge leap upwards from that of its predecessor and the plot was even more intense, believe it or not, this time around. I didn't actually think that Saw II was that ""gory"", but the violence on hand was very graphic. It will take a hard stomached person to not squirm during the needle scene and the wrist-slashing trap. Tobin Bell turned in a great performance as Jigsaw and really added depth to the maniacal character. I also liked the inclusion of other original cast members. There were even a few scenes in the finale that act as great throwbacks to the original and serve to further connect the two movies. The end even had a few well developed twists and turns that were both logical and believable.The doors have been successfully opened to create at least one more sequel, and if it is even nearly as good as Saw II, which I think might even be better than the original , I will welcome it with open arms."
"megatron027","10","0","2","28 October 2005"," Opening night review
","I have to admit that when I found out that there was going to be a sequel I convinced myself that it wasn't going to be as good as the original but I decided being Halloween weekend and all I had to give it a chance. The minds at Twisted Pictures really pulled through again. The plot and the writing behind it were amazing. Knowing that there were going to be plot twists I kept looking for them the whole time but still ended up being shocked in the end. I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire movie, it kept me thinking the whole way through. I am going to be anxiously awaiting the possibility of a SAW III. After weeks of anticipation I was not disappointed at all. I'd recommend to anyone that I knew could handle it."
"utrx05","10","0","2","28 October 2005"," Awesome, thrilling, intense....GO SEE IT NOW!!!
","Usually sequels do not live up to their predecessor. This one surpassed the original by miles. The acting was so much better than the first. The 2 main characters in the first one just didn't seem to be into the movie until like the very end. That plot was way better. The director tied everything together between the first and the sequel very well. The surprises were even better. The movie rocked hardcore. If you haven't seen the first one, it isn't totally necessary to see it, but it would help explain a couple things. It's fun trying to guess what is going on. Once again, I was dead wrong. The ending of this movie is amazing!!!"
"auggy_meat","7","0","1","28 October 2005"," We come for the depravity, we stay to connect the dots
","I saw the first 'Saw' film with a good friend of mine. She left in tears, crying all the way home.<br/><br/>Naturally, we had no choice but to set off for the second.<br/><br/>What really intrigued me before we even got into the theater was the active carding going on. Since when does this happen? I can't speak for the rest of the world, but I barely knew the concept even had merit in Montreal.<br/><br/>Naturally, I expected the gore to blow my mind.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, it did not perform such an action. Mind you, this film is truly gruesome when it decides to be. One second you'll have generic paddlin' gore and then the next your eyeballs will feel violated and your skin will crawl for the poor fool on screen.<br/><br/>The gore isn't what matters here though. There's a lot going on in this film. I'd go so far as to say that its very machinations are superior to its prequel in every way, exempting the lack of a consistent ""ick"" factor and one very depressing aspect of the film...<br/><br/>The characters are horrible. There is no one to love in this film. Well, okay, the most likable character is Shawnee Smith (who returns from the first film to endure some more pain) but it's hard to pay attention to how good she is when everyone around her is attracting your eyes and ears with just how much you wish you were knocking their teeth out.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and Jigsaw is an extremely likable character despite being our featured antagonist.<br/><br/>What I intended to get at (before I decided to ramble) was just how fun it is after this movie, to piece everything together. While watching, certain things will seem foolish or flawed (and as I've told ""plot pickers"" of the first film, this would be false with one possible exception) but inevitably come together and before you have time to process it, something else will make sense and by the end of all this processing you've still got some thinking to do on the way home.<br/><br/>Awesome Tobin Bell, awesome Shawnee Smith, some lukewarm but welcome Dina Meyer and a whole lot of uncomfortable squirming every time someone is about to get punctured, prodded, sliced, diced or otherwise ripped to pieces by god knows what.<br/><br/>7/10 or 3 and 1/2 stars"
"kuito69","10","0","2","28 October 2005"," Summarized in one word... BRILLIANT!
","I never thought the makers would be able to top their amazing plot and story of the first Saw movie, but I was wrong. This movie was psychologically brilliant. The entire movie I found myself trying to think like John (Jigsaw). When the end came along (I won't ruin it, you have to see it for yourself, it's just that damn good!), I wasn't even close. Every aspect of shear brilliance was covered, with, of course, another amazing twist at the end. Best movie I've seen in a while. I hope the makers will keep it at this. It'll be very hard to get three in a row, but if they do, it will successfully be my favourite trilogy. If you haven't seen this yet, its the perfect date movie! Enjoy it to its fullest and embrace the magic of Saw. I know, its about killing and whatnot, but look beyond that and see the brilliance of the entire thing."
"quiet_one212","Null","0","1","28 October 2005"," loved it
","I love this movie because of what it's about. He puts these people through painful jigsaw puzzles and if they really want to live then they figure out what he's talking about and make it. He only picks people that really have no reason to live, drugys, bums, etc...If you did make it through and live then he would help you get you life back together. If everybody would just look at life as Jigsaw does then everybody would be so much happier. It's a great movie, my top 3. First is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and second is Saw, the first one. awesome! Pretty gruesome but a beautiful movie all in all. As long as you have a strong stomach, I recommend it."
"mattburr86","8","0","1","28 October 2005"," Oh Yes, There was Blood
","A pretty well done follow up after Saw from a year ago. Although I think the first one was better the second one is more evil. <br/><br/>The thing I didn't like too much was the characters weren't put down thoroughly enough and that took a little away from the film compared to the last one. Also there is some things that went on in the film and then just dropped for the sake of what was really going on. You'll know what I mean when you/if you see it. <br/><br/>The ending didn't disappoint at all. Another twist that wouldn't be expected lives up to this series as twisted and psychotic. It does very well considering how I wondered how it was gonna follow up this time around. It played out very well to say the least other than some odd flow of the movie. But anyone in for a psychological thriller and any fans of the Saw series will enjoy."
"hamstaz123","10","0","2","28 October 2005"," incredible
","this was the best movie ever.. i think twice as better as the original.. but no more because the first was incredible too.. seeing saw 2 was seriously an experience.. not a movie.. go watch it right now! this was the first movie where i actually called everyone in my phone book to tell them how great of a movie it was.. if you like the mind of jigsaw and his sick psychotic games.. this is definitely the movie for you.. I'm seriously buying another ticket and watching this movie again.. i have no words to describe the feeling and adrenalin rush this movie gave me.. i've never been so heart throbbed over a single movie.. i love this movie.. go see it.. right now.. stop what your doing.. get up.. go to your blockbuster/DVD provider and buy/rent it.. because by the time you read this it will have already been to late to see it in theaters.. go SEE It!!"
"cocodust3","10","0","2","28 October 2005"," awesome!!
","Well, you know when sequels usually aren't nothing like the first one? This one proves that old saying wrong. Saw 2 was WAAAAY better than the first one. There are more characters involved making it constant 'edge of your seat' frenzy. Of course, just the characters isn't what makes it so interesting, it's where they are and what they got to go through. Yes, there is a lot of blood and gore but I can promise you that you will be so into the movie that you won't want to go to the bathroom or to the concessions while it's on. When you see the ending, you'll flash back through the movie and realize how things happened for it to end up that way making it more enjoyable when it's over. You won't leave thinking 'what?' you should be satisfied with this movie and know there will more than likely be a part 3."
"savior_x","9","0","1","28 October 2005"," Predictable, but also not?!?
","I just saw this film and I must say ""woah""! I cringed, squinted, and said ""ohh ugh"" more than I did watching the first. The sad thing is that I had the entire ending predicted a week before the movie came out. It is really quite like a game, if you think about it. All I did was try to figure out just why the character Amanda would return and why would she be forced to ""play"" again?!? Think about it. A little less than halfway through it I also pretty much figured out the common bond between the captives and where to find the combination. But I would have never thought the film would have ended where it did and even though I new the circumstances of why it all happened, it tied everything together very cleverly. All I am saying is that if you are one who can easily predict the outcome of films, even ones so cleverly written as the ""Saw"" films, then maybe pay a matinÃ©e admission to see it. BUT DO Definitely SEE THIS FILM! I think it is better and more clever than the first. It is more gruesome than the first, but the brutality is clever! Let's shoot for a hat trick!"
"Musicmanbgp","7","0","1","28 October 2005"," Decent Sequel...entertaining movie
","After seeing the first Saw and hearing just a few days after about the upcoming sequel, I was immediately excited at the thought of a new installment. Bottom line- I am NOT disappointed.<br/><br/>In terms of quality- the movie is just average...but then again, when watching Saw, is the quality of acting so important as long as it does not distract you from the movie itself? Also some plot holes...but whatever.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was sweet. My seven dollars was well spent, and the twist (4 for that matter) were straight redonkulous. If you're looking for an entertaining, thrilling movie and not so analytical towards movies, go see Saw 2. But remember, there will be blood. :-) P.S. If you saw Saw 1, get your ass off the computer and go see the sequel with a few buddies with a strong stomach."
"benitez275","8","0","1","28 October 2005"," Good movie You gotta see both!
","If you've seen the first one you'll like this one. This one is better than the first in my opinion. This movie although being about killing and torturing actually teaches you lessons. Just pay attention and you'll know about it. The movie is great if you have seen the first this one will add more I suggest you watching Saw I then Saw II so it will be easier for you to understand. I just got home from seeing it and it leaves you thinking. The director sure has a creative mind in making this movie. If anyone dislikes the movie because of the violence then don't reply on this. Go join another group or something.Well minimum is 10 lines so i am just gonna keep writing. See both movies they're really good it leaves at the edge of your seat the whole time. I liked it so there."
"baseballpimp476","8","0","1","28 October 2005"," Some slight errors, but overall a good movie
","I think it was an actually pretty good movie, another plot twist, pending that my definition of plot twist pasts with the past arguments about the original Saw, but again I left the audience asking myself, ""What in the hell..."" Some things you don't see coming, some things you do. You'd have to go see it, I'm not spoiling it for you.<br/><br/>The whole timed death thing is kinda weird to me though, with the poison and all. Everyone's immune system is different. You can't have it exactly timed to 2 hours. What if a huge fat guy has twice as many white blood cells as someone else and outlives the 2 hours. Oh well, I John could have done his research on their blood samples? Go see it, well worth the $6.50."
