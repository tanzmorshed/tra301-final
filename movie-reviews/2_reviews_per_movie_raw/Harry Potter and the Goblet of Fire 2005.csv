"imdb-10900","8","310","413","22 November 2005"," See the movie for action, read the book for story
","It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The rule of movie editing is when you must trim for time you remove the sub-plots. A lot of story and character development isn't there.<br/><br/>But what is there is a great visual treat. If the movie leaves you with questions just read the book or get the audio version on CD. It would have taken a minimum of another half hour to flesh the movie out and that simply wasn't going to be done by a studio whose primary target is a younger audience. (Note how no studio wants to release an animated film longer than 90 minutes for this reason.) Perhaps Alphonso Curon would have done a better job of cohesion but there really isn't much more that could have been done in the time and the script would have been essentially the same. This movie begs for an extended Lord of the Rings type DVD, another 30 to 60 minutes to give you what was left out for theatrical release.<br/><br/>See it and spend the bucks to see it on the big screen."
"SRArmstrong","3","340","469","18 November 2005"," They got Dumbledore all WRONG!! and lots of other stuff too
","First, the good news -- The special effects and the music in the this movie were the best yet! The underwater scenes especially were very well done. <br/><br/>The thing I disliked most about the movie is that Albus Dumbledore is not portrayed as the calm, wise old wizard he is in the books. Instead he is portrayed as a stormy, confused old man that doesn't have much of a clue what's going on. The character of Dumbledore is just WAY off. In one scene Dumbledore grabs Harry around the neck and shakes him, what's THAT about? The very thought of Albus Dumbledore being physically violent with a student is Absolutely ABSURD!! THATS NOT IN DUMBLEDORE'S CHARACTER!! Real Harry Potter fans all over are going to be outraged by this portrayal of Dumbledore. That pretty much ruined the movie for me. Another thing I didn't like about this movie was that so much of the real story was left out and/or changed. I guess i'm just spoiled because I'm so attached to the books... I know it's impossible to fit that whole story in a 2 1/2 hour movie, but there was some pretty good stuff that was left out.<br/><br/>If you're interested, Some of the things that weren't included in the movie that stuck out in my mind are:<br/><br/><ul><li>The scene where Dudley eats the ton-tongue coffee and has an enlarged tongue. The Dursley's aren't included in this one at all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Weasley's Wizard Weezes are not mentioned</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The character Ludo Bagman is left out altogether</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Winky isn't in the movie</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>S.P.E.W (Society for the Protection of Elfish Welfare), the Elf-rights activist group formed by Hermione, is left out altogether. And i thought this added a lot to the story throughout the book</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hagrid's humiliation at being exposed as a Half-giant is left out, and so of course is Harry, Ron, and Hermione coming to comfort him</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>no Blast-Ended Screwts</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hermione never catches Rita Skeeter in her animagus form (a beetle) as she does in the book</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The scene in which Draco Malfoy is attacked on the train near the end isn't in the movie</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The money Harry wins from the tournament and gives to Fred and George to go toward starting their joke shop is left out</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The discussion with Fudge about Voldemort's return and his refusal to accept it is left out. I don't know how they're going to reconcile this one because Fudge's refusal to accept Voldemort is crucial in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sirius coming to Hogwarts to see Harry after the Third Task is left out</li></ul><br/><br/>I'm still ticked off about Dumbledore... I'm starting to think that the people who make the movies just don't even read the books, because Dumbledore was SO out of character it made me angry. That bothers me more than anything else. I wouldn't rush to see this movie, wait until it comes out on DVD. Besides the good special effects and music, the movie was really bad. I Hope this review has been helpful."
"TheScraggler","6","144","196","18 November 2005"," A huge, HUGE disappointment...
","Before I review the film, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter films and have liked all of them up to this point. I'm not going to compare the movie to the book because, as most people know, they are two completely different animals. There is no way in heaven, hell or on God's green Earth that a book the size of Goblet of Fire could appropriate EVERYTHING that happened in the novel. I'm going to go by what I saw up on the screen.<br/><br/>What I saw up on the screen was a completely pedestrian effort that made no attempt at contributing style, substance, or character development to a series that was getting better and better with each progressive film. Scenes start and stop with no explanation. The big action scenes (especially the fight with the dragon) just begin with no buildup whatsoever almost as if you've stumbled upon someone playing the new Harry Potter video game. There is no sense of the passage of time at all. The Tri-Wizard tournament consists of only three challenges yet the competition seems to last the entire school year. Ron and Hermione have a blow-up at the Yule Ball because of his misplaced jealousy yet six months go by (the last day of school) and NOTHING MORE is ever said about it? She even tells him that he made a mistake by not asking her out and he lets SIX MORE MONTHS go by without saying a word?!<br/><br/>I can forgive the fact that a lot of these things are just glossed over because of the time crunch but I can not forgive situation after situation that has something happen only because the lead character needs to live. In the aforementioned fight with the dragon, Harry ends up hanging from a ledge 100 stories above the ground trying to reach his broom which is nearby. The dragon lands on the building and begins crawling down to him, slipping and sliding, peeling away shingles as it goes and it suddenly hit me. Harry is hanging from a ledge, defenseless, and the dragon is CRAWLING toward him. He is dealing with a creature who spits fire and who can FLY. One flap of its wings and a quick belch and Harry is crispy. The ONLY reason it doesn't is because Harry has to live. <br/><br/>And for that matter, no one in the film acts or reacts to a situation because it's in their nature to do so. They react in a certain way because that's what the script demands that they do, even if it completely goes against their character and everything that we know about them. When Hermione blows up at Ron, it seems to come out of nowhere. She seems to be mad because Ron didn't ask her and she wanted to go with him. But if this is true, why is she so happy about being there with a competitor from a rival school? And I don't just mean happy, I mean she is absolutely BEAMING when she arrives with him. And at one point, Dumbledore grabs Harry and shakes him violently demanding that he answer a question. My reaction to that was WTF??? Has Dumbledore ever shown that he's a violent person or that he would grab a STUDENT, yelling in his face? Of course not but he does it because the script says he has to. At one point in the film, a particular curse is brought up that allows you to control another being. That's kind of funny because it seems like every character in this film is being controlled by the screenplay, even if it means going completely against character.<br/><br/>But I guess the biggest disappointment for me was the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. For someone who has been built up to be the devil, he sure is beaten easily at the end of this film (and by a quartet of ghosts, no less, which took cheesiness to a new level). The appearance of Voldemort is obviously supposed to be chilling but, in actuality, he looks like a hairless rat wearing a cape. The great Ralph Fiennes does everything he can but part of the appeal of this character is NOT seeing him in closeup in full daylight. He shows up when he wants and manages to let Harry live because he'd rather talk him to death instead of just cutting off his head while Harry is pinned down. But, of course, that's because Harry has to live and this final confrontation, again, seems ridiculous in retrospect.<br/><br/>The entire Tri-Wizard tournament seemed a little off-kilter to me. You perform tasks that test your abilities and try to do better than your opponents, but to what end? The final test consists of entering an ever-changing maze and the first competitor to find the trophy wins the tournament. So, even if you finish DEAD LAST in every other challenge, if you're the first to find the trophy, you win anyway. So, I ask you, WHAT'S THE FRIGGIN' POINT OF EVEN COMPETING IN THE OTHER CHALLENGES?????? Why put yourself in harm's way three times when you only HAVE to do it once? <br/><br/>Looking back, I just realized that you could completely skip this film and move right on to number five without missing a beat as long as you had someone to tell you two things about the film - Harry's interest in Cho and Voldemort being back, sort of. Here's hoping Order of the Phoenix doesn't follow the same path."
"Lucifer800","1","253","353","18 November 2005"," horrible idea to make it one movie and not two
","The movie ran as if it were a series of highlight clips from an actual film representation of the fourth harry potter novel. Details were thrown in haphazardly, if for no other reason than to bring a feeling of recognition from readers. If the viewer had not read the book, but only seen the previous two movies, s/he would not have understood the movie. The screenwriters created no semblance complicated plot, but rather the rather single-minded story of the three tasks in the tri-wizard tournament. All new characters were hardly introduced and remained quite one-dimensional, which is unfortunate; even old favorites got the shaft in this one. There was no time for more than two short scenes with either Malfoy, no magical lessons, and Dobby the house elf was completely absent. Crouch never disappeared, but his body was found dead. The cinematics in this case were atrocious: Harry appears in Dumbledore's chambers in the scene immediately after discovering Crouch's body, but then proceeds to tell him about his scar hurting and dreams rather than Crouch's discovery. There was no magical map, no late-night encounters with Moody, no discussion of Snape and Karkaroff's relationship, nor of Dumbledore trusting Snape. Seeing as this relationship will rise to be the single most prominent issue in the entire series, I was very disappointed to find it was ignored in favor of large and ineffective theatrics, such as a hedge maze without any traps, only shifting walls and evil roots, an extremely obnoxious modernized yule ball, and a pointlessly drawn out dragon chase scene. Dumbledore's lines and the directing of his acting made him look like an old, bumbling fool, rather than the clever, most-powerful-wizard on the planet, the only person of whom Voldemort is afraid. The writers decided to add Crouch Jr. into Harry's dreams, completely removed the second house-elf and the invisibility cloak from the quidditch world cup, and had the audacity to explain that Crouch Jr. had been sent to Azkaban, but never explained his escape. Finally, the movie ended with Crouch Jr. being sent back to Azkaban. The Minister of Magic never showed up with dementors to kill Crouch, Dumbledore never argued with him about the verity of Harry's claims, and the potential for an amazing cliff-hanger conclusion with Dumbledore in all his might giving orders to Hagrid and others as a general before the final battle, was instead replaced by a horrible attempt at a eulogy combining direct quotations from the novel with poor scriptwriting to make Dumbledore out to be a poor speaker as well as incompetent wizard. I shudder to think how the next movie will have to deal with all of these plot gaps, and how Dumbledore can hope to maintain any semblance of respectability when he trusts Snape and continues to avoid Harry in the fifth movie. Much better would have been to stick with the original idea and make two movies. This movie didn't feel like it had any plot, one did not become attached to the characters, and spent the movie groaning or laughing at the contrived immaturity of it all. Some acting by Harry and friends was good, but it was overshadowed by a terrible attempt to fit everything and nothing into the movie."
"cosmic_quest","6","432","623","18 November 2005"," Good though rushed
","Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.<br/><br/>I have to say I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy (now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term!), but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out-of-character and the scene does drag).<br/><br/>The acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF, Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However, the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scene-stealing depiction of Mad-Eye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous, feral edge.<br/><br/>The younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis, who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast, though, Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA, he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath, depicting Harry's anger, feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I, at last, have faith he might be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.<br/><br/>The film did lose points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on, Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of over-enunciating her lines and being too melodramatic, which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy, but is just annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears or in a hormonal snit, even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film, as if Steve Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a two-hour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed, especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the Molly/Harry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel as the film didn't round off in a manner that reflected a boy had died and Harry would be traumatised by what he saw.<br/><br/>I think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Non-fans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or, at the very least, check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it, there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident, the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying, 'Mummy, I'm scared' so, parents, be warned."
"cryptkeeper3000","4","96","135","18 November 2005"," The worst Potter film yet.
","I have to say, I'm really disappointed in how this film turned out, especially in comparison with how great the book is. In my humble opinion, studios have to face up to the fact that two and a half hours is no longer sufficient to capture the scope and power of J.K. Rowling's universe.<br/><br/>In this film, Harry is forced to enter the Triwizard Tournament when someone unknown puts his name into the Goblet of Fire, a magical artifact that serves as the selector of competitors from each participating school. The special effects, as always, are spectacular, but they seem to be a cover for a lack of effort, not the results of a work of love.<br/><br/>All of the highlights of the book are shown; the Quidditch World Cup, Harry's battle with the dragon, the underwater world of the merpeople and the enchanted hedge maze are all done in exquisite detail. But this only seems to point up the movie's shortfalls. Michael Gambon has none of Richard Harris' quiet dignity or unflappable demeanor as Dumbledore; instead he seems to jump at every shadow and constantly be lost in the situation. The worst example of this is when he almost tackles Harry and desperately interrogates him on whether he put his name in the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>The movie skips from one event to the next with very little shown of the intervening time; action is held up as a replacement for character development and plot. Draco Malfoy, the cruel bully everyone loves to hate, is only shown twice through the whole film. Mad-Eye Moody, beautifully portrayed by Brendan Gleeson, is given little to do other than push Harry along. Nothing is explained of the backstory between Barty Crouch and his son, nor of Snape's past or what Dumbledore intends to do in the face of Voldemort's return.<br/><br/>Along that line, Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Lord Voldemort suffers in much the same way Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore does. Instead of the patient, cunning Dark Lord I'd come to expect from the first two movies, he is easily angered and has no control of his emotions or reactions, much less the situation. The scene should look hopeless, but it is obvious right from the start that Harry is more than Voldemort's equal. In the same scene, Timothy Spall seems almost bored in his portrayal of Wormtail, reacting to the loss of his hand with as little pain or emotion as one would scratching an itch. He literally doesn't seem to feel it.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I think I've made my point. Don't go expecting the magic of the first three films; it's gone, and only a severe rearrangement of cast, director and editor will bring it back if this franchise hopes to survive. If you must see it in a theater (and for all its faults, I recommend doing that at least once), see it in a matinée or better yet, wait until it's in a dollar theater."
"em_1986","7","202","297","18 November 2005"," what the hell?!
","As a fan of the potter book series, I'm going to start with my opinion of the movie,and then I'm going to slaughter the adaption.<br/><br/>as a movie this was ALMOST amazing. the special effects (other than the captives under the water) were generally of an excellent standard. The acting of the trio was well above what it has been previously. Especially in the case of Emma Watson, who was initially terrible but has improved with each movie. Bravo i say! Rupert Grint is always a joy to watch. he really is Ron Wealsey for me, despite that fact that hes the same height as Radcliffe. speaking of Radcliffe, i was exceptionally impressed! he was brilliant for the most part, but especially during the scenes with Voldemort in the grave yard and when he returned to Hogwarts. However, credit given to those, i have to say that Alan Rickman as Snape is the best! This isn't just because he is my favourite character but i genuinely thought that he was brilliant, particularly during the scene when Harry and Ron keep talking. dumbledore on the other hand was atrocious. I'm afraid this is where my commentary moves onto slaughtering the adaption.<br/><br/>Since when exactly, has Dumbledore ever lost control and shaken Harry. If this is how he reacts to harry's name being entered, what the hell is he going to do when Harry destroys his office in The Order of the Pheonix. Michael Gambon may be a fine actor but he just isn't Dumbledore.and is it me or did the film lack certain key elements that made the book? such as the fact that Harry has a parent figure now? when the Thing with Sirius happens in OOTP, the audience wont know anything about him. And the scene with the Dursleys at the beginning was one of the best in the book! I understand that for the obvious reasons such as time management, certain elements have to be omitted, but this really did take the biscuit. Why alter scenes which arnt vital to the book, such as the way that the first task played out, and then cut what makes the books great. The two things that really wound me up were the way that Sirius appeared in the fire (why the hell they did it like that ill never understand) and the change in who gave Harry the Gillyweed. Those changed really were pointless.<br/><br/>When viewed as a movie in its own right the Goblet of Fire is as enjoyable, thrilling and down right scary as the book is, but as an adaption, to be quite honest, it was a let down."
"egarmon","4","77","108","18 November 2005"," Highly Disappointing
","I have to say that I disagree with almost every review posted here. I traveled for an hour to see the movie at midnight, for the first showing. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film. How disappointed I was. I must say that I think that the fourth book is perhaps the weakest in the series, but it is still a good read. The movie, however, was by far the worst yet. So many important details were left out, the movie raced along trying to fit as much plot into two and a half hours as possible. Of course there was excitement, funny moments,and talented acting. But overall, the plot moved so quickly, that one barely felt any connection to the characters involved other than what has been built up from the last three movies and the book. The Yule Ball was ridiculous, and Hermione (Emma Watson) was overly dramatic. The challenges in the Tri-Wizard Tournament were rushed through and the other competitors characters were not built up. You barely know, yet alone feel anything about Viktor Krum, Fleur, or even Cedric Diggory. The special effects were great, but could not make up for the loss of the ""magic"" felt in the books and other movies. The final scene with Voldemort was well-done. Scary, suspenseful, exciting. But I must say I will not be seeing this movie again in the theaters as I have the last three."
"AetherTheory","9","50","68","21 November 2005"," Shortest 2.5 hour movie
","Mike Newell is forgiven for cutting out so much detail from the book, and JK Rowling is forgiven for writing wonderfully rich books. However, fans of the book cannot help but feel like riding a roller coaster that is so fast there is no time to enjoy the ride. I predict the huge void between book and movie will spur remakes in about 10 to 20 years. Even if the movies must be 5 hours long, Harry Potter fans are willing to sit through them. This movie doesn't get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation. All said and done, this is the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever watched."
"h2o_ns","1","82","119","19 November 2005"," A movie standing alone
","There are a lot of things wrong with this movie and the part that's really wrong are the characters. 1000 words aren't enough to explain everything so I'll have to be brief. The worst character is Dumbledore. What version of him Kloves & Newell see I have no idea.. I mean, have they read the books at all? Would Albus Dumbledore, one of the greatest wizards alive manhandle one of his own students, especially his favorite student? I should think not. Would he use Harry as bait to lure Voldemort out of hiding? Same answer as above, NO. Gambon can't play him to save his life, Richard Harris could, he had the twinkle in his eyes... something that makes Dumbledore so special. Gambon just comes off as a lunatic.<br/><br/>If it isn't broken, why change it? So why change the first task? Why is Harry getting attacked by the dragon as soon as he leaves the tent? In the book he get's on his Firebolt first... he doesn't run around and almost die for 5 minutes. But then, finally he's in the air and I thought they'd stick to what's in the book but no. There is a chain instead of the dragon being a nesting mother, protecting its eggs. Instead of Harry luring the dragon to get airborne by gently guiding it upwards, teasing it, tempting it, we get this chain that breaks (What happened to the new security measures?) and a stupid dragon that forgets it can fly and has to climb instead.<br/><br/>The second task. This is where a part of me died inside. When Harry get's pushed in by Moody and doesn't re-surface at once Neville goes South Park. ""Oh my god, I killed Harry Potter!"". I'm sorry but Kloves, Newell or just about ANYONE involved in the making of this movie, how on earth could you let him say that! South Park quotes, although hilarious and one of my absolute favorite shows of all time has no right to be in a HP movie! Didn't you think we'd notice!? *exhale, calm down* The third task. What happened to the Sphinx? What about the Acromantula, we do know they exist thanks to Chris Columbus, why couldn't Harry help Cedric out there instead? So you skipped the Blast-Ended Screwts but you could have at least given us one of the other two...<br/><br/>The graveyard. This scene is very right and very wrong at the same time. Wormtail (Who was just awful in PoA) is just as bad here, and what is wrong with the other Death Eaters? Wormtail including the others are terrified that Voldemort is actually back! One of them flings himself onto the ground, crawling towards Voldemort while begging for forgiveness and kissing his robes, and get's tortured in the book. I think Ralph does a good job of Voldemort, since the make up or whatever they used makes it hard for him to really use his face which is basically the real problem. Where are those red slits for eyes? They're what really makes him creepy in the book... but then again (Yes Kloves & Newell, I'm pointing at you) where is his thirst for repayment of his 13 lost years? I didn't see it at all. There is also a BIG problem with the name Voldemort. It is said out loud at the QWC after the Death Eaters have had a go at the tents but no one shudders? They don't even use You-Know-Who, they actually say Voldemort? Where's the gasps when Dumbledore says Voldemort in front of the whole school? This is something established so early in the series, did you actually forget it?<br/><br/>Why is Harry wearing the newest Levis jeans... what happened to him wearing Dudleys old cast-offs? Perhaps Hermione has done some shopping for him since she apparently has taken a liking to pink clothes.. what was wrong with the blue dress she had in the book? Is blue a more expensive color to make a dress in or something? Or is it because we have to see her girlie side in GoF? First you took her bushy hair... now the pink dress.. I don't even want to know what's going to happen to her in Order of the Phoenix. Also, who the hell was Nigel? Why not use Colin or Dennis Creevey? They're already established characters for gods sake! What happened to Filch? When did he stop being bitter, evil and quite frankly a real bastard? He's the caretaker that wants to whip students, hang them from their ankles in the dungeons dammit, not some idiot jumping around and firing off cannons... and why on earth is McGonagall teaching them how to dance? Would she order a student to place his hand on her waist? I don't think so... even if you haven't read the books you must have noticed that she'd never do that.<br/><br/>I think the only good thing about this whole movie was Ginny. She showed me that she can act (She just didn't get much screen time in Chamber of Secrets, even if she was very promising), that she's sweet and has a temper! Finally a character that's actually working! Although I really did miss the moment where Ron suggests that she can go with Harry to the Yule-Ball. Sure, there's action, there's cool special effects but it's just not what the STORY is about and the story is what makes Harry Potter special, something more then your regular Hollywood script action movie. It, just like PoA get's an extremely well deserved 1."
"ridethewind","8","12","14","25 November 2005"," It's a movie, NOT the book
","As a huge fan of the books, we have to keep this in context. This is a movie, there is no way it could have included all of the book. I use the movies as fillers between the books, entertaining, but just fillers. That said, there were some glaring omissions that are vital to the next book. Why did Mike Newell extend the dragon scene, but leave out key characters? - because mistakenly Hollywood thinks that such exciting CGI is more important to the fans of the books than expanding characters and plot details. Wrong. But we will go and see the movie anyway.<br/><br/>I felt the movie was chopped up. The Quiddich World Cup while fascinatingly done in the movie was over so quickly that it barely seemed to be a part of the plot. Mr Crouch is suddenly dead, but it is just left dangling. Why bother to have Sirius in the movie at all, his brief scene in the fire was really disappointing, his head should have been fully out of the embers, as in the book, not part of the embers. He was barely recognizable as Sirius. What a waste.<br/><br/>No Ludo, no Winky and Dumbledore looking like a bumbling idiot rather than the world's most powerful wizard. Most importantly the whole end of the book is gone where he has a parting of the ways with Fudge and the Ministry of Magic, because of Fudge's refusal to believe that Voldermort is back. This whole scene sets up the next book.<br/><br/>So where does this movie adaptation shine? In the script and the impeccable casting. Despite what some have said about Daniel Radcliffe, he IS Harry. From the first movie, his sweet innocence to how he has grown into the part, he remains the face I see when I read the books. Emma Watson needs to tone down her overacting a bit, she was near perfect in the first movie, but hasn't really developed her character much. Rupert Grint really shines in this movie, his face is handsome, and funny and full of expression, he is the perfect Ron. The Phelps boys, as Fred & George really come into their own in this movie although how they are to start their joke shop without Harry's Tri-wizard winnings in film #5, is a question since it was entirely missing from the movie. And it was nice to see Neville getting a bigger more important role, even though all of his key info was left out of the movie. And now I've read book six, Snape takes on a whole new meaning to me and again Alan Rickman has been the perfect Snape in all of the movies.<br/><br/>The question as to whether the three main characters should remain on after the release of the 5th movie in summer 2007 seems a dumb question to me. Since when has Hollywood ever cared about the age of an actor and the part he or she is playing? How often have we had 20 somethings playing teenagers! There comes a time when the age of Daniel, Emma and Rupert will not matter to the audience. Personally I hope that they play in all of the movies.<br/><br/>They say that JK Rowling has a big say in what stays in and what is left out of her books, because she alone knows what happens and how each piece of the jigsaw fits. She must have been on holiday when decisions were made for this movie. Perhaps ""the Director's Cut"" DVD will explain that also..."
"HMSDauntless","1","59","89","21 November 2005"," Worst Harry Potter Film so far
","This is the worst conversion of book to screenplay in the whole series. From the first scene where there are characters in the movie scene that are not in the book scene, to added scenes in the storyline, to radically changed scenes in the triwizard trials, this screenplay bares only a passing resemblance to the book. The book was fine, and had plenty of drama and excitement at the needed times. there was no need to rewrite the story, only trim it down for runtime.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed watching this, and surprised to see that it was the same screenwriter as the first three films, since this was of such substantially lower quality.<br/><br/>And the director completely wasted Brendan Gleeson as Moody. This is an incredibly talented actor, and should have been an anchor of the movie. instead, he's almost nothing like the character in the book, even going as far as substituting a metal leg for the wood one. he's practically a footnote to the whole movie.<br/><br/>And the final showdown in the graveyard felt incredibly rushed. there's been four movies and 1500 pages of book building to this scene, the scene were everyone finally sees Voldemort in the flesh, and watches him duel with Harry. this should have been a powerful climax, yet is over almost as soon as it's begun.<br/><br/>bottom line, get a new director, and a new screenwriter for the next one. if the climax at the Ministry of Magic is as bad as the climax of this movie, the series will lose a lot of fans."
"Joey_the_random","5","39","57","18 November 2005"," I didn't think it was great
","I went to see this movie this afternoon and to be honest i was expecting disappointment as happened with the other three potter movies but i wasn't quite expecting what i saw. I am a lover of the books and have read them all many (10+) times (ex HBP) and hate it when important bits of the plot are cut. I think in terms of effects and general film making the film was good, the acting from the majority of the cast was also excellent, however i feel that the movie moved too fast and didn't really explain what was going on. If you've seen the trailer you have pretty much seen the movie. Much of the Plot involving Rita skeeter was cut (i think we only saw her twice) which i find very disappointing as it sets up the fifth book and the ""harry is crazy, look at what was said about him in the prophet last year"" plot. One surprise for me though was Mad-eye-moody, after seeing the trailers and photos i was dreading him being played as a joke character with his mad eye but i was very impressed with his character and performance although i did notice the lack of CONSTANT VILIGANCE. Overall i think this movie could be used as a 'look what i can do with my computer' movie. In my opinion if you want a good plot and more than one comprehenseable storyline you should go read the book."
"BeforeDarknessFalls","7","169","277","14 November 2005"," Pretty darn good
","First of all, I must mention that Goblet of Fire is my favourite Harry Potter book, and so I expected great things from this movie. And great things I did get, but they were entirely unexpected.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Harry being shaken awake by Hermione in The Burrow. This itself gives us a glimpse into Mike Newell's thought process. Mike Newell and writer Steve Kloves seem to be Harry/Hermione advocators to a small extent. It's not so much as the fact that they show Harry and Hermione to be better friends than Ron and Hermione, which isn't really true to the books, it more the fact that they've made Hermione tag along or take care of Harry in several scenes.<br/><br/>As the subject matter of the Goblet of Fire book was too vast, many scenes in the movie have been sliced so that it deals with action rather than explanations. In a way, this works. On the other hand, Potter fans will surely expect some more details, and this, I predict will be the main negative response to Newell's work. The end particularly requires an explanation. Newell leaves things a bit up in the air. But this doesn't mean the movie is bad or disappointing. At least not for me. It is filled with laugh-out-loud moments, thrilling action sequences and a few new surprises that will captivate you. Truly, It has some wonderful scenes which seem like they've been plucked from your imagination. Voldemort's rebirth for instance.<br/><br/>And speaking of Voldemort, I must say Ralph Fiennes has done a remarkable job. The make up artist and computer animation guys must have worked hard too  Voldemort looks just as evil and scary as he should! This is one of the reasons that the movie has received a PG-13 rating. The highly suggestive yet hilarious scene in the Prefects bathroom, as well as a few very suggestive dialogues here and there also explain the rating.<br/><br/>The movie's casting has been tastefully done. The new actors have managed to remain true to the characters that they play, and are very believable. Miranda Richardson makes a fantastic Rita Skeeter. Stanislav Ianevski (Krum) and Robert Pattinson (Cedric) are well cast and play their roles well. Clémence Poésy makes a good Fleur Delacour, but Mike Newell should have let her keep her hair down.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, Matthew Lewis and Brendan Gleeson gave very good performances. Matthew Lewis, although he has grown out of his short and pudgy first-movie form and has become tall and slim, has nonetheless managed to keep Neville alive and kicking. There are many funny scenes as well as scenes that can only be described as 'cute' involving him. As for Brendan Gleeson, I didn't think much of him as 'Mad-Eye' Moody when I saw the trailers and the teaser pictures. But he makes a great Moody, crazy, loud and sometimes scary.<br/><br/>There was much debate about the casting of Frances de la Tour as Madame Maxime as many seemed to think that she didn't fit the part. I can see their point, since she isn't the best Maxime they could have got, but she wasn't too bad. Pedja Bjelac (also known as Predrag, in case you're wondering) made a wonderful Karkaroff.<br/><br/>As for the carry-over actors from the last movie into this one, I have to say that I am most impressed with Emma Watson's performance. (and of course Matthew Lewis, whom I have already mentioned.) Emma manages to capture the essence of 14-year-old Hermione quite well. Rupert Grint gives his 100% Ron. Sometimes it's hard not to imagine Ron as Rupert while reading the books. Daniel Radcliffe, the 'star' himself, has greatly improved in terms of acting since Prisoner of Azkaban and, although his performance is uneven, he still manages to be a convincing Harry. The Phelps Twins are remarkable as Fred and George and entertain with their hilarious banter and excellent screen presence. Bonnie Wright (Ginny) has a bigger role in this movie than in any of the others. She has almost no dialogue, but is present in many scenes here and there, which is something. Tom Felton, too, has a very small role. In fact he's only present in three scenes, one of which I am pleased to announce involves Professor Moody! But enough about the talented actors that have been a part of this magical movie. What about the scenes everyone has been waiting to see? Are they well done? What has been kept? What has been cut? I'm afraid you'll have to see the movie for that. If I begin to dissect this movie into what was well done and what wasn't, this review will probably be 8 pages long. All I can say is that this movie will make you feel happy, sad, anxious and surprised at the same time. It will make you laugh out loud, jump in surprise and gasp all at once. Prepare yourselves for a ride filled with mixed emotions. It's advisable to be prepared  This ride can get very overwhelming!"
"volrath88","1","61","94","18 November 2005"," this movie should have never been released such as it is
","this movie was horrible. all that you get from it is a very basic plot outline. there are huge time gaps, changes in scenes, and total disregard for what happens in the book. all of the subtle nuances that make the harry potter series great are missing from this movie. some scenes are completely changed from the book. the horntail scene, world cup scene, and many many others are completely redone. this being said, there were some impressive CGI effects done. the world cup stadium, though they do not seat harry and his friends in the correct place, and do not show the match its self (which was personally very disappointing, because i had been looking forward to seeing the match quite a lot) is, as a CGI work alone, very impressive, as is the maze at the end. despite these minor interesting details, the majority of the movie is very poorly done in relation to the book. accordingly, this is easily the worst of the four movies released to date."

What happened to Dumbledore explaining the fact that Harry and Voldemort's wands had the same core, and that the feather came from Fawkes? Why didn't they play out Ron and Harry's fight better?

"joestank15","10","142","234","18 November 2005"," Dark, and funny.
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Harry (Dan Radcliffe) enters his fourth year of Hogwarts and is entered into the incredibly dangerous Triwizard tournament by an anonymous stranger. All hail to Mike Newell, the director of this masterpiece! The movie forgoes the happiness and frivolity of the previous movies and replaces it with teen problems (done very funnily of course), epic action sequences and hilarious British humor.<br/><br/>Coming back to the show are the fantastic three. Dan has come into his own. He is Harry. He is vulnerable, angry, not always sure what to do, and has actually gotten quite good at comedy routines. Rupert Grint is not just used for comedic relief this time. He gets jealous of Harry for getting into the tournament, and is tired of being referred to as ""Harry Potter's Stupid Friend"". Emma Watson is beautiful and plays the supporter of Harry largely, but does it well. The other children are a blast to watch, especially Neville and Fred and George. I liked how more attention came to the character of Cedric Diggory, and his brief relationship to Harry.<br/><br/>The adult actors are sparingly but well used. Alan Rickman only has two main scenes (He probably did about one day of filming) but it's just enough. Maggie Smith is equally funny and Micheal Gambon is used more than in the previous film. He thankfully has one fatherly scene in this film, which was lacking in PoA. Brendan Gleeson is hilariously over-the-top as ""Mad-Eye"", a vicious old dark wizard catcher assigned to be the new Dark Arts teacher.<br/><br/>The humor has grown more adult, which fits the growing audience better. Sexuality and Excellent Writing replace most of the repetition gags and silly physical humor of Columbus and Cuaron. This fits J.K. Rowling's style much better actually. It's all very funny and very British, as it should be. As for the teen problems? Getting a date for the dance, and learning to dance. Dealing with rejection and hormones. We've all been there. It's all very real and well done. These kids feel like real people, not mythical elves or gods.<br/><br/>The movie is close to 3 hours, but chances are you'll spend most of it either laughing or terrified. Harry's round with the dragon is intensely scary but amazing. His second task, slightly less so, but the dragon was a tough act to follow. The maze is scary, easily a villain by itself. Think ""The Shining"" on crack. The finale will leave pretty much anyone with a soul breathless and crying. Ralph Fiennes is terrifying as Voldemort. Dark times indeed.<br/><br/>Not for anyone who hasn't seen the other movies or read the books (or doesn't want to because it's not ""cool""), but who gives a crap about them? Not for kids under 12 (they'll go to see it anyway, I've seen 7 year olds read the 6th book), but this stuff is scary for anyone. Diehards who want every side-plot of the book included will be disappointed. C'mon guys, the movie's almost 3 hours anyway (Though I was genuinely disappointed at the lack of further exposition about Neville Longbottom)! The movie does the best at being comprehensible without aid of reference from the books of it's predecessors, and is a genuinely exceptional comedy/thriller, and feels epic and yet real. And that's a tall order to deliver for a story about magic and a wizard. Mike Newell is a god truly.<br/><br/>Not for the faint of heart, this gets an A"
"jgarrick","8","282","486","20 November 2005"," Best Potter Yet
","I'd hate to face the task of condensing a 700 page book into a movie - even a two and a half hour movie, but they've managed pretty well with this installment of the adventures of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>For fans of the movies, you'll find this installment a little darker, a little grittier, and a little more involving. The characters are growing up and are now facing more adult situations with more adult outlooks.<br/><br/>For fans of the books, you should find this adaptation a commendable reflection of Rowling's tale. Naturally, some parts had to be modified or cut entirely - there's no way to avoid that without making it a 10 hour movie - but the parts that were cut were either not critical to the story line, or will be easy to account for in the films to come. Unless you're an obsessive nitpicker about every last detail, you should find this a satisfactory film version of Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire works well as a stand-alone film, as a film version of Rowling's book, and is in my opinion quite easily the best Potter movie yet."
"tinkerbelljsg","1","36","54","21 November 2005"," Not good at all
","It was toooooo rushed. The length of this book should have been matched with a movie the caliber of the lord of the rings movies. It was too unfaithful to the books and left out many characters or made them too small. Rita Skeeter was barely in it, you didn't feel the evil that should have emanated from her. Plus, nothing happened to her at the end. If these movies are to be the standard for Harry Potter movies to come, true fans should be disgusted. Dobby, Winky, Ludo Bagman, Hogwarts classes in general, other students, the Dursleys, Ton-Tongue toffees, all gone. Shunted to the side was the whole graveyard scene, Voldemort wasn't scary at all, Dumbledore was almost violent to Harry. Overall, there wasn't enough time in the film to give the characters their due limelight. With Rita Skeeter not caught, no Winky, Sirius almost non-existent, the next movie will probably sink as low as this one and its predecessors. If these books are so long, the movies should be made longer."

"Kaphlooey","1","23","33","1 August 2007"," For equivalent reading experience, skip every other chapter in the 'Goblet' book
","At the time this film came out, I was convinced that it indicated that the longer the Harry Potter book, the worse the film. Now, with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix out, I am relieved that this isn't the case -- instead, I now fully comprehend how thoroughly bad this picture is.<br/><br/>It starts out good enough with a dark, scary and well directed scene where Voldemort feels immensely more menacing than he is at the end of the film. Then we cut to our beloved protagonist, squirming in his bed at the Dursl-- no, wait a minute, that's the Burrow! Damn, I think, Newell weaselled (no pun intended) me out of seeing my favourite nasty relatives. Oh, well, at least I'll get to enjoy the weirdness of the Weasley home for a whil-- no, strike that, apparently they're heading straight to the Quidditch World Cup.<br/><br/>I think you see The Goblet of Fire's main flaw. It lies not in the acting, as usual carried out by Britain's finest, nor, I don't think, in the screen writing, as Mr. Steve Kloves acquitted himself well enough in the three previous outings. No - it's the directing. It's as if first-timer Mike Newell weighed the seven-hundred page book in his hand and said to himself ""oh, how will I ever fit all this into one film?"". The film jumps, at a maddening, jerky pace that makes you want to cry out, ""but I wanted to see that!"" Case in point: Harry and the Weasleys barely have the time to find their seats at the Stadium, before the game's over and we're inside their tent again. Mind you, I wasn't exactly a fan of the Quidditch game in the book, but at least a glimpse of it -- a teensy little montage? A minute of Death Eater-induced panic later, and we're on the Hogwarts Express. Half a second of Cho Chang later, and we're at Hogwarts, seeing the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang schools arrive - apparently on the same day. What on earth they're doing there so early is anyone's guess, since the Triwizard Tournament still doesn't seem to start until Halloween, which would allow for nearly two months application time to the Goblet of Fire. And on it goes. The only really good scene (apart from Hermione, like all the women in the film, acting like a frail damsel in distress) in which the students have their first DADA lesson with Mad-Eye Moody passes by all to quickly, and then we're jumping and jerking about the plot again. Harry has a falling out with Ron, signified by Rupert Grint dramatically lowering his eyebrows down to his cheek bones. Big deal. Harry kicks the living crap out of a dragon. Wow. Harry and Ron make up. Happy to hear it.<br/><br/>And then, suddenly, Newell hits the brakes. The ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" director sees in the Yule Ball semi-familiar ground, and he seems intent to squeeze all the juice there is out of it. Harry and Ron talk about girls, learn to dance and behave like unbelievable prats to both the Patil twins. Meanwhile, Hermione strikes up a relationship with Viktor Krum, Hagrid woos the plus-size Madame Maxine, and we are then treated to the musical stylings of a wizard rock band, telling us to ""boogie down like a unicorn"" (which the probably imperiused crowd subsequently does). It's all very cutesy, all very non-Potterish. Hermione and Ron are especially egregious in this part of the movie -- Harry just seems oddly vacant.<br/><br/>The movie trudges along, occasionally giving reason to hope, only to quickly dash it again with a mind-boggling jump. Finally, we reach the ending, where the maze is nowhere near as challenging as it was in the book, and where Voldemort's rebirth is strangely anticlimactic and unfulfilling. Cedric Diggory dies, impostor Moody is exposed, Ron and Hermione exchange some glib remarks that trivialise the whole ending, and that's the film.<br/><br/>Now, a lot of people like this film. Rotten Tomatoes ranks it higher than its successor, Order of the Phoenix. This, to me, is inexplicable. Sure, a lot of things have to be scrapped to fit any novel into a two-hour movie. But a good adaptation, such as Order of the Phoenix, does that without you noticing it. Instead, Goblet of Fire rather seems to be making a point out of making omissions glaringly obvious. Even non-Potterians would probably surmise that the book covered the Quidditch game even though the film didn't, because the cut is made so quickly that Newell seems to hope that viewers will just think they dozed off during the game. Actually, all it does is leave us with a nonsensical, disjointed mess that will make you long for the comparative greatness of Chris Columbus. At least he knows how to do an establishing shot."
"Havoc1","6","32","48","18 November 2005"," The PR Machine Fails the Product... Again.
","-=-=-=-SUMMARY: The movie leaves a lot to be desired. It nails its dark ending, but the rest of the film is disjointed and without substance. Why? It puts a little of everything in, rather than a lot of a few things. ""Star"" characters Krum, Fleur, Cedric, and Cho get the shaft in a big way -- but at least it looks pretty?-=-=-=-<br/><br/>I'm so sick of PR. ""Goblet of Fire"" comes out, and doesn't live up to the PR machine. This film was showcased as the TriWizard Tournament with some Yule Ball flavor. Instead, the film is schizophrenic and doesn't address either plot satisfactorily.<br/><br/>That doesn't make the film unenjoyable. It is well produced, with a high-and-shiny gloss that makes it picture-perfect. The locales are gorgeous. The cast is gorgeous. Ralph Finnes and the graveyard scene ending is done without flaw. But the whole picture is hollow. In short, it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Take, for example, the TriWizard Tournament. Four contestants, three new schools, two new love interests -- and we learn nothing about them. Nothing. Fleur has a total of 2 lines. At least Clemency Posey tries to give the character a bit of dignity with some naturally added and improvised French to contrast with all of the sexism the gal faces. Viktor Krum is just for looks, as he literally has 2 lines. TWO. And the one he says to Hermione is barely audible. Cho Chang - with Katie Leung being subject to much controversy - gets three lines. Three. THREE! Cedric comes off as the most substantial character, which isn't saying much.<br/><br/>I don't blame this on director Newell, but rather the Potter source material as a whole. For one, fan boys and fan girls - hellbent on everything being lifted directly from Rowling's ""divine word"" - are crippling a potentially successful film franchise. None of these have been so glaring as ""Goblet of Fire."" Secondly, the film is handicapped by the ongoing script that is the Harry Potter novel series. ""Lord of the Rings"" it ain't. Whereas Peter Jackson, Phillipa, and Fran could take the trilogy and work around the major subplots, the HP crew cannot. No one knows what subplots JK will use, abuse, neglect, discard, or revive. What character will be essential? Which one is not? Since the screenwriters don't know, then it makes sense to leave in a little bit of everything, which takes away from the ""whole lot of some things"" essential to making ""The Goblet of Fire"" a stand-alone story.<br/><br/>It should have stripped to the basics: - TriWizard Tournament - Yule Ball, with some Cho/Harry, Ron/Hermione, Hermione/Krum characterization, with a bit of Patil twin thrown in. <br/><br/>And, in the end, the return of Voldemort. Instead, the movie attempts to juggle its insane cast: Snape, Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy, Hagrid, Ginny, Dean, Seamus, Fred&George, Dumbledore, Moody, McGonagall, Flitwick, Neville, Rita, and so on and so forth that it cannot adequately address its new characters. And since so many of these new characters have never before appeared in a Potter film adaptation, they never receive sufficient exposition or introduction.<br/><br/>The Patil sisters are never expressly named; Parvati is only named outside of a scene. Never appeared in a movie. Cho Chang is never even given a named introduction. Never been in a movie. Cedric Diggory is never given sufficient introduction. Fleur and Krum have no lines, so it is moot. Madame Maxime gets a few awkward scenes with Hagrid. Karkaroff has a pointless subplot that goes nowhere.<br/><br/>Thus, the movies are becoming increasingly convoluted -- and for those who haven't read the books, it becomes difficult to decipher. Wait until Movie 5 tries to add in ""Luna Lovegood."" It'll be a field day for sure. The real problem is that Harry Potter isn't completed. We're leading to a Hermione/Ron romance, but we don't know if they will get together. This need to leave in a little of everything kills the films and, in turn, the films put a clamp on the direction of the stories. The insane market-hype that is ""Harry Potter"" is neither giving the film nor print franchises the creative space to grow.<br/><br/>The acting is still the same for the children - over-emotional. Mad Eye Moody adds character, charm, and much needed pizazz into an otherwise ""color by numbers"" tale. Hermione (who I adored in the 3rd film) and Dumbledore were very off - Dumbledore seeming irritable and aloof throughout, and Hermione overly shrill. Emma: chill with the eyebrows. Dan Radcliffe looks like a Harry Potter, but still struggles with the key scenes. Ron is Ron, though he isn't too likable in this film with his unnecessary melodrama. The timing is off -- the ""guest"" schools visit for an entire academic year, with one of the three challenges occurring in fall, a Winter Ball on Christmas Eve, and two challenges in the Spring. All of this time flies by with no character interaction, growth, or even any ""Nancy Drewing"" on the part of our protagonists.<br/><br/>C'est la vie, in the end it's all moot for the Potter fan. The film looks beautiful, but leaves a lot to be desired. The hardcore Potter fans (like my boyfriend and sister) don't seem to care. Even I, a non-hardcore fan, feel like there needs to be some sense of artistic freedom in these film adaptations.<br/><br/>Break-Down Pros: Gorgeous Cinematography, Special Effects Best of the Series, Costumes, Sets, and Characters look phenomenal, The showdown with Voldemort at the end is near perfect. <br/><br/>Cons: Still too many unnecessary subplots and characters, Not enough focus on our ""new"" characters, choppy scenes, over-acting from Emma Watson and Dan Radcliffe.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 6/10. You'll see it regardless. It's an entertaining time, but leaves a lot to be desired."
"khimaera_tia","4","32","48","18 November 2005"," A Midnight Disappointment
","Before I hear the ""You can't expect it to follow the books"", the people who seem so firmly set on this was a good movie, best yet, and that it did the book justice I have to ask why.<br/><br/>In the first scene, it comes to the house of Riddle, as in the book. But instead of it just being Nagini, Wormtail and Voldemort in the room, there is also Barty Crouch Jr? What? I know that they had to cut things out but to manipulate the plot line so that things fit the way that the director wanted and not how many avid fans would want is beyond me. He had the option of making it a two part series, and in that I think he would have been able to do a lot more justice to the books then chopping it all to an atrociously choppy film. It was choppy, and for people who don't read the books it will be confusing and misleading, especially if they read them later on.<br/><br/>I had the, unfortunate idea that I should read the GoF before seeing the movie, as I was excited about all of the things that would happen. Some people don't miss the Dursleys, the Weasleys, and the opening feast, but I did. What happened at the Dursleys leaves things open for what happens in book/movie 5. At the Burrow we lost Mrs. Weasley, Percy, Charlie and Bill. Each of which did a lot of growing in the book and would affect later plot lines in the story. I know, they are lengthy, but the slow start to the story is put there for a reason. There is a reason for each of the scenes as they are written as per the book.<br/><br/>I understand that they would not be able to fit everything in, but to cut out people from the story, manipulate it as they have, what is going to happen in the sixth movie? In this story Fleur and Bill would have met by chance, but nothing. In this story, Sirius was a bigger piece of the plot, and one of the few that was holding on to Harry. They cut out a lot of Rita Skeeter and the effect she had on the book, the other characters involved. It was like this movie was not to be about the story, but simply the Tri-Wizard cup. Alright, let me try it from that angle.<br/><br/>In the scene with the dragons, someone was really CGI happy. This is obvious in the long, drawn out, far from the story line, Hungarian Horntail chasing Harry around the grounds of Hogwarts. Did I miss something in reading the books? The mer-people and the scene there was closer, a lot closer and yet still things were missing. The seats weren't over the water, they were on the shore, and one of the mer-people, the Cheiftaness no less was to be there. And lets not forget the champion eating hedges for the maze, instead of blast ended skrewts, the spider, the traps, and the Sphinx.<br/><br/>OK, I am dragging on.<br/><br/>Overall, acting was alright, not spectacular, but not frighteningly far from the story. Voldemort was played with a particular flair that left some to be desired but at least it was true to him.<br/><br/>What I am most disappointed about though, is simply the lack of the story in the movie, the choppiness of scene to scene. The missing characters who are in later books as well. It just makes me worry that if they cut this much out of GoF, what are they going to cut out of OotP? At least there was a bouncing ferret."
"kaoruchan30","1","29","43","19 November 2005"," Did the producers even glance through the book?
","A fabulous film -- if you haven't read the books. Really exciting, and nothing left out -- if you haven't read the books. However, if you have read the books, it is a complete and utter disappointment. I went into the theater thinking, 'This shouldn't be too bad,' but, after seeing what they did to Mad-Eye Moody (i.e. the HUGE BLACK STRAP) I wasn't all that thrilled. Dumbledore - completely out of character. During one scene, he actually shakes Harry and yells in others. The Albus Dumbledore of the books is a wise, calm old man, not a raging but clueless crackpot. Many things are left unexplained; such as Neville's fear of the Cruciatus (sp?) curse, and what exactly happens to Barty Crouch (senior). Of course, if you have read the book, you know exactly what is going on, but as an innocent movie-goer who has never even glanced in the books, you are left wondering. And as Emma Watson already being quite pretty, the supposed transformation when she appears at the Yule Ball is muted and almost nonexistent; it simply that she put her hair up. All house-elves are not mentioned at all. S.P.E.W. is gone (though, despite it being a interesting subject in the book, it wasn't particularly important to the story). And it is Neville who gives Harry the gillyweed, instead of Dobby. Of course, that still works quite well, as Neville is so good at Herbology. But, did anyone think that Voldemort was far too jolly? Or is that just me? 'Oh, Harry, I'd almost forgotten you were there!' Can you honestly picture that coming from the great Dark Lord's mouth? There were many other examples during that scene; it was extremely annoying. As for the Dark Mark appearing in the sky, it comes too late. The tents are set on fire (where are the people suspended in the sky?) and everyone is running. Yes, that's reason to be scared, but surely the Dark Mark appearing is far better. So, after everyone has left, who should come along but Barty Crouch Jr. Then he fires the Dark Mark into the sky, and the producer thinks, 'Oh, good. We've got that in the story; people shouldn't complain.' Nope; wrong. He fires it a bit too late. After EVERYONE has left he brings out what should have started the terror. How stupid. (And it was also disappointing when they only made one comment that might suggest who won the World Cup. I'm Irish; I would have been very pleased if they had made that a bit more apparent. While we're on the subject of Barty Crouch Jr., I will bring up that his character totally changed. Instead of being this sniveling, scared young man who calls out to his father in desperation only to have Barty (senior) say, ""You're no son of mine,"" we have him as a weird, explosive monster who comes up and licks his lips at his dad and is all, ""Nyehehehe. Hello, Father."" The 'son of mine' line only works if you make Barty (Jr.) a proper, terrified, misunderstood boy. And Sirius. Gary Oldman makes no actual appearance; how do we even know that it was him who was talking to Harry? And that was done horribly. Instead of Sirius's head appearing in the flames, we have a grotesque thing (that did not look anything like Sirius) popping out of the embers. And also, when Harry sends off his letter to Sirius at the beginning, it is clearly marked on the front to go to Sirius Black. But how ridiculous! His letter could have been intercepted, and then everyone would know that Sirius was somewhere nearby, and that someone (if they weren't one of the people who knew either Harry's handwriting or Harry's owl) was in contact with him. But, as for the acting and the special effects, it was all fine."
"Asutian","7","258","457","20 November 2005"," The best by far
","I must say I am extremely sick of this movie, though not for conventional reasons. Nine reels is a lot to put together and screening a three hour movie can be exhausting, especially when you're trying to write several term papers during the same week it is coming out. You see, I am a projectionist and getting this movie ready for a midnight show was part of my job. I realize that the fact that I was paid $14.50/hr to watch this movie on Wednesday night might give rise to feelings of jealousy among some, but I am currently wishing I could manage to get more than five hours of sleep sometime soon.<br/><br/>All that said I must say this was by far the greatest Harry Potter film so far. Although it was long, it did not drag on. It had a nice, tight feel to it. It progressed from scene to scene with a smoothness that I find to be lacking in many movies adapted from books. The acting has noticeably improved from the first three, and the more adult feel to this one really drew me in. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was the fact that it felt like a mix of genres. It had an epic feel to it. After all it is about good v. evil and battling the dark wizards, etc. This movie,however, also felt like a high school movie. It had the issues of coming of age, which makes sense as the characters begin to mature. Ultimately it came off a lot more loyal to the book in theme than I think the last one did. (The first two, while loyal, I found to be relatively campy and childish.) <br/><br/>This movie, like many, does have its shortfalls. I believe that Dumbledore was portrayed as a little too intense, like an old Al Pacino. Instead of the benevolent, kind, and good-humored old man I have always loved in the books. As someone that has read the books, I must say another shortfall is that this movie banks on familiarity with the story. Having read the books, I found it very easy to follow, but I could understand how one who has not read the books may feel a bit lost, as some important information was left out and some back-story was left mostly unexplained.<br/><br/>All in all I would say this is definitely the best movie in this series so far, and if the next three are on par with this one then I would be content."

We didn't see David Tennant have his soul sucked which was rubbish, for goodness sake, get it together with amateur acting man!! I wasted my money and I certainly won't be buying this twaddle on DVD.

"AnishMisra","9","14","19","7 July 2018"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a film directed by Mike Newell. With every instalment of the series, my anticipation for the film also increased. And I can say even with the fourth instalment, the excitement is never reduced.<br/><br/>Plot: Harry Potter is selected by the Goblet of fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament making him the youngest ever to compete much to the chagrin of everyone.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This is the first film in the series not to have the first scene at Privett Drive. I thought it was the right move considering the film has many things going on. During the first fifteen minutes or so, the film feels quite fast paced. I didn't get the understanding as to what his happening. If the makers would have given a little importance to the beginning, I guess the film would have worked wonders. But after those initial minutes, I was totally engrossed in the movie. There were some new characters to look out for and I can say all of them impressed. Also some of the VFX work in this film is incredible especially the broom scenes which have greatly improved. With that being said, I would add that the tournament scenes were well directed. There is always a sense of tension in the atmosphere during the scenes as you care for the safety of those characters. The film also brings another aspect of the trio's friendship into light which was very nicely handled. This is the first film also not to feature John Williams as score composer. But I can very well say that Patrick Doyle did a spectacular job as composer. The film do marks the very first appearance of Voldemort and I can say that he is terrifying. With his appearance and the build-up that has beenmade, you can say that this man means business and also that he is ruthless and would harm just anyone who comes his way. <br/><br/>Performances: If I had to pin-point I had to say that this was by far Daniel Radcliffe's best as Harry Potter. The emotional side had never been explored until this film as it was great. As for new characters, Ralph Fiennes just nailed it as Voldemort. He just looks as the villain you predicted. Brendan Gleeson brings his charm to the screen and that just lights up the scene itself. Robert Pattinson also justifies his performance. Timothy Spall and David Tenant gave good support. As for rest of the cast, always just do justice to their roles and never have they given me a single reason to complain.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the Yule Ball scene where the boys after the initial dance just sit at one side and are jealous of Hermione seeing she is having a lot of fun unlike them. This very well depicts the teenagers who are at that age.<br/><br/>Verdict; Thanks to Mike Newell and Steve Kloves we have got another griping chapter to the series. Except for the first fifteen minutes, I enjoyed the entire film.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."
"rangergirl3000","6","109","191","7 November 2005"," Saw the film last night...
","I saw the film at its world premiere last night, and as somebody who was sorely disappointed by the first three Potter films, I was thrilled.<br/><br/>Mike Newell has really shaken up the formula - there are no Dursleys, no long introduction, no dodgy CGI moments - he has given it the grittier, more emotional reality that it's been missing. Much has been made of the fact that the series becomes progressively darker, and this is certainly reflected in the film's unnerving opening sequence and the unexpectedly brutal climax.<br/><br/>Inevitably, it does feel a little rushed at times, but for me this wasn't off-putting - the script incorporates the book's most important scenes (the World Cup, the three tasks, the Yule Ball) and includes several new moments which are both authentic and highly enjoyable for viewers who want to see more than a laborious word-for-word adaptation of the book. The film is also very, very funny, and the humour is very much in the distinctive, quirky style of the books which the other films have, to my mind, never quite captured.<br/><br/>It took a British director, but they've finally got it right. This is, for the first time, genuine Harry Potter on film."
"mk65","10","115","203","21 November 2005"," Fine capturing of the spirit of the book.
","I went to see the movie with three of my four kids this weekend, we were hoping that it would not drag, being so long. Having read the book, my oldest and I knew it was a long story with much to cover. Though there could have been traps to make it drag, we were very pleased with the fine way they found to smoothly link everything together and not lose the spirit of the things they had to leave in the book. We did enjoy the third HP movie, though we did find this one to be vastly more appealing to the movie series. This was a fine movie and all involved with its creation and presentation to the big screen for our enjoyment deserve kudos. Special effects were wonderful, and the devotion to the written story was exemplary! We only wish it would have been shown on our stealth cinema with stadium seating instead of the standard screen. Other than that, Ten stars for sure."

","Wow! What can I say? I've been waiting a year and a half for this movie and I can tell you that it was Definitely worth the wait! Even though Daniel, Rupert and Emma are much older than 14 (it's pretty obvious) they are so convincing as they learn about their feelings of maturity:) The selection ceremony for the Tri-Wizard tournament was humorous. The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome! The movie was so well done, I'd have to say that it is the best movie in the series so far! The movie does the book justice."
"Tinuvielas","8","36","58","15 November 2005"," Darker, funnier, reveling in spectacular CGI, teenage angst and Brit-humor
","the fourth Harry-Potter-film (and the first to be directed by an Englishman) is a fun ride. Not for the youngest fans, perhaps, because like Rowling's novel it marks the point where Harry's story transforms from a children's tale into darker, maturer fantasy. In this sequel, Harry's arch-enemy Voldemort rises again and, as the movie's tag-line has it, ""dark and dangerous times lie ahead."" <br/><br/>More immediately, Harry finds himself an unwilling participant in the dangerous Triwizard tournament  a doubtful Honor that alienates him from his schoolmates and even turns his friend Ron against him. And the teenagers' trouble doesn't end here. They also have to face the three unforgivable curses  mind-washing, torture and murder  as well as the pangs of disappointed love. Harry and Ron are pathetic when it comes to girls, and director Mike Newell (""Four weddings and a funeral"") makes the most of his actor's efforts when they try to secure a female companion for the Christmas ball. Ron's dismay when faced with his fancy, decades-out-of-date-dress-robe alone is worth seeing the film. <br/><br/>In fact, it's the teenage angst topic rather than the magical plot that distinguishes this film. I was asked about the best spell in the film after the press screening, and I couldn't come up with a single one. OK, there's several ""expelliarmus'"" and ""accio's"", as well as spectacular Special Effects, but ""magic""? Less than in the previous Potter-adaptations, I should say. At least it's less central. Mike Newell  who earned one Million Dollar directing ""Goblet"", one tenth of the sum pocketed by Chris ""Home alone"" Columbus  certainly achieved his aim to shoot ""a classical thriller with lots of action, something along the lines of 'North by Northwest', without disregarding the often funny teenage angst"".<br/><br/>Thus the pacing in the first half of ""Goblet"" is impeccable, whereas towards the end it gets a bit rushed. Still, ""Goblet"" manages to tell the complex story and capture most important moments of the book  even if it means that certain subplots are only hinted at. One would love to see more of Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson), for instance, or of the death-eaters at the Quidditch Championship: a dark initial sequence, which, together with the repeated dream-sequence, sets the tone for what is to come. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are enough shots involving secondary characters to offer emotional or even comic relief, such as Neville dancing or Filch loping wheezily across the Great Hall. The Yule ball alone is a visual and musical feast: Hogwarts decorated with icicles and frozen seafood, the couples dancing formally to Patrick Doyle's romantic soundtrack before the whole thing evolves into a wild party featuring stage-musicians from Pulp and Radiohead.<br/><br/>A few words about the performances. The young protagonists (especially Rupert Grint as Ron) were inspiring to watch, writhing in the grip of puberty. Daniel Radcliffe impressed me by managing to look very young, fearful and confused in some scenes and handsomely mature in others, especially when fighting Voldemort. In these scenes, one can almost see the grown man in him. <br/><br/>Equally impressive is the fact that Radcliffe did some stunt-work himself; in the scene where he falls off the roof fighting the dragon, for instance, he bungee-dived 13 meters down. He took diving lessons for the underwater sequence and spent 41 hours acting in a deep pool, in murky darkness, with only the assistant's voice in his specially devised earphones giving him directions. In the short takes underwater he had to hold his breath, remember not to let out bubbles, react to non-existent monsters, then swim back to the divers to receive air  not a mean feat.<br/><br/>Of the secondary characters, I liked Miranda Richardson as flamboyant, sensation-creating journalist, although she didn't turn out as nastily insinuating as the book-character. I was less happy with Brandon Gleeson who wasn't sinister enough as Mad-Eye Moody, giving the character a comic edge it shouldn't have. The Triwizard champions, too, were mediocre: Clémence Poésy's Fleur Delacour is pale and nondescript, not the fascinating, haughty part-Vaala of the book. Worse, she's apparently hardly equal to the Triwizard tasks simply because she's female. While Stanislav Ianevski made a passable if too handsome Viktor Krum, Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory hardly got the chance to develop his character, which should have had a charisma equaling Harry's. The only thing that redeemed him is the scene of his death, which is appropriately chilling.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the two great wizards, Dumbledore and Voldemort. Sir Michael Gambon simply can't make up for Richard Harris' loss  and it doesn't help that he's playing Dumbledore as an old man afraid and out of control. Whoever came up with this interpretation, it does not suit ""the only one Voldemort ever feared"". Dumbledore shouldn't be hasty, or perplexed, or making pompous speeches, nor should he shake Harry's shoulders in panic after Harry's been chosen as champion. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes, on the other hand, is genial casting. He embodies the Dark Lord with uncanny charisma, evilly human, undergoing sudden changes of mood: not a serial killer, but a scary madman. With minimum makeup  a thin layer of latex applied onto Fiennes shaved head, arms and breast, giving the impression of pale, translucent, veined skin  and digitally created nostril-slits, Fiennes makes a truly frightening, eerily handsome Voldemort. Dressed in a billowing black silk robe, a ""floating reptile"", as Fiennes describes him, barefoot, long-nailed and displaying a weird, suggestive body-language, he reminds one of a dark version of Cate Blanchett's Elven-sorceress Galadriel in ""Lord of the Rings"". <br/><br/>A final comment on the CGI: I loved the dragons, great and small. Absolutely adored the scene when the horntail climbed over those rooftops to get at Harry. And I was happy to read, in the final credits, that ""No dragons were harmed in the making of this movie."""

For example Dobbi and Winky were not even mentioned and they were in the book quite a bit. Also Syreus was only in the movie for about 1 minute and that was very disappointing. There were so many differences from book to movie that I can't possibly name them all. My advice is to see the movie before you read the book so you don't feel disappointed.

"tjcclarke","7","239","456","7 November 2005"," Rowling's Roller-coaster Gathers Pace
","First, a confession: I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a Potter fan, so I felt something of a fraud as I sneaked into a media screening of Goblet of Fire while many bona fide devotees have had to wait it out.<br/><br/>My interest in the franchise has thus far consisted of sitting through the first film in a freezing cinema wondering what all the fuss was about, and skim-reading the second book on an aeroplane to appease my curiosity as to the young wizard's appeal. I have long been astonished at the sheer scale of Rowling's achievement, and while I may treat many of my fellow commuters - the regressive thirty-somethings who are buried in her CHILDREN'S novels on the tube  with something approaching contempt, I realise her success is very much deserved. It's a bit excessive though, and frankly enough to reduce any impoverished wannabe writer to a jealous whimper.<br/><br/>Being an outsider who will undoubtedly get all the names wrong, I won't spend long here on the plot, save to say it revolves around the ""tri-wizard tournament""  an epic and dangerous event that threatens to split Hogwarts loyalties asunder.<br/><br/>Instead, I'll concentrate on the performances, and, first up, I fear I must say I have reservations over the casting of Harry. Daniel Radcliffe looked an inspired choice after the first film  floppy hair and specs and an earnest charm - but I'm afraid to say, he is an ordinary actor. The trouble with hiring an eleven year old for a film project as massive as this, is you are rather in the lap of the gods when it comes to puberty. It's a bit like doting on a baby puppy and then being terribly upset a year or so later when a bloody great Alsatian smashes up your living room and defecates on your carpet.<br/><br/>Much better are his faithful chums. Rubber-faced Ron (Rupert Grint) handles the adolescent grunting with considerably more aplomb than Radcliffe, and he also says ""bloody hell"" a lot which elicited gasps of delight from some of the younger viewers around me. There is some nice chemistry between him and the hitherto gawky and posh Hermione who has blossomed into a snooty English rose, and the theme of teenage angst runs deep throughout the excellent supporting cast.<br/><br/>""Dark and difficult times lie ahead"" is the smartly worded tagline, and one gets the impression Harry is far more comfortable dodging fire-breathing dragons, than he is tiptoeing around the opposite sex. The growing pains are neatly handled by director Mike Newell, himself no stranger to the awkward whimsy of love's young dream after sterling work on Four Weddings and a Funeral  Indeed, many of the light-hearted interludes around the school dance scenes betray Newell's penchant for bittersweet comedy and romantic pratfalls.<br/><br/>And, of course, the adults in the cast zoom around with a zest inspired by their youthful co-stars. Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid fashions an unlikely romance with a giantess played by Frances De La Tour; Michael Gambon is a sprightly Dumbledore; and Gary Oldman's screen time is restricted to one scene where he thrusts his head through the burning coals of a roaring fire to offer Harry some sage advice. Perhaps they should have simply hired a stunt double and saved on his fee.<br/><br/>Most impressive of all is Ralph Fiennes who is genuinely terrifying as the evil Lord Voldemort. Fiennes is ably assisted in his wickedness by a suitably conniving Timothy Spall and also the most fearsome set of nostrils to grace the silver screen since Hannibal Lector flexed his snout at Agent Starling in The Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>It is pretty stirring stuff  visually extraordinary in places  and nicely paced. Potterfiles will love it and detractors may just find their criticisms stuck in their throats. However, my disdain for adults who proudly devour the novels on public transport without any sense of shame remains absolute.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Listers_armpit","7","12","17","21 November 2005"," A Good Movie, But Die Hard Rowling Fans Will Be Very Disappointed
","This just goes to show that these films are merely based!!! on the brilliant series that is the Harry Potter books. Again Fair play to the actors, they have matured and acted better than ever in this film and i thoroughly enjoyed Rupert Grints portrayal of Ron, for me it was him who somehow kept me in the cinema and reminded me of some of the brilliant scenes in the book. The first problem with this film is that almost the whole film is dark and disturbing, like the last half hour of the prisoner of Azkaban. there are hardly any light fun moments, any that were, were cut from the film. for example, Dudley's huge tongue after eating Fred and George's sweet prototypes for their future joke shop.<br/><br/>Harry's feel good Two weeks of summer at the Weasleys house. The immense full length Quidditch world cup match and the two teams comical cheerleaders.<br/><br/>When Harry fights the dragon he actually starts to enjoy himself by being back on his broom flying and being free again.<br/><br/>Rons comical new owl Pigwidgeon.<br/><br/>There are many more but if you want to know you'll have to read the book. The other huge problem with the film is the total miss interpretation of Albus Dumbledore, Fans of the books will know that Dumbledore is a kind gentle patient wise true powerful wizard who commands respect by every full grown wizard around him and he never shows any sign of fear anger hate and doubt or depression, in the film however he has almost none of his good qualities and all of the bad, for me the first two films' Richard Harris had Dumbledore to a tee and i was devastated by his passing away, he showed a true compassion for Harry and the following films were meant to show a ever growing bond between them, sadly there is hardly a friendship between them, and how Dumbledore got angry at Harry and showed fear was terrible, and when he showed hopelessness at the situation after Harry looked into the pensive really lost the confidence in Dumbledore. I am not having a dig at Michael Gambon as i believe him to be a brilliant actor but the direction he was given obviously didn't work for his role. the film lacked a huge substance, unlike the book which leaves you on tenterhooks and anticipation for the next one, scenes that truly needed to be in the film were discarded by added ones that didn't need to be there, (like the learning to dance for the yule ball). I would have much rather seen some integral scenes instead of these added extras. for example, The Weasleys comic arrival by Floo powder at number four to pick Harry up for the rest of the summer.<br/><br/>The feel good two weeks at the weasleys house was a delight to read<br/><br/>The amazing world cup match.<br/><br/>there was no Dobby or Winky in the film which will need explaining in the fifth film.<br/><br/>There was none of Hermiones elf aid S.P.E.W<br/><br/>None of Hagrids Blast ended Skrewts, which should have been a challenge in the maze, as was the sphinx and the giant spider and the mysterious Myst that made everything upside down.<br/><br/>The trio never met Sirius in Hogsmeade, which cancelled out the growing of Harry's and Sirius's relationship<br/><br/>You never found out in the film that Hagrid and madame Maxime were descendants of giants<br/><br/>Hardly any Severus Snape in the film, why? hes turned out to be one of the most important characters <br/><br/>No Ludo Bagman in the film, made the film lack storyline.<br/><br/>No Bertha Jorkins in the film, which ruins how Wormtail found Voldemort and also how Voldemort found out about the tournament<br/><br/>Hardly any info was given on Barty Crouch and his son and also no explanation of how Barty junior escaped azkaban<br/><br/>Percy weasley was meant to take over the judging in the tournament after the death of his boss<br/><br/>No Mrs Weasley at all<br/><br/>No bill or Charlie weasley<br/><br/>The graveyard scene which should have been the highlight of the film lacked many important bits and Harry hardly fought Voldemort, in the book there is a much more satisfying fight<br/><br/>The most important scene to the whole film was completely left out, it is when Harry is recovering in the hospital wing and everyone is there, here is where the order of the phoenix is meant to begin to regroup, where Sirius reveals himself to the rest of the weasleys and how Dumbledore forced Snape and Sirius to shake hands and put their pasts behind them, and also mentions Snapes secret mission which he agrees to do. also Harry is meant to give his thousand galleon triwizard winnings to Fred and George for their joke shop, how they'll explain that i do not know. The Goblet Of Fire is by far my favourite book and i was sooo looking forward to the film, sadly its left me angry and disappointed, but its still a Harry Potter film and though lacking immense loads its still watchable. All in all this film has left out a lot, meaning also that the next film is going to leave out a lot, its in all honesty that if you want to experience the true magic of hogwarts and see a bigger relationship between the trio and others and a much huger and fuller satisfying storyline, go and buy all of the Rowling books and read them from start to finish, it will leave you completely satisfied and craving more, <br/><br/>I only hope the next director can somewhat redeem these films and deliver a brilliant Order of the Phoenix."
"tony.newton","7","12","17","21 November 2005"," Entertaining but too short and too many omissions
","What summed this film up for me was the comments of my non-HP book reader wife and friend. ""Didn't really understand it"".<br/><br/>The JKR books are full of ""tells"" and explanations, with sub-plots taking on great significance later on. The book of Goblet of Fire is central to the denouement of many of these - and in the main they are left out of the film version in favour of action and CGI.<br/><br/>That said, it was not all bad, so I'll highlight what I liked first! <br/><br/>The teenagers' awkwardness as they explore their relationships, and the way this was handled in the build up to and the actual Ball scene. Hermione in particular was well portrayed, and Ron and Harry sitting like wallflowers while the rest of the school dance the night away was well done. <br/><br/>The look on McGonagall's face when she sees Ron's dress robes - priceless. <br/><br/>The Moaning Myrtle scene in the Prefect's bath is excellent, funny and well acted. <br/><br/>Mad Eye Moody was excellent, convincing and menacing. <br/><br/>The opening scene showing the splendour of the Quidditch stadium was breathtaking. <br/><br/>The graveyard scenes at the end were well done, and close to the book. Ralph Fiennes was excellent, if a little too ""strong"" to be credible so soon after his rebirth.<br/><br/>What did they do badly? Quite a lot actually. I realise how hard it must be to condense this long book into a 150 minute movie, but overextended scenes could have been shortened, and 20 minutes extra to cover some key current and future story lines would have been time and money well spent. <br/><br/>Dumbledore is mad! What has Gambon done to him? Would Richard Harris have grabbed Harry by the neck and shaken him, shouted at him? Would Harris be mumbling and doubting of his abilities, such that there is now almost no credibility that Voldemort should ever fear him? No. And neither does the Dumbledore of JKR. <br/><br/>No muggle taunting and no house elf in the Quidditch world cup scenes, meaning no explanation of the purpose of the riot and burning of the tented village, and no set-up of Bartie Crouch Senior as a key character. <br/><br/>No mention at all of SPEW. <br/><br/>The dragon fight scene is ridiculously long, and ridiculously expensive. Harry flies right out of the stadium, chased by the Norwegian Horntail on a trip to demolish large parts of the castle roofing tiles. The dragon can fly, for goodness sake - why would it spend 2 minutes climbing across rooftops to get to Harry when it could fly out and blast him from the air? <br/><br/>The characterisation of the new characters is poor - Fleur, Viktor and Cedric are all just cardboard cutouts for Harry to battle against. <br/><br/>The omission of almost all the interaction between Harry and Sirius, so crucial to the next two films. Make you wonder whether the film makers have actually read all the books. <br/><br/>The absence of any reference to Hagrid's half-giant heritage (subtly alluded to in one scene with Madam Maxime, but only if you know what you're looking for) which is so important to his role in the next film <br/><br/>No mention of the Minister For Magic's denial of Voldemort's return, nor his act of bringing the dementors to kill Bartie Crouch junior before Snape can use Veritas serum to make him confirm Harry's story - both key to Dumbledore's flight in the next book, and setting up for Umbridge to wreak her havoc. <br/><br/>A messy treatment of the Snape/Karkaroff relationship and history, again failing to set up the future doubts we have about Snape, who is still mainly just portrayed as a nasty teacher rather than key character of the 6th book. <br/><br/>The acting. Sad though I am to say it I thought most of the acting was poor in this film, especially from Emma Watson (who I've always thought was the best of the young actors) and Rupert Grint. To be fair this is probably more due to their hugely diminished parts in this film, but that aside I feel Hermione is portrayed more as Harry's mother figure, rather than the super-clever heroine who Harry can always rely on to get him back on track. <br/><br/>The Rita Skeeter storyline is shallow, with no set-up for the essential article in support of Harry, and no mention of her being an illegal animagus, and thus no capture and blackmail of her by Hermione. <br/><br/>The Maze is transformed from testing puzzles and magical scenarios that the 4 Champion's could reasonably expect to figure out/defeat, to a series of menacing hedges and roots that becomes the entirety of the final test. The winner just needs to be luckier and faster than the others - leaving no avenue for true Wizarding contest, nor for Moody's sabotage of Fleur and Viktor's efforts. <br/><br/>Finally (though I could go on) I was amazed that a director of Newell's status and past history should make Fleur such a lame character, fit only to be dressed in a skimpy swimming costume, and swiftly fail, with no explanation, in all the tasks.<br/><br/>As I've said, I sympathise with how hard it must be to condense such a long book and not miss out big chunks of it - and I think they did that quite well with the start - but I do feel they erred too much on the side of spectacle and not enough on explaining all the plot twists and lead-ins to the next book.<br/><br/>What will non-book readers make of it all!<br/><br/>Tony"

","This movie was the worst Harry Potter movie so far! I can't see how anyone could be satisfied with it. Those who have read the book couldn't possibly accept the important details that were left out in favour for dragged-out, irrelevant scenes. Those who haven't read the book couldn't possibly enjoy the movie either, for so much is left out that it is impossible to correctly follow! Very important scened that are left out include The Parting Of The Ways, where it becomes very clear that the Ministry aren't going to believe Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort, Dumbledore telling Snape and Hagrid to go on their separate missions, any adequate explanation about Barty Crouch Snr or Jnr, and how and why they got into the situations they were in, the winner of the Tri-Wizard Tourament, and there is very little screen-time for Sirius, which means the audience can't see the relationship between him and Harry, which is very important for the events of The Order of the Phoenix! Many more scenes and information have been cut out that really needed to be there, and my advice it to stay away from all the movies, and just keep to the books!"

","I just saw the movie for the first time and i was very surprised on how good the movie relates to the book. this was my favorite book as it was transitioning into a more serious and in-dept story. No offense to the other books before as they were great too, but this is the story were its not so childish and the characters are becoming more mature and serious about their futures. the movie does a great job on its special effects, acting, and all together the direction movie went. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat with all the action, suspense(the dragon scene were especially good), and drama.If your a fan of the books, then I highly suggest that you go see it."
"cristeen","1","21","33","19 November 2005"," I thought POA was bad, this one stinks.
","I was unhappy with movie III. I am aghast at this movie. Where to start? The beginning is usually a good place. Choppy. This movie was even choppier than the first one. It starts appropriately with the dream (of course the dream is not accurate to the book), but Harry is already at the Burrow. I guess there wasn't enough money in the budget to pay for Molly, Bill, or Charlie since none of them are in the film. Same goes for a little Quidditch, there isn't any. How can there be a Quidditch World Cup and no Quidditch? Ludo Bagman, where is he? Bagman is essential to the twins money sub plot. Money for the twins, how are they supposed to leave school toward the end of the next movie with no money (There was no mention of a monetary prize for the winner of the tournament)? How is Harry supposed to get any information any more, Sirius kept Hedwig? Then again Sirius must not be too important since they couldn't even do the fireplace scene appropriately and didn't have him, not even as a large, black dog at the end of the film. Then again Harry never went to the hospital. Fudge and Dumbledore do not have a parting of ways. I just wonder if Steven Kloves even bothered to read book 5 or discuss it with J.K. Rowling before butchering the screenplay for this movie. I just can't see how there can be an Order of the Phoenix that makes any sense when all of the set up was cut from the fourth movie. I know they can't have everything in the book in the movie but the overall story arc has to be maintained. I wonder what J.K. Rowling truly thinks of this film. I know two things for sure, I want Chris Columbus back directing 6 and 7 and I want Peter O'Toole for Dumbledore."
"schwenkester","3","22","35","17 November 2005"," Dumbledore Lacking in Character Study
","While the movie was generally entertaining, there were just certain things that true Harry Potter fans are simply not going to be able to be able to overlook. The major one, in my opinion, is Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Since when does Dumbledore push Harry around and yell at him? I don't think that this has EVER happened. He tends to be a more subdued character who is very understated in everything he does. Dumbledore is not the type to yell; instead, he reasons and kindly scolds students, especially Harry. NEVER, EVER would he yell in Harry's face much less push Harry around, question his own spell-work or for one second believe that Harry Potter put his own name in the Goblet of Fire. IT IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE! Other problems for fans of the book will include: Krum, who comes off as a pompous oaf who is very much into himself and not at all impressed by Harry or even slightly interested in him. The whole scene about the Quidditch Cup and the Death Eaters which comes off as something much bigger than it was in the book. The opening scene at the Riddle house where Barty Crouch, Jr. shows up (DEFINITELY not in the book). The Weird Sisters are definitely not at the Yule Ball, and the Patil sisters are both in Griffindor (Padma is definitely in Ravensclaw).<br/><br/>On top of everything else, I must say that during a good portion of the movie, I felt like I was watching a video game. There was entirely too much CGI throughout the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I must say that I was thoroughly disappointed in this film because there were just certain things that could have been fixed so easily and yet they were left there to ruin the movie for the true fans. Basically, I would recommend seeing the movie if you are out for a good time, but don't expect it to satisfy your lust for a movie that mirrors the book well."
"veriaamiri","1","38","66","20 November 2005"," Gambon can't play Dumbeldor ....!!! there weren't any better way of ruining Dumbledor's portrait.
","A huge disappointment. As a big fan of Harry Potter I should declare that if there was any other way of taunting abjecting and con-tempting Albus Dumbledor, then Mike Newell and Michael Gambon were not aware of it. <br/><br/>Is this the wise, decent and kind Dumbledor that always knows everything? Is this the Dumbledor who always have some wise words to solve the problems? Is this the Professor Dumbledor who in my opinion is a portrait of a superman? No, but instead we have a fearful, dull, clumsy, rash, joker who I bet has not bothered to read the book even once !!! Anyone with a standard level of IQ and wit who has read the novel, can tell that this is not Professor Dumbledor. <br/><br/>Since when exactly, has Dumbledore ever lost control and shaken Harry? If this is how he reacts to harry's name being entered, what the hell is he going to do when Harry destroys his office in The Order of the Pheonix? Since when Snape draws his wand and outsmarts Dumbledor in clearing up the mess? Michael Gambon may be a fine actor but HE JUST ISN'T DUMVBLEDORE !!! <br/><br/>This is what I disliked the most about this movie that Dumbledore is not portrayed as what he is,a calm, wise, kind, old wizard who speaks wisely. Instead we have a stormy, confused blundering old man that doesn't have a clue what's going on. The character of Dumbledore is just WAY off. where in the book u can see Dumbledor to shake a student? Where and When you see him shout and act like a goat? Absolutely ABSURD!!! It just ruined the portray I had in my mind about the great Dumbledor, I wont watch it again and definitely wont recommend it to anyone. <br/><br/>This is the poorest Harry Potter movie so far. At least in the first two you could see the brilliant actor Richard Haris as a Dumbledor who is what he really is in the book. The same story goes for Voldemort, who is way off the character he should be. He is not as calm and powerful and dark as he should be. He is uncertain and even surprised and stupid in some parts. He is not the darkest wizard of all the times at all. This is a pretty good movie, good music good special effect ...but the problem is that its just not the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>Cutting off lots of the critical scenes of the book, very poor choice of the new faces, miss-changing the scenes, and considering the various other things I mentioned, I only gave it 2 out of 10 because of it's brilliant sound and special effects. But after I read the book again last night I disliked the movie even more, so its just 1 out of 10. I rate it to be the poorest Harry Potter movie so far."
"wondernat","1","10","14","1 March 2006"," Pathetic, loathsome, evil cockroach of an adaptation
","I absolutely HATED this movie. As a movie that is supposed to not have anything to do with the great book that is attached to it, it is entertaining, but because it carries the ""Harry Potter"" emblem to it, I will scrutinize it to the very last detail that bothered me.<br/><br/>First of all, Columbus did the world's WORST job. I don't understand how having a fool-proof, action-packed book could've turned out this crap.<br/><br/>The disappointment begins with the Quidditch World Cup. What is the point of building all of that up if you're not going to at least show us the Wronsky Feint? Or explain the veela? The issue of Barty Crouch, Jr. isn't even vaguely touched upon, which means that Winky isn't at all discussed! <br/><br/>In terms of the tournament itself, BEAUXBATONS ACADEMY ISN'T AN ALL-GIRLS SCHOOL!!!!!!!! (Durmstrang isn't an all-boys wanna-be military academy, either!) The women in the movie are completely objectified. The Beauxbatons' entrance into the Great Hall? Migod, you'd think Maxime was bringing all of her girls up to be easy French sluts! And naturally, Fleur's background (part veela) and silvery BRIGHT hair are completely overlooked. I'm upset at the non-mention of her veela background because without it, there's no explanation that what is seen, i.e., them going ""Ahhhhhhh"" is just in the entranced boys' minds. Anyway, read up on veela! <br/><br/>Was it lack of imagination that prompted the producers to TAKE THE DRAGON OUT OF THE ARENA AND HUNT HARRY DOWN LIKE A DOG? Honestly, I think keeping the first task within its original boundaries was a lot more effective. PATHETIC that they would let the Dragon die when in the book, they were adamant about protecting its eggs. Like Charlie would've let the Horntail get away like that! Or Dumbledore! <br/><br/>Dumbledore! Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was the most awkward and pathetic and unwelcome change in the installments. Long rest Mr. Richard Harris, who so well captured Dumbledore... Gambon should've at least the read the books. He was pathetic in that role, and it angered me to see Dumbledore so out of character.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters out of 'sync with their book counterparts, Hermione was intolerable in this movie! I don't think at all it was the actor's fault, but rather an incompetent playwright who didn't bother to fully grasp Hermione. Maybe he thought ""o no she's a teenager, I should write her like one!"" which is VERY un-Hermione-ish!! <br/><br/>Lastly, the final task. ""O NO THE HEDGES ARE COMING AT ME, THE HEDGES ARE COMING AT ME!!!"" What the hell was that??? No skill needed whatsoever! Where was the sphinx, the boggarts, and all of the other TRUE challenges? Why the hell would a witch/wizard be afraid of MOVING HEDGES??? Why the hell would that change a person? Gaaaah, the bull they try to make us swallow, the tripe! <br/><br/>In sum: read the book."
"magnusgallant","1","10","14","11 January 2006"," The Worst of the Harry Potter Movies by far
","Four Funerals and one Satanic Sacrifice would not be enough to condemn Mike Newell to the flames of the Underworld for this monstrosity. How the Harry Potter revolving door of directors could settle on Newell is disconcerting as he produced the single worst movie in the Harry Potter franchise, perverting J.K. Rowling's excellent work into trash, plain and simple.<br/><br/>The big thing with the Goblet of Fire was that it was darker than the three previous works as Harry and Co. had turned 14 and would face death and the return of a powerful foe. Unfortunately, Newell took ""darker"" a little too literally, as there is virtually no light in the movie at all, whether in terms of the forces of good (Albus Dumbledore, along with the rest of the supporting cast, is practically nonexistent) or simply scene lighting as almost every scene, whether at the Yule Ball (where Harry and Ron experience that typical teenage angst from unrequited and unacknowledged love), the Triwizard Tournament events, or even inside Hogwarts. The complete absence of light makes the final battle much less powerful, unlike Narnia, which so beautifully balances and separates light and dark, clearly opposing the two and making each more powerful than if one completely dominates. The scenery of Goblet lacks the majesty and beauty so present in Azkaban as the settings are dull and uninteresting.<br/><br/>In Newell's defense, Goblet is massive, more than 600 pages, which could not be easily included into a still long 2.5 hour movie. Still, it is the little things in the movie that are most annoying: there is no Quidditch, he does not use a ""Hedwig scence change"" (where Harry's pet owl flies off and changes the season), and the supporting cast of professors and other wizards are incredibly underused, although newcomer Mad-Eye Moody and old favorite Snape each have one great scene, one with transfiguration and the other with a textbook.<br/><br/>For a supercondensed story (as if the movie doesn't do that on its own), Harry enters his 4th year at Hogwarts with a burning scar and dread after the appearance of the Death Eaters, Lord Voldemort's followers, at the Quidditch World Cup. All of Hogwarts is concerned with the Triwizard Tournament, which pits one 7th-year student from each of the three wizarding schools in a three-task competition to win eternal glory. However, Harry's name comes out of the Goblet, and he becomes the first ever 4th champion. As he tries to deal with the difficult tasks, he also must confront his love of Ravenclaw's Cho Chang, Ron's hostility and jealousy, and the everpresent school, including new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Mad-Eye Moody.<br/><br/>Although it is necessary to see the movie in order to understand the 5th movie, I beg you to read the book and get a true image of Rowling's story instead of forking over your hard earned coin for this. Oh, it will be in my DVD collection, but I won't be happy about it."

"kenkabatoff","1","7","9","23 November 2005"," This Did Not Meet Expectations
","Over the last few years, people have been excited to see Harry Potter films. I know I am excited to see them, I like Harry Potter. But that being said, there are some major flaws with these films.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus - I was happy to see how he brought such a fantastical story to the screen. His directing was questionable, but the point is, he's the first one to do it. He was with us for 2 films.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron - My favorite of the 3 directors. His dark style fit very well with the third story, and really made me a fan of the movies. Acting, Directing, Writing, and Producing was great in the third film. They hit their mark. It's a shame he didn't Direct ""Goblet of Fire"".<br/><br/>My problems with Goblet of Fire:<br/><br/>Directing - Mike Newell lacked any kind of style. He seemed to me, like another Chris Columbus. Cinematography wasn't great, cliché shots with no symbolic value. It seemed like he was trying to ""wow"" us by sweeping the camera around the actors, no reason for it. One of my major problems with his Directing is how he played with the character arcs. Over the last 3 movies we've started to love how these characters interact with each other, and we know ""normal"" for them. Dumbledore was an angry, paranoid, old man in this film. And any reader of the series would agree with me that Dumbledore would NEVER put his hands around Harry's neck and yell at him. Overall, weak Directing that should have been caught early on.<br/><br/>Acting - I'm not going to harp on how bad these actors are. They aren't bad. I enjoyed them in POA. But for acting, I once again blame the Director. It's not their fault for how they acted in this film. The Director tried something new, a new approach to these characters, and frankly, I didn't like it. It made them seem childish, and whiney. *Dumbledore is definitely the largest character change in this film.<br/><br/>Writing - Something was off with this script. I know that it's the original writer, but something was off. Too cliché. It didn't keep the rhythm that the other scripts had. Also, a fault of the writer's for changing the characters around, or at least writing them differently.<br/><br/>Producing - Finally, to end on a positive note. The producing in this film was great. Great CGI. Now, I have to confess, I hate CGI. It's hard to get drawn into a story, when nothing that you're seeing is real. A reason why the new Star Wars films failed, but that's another story for another time. I would've liked to see them build that giant ship that Bouxbaton's (i'm not sure how you spell it, forgive me) comes on. But that would be a lot of work for minimal screen time. No problem.<br/><br/>I left the cinema upset. I wasn't mad that they cut so much, I understand that aspect of the film. But I was upset at how they presented this story. In fact, Goblet of Fire is a much darker story than Prisoner of Azkaban, but to me, it did not seem like it. <br/><br/>I will let all of you of course decide on your own opinion, but these are my views on the film, and I think some will agree with me. Thank you. <br/><br/>Ken Kabatoff, 16"
"las-16","8","7","9","23 November 2005"," Film missing Cuaron's creativity
","I found ""Goblet of Fire"" to be good, but rather cryptic for those who've never read the book. I noticed that, to make up for time, it had multiple things happening in each scene, which made it feel like I was reading the book in fast forward. I cracked up at the scene when Ron puts on his ""dress robe"" and Ralph Fiennes did an awesome job -- they couldn't have found anyone better. While staying mostly true to the plot lines of the book, this movie (and perhaps the book as well) exchanged some of its magical awe for more grown-up ""teen angst"" conflicts between the characters. I missed the cool quirky beautiful style that Alfonso Cuaron brought to the series (think the talking head in the Knight Bus and Harry's surprise flight on Buckbeak), but Mike Newell got the job done nicely."
"evie_emt","9","7","9","21 November 2005"," Loved it!
","This movie was so close to the book, it was wonderful. Of course there was a lot of jumping around, but given the time frame, they did an excellent job. The ferret scene was absolutely, my favorite! Madame Maxime wasn't as good as I expected, but the girls from Beauxbaton's were cool. The sons of Durmstrang were awesome! I loved them, and Karkarof was dead on. Moody was awesome, no one could have done it better! The build-up to the Quidditch Cup was spectacular, but you don't get to see a character that was introduced, and I had wanted to see. And you don't get to see the Quidditch Cup. Voldemort's sign was awesome, but they changed around some minor plot points to fit into the movie. The Yule ball was okay, but again, the changed some minor details that I had wanted to see. The tri-wizard Tournament was fabulous! I loved all the ""things"" that went with it. It was done extremely well. The graveyard scene was perfect! I can't say more than that, but your expectation of it, will be met and/or exceeded. I guarantee it. I am a huge Harry Potter book fan, and I loved this movie. It probably shouldn't be watched by younger kids or those who get nightmares easily, but I took my niece, age 11, and nephew, age 9, and they loved it. So it is definitely one almost everyone can see!"

I can't wait for the DVD to find out if there's anything added that was left out of the film. This movie is best on the big screen. The young actors are growing up well.

"rickrainy","2","16","25","20 November 2005"," Extremely Disappointing
","Ever seen those companion books for kids that come out around the same time as a movie? They are mostly filled with big pictures and little explanation about what actually happens in the film. Goblet of Fire is basically the same thing - only opposite. It is a picture-book-type movie that has been made as a companion to a book already released. It offers no explanation to the plot (rarely even provides a plot), and is filled with lots of big pictures that only make sense if you have read the book.<br/><br/>I realize that the book was very long, and that kids only have a limited attention span, so some things need to be cut out, but hardly any of the scenes even connected together and there is little explanation as to why things are occurring to Harry and his companions. This film is just a series of unconnected scenes.<br/><br/>If you have read the books, then the following shouldn't be a spoiler, but it will spoil what they actually include in the movie.<br/><br/>As I said, they were pressed for time, but why then did they extend the scene with Harry battling his dragon for so long? Most of that scene was completely unnecessary. Very little is shown of the World Cup (no actual quidditch), little explanation is given for the Death Eaters' attack, Dobby and Winky are no where in the film (so they show Barty Crouch Jr. sending up the Dark Mark right away without Rawlings' intention of making it seem like he is innocent), the actual death of Barty Crouch is not explained at all (they just show his dead body), there is very little explanation of Harry's duel with Voldemort (Dumbledore simply says they went through Priori Incantatem, and thats it), they never explained how Barty Crouch Jr. escaped from Azkaban, they changed the maze challenge completely so that you don't realize that Krum is under the Imperius Curse, there are no obstacles in the maze (no sphinx, no monsters, etc, just the maze itself changing its walls around), and as I said before - very rarely do scenes actually connect; the plot just jumps around from one scene to the next. Those are just a few of the things that were very wrong with the film.<br/><br/>I hate to imagine how people who haven't seen the film would think of it. I think the reason why others are giving this a good review is because its been long enough since they have read the book that they don't realize what is missing, yet they still remember the plot enough that the missing explanations aren't needed - which is probably exactly what the writer and director of this film want.<br/><br/>I really really wanted this film to be good, and I realize parts need to be cut out - but this is inexcusable. This is easily the worst Harry Potter film yet - and as a film alone, it is absolutely horrible. I did enjoy the other films, and really like the books, and anyone who is a fan probably will not like this film.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it was actually very beautiful, and a lot of the scenes did look really cool - enough for the film to get a thumbs up from little kids, but no one who can read at a level necessary to understand the books."
"ZekeRage911","5","12","18","30 March 2007"," Hello... plot? Are you under the invisible blanket?
","My girlfriend is a huge Harry Potter fan, so she eventually roped me into watching this cinematic train wreck.<br/><br/>Let's start with what I liked, first. Solid opening scene, good special effects, interesting fantasy elements, and sometimes funny dialog. Now I ask fans to hold their breath. I did not like this movie.<br/><br/>After the first quarter of the film, where it has been pointed out with a BIG NEON SIGN that the big bad uber-evil Wizard that everyone is so afraid of they refuse to speak his name, is returning from pseudo-death. Then, for some psychotic reason, the movie decides to forget about this imminent threat to the universe and instead show us poorly written, badly acted, and horribly uninteresting high school soap opera complete with a freaking prom. Maybe this is a hit with the middle school crowd, but even still, you can tell the actors themselves are thinking ""what the hell IS this about?"" EVENTUALLY, everyone remembers (a touch too late) that the evil ""you-know-who"" seems to be making his way back to life through foreshadowing and not-so-subtle hints, but now we're caught up in a life or death competition where Harry Potter has been illegally entered, and set up basically as bait to lure out Voldemort and/or his henchmen. Well, when the big bad DOES finally make his move, the powerful Wizards completely fail to notice, or even remember, that Voldemort has taken the bait. A confrontation between Harry and his nemesis ensues, whereupon the young hero through the power of love from his dead parents, or some such nonsense, just barely makes it away with the corpse of a fallen Hogwarts student. So what happens now that everyone has absolute and undeniable proof that the most evil force ever has returned? They go on summer vacation. Right, nipping off on holiday, I'm sure he won't destroy the world until next term. From start to finish, this movie had me on the edge of my tolerance. I'm being generous with five out of ten here, but only because I feel there is the POTENTIAL for a good movie in here. Someone just needs to slap around the director and scrounge the cutting room floor."
"edwardsa-1","1","12","18","13 March 2006"," I thought this was awful. Nearly absolutely awful
","I just saw this at a $1.50 movie, having missed going with my family. I was severely disappointed. I would have felt worse going to the first run. I will start with what little I liked. 1.There were a couple of scenes in which Daniel Radcliffe actually, you know, acted.This is pretty hopeful, because someday they might hire an actor's director who would find a way to get Radcliffe's best. 2. Brendan Gleeson did a uniformly nice job with Mad Eye. 3. Similarly, Miranda Richardson did well with Rita.<br/><br/>I've run out of nice things to say. Now down to business.<br/><br/>I think the most egregious and obvious difficulty was the direction. This may be the most unimaginative rendering possible. It should not have been one movie, but if it had to be, it should have been significantly longer. It was so compact, it felt like a two hour commercial for the real movie. Nothing in the movie had any sense of development. It was a series of highly visual set-pieces leavened with uncomfortably phony dialog. The acting direction may have been the worst feature. Considering the remarkable collection of good actors, this an amazingly wasteful undertaking. The movie seemed like a filmed read-through. Two of the most embarrassing scenes were the conference between Dumbledore (a completely miscast Michael Gambon) and the rest of the faculty about Harry's staying in the tournament, and the last scene between Harry, Hermione and Ron. Emma Watson, who has done such a great job with this role, gave a completely phony reading in that scene, and for that I blame the direction. I say this because there were so many poor performances from good actors. <br/><br/>The second biggest problem was the screen writing. Everything from choices of what to cut, to dialog was amateurish. Harry's line ""I love magic."" made him seem simply goofy. The most offensive writing feature, however, was choice to add bad material that was not part of the story. If you are going to add something to a story as good as this, what you add should be, well, good. The dancing scene with McGonagall should not have seen the light of day. I pity Maggie Smith for having to do that scene. Moreover, the choices of things that were cut so that this could be added are even more maddening. Small things like Fleur being part Vela and what a Vela was in the first place. The entrance of Beaux Batons and Durmstrang was an ignorant display of fake, international stereotypes. The scene could have been written by George Bush. Rumania is not Russia. The little dip-dance by the students of Beaux Batons was completely inappropriate. Their uniforms and their carriage as they entered spoke of a dignity and even aloofness that would have rung true. This was completely ruined by the silly choreography. Finally, the reduction of Filch to a dumb, running gag with a cannon instead of using a little time to discuss his status as a squib was a great loss and, to my mind, indicates a dearth of writing sense.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to return to Dumbledore. As good an actor as he is, I just don't know if Michael Gambon could do justice to Dumbledore. Richard Harris struck a wonderful balance between humor and gravity that is crucial to this character. Unfortunately, Michael Gambon comes off as someone's drinking buddy. He has done this in two movies. I would hope that this part would be recast."

","Now mind you, I love Harry Potter. However, I can separate film from book and enjoy a film on its own, dealing with some differences here and there.<br/><br/>So believe me when I went on early Friday to see Goblet of Fire with nothing but the best expectations and a secret smile (as I sat next to a green-hooded, obviously Slytherin kinda guy), I was astounded to be walking out of the theatre bleary-eyed, (for fear of blinking and missing anything,) annoyed and somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>Yes, the film was full of great action and I got that it was supposed to be a thriller and dangerous and all that. I got that Newell was playing up on the teenage angst and the trials and tribulations everyone goes through at that time. I understand that it was a dilemma trying to condense a 734 page book (a daunting task) and that some things would have to be left out...but why oh why did they change some key elements crucial to the plot of the Harry Potter series? And why did they overlook common sense details in having the flow make sense?<br/><br/>My grievances (***SPOILERS***): <br/><br/>Why is Dumbledore so crude and practically man-handling Harry by shaking him and yelling at him at every chance he gets? Why is he breaking tradition and visiting Harry in his bedroom dorm and not in Dumbledore's office? Why is he practically unintelligible and annoying as he mutters after Harry comes out of the pensieve? Everything we associate and know about Harry and Dumbledore's relationship of solidarity and kindness is upended which is so crucial to the plot throughout the whole series (especially Half Blood Prince). This was probably the biggest mistake in the film aside from all the other not as important stuff I'm listing subsequently.<br/><br/>Why was the Dragon hanging on the roof for so long? Hell, it's a Dragon fer cryin' out loud! If I were a Dragon I would've crisped Harry in all that screen time by using my god-given wings and FLEW! Isn't Harry's focus supposed to be about getting the egg? Why is he flying away from the egg to hang out on the roof with the Dragon? <br/><br/>Now I'm glad Neville finally gets something good happening to him, being the last one partying into the early morning (go, Neville go!), but why prolong certain tortured minutes of seeing him dance? Sure, keep it in but keep it shorter.<br/><br/>Hermione. Ugh. I can't believe Newell has her sobbing and crying. Totally un-Hermione like. Also, I don't understand why Hermione throughout this whole film is jumping up and down and is filled with such energy every time she's on-screen. It was over-done and felt totally pushed over the edge. A regular hug in the tent would have sufficed. Newell turned Hermione's concern for Harry's life into something very strange and forced.<br/><br/>In the camp why is Harry still there after the whole camp has already been burned down? He would've been trampled or something. And then all of the sudden the Weaslys pop up all clean and suddenly find him in this barren landscape? This detail annoys me to no end. I understand they were probably trying to show how devastating it was by showing the camp all burned up but it really didn't make any common sense.<br/><br/>So those were my most annoyed grievances. I just had to address these things because I feel like everyone is under an Imperious Curse, thinking the film is all that dishing out perfect 10's when basic filming principles of making sense aren't there. Goblet is closer to an action film and leaves out much of the emotional involvement, plot-important details, and continuity to other Harry Potter films past and future. Harry Potter is not just a teenage thriller, the stories have always been about mystery and time spent with Harry trying to figure out who he is and where he's going next (age-old questions of existence). There was no space and air to breathe, no time of contemplation or to establish emotional closeness. Again, I understand the time limits on-screen, but maybe making two films would have been the way to go. (I shake my head sadly at the unfortunate exclusion of the ton tongue toffee scene.) Oh yeah, and by the way, Voldemort wasn't very scary. Sure, no nose equals creepy but there was a definite chill missing. I always thought he was more freakish, more spidery, maybe skinnier and taller. Maybe more moldy looking, I dunno. I think he's scarier when you can't see him, like the Thing-Under-the-Bed.<br/><br/>I don't want to be too down on the film, there were funny moments and interesting things happening like with the ferret-in-the-pants, practice dance lesson, the ever ominous head-bashing Snape. The stadium scene was executed quite well with Krum's image done that way on the crowd and the little dragons-in-bag-with-smoke-coming-out was great. All of Maggie's Smith's lines are perfect and she executes it so well as McGonagall. The death eaters forming out of black swirls of their cloaks--very cool. And so is the grave marker statue death thing that moves. A++ to Stuart Craig, as visually the film is stunning.<br/><br/>I'm giving my review of Goblet of Fire a 7 out of 10 because although it did not meet the completeness and better storytelling of Prizoner of Azkaban, it is a formidable project to have undertaken and aside from the big boo-boos of Dumbledore and editing, it was a good effort.<br/><br/>I really hope they get it right with Order of the Phoenix though. Expecto Patronum pretty please! And they better include the Weasly twins' Great Exit or I'll have to write up another darned review spewing about it."
"badboytim13","9","8","11","18 November 2005"," Thrill ride
","Of the first 3 movies, I liked Harry Potter and the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone the best because it came closest to expectations. Goblet of Fire is by far by favorite book in the series, so I had high hopes for this movie long before I saw any of the other movies. This movie is brief and brisk at 254 minutes. Thats right, it is a very fast 254 minutes and you don't want the movie to end when it does. <br/><br/>Yes, there is no Dursley family, Winky or Dobby a mild disappointment. I am upset that there is no Mrs. Weasley more than anything. Even if she had only one line, calling Ronald to breakfast or having her fuss over Harry would have been better than cutting her out completely.<br/><br/>Speaking of disappointments, while keeping the movie brief, there is no Quidditch action in this movie, it is mentioned that Krum is the best seeker in the world yet we don't see him in action. There could have been at least 60 to 120 seconds of Quidditch action showing us just how good Krum is.<br/><br/>The acting is superb in this film, the trio have improved greatly since the last movie. Mad Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) is wickedly funny and the screen lights up as you sit up to watch what he does next. Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is just dreadfully delightful as the reporter you love to hate. <br/><br/>The debate over who is the better Dumbledore is about to heat up once again. Now that both have two full movies, I think it is now fair to compare the two.<br/><br/>Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is my personal choice; in this movie I wasn't missing Richard Harris as Dumbledore like I was in POA. Gambon will win over some of the Harris fans. Not all of them but some of them.<br/><br/>What can I say about Maggie Smith,Alan Rickman or Robbie Coltrane? I wanted to see them more but there weren't any other scenes to put them in. When they were on the screen they all did a superb job. There were myriads of outstanding perfermances both big and small parts.<br/><br/>Love was in the air in this movie but it also felt a little out of place because there was no way to really work the love scenes in this movie.<br/><br/>The number 1 reason I wanted to see this movie after reading the book was Harry and the dragon. The scene didn't disappoint, it kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time. In fact the three tasks were outstanding to watch and worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The rebirth of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is creepy to look at. The graveyard fight scene between Harry and Lord Voldemort is too brief to be a climatic battle for a movie of this scale.I feared the dragon more than I feared Voldemort. <br/><br/>This is the first time Harry and Lord Voldemort meet after that fateful night 13 years ago. Voldemort has had 13 years to plot his revenge on Harry Potter, Voldemort now has a body and Harry standing in front of him.<br/><br/>Voldemort should be out to prove that he can best Harry in front of the Death Eaters who are present at this confrontation but LV comes off looking weak and pathetic, he can't best a 14 year old fourth year student. LV knocks Harry off of his feet but nothing else. The Imperius curse on Harry for 60 seconds or so would have been wonderful to help show us the true sadistic power of Voldemort and why he is so feared by so many wizards.<br/><br/>To say I liked the movie is an understatement. I do hope there is a directors cut of this movie. This is my favorite movie of the four so far. I can only hope Mike Newell is brought back to direct Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix after the job he has done with GOF."
"TMLS","7","64","123","21 November 2005"," Best Harry Potter movie
","Having not thought much about the other HP movies, I went in to this one expecting the worst, and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I am a *massive* fan of the books, but Radcliffe & Co. haven't really done it for me so far.<br/><br/>As long as you don't think too much about the book, as a stand-alone movie this is fine, quality family entertainment. There are some polished performances from the teenage stars, and the plot flows along nicely.<br/><br/>Overall then, a good movie. Not one of the greatest ever made, but certainly the best Potter we've seen."

I loved it and i cant wait till the 5th movie. This has to be the best movie I've seen this year. It has story, action, humor, and drama.

"staffermom","7","9","13","22 November 2005"," Close enough, I suppose.
","I am a rabid Harry Potter fan, as I'm sure most of the people who went out of their way to review this film are. I am also, however, a purist and therefore must take exception with certain aspects of this interpretation.<br/><br/>My main problem with the movie was that even though in an A&E special Newell complained about having only 120 pages in which to fit this 700+ page novel, he chose to add things. Granted, as my husband points out, we've never seen these kids dance, so the dances lessons scene was needed. Personally, I would have gladly sacrificed the graceful choreography of the Yule Ball for an extra scene with Draco Malfoy, the World Cup, the Dursley's, Snape, Sirius, or for heaven's sake - Molly Weasley! In a book of this size there will of course be omissions in the movie, but there were certain things missing that simply should not have been. Lessons, for example. This is still a school, yes? Could the trio's conversation regarding dates for the ball have taken place during History of Magic instead of what appeared to be a never-before-seen study hall? The first task was alright, but again, I could have lived without Harry falling all over the castle roof in exchange for another scene that was actually in the book. The second task was again not bad; however, since Dobby (and Winky and Ludo Bagman) was written out of the script there was no one to warn Harry as to what had been stolen from him - when he got the bottom of the lake how did he decide that Ron was his hostage and not Hermione? Are we supposed to believe that Harry likes Ron more? As for the third task - where on EARTH were all the magical creatures and spells?? Mist that forces the world upside down, Hagrid's blast-ended skrewts, giant spiders, and a sphinx scare me a lot more than wizard-eating roots and hedges that grow together rather quickly.<br/><br/>Cedric, Krum, and Hermione were completely out of character for half the movie. Cedric made a point of telling Harry that he'd asked people not to wear the ""Potter Stinks"" badges, but second before had laughed with his friends as they ridiculed Harry. Cedric in the maze attacking an obviously bewitched Krum? Forcing his way past Harry only to scream for his help when he was attacked by the roots? Granted, he came to his senses and told Harry to take the cup, but by and large he was not the sweet, noble Cedric portrayed in the book.<br/><br/>Krum's head is certainly NOT full of sawdust. He is not cocky. He REALLY isn't good-looking and graceful. Nor is he a ""physical being"" as in the book he tries non-stop to engage Hermione in conversation. And, speaking of Hermione. Collapsing in tears on the steps in the entrance hall - what the hell was that?! Hermione gets angry - and then cries in private, not out in the open like that.<br/><br/>Then there were the little things. Who is Nigel and where was Dennis Creevy? Where was Lavender Brown and why are both the Patil twins suddenly in Gryffindor? Where was the Ministry denial of Voldemort's return? All of that being said - in and of itself it was an excellent movie, if a little frantic pace wise. The SFX were flawless and the kids' acting has improved greatly over the years. I'll see it again and will add it to my collection when it hits DVD. And, to be fair as I told a friend - I probably wouldn't have been completely happy with a 6 hour version. I'm just that picky. In the end, it's still Harry Potter."
"ricedout","5","60","118","20 November 2005"," There was the good.....but the bad...
","After reading all the reviews for this movie, I can't help but wonder if half of the people who seen this movie actually read the book? Well let's get straight to the facts.<br/><br/>The movie was OK. There were definitely its strong parts. The special effects are amazing; the acting has definitely got better, and Voldemort was portrayed beautifully, and I must say, the ending definitely saved the movie from a total disaster.<br/><br/>But if you would like me to ramble on and on about the good parts, well, that's what the hundreds of positive other reviews in this site is for.<br/><br/>There definitely was a lot of material to cover in the fourth book and being a 2 ½ hour long movie, I was expecting parts to be cut; I wasn't disappointed, but actually amazed on how much was cut! The entire movie felt like it was being rushed. Before you could fully understand what was happening, another event begins which caused so much confusion. I was glad to have read the book, otherwise I would've gotten lost in the first 10 min of the film. Key explanations of what was happening were condensed into sentences that the audience could barely catch. Many time, there were whispers in the theater; ""what did he say"" ""did you catch that last word?"" ""what was that?"" A prime example would be during the Defense Against the Dark art class scene. My friend didn't even know what any of the three unforgivable curses were because the scene was extremely quick and choppy (in fact the entire movie felt choppy).<br/><br/>Character development was horrible (if there was any at all). The fight between Ron and Harry, and Ron and Hermione was completely lost. One minute they're all together as happy as can be, then the next all three won't even speak to each other (once again, the choppiness of the film played a part). Key characters were also thrust into the movie with no introduction at all. Rita Skeeter, instead of being sly and devilish, was quite annoying in the movie and I couldn't believe her scandal was dropped entirely! Also Dumbledore was portrayed COMPLETELY WRONG! He no longer looks or act like a wise, all-knowing and powerful wizard whom Voldemort fears, but rather a old geezer in the background.<br/><br/>Key events where put in with no reason at all. The scene in Snape's potion closet where they were discussing about the Dark Mark was pointless because the movie never came back on the fact that Snape was also once a Death Eater and has a Dark Mark himself. The scene in the Prefect's bathroom where there was so many sexual jokes is so unnecessary and the stained glass window with the naked mermaid, what was all that about? The traps and the monsters in the maze were completely left out! The world Quidditch cup was so short; makes the audience wonder ""where was the action?"" The most annoying part in the movie I have to say, was the Yule Ball. OMG! WTF was that!? The set was horribly made, everything was modernized, and character choices were just plain bad (Harry and Ron going out with two Indian girls just really didn't fit in). There great hall where the ball took place seemed smaller and cramped. There was confetti and pieces of decoration littered allover the floor (and I could've sworn I saw paper party plate). The concert like dance thing was just a total disaster and did not at all fit into the movie. At times I was asking myself ""am I watching a Harry Potter movie?"" The sense of ""magicalness"" was taken away in this once scene. Hogwarts no long looked like a grand, magical place but rather like in the inside of a high school gym during prom.<br/><br/>I can't imagine in my wildest dream the ball turned out the way it did. I expected to be real formal and classical. The director did a horrible job doing it (this is probably the worst part of the movie and ruined the entire Harry Potter series). When the DVD comes out, I can just imagining fast forwarding through the dance.<br/><br/>Too much time and effort was done trying to make this movie look good with special effects and humor that the essence of Harry Potter was ruined; character and plot development. The director modernized the movie too much making Hogwarts seem like more of a typical American high school (with immature kids and even a school band) rather then a grand place where people of a higher society go to learn magic (which by the way there was hardly any classroom scene in the movie).<br/><br/>I'd much rather have the movie run four or even five hours long, then to sit through certain part of this movie again. I really hope the next movie is as good, or at least able to explain the book, the way the first three did. *sigh* (disappointed)"
"c-blauvelt","10","10","15","23 November 2005"," As teenage angst sets in, Harry Potter must face once again his greatest enemy.
","If people aren't hooked by the very first shot in this movie, then there is really no hope for them. I knew from the very first instant of this film that it would be outstanding in every way. As opposed to the kid-friendly, John Williams tinker-bell score that sounds so similar to ""Somewhere in My Memory"" the movie begins with a much darker variation on the Harry Potter theme. The opening shot follows a snake to the crypt of the Riddle family and a statue that looks ominously like a Death Eater. I adore this first shot so much because it lets the viewer know that right away this film is going to be a lean, mean thriller. And thankfully, the opening scene of Voldemort, Peter Pettigrew, from here on known as Wormtail, and Barty Crouch Junior, immediately immerses you in the ""magical world"" as opposed to the ""real world"" of Harry's dreadful relatives, the Dursleys. Thankfully, the Dursleys are absent from the beginning of this film, and the story begins with Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys journeying to the Quidditch World Cup. Right away we realize that that opening scene was just a dream, a dream sequence that would become a dramatic motif throughout the rest of the film that often unifies disparate elements into a thriller format.<br/><br/>From the very beginning the cinematography in Goblet of Fire is so much more epic than in the other films with its vast sweeping crane and helicopter shots of breathtaking vistas. The mise-en-scene is infinitely darker than the other films even from the first few moments. I love the extremes in the production values here. I adore how so many of the shots throughout feature the darkest gray lighting and yet are of such sweeping expanses.<br/><br/>The film is expertly paced from the very beginning, instantly immersing the viewer in this magical world without the often awkward transition of Harry enduring the Dursleys for a while and then entering his world of magic. The dream sequence at the beginning casts a specter over the entire rest of the film, setting the overall mood. This chilling opening is continued with the brilliant attack on the Quidditch World Cup by Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters. The shots of the playing field after the attack are stunningly bleak, and the appearance of David Tennant as Barty Crouch Junior, who conjures the Dark Mark, is chilling. Barty Crouch Junior seems almost like some sadistic member of the Black and Tans with his leather boots and jacket.<br/><br/>So much plot is crammed in this movie that it is almost overwhelming to consider all that happened. I think that in terms of action scenes, the segment beginning the Tri-Wizard Tournament where Harry battles a dragon is one of the most exhilarating, edge-of-your-seat thrill rides I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I really have mixed feelings about the teenage romance aspects of this film. Although I think that there might be more there than just a copycat of a 1980s teen comedy, I can't ignore that this whole segment really does slow down the overall plot, especially since it was charging ahead with such glorious speed earlier. And I don't think the film gains back that same momentum until the very end. I think the underwater challenge is not nearly compelling enough for the amount of time allotted to it, but this is nearly forgotten by the brilliance of the final challenge in which Harry must enter a maze of doom. In this maze he and Cedric Diggory are transported to the graveyard of the Riddles seen at the beginning of the film, and there Harry confronts his old nemesis Lord Voldemort, after being forced to give him life by Wormtail. The Dark Lord is played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes, who turns in a performance of such over-the-top glee perfectly fitting the mountains of set-up in the first four movies leading up to this moment. Voldemort is half-serpent, half-Hamlet, a character really unlike any other I've ever seen. His genius is evident, but also his insecurity as he feels it necessary to duel Potter in order to prove his powers. The final moment of their duel when Harry's parents arrive to help him is the best surprise I could've imagined in that moment.<br/><br/>What more can I say about this film? It is a wildly entertaining roller coaster-ride, certainly not without its flaws, but an exhilarating experience nonetheless. Despite the crawl of the middle-section of the film the beginning and end are so perfectly paced it's hard afterwards to even remember that there was a time when it dragged. More than anything I just love how this movie franchise has now grown up with Harry. Gone is the predictable whimsy of a John Williams score. Absent is the kid-friendly, cartoonish sensibility that made the first movie, and even to some degree the second, rather formulaic. Mike Newell knows when it is important to have frenetic visual, loud sound effects, and a bombastic score and never overplays any of these elements like Chris Columbus was wont to do. In Chris Columbus's films never would there have been the quiet chill of Harry's exploration of the foggy maze or the eerie silence of the ruined Quidditch World Cup venue. Patrick Doyle's score is understated for the most part and only supplements the action occurring on screen. Mike Newell has learned from the previous installments that less can be more, not every moment has to be another peril, not every shot has to be filled with frenetic action or deafening sound effects. But when he does include these elements they have so much greater emotional intensity because they punctuate moments of relative quiet simplicity."
"jbenante-1","9","10","15","21 November 2005"," The Sadness of Coming of Age
","This fourth Harry Potter movie may be the best so far. Yes, there are far too many characters, probably more so than in the first three films, and of necessity most of them, especially those introduced here for the first time, have little or no dialog and are not fleshed out. Also, Hermione and Ron are more relegated to supporting characters than before. Still, the movie works on a number of levels, as pure adventure, suspense, and with a couple generous dollops of horror.<br/><br/>But the most horrific parts of the film come less from the very good special effects and more from what the movie evokes from the heart and experiences of those viewers who have lived beyond their teen years.<br/><br/>WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD! Nothing involving Voldemort, snakes, or spells was more disturbing to me than Harry's reaction when he returned from the maze with the corpse of his slain friend and fellow student. This was the first time, in my recollection, that Harry out and out wept - and his sobs were gut-wrenching. Those 30 or so seconds brought a spirit to this series that I'd never seen before. In Harry's weeping, I got the feeling that suddenly this wizard business wasn't much fun for him anymore, that the tournament, past trophies and triumphs, his own fame, none of it mattered much anymore, because now everything was tainted. Sometimes, people aren't just temporarily frozen or turned into ferrets until the proper magical antidote is conjured. Sometimes, they actually die, and their deaths aren't especially pretty or glamorous, just as was shown in the scene preceding this one. Harry's world has been tainted with the very close and personal experience of mortality and loss, and as his own sobs mingled with the wailing of the slain boy's father, the scene became, for me, almost too unbearable to watch in its horror and sadness. As Hermione tearfully acknowledged in the final scene, everything is going to change. It's going to change because these kids have come of age, and just as in the muggle world we inhabit, prior innocence can be remembered, but never recaptured.<br/><br/>During the drive home from the movie, our two teenagers chimed in with their thoughts. My son found it disappointing that Dumbledore didn't seem to have the air of calm, majesty, and invulnerability about him that he had in the previous films. It occurred to me then that, probably, Dumbldore hadn't necessarily changed; maybe it was Harry & company's perceptions of him that had changed, again because they are growing up. Most of us when we were very young perceived our parents and teachers as emotionally and morally infallible, until suddenly they're not anymore. In most cases, they never really changed; we did.<br/><br/>I don't remember the last time any movie inspired in me such contemplation over what it felt like to grow up and start seeing things that really hurt, and you begin to change. Not because you want to, but because you have to, because for most of us, NOT growing up isn't an option."
"Nevyn_85","1","32","59","22 November 2005"," why... why... WHYY!!!
","First of all... WHY!!! <br/><br/>Secondly I found this movie to be a great disappointment. I just don't know where to begin. So lets start from the beginning shall we?<br/><br/>first there was a harry potter book series written by J.K Rowling that was good, children and adults all over the word rejoiced. Then in comes Hollywood and says: Hi we want to make movies about this ""Harry Potter"" we have heard so much about. And Rowling is flattered to no end and says yes.<br/><br/>First movie: great to see Harry potter on the big screen, all right movie<br/><br/>Second movie: begins to get darker, you love it, I love it, we all love it.<br/><br/>Third movie: SLAM DUNK. They followed the plot of the book and made some ""changes"" for example casual clothing after school hours that just makes it feel so much more alive.<br/><br/>And now we have *drums* Number four: WHAT THE *BLEEP*, although I must admit I cried... allot! From the beginning to the bitter end! it was horrid, it almost felt like Hollywood was taking a big dump right on my copy of the book. I have a feeling that the chaps in Hollywood said: - Read! READ!? You want US to actually READ the book before we make a movie!? Preposterous!<br/><br/>at the beginning of the movie i just sat there with an uneasy feeling in my stomach because everything was going waaay to fast. and the usual ""slow start"" was no where to be seen. They just jumped right into all of it. Then what was up with that ridicules entrance into the great hall! I almost puked right there. And some of the later action sequences like 1st task WAY to overblown, in the book Harry just breezed trough it.<br/><br/>but okay I can almost of forgive that, after all it IS Hollywood. But what I can't forgive is the Butchering of Characters in this movie! And the victims are:<br/><br/>Dumbledore: in the book he's the calm, somewhat silly rock that hogwarts rests upon, in this movie he's well lets say not that calm. He shouts, grabs, maybe even pinches and bites. and I can't shake thee feeling that he is a mean drunk some of the time.<br/><br/>And then Krum... ooh poor krum, he became the teen movie Jock. in the book he is insecure, somewhat frail, clumsy on the ground, quite intelligent and ugly. in the movie he has an Kelvin kline model with an ego the size of Hagrid and so stupid Crab and Goyle seems like Einstein in comparison. <br/><br/>AND there is not even a whisper about fleur being 1/4 veela. I mean COMMON! How hard can it be to fit that in! <br/><br/>just to name the biggest.<br/><br/>The thing this movie lacks that number three is filled with is: Soul, character interaction, character building, and sense of details.<br/><br/>So if you want to see some kind of cool action scenes, and special effects for 308 000 000 dollars, be my guest. But if you want Harry potter. take a cup of coco, a blanket, light a fire and read the book. because this ladies and gentlemen is NOT Harry potter!"
"The_Rogue_Phoenix","1","27","49","21 November 2005"," It was all a let down, save for Neville
","Despite the fact that the third Harry Potter movie was deeply disappointing, I was going to give this one a chance. There was a new director, so I was not going to judge without seeing the movie. One look at the trailers and I figured, this movie ought to be pretty good. I was proved more than wrong. <br/><br/>Based on the choppy scenes with no genuine transitions and lack of continuity, the movie itself seemed like one big trailer that would be promoting the ""real film."" I find it hard to believe that anyone who had not read the books could follow along in the beginning at all. I was very let down within the first ten minutes of the movie. At least the last one was able to keep me happy for half an hour. The only reason I continued watching was because I paid 6.50 for my ticket and I figured they could not butcher it more than they already had.<br/><br/>I knew from the first scene that they had gone and rewritten it again when I saw the ""third"" man in the room with Voldemort and Wormtail. I knew straight away what they had done and that by placing Barty Crouch Junior in the room they would be able to magically write out the house elves. That is the moment that I knew they ruined what makes the Harry Potter series so great, the mystery. In the first ten minutes they managed to write out all of the mystery, which is what makes the books worth reading. Harry was never supposed to prematurely know that Crouch Junior was alive, that is half of the shock at the end of the book. The movies without that mystery turn into cheap fantasy thrillers with a bit of teenage drama.<br/><br/>The beginning is probably one of the main reasons I intensely dislike this movie. Then what angered me further was the unnecessary scenes that were lengthened or inserted into the movie for ""action."" For example, the chase scene with the dragon which lasted a good seven or eight minutes long could have been taken out for its useless (intended to be) climax of action. In the book, Harry never left the arena and that scene in the movie was completely ridiculous with them climbing on the roof of the castle. Then there was the scene when the other schools arrived and there was like a five minute show they put on that was completely meaningless. It was like a circus performance and had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. They could have kept the dragon scene like it is in the book and took out the little performances by the other schools and then done a little more work on the beginning and end. The end more so because they left out parts integral to the next book. <br/><br/>They failed to have Dumbledore explain what exactly Prior Incantatem was and why Voldemort and Harry's wands failed to work against one another. It was also never stated that the ministry refuses to believe that Voldemort is back, and that is the most important information because the entire fifth book is based around the fact that almost no one believes Harry that Voldemort is back. Although not as major as the last bit of ""forgotten"" information, they also left out how Dumbledore was rallying old friends to start fighting against Voldemort, the triwizard winnings and how Harry gave them to Fred and George, and they even left loose ends. They began the Rita Skeeter story line but they never concluded it, they just stopped mentioning or showing her halfway through the movie. I'm sure they did such a cut for time, but Rita skeeter plays a roll in the next book when Harry tries to convince the wizarding world of the truth. Now all of that is only most of the reasons I hated it. If anyone wishes to discuss further or ask more detailed questions you can e-mail me at padfoot_3@yahoo.com.<br/><br/>There was one thing I DID enjoy in the movie and that was Neville. Everything else was absolutely dreadful whether it was the acting, the writing, or the cuts, but Neville I loved. In fact I like his character more than I used to due to this movie. Ron was my favorite character (in the books) but now he is tied for first with poor Neville. I am also saddened that most of the real Harry Potter comedy is written out of the movies and they insert corny movie comedy. All the comedy the story needs is in Fred and George and they always leave any of their scenes on the cutting room floor. Or maybe they don't even consider including them. <br/><br/>As a Harry Potter fan and a moviegoer, this movie was atrocious and I will never recommend watching this movie. It was a waste of time that could have been put to better use. If anyone does feel compelled to watch it I suggest not paying to see it, borrow it from the library and fast forward over all parts except any scene in which Neville plays a part (which is only about five scenes). I will reiterate how tragic Neville always seems and this makes him more likable.<br/><br/>I would just like to say that as a person who never watches football and has never liked it, I would have spent my time better had I watched the Ohio State vs. Michigan game instead. <br/><br/>To anyone who e-mails me, I will gladly reply. If you read this entire comment, then kudos to you."

","I was lucky to have the opportunity to see this movie. I know that people are tired of hearing this, but is THE BEST POTTER FILM I've ever seen. OK, I'm a fan of Harry Potter, but not so much of their movies. I think that the three previous movies were OK, but it has a different style of the last one (the previous hadn't so much mysterious, well at least the first and the third). The music was OK (although Patrick Doyle used a lot of violins) and the Mcbeth sisters were excellent! Of my part I think that this is the best of Newell (Mona Lisa smile was boring!!!)and I hope him to direct another Potter movie. My rate is 10/10, i'm glad to say that it deserved it :)."

Then the whole world cup and the Veelas, nope, cut out. Then I thought, they'll have to get it right soon, ha, no flying muggles.<br/><br/>Some thing that I noticed is that Dobby and Bagman were missing. Along with Dobby, SPEW/the house-elf liberation front was missing. Neville was able to dance, and the Cho-Harry-Cedric triangle was all thrown off. Everything, including Dumbledore's emotion, was thrown out of proportion.<br/><br/>Before you judge, or go on, note that I do realize the effort and problems with a book this size.<br/><br/>Anyway. Some of these things were taken out because they were needed to be: Crouch Junior attacked dear old papa, the little joke behind McGonagall putting her hair down, Moody's grand entrance, the mermaid picture helping, Skeeter's ""ability"", many obstacles on the third task, Harry and the Weasley's in a box with the ministers, and why Krum went all crazy on the third task."
"unbreakabletrekkie","1","23","42","26 November 2005"," The perfect example to not make another Harry Potter movie
","I would vote 0 except it's not an option. OK, I know that it's necessary to cut out some of the book to keep the movie under 10 hours. After seeing this, though, I see the writers and director do not have the finesse required to make necessary cuts/changes and produce an even mediocre movie. The acting was the least believable that I've seen in a while (and that's including Zorro 2 by the way). No one made a dramatic pause or was able to say even a simple undramatic sentence without some huge physical gesture. Dumbledore's walking around the Goblet of Fire when the champions were announced reminded me of the Ferengi in an early episode of Star Trek the next generation where they were dodging around and growling for no apparent reason. The characters were mutilated beyond recognition (with the possible exception of Harry because they just can't do that), like Dumbledore being more of a hothead and forcing Harry back once his name is called instead of the serene scholar who cares about his students and would never do anything resembling manhandling them. Victor Krum reminded me of the roast ham at Thanksgiving dinner yesterday except the ham was smarter, better looking, and had more lines, a complete contrast from the star of Bulgaria Krum was in the books. I could go much farther in the intense hatred this movie has inspired in me but the box says I have a limit, so I'll wrap it up. The whole thing says ""OK this is something we're just churning out to make money off the quality books through name recognition, so we don't need to put any actual thought or effort into it."""

","I cannot count on one hand how many times I had read the book. I absolutely LOVE the book and I had very high expectations for the movie. I agonized with myself how in the heck were they going to slim it down to under 3 hours, but they did it. Like the last movie, I expected major plot aspects to be left out of this movie. I feel that Prisoner of Azkaban (POA) left to much important details out to focus on other things. Don't get me wrong though it was a good movie but don't get me started on what they should have included.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire (GOF) was everything I could have expected it to be, even more so! Granted...if we could have it our way...we could included absolutely everything from the book but then the movie would be 6 hours long. If you had to cut something for the sake of making a movie the crew of GOF did it appropriately.<br/><br/>GOF was surprisingly upbeat though. I expected it to be darker (scarier) than POA in may ways. But I found myself laughing very often. Which seems like a great set-up for Order of the Phoenix as far as the Weasly twins are concerned. For those of you who know the books and have seen GOF than you know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>GOF had great special effects and Mike Newell did a wonderful job directing the actors to appropriately portray their characters. It's a tough job and it couldn't have been done better. A huge 10 for me!"

"smoothhoney1265","6","18","32","24 November 2005"," Four champions and a funeral
","So this is the new, long awaited Harry Potter, the adaptation of the fourth part of the legendary magical book series. I've been waiting for this movie for, let's say a year now. And from what I've heard, seen in the trailer and the MTV Making of I was optimistic. Even more so because Mike Newell directed the film who also did one of my favourite films, ""Four weddings and a funeral"". And yes, I had high expectations. <br/><br/>The beginning is spectacular. I didn't mind that they left the Dursleys out  we had the Weasleys rescuing Harry from his summer holiday jail in the second Harry Potter film already. Then the film directly dives into the Quidditch finals and all the scary events surrounding it. Now, I thought, now we'll see the spectacular game! But would you believe it, after some impressions of the audience and a spectacular appearance of the two teams, the Irish and the Bulgarian, we are already taken away from the game. And so on, and so on. This is basically how the whole film goes: The director throws us into a situation and after some minutes takes us out of it without letting us time to understand or let it work. Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments. And Mike Newell shows that he has a good sense of humour. But Harry Potter is not a slapstick-comedy and we don't need a laughter every two seconds. <br/><br/>The fourth Harry Potter book has so many interesting moments and potential  the stunning Quidditch World Championship final, the dangerous tasks at the Triwizard Tournament and its tragic ending, the romantic moments at the Yule Ball. Those were the scenes I was most looking for and Mike Newell spoiled ALL of them. Where is the wonderful scene in the garden that takes place after the Yule Ball? Where are all (or at least some) of the great obstacles that Harry has to face in the maze when it comes to the final showdown between him and Cedric in the tournament?<br/><br/>In my opinion the best two adaptations of Harry Potter are still the first two films under the direction of Chris Columbus. Some say those films are way too kitschy, but they had something you love in the books but never find in the third and fourth film: A heart, a soul and  most of all  magic. Mike Newell himself said that the fourth book is a thriller. Yes, it is. But it is also a fairy tale and about magic. We can't find neither of these two qualities in the film. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is nothing more than situations and impressions lined up after one another. Without emotion, without sense and without giving the viewer time to breath in between. So at some point you just lean back, switch your head off and watch the kids and adults work in their roles. But if this moment arrives during a film it's the worst thing this film can do. Besides, I don't want to criticize it just because I'm a fan of the books. I'm glad I read the book before seeing this film. Because if somebody sees this film without reading the book first he will get more questions than answers. For example  Harry's dream of the house, where he sees Voldemort, is never explained in the film. Yes, it is foreshadowing the ending but we all know that there is another link (and is explained in the book). If you don't know the link you ask yourself: Why the heck did he show this dream sequence? He might as well have left it out.<br/><br/>A word about the cast Nothing to complain about the adults  they're gorgeous as usual. As for the trio  I really liked Daniel's performance  he's getting better with every film and this one was maybe his best so far. Rupert ""Ron"" Grint is the only one of the three who really goes through a change  he is no clown any more and not only a sidekick  he begins to question things (including his friendship to Harry) and to develop his own personality. Emma Watson  well, what shall I say? She's not a bad actress but thanks to the director she behaves like a hysteric little girl throughout the whole movie  which most of the time is absolutely unnecessary. In general I must say that the director really achieved making slapstick clowns of most of the cast. Hello, we're not in a Charlie Chaplin movie here! In my opinion the best performance of the film comes from a youngster that stayed in the background and was nothing but a laugh so far  Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom. He's basically the only teenager that could carry the character of the book to the screen and through the whole movie  he is a shy boy discovering the girls and maturing. His performance was really touching.. It's a good co-incidence and a good job by the young actor because in the next Harry Potter movie Neville Longbottom will play an important role. Nice performances also by the gorgeous and hunky Robert Pattinson as the tragic hero Cedric Diggory and the charming Katie Leung as Cho. <br/><br/>All in one ""Harry Potter and the GoF"" is a 3-hour-trailer: Scenes and people are introduced without letting them space to develop their character, we get hints and foreshadowings, surprises and impressions but you cannot really see a flow or a plot. So for everyone who doesn't want to think, doesn't care about magic or good cinema, this is the right film. I do and this is why I was very disappointed."

","The Goblet of Fire was the first book in the Harry Potter series that I actually read (i know, lets start at the very beginning a very good place to start - you don't have to say it) and it soon became the best book that i had ever read. Even when i went back to the start and read all the other plus the 2 most recent, the Goblet of Fire still remains for me my fave book! So it was with trepidation that i approached this movie, even though i had loved the past 3 films i had felt that nothing had come close to the excellence of the books! In my opinion, not only was the Goblet of Fire the best book i had ever read but now in my personal opinion the film adaptation is the best film i have ever seen! From the moment we see poor old Eric Sykes die a horrible death (he probably deserved it for all those crappy 'sykes' episodes) to the stunning yuletide ball, to the dragons, merpeople, beautiful beauxbatons, hunky durmstrangs, and the sublime maze scenes - this film was a f*****g cracker!

","Having read all 6 books to date (each several times), and having enjoyed the first 3 films, I must say that this installment is by far the worst.<br/><br/>A better name for the film adaptation would have been ""Harry Potter and the Triwizard Tournament."" This title would have accurately described the Mike Newell version of the great fourth book. I have read and listened to all the media outlets about Mike Newell's understanding of the English boarding school and ""wonderfully"" applying it to the Harry Potter world, but if that is the scope of his expertise, please don't let him direct any more Potter movies, because there were no school scenes at all apart from the ONE Defense Against the Dark Arts class.<br/><br/>More to the point, Warner Brothers needs to reconsider it's Potter franchise. If the intent is to merely pay homage to the wonderful world that J.K. Rowling has provided us in canon by giving the public a general overview filled with empty action sequences, and to get as many people in the theater seats as possible to earn a buck or two (million), then go ahead with these travesties. However, if you wish to keep a loyal fan base to go along with the books, then you will have to spend more time, effort, and (gasp!) money to provide us with what we really want - a more faithful adaptation of the stories.<br/><br/>As the film gets moving, I thought I must have entered the wrong theater because the music that introduced the movie sounded remarkably like the ""Batman"" theme, with a ""Hedwig's Theme"" remix in the background. For heaven's sake, get a new composer! Then, for no reason, we are thrown into the movie with Hermione yelling at Harry and Ron to hurry up. What?! Harry is supposed to be at the Dursley's during the summer. How did he get to the Burrow?<br/><br/>I thought the movie would get interesting for The Quidditch World Cup and it did... the effects were great, but the original plot line was lost as soon as it cut from the introduction of Krum directly to the Weasley's tent and the screaming kids.<br/><br/>And what's with Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore?? When, in the books, has Dumbledore ever yelled at Harry and shook him or any other student so violently??? This is WAY off course. I could accept Gambon's Dumbledore in POA, but this is ridiculous! As another poster similarly mentioned, if this is how he reacts to Harry's name coming out of the Goblet of Fire, what will he do when Harry ""sees"" the attack on Mr. Weasly from the snake's viewpoint in Order of the Phoenix?<br/><br/>These examples perfectly summarize the rest of the film... abrupt cuts from the middle of one scene to another part of the plot with no explanation or reason as to how it happened, and a generally bad portrayal of Dumbledore.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this movie to those who have not read any of the books. Only someone who is unaware of the real plot of the book will enjoy this film. It is empty action sequences with some barely recognizable filler material in between.<br/><br/>Boooo! Two thumbs way down for this one."

Although the fourth book is my favourite I was worried that it would lack something in the transfer to film. I was wrong! The new kids are great as are Emma and Rupert. Daniel Radcliffe is good but very similar to the last film. He's a good actor but I don't think he is strong enough to lead the franchise. Ironically the real leads are the outstanding supporting characters, such as Alan Rickman's Snape and especially Maggie Smith's McGonagall. Michael Gambon is good but I'm still thinking of Richard Harris when I read the books. Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody is amazing as is Ralph Fiennes as V.... He Who Must Not Be Named!

","I've never read the books, and they may very well stimulate the imaginations of children all over the world. That's commendable. BUT as a movie series, these movies have been mediocre at best. This latest movie, Goblet Of Fire, is the worst yet. It's slow paced, the characters are either not interesting or completely annoying, and the movie is so dark that it's impossible to see things sometime. The biggest problem I have is not with the film itself, but with the actors' thick accents, quick speech patterns, and tendency to whisper, it's impossible to understand what they are saying half the time. The movie does have some noteworthy sequences though. Harry's face off with a dragon is very exciting. An underwater rescue is also very good, with some amazing special effects. A sequence involving a huge hedge maze that makes the maze in the Shining look like child's play, is exciting, but possibly way too scary and violent for young kids. It's rated PG-13 for a reason. I'm not a Harry Potter fan, but I gave the movie a chance because my kids wanted to see it, and I was very interested in seeing the Superman Returns preview they were going to show before the movie (and that looks INCREDIBLE). But neither I nor my children were at all impressed. For our money....ZATHURA was FAR superior. Stick to the books kids, I'm sure they are far better than this drivel."

","I have just back from seeing this. Right now, I should be doing something more important, but I had to put this down before my head explodes! I really, honestly do not know what to say about this film. It's beautifully made, yes. The acting is much improved, yes. But the unbelievable liberties that were taken - what are you meant to say about that? From the off, Harry's dream about Voldemort etc is horribly altered by adding an unrelated character - it may not seem that important, but it is. And Dumbledore - I think Michael Gambon is an exemplary actor, but to see Dumbledore lose it with Harry in such an uncharacteristic way was dumbfounding.<br/><br/>See, I can understand why things have to be left out - it's a long book, and there are extraneous elements. For one, there's Rita Skeeter - so why keep part of her storyline in, and ignore the rest? What really annoys me, though, were the ridiculous plot and character revisions that occurred. It's such a pointless exercise that I can't even see why it was done.<br/><br/>I don't blame Mike Newell, as I think he did a great job. In terms of the complete destruction of Dumbledore's character, you really can't blame Gambon. The only person to blame is the utter idiot that adapted it - the lack of grasp of what was important and what was not astounded me. You would think that they would have read the books and I feel sorry for the director of OOTP as they really have their work cut out - many of their main characters, that we should already be familiar with, have barely been introduced if at all. Sirius 30 second CG appearance was ridiculous. Again, I wish these people would really read the book - at one point, the expelliarmus charm managed to knock someone off their feet whilst they were still holding their wand - getting small details like that wrong is rather ridiculous too.<br/><br/>I saw the film with my fiancé who has not read the books, and he was rather confused by it - you didn't even see the seasons change, and the film felt so rushed and the plot was so unexplained that it might as well have been 6 weeks rather than an academic year.<br/><br/>Oh well - it's a great looking film, and I was most pleased to see the split-second appearance of Jarvis Cocker, Jonny Greenwood et al, but it's relationship to the book is somewhat distance - second cousin twice removed perhaps?"

But this movie does NOT do the book justice, anyone who is a true fan of the books could tell you that. The sheer volume of information that was left out of this movie almost made me sick. They cut out several highly important characters from the book, such as Winky the house-elf, Ludo Bagman, The Dursleys, and Molly and Percy Weasly, but yet they had time to add in nonsense scenes that never occurred in the book. One of the greatest blows was that they did not even show the quidditch world cup being played! The merely introduced it and then switched the next scene. The rapid switching of the scenes was to become commonplace throughout the movie, and I feel that if I was not already overly familiar with he books that I would not be able to understand it. If the studio would have made it into two movies and not tried to cram the 600+ page book, it would have been one of the most stunning movies of this year. but as it stands, it is a disappointment to the book, and to Harry Potter fans everywhere."
"MrSharma","7","5","7","4 December 2005"," Decent but severely flawed
","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" presents the fourth installment of the Harry Potter franchise, illustrating a significantly darker take on the characters we've come to love and allowing us to see the dark Lord Voldemort resurrected to his full power. Easily one of the better books of the entire series by JK Rowling (including books 5 and 6), the darker and scarier take on the story was welcomed by fans of the films and the books everywhere as Director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) attempts to attach his name to an ever-growing franchise. But, rest assured, this film has many flaws.<br/><br/>For one, the acting remains a substantial problem that is bound to plague the fans for the remainder of the franchise, including the next few films that are already signed up. The big budget and the excellent special effects can't alleviate the responsibility that the three young actors have to presenting decent performances. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), despite improving immensely since the previous installment, remains stiff and uncharismatic on screen whereas Emma Watson's melodramatic take on the character of Hermione had the entire audience frustrated. She seems to be throwing herself into her role with too much gusto and enthusiasm, resulting in a pretentious and unsatisfying performance that remains a plague on the rest of the film's merits. Dumbledore is pathetic in his role, completely misunderstanding the direction of his character and ultimately illustrating Newell's lack of grasp of what Harry Potter is really all about. The only actor that seems to stand out in a positive light is indeed Rupert Grint (Ron) who takes his performance easily. From his flawless comic timing to his understanding of the more serious scenes as well, here is an actor we will no doubt see after the Harry Potter film franchise has concluded. He stands out as the more talented of the three teenagers.<br/><br/>Newell's direction is furthermore extremely flawed, surprising after the brilliant and entertaining ""Donnie Brasco"". Not only does he fail to understand the needs and wants of the actors in their respective performances, but he seems to also clutch no grasp of what made this book so amazing. Gone now is the magic of Chris Columbus in the first and second installments of the franchise, and supposedly Newell was to present a darker take on our heroes. He does so, but at what expense? Whereas the book by all means illustrated a darker take, it did so through a compromise with the more magical and ""Christmassy"" elements of the first few Harry Potter books as well as the scarier elements. Newell completely abandons the magic of the first few films and goes for an all out ""noir"", losing one of the best bits about a Harry Potter film: magic.<br/><br/>The script remains tarred, leaving out some of the best and most entertaining elements of the novel such as the opening Quidditch World Cup - an exhilarating read and surely an excellent addition to the film? Once again, the elements that made the book so magical are completely left out in the script and are failed to be remedied by Newell's poor direction. The script's inability to identify emotions and character is further exemplified through the completely underdeveloped problem of Ron's jealousy of Harry, as well as the seemingly over-developed problem of Ron and Hermione's increasingly changing relationship. Where the book merely hints at such a concept, the script-writer deems it at the forefront and shows a half-assed attempt at a romantic comedy within a few weak scenes. It doesn't help when Emma Watson takes it seriously, either.<br/><br/>That being said, the special effects are relatively good throughout the three tasks that our Tri-Wizard champions must face - ranging from the amazing sequence of Harry dodging left and right to avoid the Hungarian Horntail Dragon hot on his heels, to the murky depths of the school lake as Harry explores the underworld of the blue. The cinematography of the film is fairly decent also, but by no means a notch above the previous three films. Other technical aspects such as the score and the editing are relatively impressive but again pose no substantial superiority over the previous three films.<br/><br/>To sum up the film ... Different; yes. Better; not necessarily. A darker take definitely, Newell forgets to show the real magic behind the Harry Potter franchise. Poor acting for major characters, a patchy and inconsistent script that seemingly misinterprets the brilliance of Rowling's fourth novel, and Newell's inability to direct both the action and the actors on screen result in a film that is mediocre at best and completely undeserving of the recent hype that has accompanied its theatrical release. <br/><br/>All we can hope for is that the next film brings back the magic."

It still features most of the cast from the first three movies, including Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson and Hermione Granger. Mike Newell took the head for directing this time and Patrick Doyle provided the music, rather than John Williams of ""Star Wars"" fame.<br/><br/>The U.S. Edition of the ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" book is 754 pages long, which translates into an audiobook with a total 20 hour, 30 minute running time. With this huge length, the question on many peoples' minds is --- were they able to successfully convert this into a film of approximately 2 and 1/2 hours? Overall, I'd say the answer is a resounding yes. The film features exactly those moments that are essential to the plot, plus a few nice bonuses as well to help to appease those that would otherwise be upset about too many cuts. The film looks and sounds excellent and the writing, acting and directing are superb. The tasks look great and while they're all changed or shortened from their original book versions, they're excellent fun. The Yule Ball is largely intact, including the tension between Ron and Hermione. As for the tension between Harry and Ron before the first task, it's even ratcheted up a bit --- with Ron telling Harry to ""p*** off"" and even an insinuation that Ron is behind the Potter Stinks, Support Cedric Diggory --- The Real Hogwarts Champion buttons that nearly everyone seems to be wearing. And, yes, Ralph Fiennes is truly terrifying as the darkest wizard of all times --- Lord Voldemort. You'll feel a thrill of dread as he revels in the pleasure he takes from Harry's pain as he touches his scar and feel Harry's terror as he battles for his life.<br/><br/>Some notes on the changes and cuts --- one of the most major changes was the presence of Barty Crouch Jr. in the scenes with Voldemort and Wormtail. I found this an interesting choice and they worked it nicely into the film without hurting the plot any. Another nice change was having Neville provide Harry with the gillyweed he needs to breathe underwater. This is especially notable because in the book, the fake Mad Eye Moody makes such a point of the fact that Harry's pride and independence kept him from asking Neville for help.<br/><br/>Some great scenes that weren't cut from the movie --- Malfoy is turned into a ferret (although this scene was altered somewhat), Harry talks with Sirius in the Gryffindor common room fire and Myrtle helps (and pesters) Harry in his bath.<br/><br/>There were only a few changes and cuts that I was unhappy about. During the Quidditch World Cup, they showed almost no actual Quidditch play at all. While I understand that they have to keep things moving, this loss still hurts. Another thing I think really should have been included was Mad Eye Moody placing the Imperius curse upon Harry and then Harry later resisting it when Lord Voldemort uses it on him (which Voldemort doesn't in the movie.) One other complaint is that they should have researched certain pronunciations better --- akk-i-o for ""accio"" and Bo-bat-ons for ""Beauxbatons"" was just wrong.<br/><br/>Finally, I'll touch on the music --- a compelling mix of traditional instrumental themes and fun vocal pieces this time around. ""The Quidditch World Cup"" contains Irish themes as well as chanting that fully evoke the passion of this great event. The ""Hogwarts March"" is a nice fun theme. ""Neville's Waltz"" has a very classical feeling to it, but is also used for great humor in the film. My favorite vocal piece is ""Magic Works,"" a sort of ballad that plays during the closing credits.<br/><br/>A few critics have complained that those who haven't read the books won't be able to follow along, but I don't think so. Sure, there are a few things that may be confusing, but as long as you keep your eyes and ears open, you should have no problems. And if you still have any questions afterward, you can always search the Internet or ask a friend.<br/><br/>Whether you've read the books or not, see ""Goblet of Fire,"" likely the best film of 2005, today."

","I planned on spending a night of my Thanksgiving break home from college watching one of my favorite books be put to the screen. Instead of seeing a book portrayed as a movie, I saw a movie portrayed as a Sparknotes guide. It touched most of the scenes in the book, but it put many out of order, and for those that were put in the correct order, they simply didn't flow and had poor connecting transitions. I felt that this movie to portray highlights from the book rather than being the book itself. The worst part about it is how bad Dumbledore was portrayed. He did not match the loving sage that Richard Harris gave us and that J.K. Rowling describes him as. Also, the whole rise of the dark lord was skewed, and it should have been one of the covert themes of the movie, but it didn't become what was the main point of the book until the last 20 minutes of the movie. Overall, I had to explain to many people why things happened when the movie should have depicted it better."

","It wasn't true to the book. They needed to have more about it, and they needed to redo the scene were the Drumsdrang and Beuxbatons students came in. They also needed to redo Ron. They put in the stupid boyish acts like when he was looking at the girls. I mean, if they were going to make the movie of the book, they have to make it what least somewhat the same. They did good with the Philosopher's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets. But when the got to the Prisinor of Azkaban the just lost it. This movie had the way of being good, but it wasn't. And another thing, how come most of it was at night. Like during the second task, it was supposed to be morning. This movie (in my opinion)is horrible. I really think that they need to redo it. And Dumbledore, he wasn't that calm old man. Instead he was rather angry and impatient. Especially when Harrys name was chosen for the Triwizard tournament. They left out many important parts and people:<br/><br/><ul><li>The Dursleys weren't included</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They never find out Hagrid isn't half giant</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They didn't put in Dudley and the Ton-Tongue toffee</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ludo Bagman wasn't mentioned</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The discussion between Dumbledore and Fudge didn't come up, which should have if they are going to make Order of the Pheonix</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Winky and Dobby wasn't in</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hermione never catches Rita Skeeter as an animagus, which is also crucial in the Order of the Pheonix, only not as much</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Weasley's Wizard Weezes are not mentioned</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Harry never got the money for the Twiwizard tournament</li></ul><br/><br/>None of these came up during the movie.

","I had a great time watching this film. I'm always concerned that book-to-film adaptations will lose a lot of the finer points of the book, but that's not the case here. The writing team very nicely trimmed the fat of the book and even enhanced it as they realized there are six distinct acts of the narrative, and the rest is non-essential. The only noteworthy plot ""changes"" are that Barty Crouch Jr appears in the first scene, and the third task definitely changed (no cloud, skrewt, or sphinx). No house elves either, so anything that Dobby or Winky did was assigned to someone else. They also chopped a ton off the introduction (gimme more Mr. Weasley!) A couple other quick complaints: Hermione becomes a bit of a tramp (Ron, Harry, and her Ball date all seem to be getting some) and Dumbledore displays a violent temper (Richard Harris is sorely missed - Gambon's comments about Dumbledore show he's not in tune with the character). The lead-up to and the Yule Ball scene were hilarious - boys and girls are so dumb at age 14. The new cast additions are all great: Mad-Eye Moody is magnificent, Rita Skeeter is correctly abominable (but underused) and you can't help but have a huge crush on Cho Chang. The tournament tasks are appropriately breathtaking and the graveyard scene is equally creepy and exhilarating (what a surprise, Ralph Fiennes is great). I'm thrilled they got this one right; good luck making a movie of the 5th book."

"randerdk1","6","7","11","25 November 2005"," Disappointing
","I am a huge Harry Potter fan. The other movies have been great, and very true to the books. My favorite is Prisoner of Azkaban. This movie was a decent movie if seen in comparison to a generic action movie, but for a Harry Potter movie it was disappointing.<br/><br/>I think Newell fell in love with special effects. He spend a lot of time on special effects scenes that did not deserve it. For instance he made a huge scene when Harry has to compete against the dragon, and it drags out. Sure its scary. Sure its cool special effects. But there are no character developments, its a cheap thrill.<br/><br/>In comparison the end scene when Harry meets Voldemort is rushed through. This scene really should be an emotional high point. Heart wrenching and scary. Harry gets to see his friend killed, and he is part of the reason that Voldemort can come back at all. Finally he gets to interact with the ghosts of his parents. All these things are rushed through, and not emphasized nearly enough. The dragon scene was longer than this scene.<br/><br/>Finally - Hermione, smart, gutsy Hermione is relegated to a much too small role in this movie. She is also given a very girly girl role.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is supposed to be character driven - not driven by cheap action thrills and special effects."

","Finally!! The HP movie I have been waiting for.<br/><br/>No, it's not perfect, and rather I'm rather thankful, because that means the next one has room to be even better. But Goblet of Fire is far and away the best movie of series.<br/><br/>The movie is full of action and I was able to get totally into the suspense of it all, even though I have read the book several times and already knew everything that was going to happen.<br/><br/>The kids are finally kids! Mike Newell added a touch that has been missing, but increasingly needed, and that was to show the students as actual people, joking around, having fun, fighting with watch other, etc. This realism adds so much not only to this movie, in terms of fun and real heart, but lets the audience get to know the students and care about them and their struggles.<br/><br/>The ending is pretty much flawless- powerful, touching, and exactly as I had imagined it, while still remaining true to the aims of this film.<br/><br/>On of my biggest reservations about this movie is Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore as a little too panicky for my taste. Dumbledore is supposed to be, at least seemingly, very calm and in control of situations that arise in GoF. He doesn't know exactly what's going on or why in the book, yet he is always with an air of wisdom and power, and this is the reason Harry trusts him so limitlessly and comes to rely on him completely to be able to take care of any matters that arise.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is not only the best Potter movie to date, but one of my favorite movies of the year. It's action-packed, funny, real, sometimes scary, moving, and above all, heartfelt. You won't be disappointed by this one."
"katyahkatrynn","3","7","11","19 November 2005"," Not as good as it should've been
","******spoilers****** I guess the Harry Potter movies hit their peak with Prisoner of Azkaban--which had the benefit of being the only one thusfar to have a director with actual talent and skill. A director good enough to keep the audience from noticing what a poor scriptwriter Steven Kloves really is.<br/><br/>The plotting and pacing in this is really poor; the script itself as an adaptation as weak--as an actual movie it is utter drivel. There are individual lines that are good, but which worked better in the trailers (and which, unlike the movie itself, I actually liked). The script is written entirely to fans who are already familiar to the plot (with minor explanations never coming about, and are sure to confuse anyone who hasn't read the book). And for those of us with the benefit of actually having read the book, many details just felt heavy-handed.<br/><br/>Two of the worst things about the movie lie in the characterization (or lack thereof) and the all the illogical changes and additions. I didn't care much for the first two movies, but I don't think I have ever felt more emotionally unattached to these main characters--which is even more tragic considering the fact that Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are the best they've ever been. The interpretation of Moody was not at all to my liking--too physical and juvenile for my tastes--and my high opinion of Gambon's Dumbledore from PoA has diminished. I'm afraid they're already past the point of some of the best characters ever being what they are in the books (like Dumbledore and McGonagall).<br/><br/>What's worse is that they took precious time that could've been better devoted to characters and instead decided to extend it for the silly action sequences I had hoped we left behind with Columbus finally pulled his claws out of the series. The first task is extended to a stupid fight in which the ""dragon"" (though not really a dragon, because it was actually a wyvern) chases Harry to the castle and we have painful moments of watching him hang from an upper turret of the castle trying to get back to his broom--before they fly off and go over a cliff. There's a similar addition in the second task involving Harry being attacked by grindylows (I think that's what they were) that was wholly unnecessary and felt like it was done because someone was having too much fun playing around with special effects. And a lot of other additionally scenes--e.g. McGonagall teaching the students how to dance--ultimately served no purpose and did *not* need to be there.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was stilted, and cuts from scene to scene illogical (there was almost no linearity to it--it felt like a series of scenes cut together that have little more in common than the fact that Harry is in every single one of them) and my opinion of Steven Kloves and Mike Newell (who already brought us the dreadful Mona Lisa Smile) could not be lower. Other HP fans will say it's great--and they're welcome to their opinion. But I still would recommend to people--anyone, HP fan or no--to *not* waste your money on this movie. It is, I'm sad to say, the worst of the series thusfar."
"worstdirectorever","1","16","31","19 November 2005"," Horrible worst movie in the series!
","This movie is so bad for fans of the book. They just have stuff not explained and I can't say it here because it would be a spoiler. The movie is boring and all the scenes that were so great in the book are either shortened or not exciting or scary like in the book. The worst thing is it keeps not setting up movie 5 and now movie 5 will probably be terrible but not as bad as this because this one was really bad! What I liked was the 3 actors Harry Hermione and Ron. They were better than ever! That's almost all the movie has good. Even the tri-wizard stuff is not that exciting. Dumbledore acts weird and mean and nothing like Dumbledore has ever acted. Wait until you see Dumbledore you will be shocked he is like a jerk! I wanted to love this movie because I'm a Harry Potter fan and love all 6 books and I loved the 2nd and 3rd movie and thought the 1st movie was even pretty good but this one is just bad. I would not recommend seeing it to anyone especially anyone who reads and loves the books!"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","3","30","65","18 November 2005"," One of the most boring films I have seen this year!
","I know I'm going to make loads of enemies by saying this but I just don't see why everyone is going nuts over this film. There are billions of biased Harry Potter lunatics out there who would give this film 10/10 before even seeing it, even if the director did nothing but wipe his ass on the celluloid. That isn't the case, but it's still one of the most boring films I've had to sit through in a long time.<br/><br/>The books do not translate well to film. I know it's an old cliché that people always say about books into movies but it really does appropriately describe the world of Harry Potter. The books may be money-spinners but JK Rowling's universe is so dense and involving one can become immersed rather easily, which is one of the franchises major selling points. The films were put into pre-production before Warner fully understood how long or drawn-out Rowling stories would be. As a result they are forced to increasingly cut down on what they put up on screen. I found Prisoner of Azkaban to be anorexic compared to it's literary counterpart. Goblet of Fire goes even further and strips it right down to the bone.<br/><br/>Director Mike Newell had the option of releasing the film in 2 separate volumes (ala Kill Bill) but his overconfidence got the better of him and he reckoned he could do a 500+ page book in a 157-minute film (with 12 of those minutes being credits). It doesn't work, I don't care what anyone says, the story is badly damaged by being whittled down to almost nothing. I'm not complaining at the lack of the Dursley's, I know they don't make or break the film. But important sub-plots and important characters are barely even featured.<br/><br/>Harry's co-competitors in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour, are interesting and developed in the book. In this movie they are so absent you'd think they'd been completely cut out. I think I heard Krum speak once. And the British Tabloid press made a huge fuss (as they do with everything) over a girl from Fife being cast as Harry's would-be girlfriend Cho Chang. But she's in it for an absolute maximum of 2 minutes and has about 3 lines of dialogue! And what of this nonsense that Ron and Hermione are in love with each other? They have a single conversation in 157 minutes with no longing glances or butterflies in stomach or anything! Being jealous at each other dancing partners simply isn't enough. Also, many important plot developments that the film doesn't have time to linger on are given a single line of explanation and quickly forgotten as things move from A to B to C. For anyone who hasn't read the book this could be very disorientating and you'll probably get lost at some point.<br/><br/>Keen to distract us from this Warner have chucked in a massive SFX budget in hope that lots of CGI will make us think the film really is amazing when it just plain ain't. How superficial can you get? I really don't think the kids will mind though. And the zombie parents dragged along with them won't care either. Those of us who are serious about films (people who go nuts over Harry Potter not included) will notice how plebeian the franchise has become.<br/><br/>Mike Newell does chuck in a couple (only a couple) of nice shots but has this amateur theory that the darker the film looks the more sinister it will become. What nonsense! Much of this film is so poorly lit you'll struggle to see what is happening on screen. And the daytime scenes are all shot with an ugly green haze to make things look enchanting or spooky or something. It makes the film look stupid.<br/><br/>Order of the Pheonix is up next. And that book was very, very long. How on earth they will fit that in a movie I don't know. Warner have seriously bitten off more than they can chew with this franchise. In the hands of a skilled director who is familiar with action, fantasy and even a touch of horror this could have been better. The director of Mona Lisa Smile and Four Weddings and Funeral is a totally inappropriate choice. For some reason John Williams has jumped ship and left scoring to duties to Patrick Doyle. But you'll hardly notice the difference. Doyle retains the Harry Potter theme and sticks to the loud, bombastic sound Williams used for action scenes in the previous films. <br/><br/>I'm not a Harry Potter hater, no matter how negative my opinion sounds. But trying to talk sense into someone who loves these films no matter what is like trying to convince a Christian Fundamentalist that God doesn't exist. A rather extreme simile, but alarmingly appropriate."

For anyone not acquainted with the Harry Potter Book series may find this film very disorientating and jumpy, those book fans out there will realise that they have chopped and changed the story around, and, as you will all be glad to hear, left all the good parts out.

","This movie sucks. The book that bears the same name (but is totally different) is where the series turns from good to great. The movie is where the series turns from okay to BAD. The very first scene departs from the book by adding another person in the Riddle house. The entire part about Harry being home and the Weaslys coming to take him to the Quidditch World Cup and him staying at their house is gone. They move the group from the top box to the nosebleeds for the movie and cut out Winky and her theft of Harry's wand altogether. They show none of the quidditch game, don't show the mascots, and instead of the kids running through the woods and having a confrontation with Draco (which is big in the book for character development), Harry just falls down and gets kicked outside the tent. This is just what is screwed up in the first ten minutes. I actually left the theatre after the dragon broke its chain, chased Harry around campus and then went King Kong on one of the towers. What happened to the dragon, you might ask? Nobody knows. Evidently it's just sleeping down on the grounds somewhere. Hopefully the director will read this page and realize that he needs to quit and never direct another movie again. Ever. Especially not one that ruins a great book."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","9","2","2","17 August 2019"," At last! Harry battles his archenemy...hormones!
","This is easily my favourite HP film. It has EVERYTHING: action/adventure, horror, romance, comedy, combining the light-hearted feel of the first two films with the overly dark/gothic feel of the third (without going over-the-top). The opening shot, where we follow snake-cam, with rather 'loose' interpretation of the now very familiar Harry Potter theme, establishes that this movie is going to be something different to what's come before. I appreciated the fact that while the prior films had somewhat slow starts, this one skipped over the horrible Dursleys (seriously, WHY do they keep sending Harry back to his abusive relatives? It's totally messed up), who're always my least favourite parts of the films, and got straight into the action.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe feels like he's at last comfortable in the role Harry, who's much more angst-filled in this film (though also more sarcastic/amusing, which is welcome). Rupert Grint finally gets to do more as Ron than just simply acting scared/pulling funny faces, and the rift between him and Harry is interesting (I'll always remember Ron's telling Harry to ""Pi$$ off""). Emma Watson, like Radcliffe, seems more at ease in her role, and Hermione goes through a wide range of emotions in this film. I appreciate her friendship with Harry, and her arguing with Ron (whilst obviously they secretly care for each other) allows for some real emotionally-charged/interesting moments. All three work like a well-oiled machine at this point with their interaction/dynamic.<br/><br/>While this might be an unpopular opinion, I actually really like Michael Gambon as Richard Harris' replacement playing Dumbledore (I know book readers had issues with him yelling at Harry, but I actually thought it showed some complexity, revealing another side to the character). Alan Rickman's Snape and Maggie Smith's McGonagall don't get much screentime, but do the most with what they're given (I thought the latter's scene, teaching Ron how to waltz, was quite amusing). The most interesting addition to the adult cast is Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody, who's odd/quirky, but I'd almost say he's the most complex of the constantly revolving door of Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers thus far...except he's not all that he seems. Miranda Richardson is suitably irritating as Rita Skeeter, Gary Oldman stops by for a quick Sirius fireplace chat with Harry, and Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable debut performance as Voldemort in all his digitally-removed-nose glory.<br/><br/>Regarding the new additions to the younger castmembers, pre-Twilight Robert Pattinson manages to make Cedric Diggory likable and his friendship with Harry *mean* something in the short amount of time we get to know him in, which proves crucial later on (as it shows that, to quote Hermione, ""Everything's going to change now""). His relationship with his father is also very effective. As for the other Triwizard Tournament champions, Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum (who Ron has a man-crush on...that is until Krum beats Ron to the punch by asking Hermione to the Yule Ball) and Clémence Poésy as Fleur Delacour (who Ron also has a crush on, and manages to earn a kiss from at one point) are actually both the nationalities of the characters they're playing, which is appreciated (instead of having actors/actresses of other nationalities doing dodgy fake accents for the roles), and are good in their parts, though after the memorable entrances of their respective schools (Durmstrang and Beauxbatons), they don't get much to do/say.<br/><br/>As for the non-Triwizard champions, Katie Leung also has very little to do in the movie as Cho Chang (other than smile and be on the receiving end of Harry's most awkward invitation to the Yule Ball ever. She has a lovely Scottish accent, though), as does Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy (he gets one memorable scene with Mad-Eye Moody). Neville Longbottom continues to get his own moments to shine, at least (though I wonder how Harry and Ron felt about Ron's sister, Ginny, being Neville's date to the Yule Ball. Even *Hagrid* gets some lovin' in this movie!).<br/><br/>As well as all the wonderful characters, something else this movie excels at is its storytelling. Things keep going at an exhilarating pace that seldom slows down. The three Triwizard tasks are all unique, but exciting (the task featuring dragons is probably more memorable for *us* the audience than the spectators, since most of the dragon action takes place AWAY from where they're sitting). The second task's underwater scenes are appropriately spooky, while the final task (involving a giant hedge maze) is the 'darkest' section of the film, creating a real sense of terror/horror. However, there are enough laughs to balance out the darker moments. The score adds a lot to the film, but never takes you out of it (and doesn't play the HP theme ad nauseam like the previous films, thankfully). In my opinion, this film is the most thrilling, enjoyable, roller-coaster (or, more accurately, broomstick) ride in the series. Also, it'll probably always be remembered as the one where nobody got a haircut."
"callingoctober92","7","2","2","27 November 2005"," Extreme Change Leaves Loyal Viewer Confused
","I am an avid Harry Potter Fan of both the books and the movies, though they are separate entities, and was very psyched to see this new film. This film was good, but there was something different about it. J.K.Rowling did in fact say once that she had never felt the same way about her books after the 3rd one, and her writing style did change, as is evident to those who have read the books. That change was widely accepted, but, in my opinion, this movie was a bit too different for my liking.<br/><br/>Firstly, though the book was meant to do this, I felt utterly blown away at the end of the film. Not because I was in awe, merely because I felt as though the film had raced on at a whirlwind pace and left me behind during the second hour. It was very hard to keep up with the plot as it zoomed away into the unknown. I have read all the books twice or more and happen to be in my teens, so do not label me as a stuck-in-their-ways old person who still believes in black and white television. I am at the lower half of the target audience for this movie and am still bemused over what occurred on that screen.<br/><br/>Another reason I was a bit skeptical about this film is that quite a few entertaining plots were left out; but mainly some important plot points of plots that were included in this motion picture. I agree that Mike Newell and Steven Kloves could not follow this book word for word in two and a half hours, but the other three films did relate very closely to the books. This movie felt set apart, but not necessarily in a good way.<br/><br/>I will withhold complete judgment until I can see the directors cut, but I actually believe it could have been better as two movies, if it meant that important plot points could have been left in, such as why exactly Barty Crouch died, which seemed quite random in the book. I have always loved Harry Potter, and always will, but this film has definitely tested some loyal fans devotion."
"tomu67","7","2","2","23 November 2005"," great visual summation of a some of book 4's main themes
","this comment contains spoilers I guess there's no way to make even a 3 hour movie (this was less than 3) containing book 4.<br/><br/>Because of this the pacing of the movie was very erratic. The movie literally lurches from scene to scene especially at the beginning, trying to pack as much in as possible. And, even then fails to cover many important plot points.<br/><br/>Here are my main beefs: 1) Dumbledore way too dramatic and completely out of character with the book.<br/><br/>2) Rita Skeeter - why even bother including her at all without the payoff of her capture as the animagus beetle at the end. I mean, there were so many other things left out (SPEW, blast-ended skrewts, etc.).<br/><br/>3) Probably the most intriguing part of the book was why the wands connected during the Harry - Voldemort duel. This would have taken less than 30 seconds of the movie to explain. I am completely miffed.<br/><br/>4) I really love and have loved the casting of Harry, Ron, & Hermionne. I think the franchise has really lucked out. They are spot on for their parts and always have been. Unfortunately, they appear to overact in many scenes because of a contextual problem within the films flow. The movie is constantly in overdrive which makes the emotional scenes less poignant because there is no space for the audience to relax.<br/><br/>There are many things I like about the film, Voldemort being my favorite.<br/><br/>For those who were so happy with the resurgence of reading among children and then upset that these movies were jeopardizing this, you need not worry anymore. It's apparent that this movie and the next 3 will not even come close to covering the material in the books."

Not that they weren't before, but they are a lot better at it now. It was sad at many parts and I admit that I did cry. It was scary as well to see Lord Voldemort and his evilness being brought upon Harry. It was very funny as well, the funniest one yet. It was interesting to see the characters starting to like other girls and boys. It added to the all around goodness of the movie. Although it wasn't exactly like the book and they left out many parts and altered others, it was still very good. Try not to be disappointed, those of you who like the book to be exactly like the movie. But if you have never read the book, you would be puzzled and you would be even more puzzled if you hadn't seen the other movies.

For instance... I thought the portrayal of Lord Valdemort was very good. Probably the best acting of the whole movie. Followed by Mad Eye Moody. I wasn't too pleased with the look of Moody, but I still feel he was one of the stronger characters. <br/><br/>There were several critical areas of the book that weren't covered. Especially the character of Rita Skeeter. HORRIBLE casting for her, and they completely skipped the whole point with her. There is more involving Rita in the following books, and it won't make any sense because they left that stuff out. The worst character by far was Dumbledore. Dumbledore has an extreme confidence that oozed from his charisma and knowledge in the books, but in this movie, he is a short tempered angry confused old man. Not the character everyone describes in the book as ""The only wizard that Valdemort ever feared."" <br/><br/>I have to say the movie really went south for me in the heavy metal goth scene at the Dance. Complete with crowd surfing midgets!! WTF? Where in the heck did they come up with that? I am thinking someone in the board room was saying ""we need something with Moxy for the soundtrack... whadda ya got for me? Nine Inch Nails impersonators? I Like it! Make sure you put some magical Harry Potter looking stuff on the drums and guitars. Bits of cloth and such... LAME!!!<br/><br/>Then there was the complete disappearance of the blast ended Scroots, No mention of the Dursleys AT ALL. The hedge maze scene was completely revised, No follow through on Hagrid's interaction with Madame Maxime and their link to the giants. The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>I also want to say, they couldn't stick with trimming out stuff from the book, they had also to add items that could have been easily left out that had no importance whatsoever. The nearly boob popping Mermaid on the wall in the bath chamber for one. WAAAY too much attention was put on that lame unimportant item. Another was the entrance of the girls from Beaubaton. I know it is hard to portray girls that are supposed to be so beautiful, but the way they handled it in the movie was terrible. <br/><br/>Okay, I will get off of my soap box now. I just felt the need to voice my disappointment with the movie, and more so, my disappointment with all of the Rave reviews by people saying how great it was.. Are we really that out of touch, or do people not care about good character development and a good story, over scads of special effects? I want to say I noticed. Not everyone bought into the Potter Hype, and it does a disservice to such amazingly good books. Thank you for listening to my rant. If this makes sense to you, we should probably become movie critics together. I'd love to lay it on the line without buying into the corporate spoon-fed formulaic garbage they try to force down the gullet of the American movie goer. <br/><br/>Peace."
"sumpleby","5","10","18","18 November 2005"," What's there is pretty good, but too much is not there
","Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter. I went to the opening midnight screening, and again this morning in order to see the film both in a huge crowd and a tiny one, as that often affects one's reaction to a film. Unfortunately, my reaction at both screenings was disappointment. I am not one that insists that a movie exactly match the book it is based on, but in this instance far, far too much is left out to make the film a great one.<br/><br/>What we do get to see is sketchy, but beautifully done. The special effects are incredible. The music is superb. The acting is, for the most part, very good. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron & Hermione are especially good. Lord Voldemort, when we finally get to see him toward the end of the film is all you could wish him to be, though his rebirth gets the same short shrift as everything else. The film has humor, action, budding romance, and some real thrills.<br/><br/>What it doesn't have is depth. Almost every single one of the nuances and subplots that, in the books, bring the Hogwart's world to exciting life are absent from the film. Major characters in the book are missing or minimized. Dumbledore is mostly reduced to an uncertain, weak old man. Snapes puts in a minimal appearance. Not enough is done with the Rita Skeeta character, house elves are non-existent as is the Hagrid/giant sub-plot--and the twins have no real reason to be in the film at all. Major plot devices, such as Mad-Eye Moody being supplanted by a polyjuice potion chugging Bertie Crouch Jr., whip by so fast your head spins. In fact, most of the stuff that did make it into the film is touched on only superficially. Overall, if you haven't read the book you won't know what is going on or why in too many scenes. For instance: the reason Hogwarts students were so ticked Harry's name came out of the goblet is glossed over (the film intimates it's because he's thought to have cheated, but no one got bent out of shape when the twins tried to cheat--the Hufflepuff angle is totally ignored); just why Ron is so angry at Harry; why Krum asks Hermione to the ball; why Voldermort's and Harry's wands react the way they do against each other and why the spirits come out of Voldemort's wand; why Mad Eye Moody was replaced; why Nevil Longbottom reacts the way he does to the Cruciatis Curse; etc. etc. etc. etc. In addition, Daniel Radcliffe's acting skills haven't matured along with him and he is outshone by just about everyone else in the film.<br/><br/>I came out of the film--both times!--with a sense of disappointment. The film is OK--but you can see where it could have been great."
"darkmoonnetwork375","1","25","54","14 November 2005"," While a great fan of the books; I consider myself almost an enemy of the movies.
","Well I cannot hide it. The movie was extraordinarily horrific. Not only have they chosen to cut out 70% of the book (I am not a mathematician so don't get anal about that figure), but they have also chosen to change, even omit, certain details when adapting the book.<br/><br/>Firstly there is the opening sequence with Frank Bryce being murdered in the Riddle-mansion. According to the book only Wormtail, Nagini and Voldemort are present apart from Bryce. But Barty Crouch Jr. is for no real apparent reason also in the room with them. This removes an entire storyline. It is no longer possible for us to discover how Barty Crouch Sr. has staged his own sons's death, it removes Winky from the story and also the episode at the Quidditch World Cup. Which reminds me, what happened there? The match wasn't shown, Ludo Bagman doesn't appear ( and his wager with the twins disappears as well ) we are not introduced to the Veela and so we cannot find any reasonable explanation as to why Fleur has such a great effect on Ron. The other Weasly brothers are not shown ( Charlie should have been there to take care of the dragons ), Amos Diggory is not given a chance to talk so much about how good his son was against Harry in Quidditch ( and Cedric at first seems somewhat arrogant and not at all like he is depicted in the book )and believe me I could go on. I never understood why they were not in the 'fancy' box at the World Cup, and why O' why were we not allowed to see Narcissa Malfoy?<br/><br/>As for the acting I still think the first two were the best in this respect with the first one as a clear number one. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson carry out their roles in a manner above acceptable. Daniel Radcliffe should be sacked and thrown off the set. I do not wish to resort to mudslinging but he is dreadful in this movie. He was good in the first two, halfway decent in the third, but in this his acting is downright poor. He delivers his lines with almost an air of indifference, pay close attention to his reaction when he returns from the encounter with Voldemort, he is supposed to cry but he is not convincing. His performance makes Steven Seagal seem a right Lawrence Olivier in comparison. Michael Gambon is normally a highly regarded actor but it pains me to say that he has no business playing Dumbledore. Richard Harris made that character come to life. He acted the part so brilliantly that I truly believe that they should have stopped after his death. Michael Gambon does not portray Dumbledore as well as Harris. Sometimes he seems even weak, off balanced and not in control. In essence he does not portray Dumbledore but someone posing as Dumbledore. (That's the way it seems). The other actors perform adequately but nothing more.<br/><br/>I was also surprised at the absence of communication with Sirius and equally surprised at his physical absence at the end of the movie (as he should have been there according to the book).<br/><br/>There are numerous other flaws, mistakes, changes, omissions, etc. but I will not bore you with them all here. Bottom line is that this movie is right insult to the books. The story is much too quickly paced, the storyline of the movie leaves one wanting to know more (the things one wants to know were actually revealed in the book), and the story is generally uninteresting. As a whole the movie is not worth watching and by the Force, do I wish I hadn't. Biggest disappointment was, however, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. I have no words for this atrocity they call acting. Fiennes is generally a brilliant actor but his performance in this movie should be forbidden by law.<br/><br/>In fact, the creators of this movie should sit down and say: ""Crap! We naused it up, lads. Let's call it a do-over.""<br/><br/>I give it 1 out of 10 but only because there is no lower grade. This is possibly the worst movie of the last decade. And yes, I saw Deep Impact."

","You couldn't even tell what it was supposed to be! Dumbledore didn't act like that in the book! and Moody, don't even get me started on him! The goblet wasn't even like it was described in the book, and, jeez! There's too much wrong with the movie to even write here! Nuh-uh. I didn't like the movie. If the book hadn't been written, sure, the movie would be fine. BUT the book was good enough and they went and butchered it.

"Cinema_Fan","3","13","25","18 November 2005"," Detention for Mr. Newell for the lack of Plagiarism.
","This film was directed by Mike Newell, of Four Wedding's and a Funeral (1994), and Pushing Tin (1999) fame. Here we see his interpretation of J.K. Rowling's novel The Goblet of Fire. His career mainly consists of T.V. Direction, since 1964, and a smattering of movies. <br/><br/>Plagiarism isn't the order of the day here, which is a pity, because if you are going to sell the book rights to the movie industry, then we would hope that it would or should, at least, stick to the original story. As naive as it sound's. <br/><br/>This is the poorest of the four Potter movies so far. The story was non-existent, the character development was extremely shallow and the overall content was less than mediocre to say the least. <br/><br/>The plot being that He who shall not be named comes back, again, to wreak havoc, almost. This only occurs during the final half hour or so. While the rest of the movie, the whole film being around two hours and forty minutes long, fair enough, is based on a tournament that contains three dangerous tasks. The conclusion at the end of the final task is that Harry unwittingly becomes His prisoner, here we go again. Thus ending in a show down, a very quick and positively anti climatic show down, a little like the first movie. <br/><br/>The ending came a little too sudden, which seems a wasted opportunity considering the length of this movie, and because of the lack of build up, the final show down was neither exiting nor worthy off a movie of this stature. <br/><br/>Apart from the shots of the Quidditch World Cup games at the beginning of the film, the hapless gang of three never leave the school grounds during the entire movie. This makes for a very stale and drawn-out plot. The sense of magic, meaning Wizards, Witches, Wands and Broomsticks etc, is lost in this over produced eye candy. There is a little too much distraction with what seem in places, unnecessary digital effects, which weakens the plot by substituting substance over effect. <br/><br/>This movie (concept) has grown up since its birth, but as it has grown older, it has, like most healthy teenagers, become lost in its own World, thus needing a guiding hand or wand if you wish, to point it back in the right direction. <br/><br/>Go to the top of the class for effort Mr Newell, but expect very little marks for content."
"sowma","5","22","47","21 November 2005"," Goblet makes me want to vomit with rage!!!
","Mike Newell should replace Voldemort as the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>What's up with the 'Goblet'? In the tradition of Thanksgiving, Warner Bros. has served up a huge turkey for audiences to feast.<br/><br/>The screenplay is AWFUL! But don't blame Kloves, who has heretofore delivered consistently good adaptations of the Potter books. What's different? Director Mike Newell.<br/><br/>I think the term ""ham-fisted"" would be adequate in describing the translation of ""Goblet of Fire"" from book to movie. How many plot threads and important pieces of information were left out? What was up with the sudden 15-minute ""Dawson's Creek"" episode aka the Yule Ball? Where did all the slapsitck Mr. Filch and Snape stuff come from? And come on... that stupid licking tick with Barty Crouch? It had all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop. The target audience is beyond the ""Teletubbies"" and ""Dragon Tales"" stage. Additionally, there are a lot of unexplained story lines- the complete destruction of 1,000's of tents at the Quiddich Cup, Ron's anger at Harry, Harry's sulkiness at the Ball, Neville's response to the cruciatus curse, Hermione's interest in Krum, Priori Incantatem...the list is too long to continue- questions dealt with succinctly in the book- in the movie, left to the audience to decipher. <br/><br/>People are saying this is darker and grittier- but I didn't see that. Who else was disturbed by the upbeat and cheery ending? Harry saw an innocent person die... I get the feeling that Newell, like Ron Weasley ""missed the point entirely"". The goriest and most disturbing parts in the graveyard are glossed over and trivialized. So why the PG-13 rating? Partial stained-glass-mermaid nudity? <br/><br/>Newell also failed to pull great or even acceptable performances from most of the cast- and it's not as if he doesn't have talent to work with. You can't blame the actors- all of whom have turned in good performances previously- again, it's up to Newell to pull the great from the bad- I was often reminded of SNL's ""Master Thespian"" in scenes involving high drama. Oh yeah, I also hated seeing Michael Gambon's violent turn as Dumbledore- dude, you suck!!!<br/><br/>Speaking of sucking- what happened to the music- If John Williams is engaged on another flick, get him back- or at least call him so he can hum a few tunes on the phone! Patrick Doyle's quasi British brass band music was weak and pathetic compared to Williams' knack for melodies and motivic development. <br/><br/>The film also appears to have a lower budget than the previous HP movies. From the lame mer-people and the obviously fake doll-like floating Cho, Ron, and friends to the lack of moving subjects in the paintings, lack of exterior shots.. and didn't everything seem like it was on a small set- the common room, owlery, great hall, etc? Suddenly all more claustrophobic... And who could forget the deflating graveyard scenery? I've seen better mock-ups on old episodes of ""Wagontrain"". I guess they couldn't afford Winky or Dobby- maybe they should have saved a little money from the god-awful Yule Ball and dragon scenes.<br/><br/>I guess it's Dumbledore who sums it up best- in times when you have to choose between what's right and what's easy- remember what happened to a book that was good, and whole, and interesting- that strayed into the hands of a hack director and a studio that turned movies like ""Batman"" into ""Batman & Robin""... Remember the REAL Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire."

"LokiWasAnAmateur","5","8","14","22 November 2005"," Major Disappointment
","I wanted so badly to enjoy this. However, I cannot let my Potter fandom cloud the fact that this movie is NOWHERE near a ""10."" <br/><br/>Now, I will admit to having held high standards walking into this movie. But that standard was set by the quality of the previous films in the Potter series. The previous three installments have been mind-blowers, so I unwittingly assumed that this would top them all.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>While visually stunning and well-directed, it simply tried to do too much, and wound up doing very little.<br/><br/>I imagine a screenwriter's mad scramble to appease book-loving audiences, while not losing the casual viewer.<br/><br/>The result was, quite frankly, an unfocused hodge-podge of book fragments.<br/><br/>A short list of what didn't work for me and why: <br/><br/>1. The budding romance between Cho Chang and Harry was forced, at best, into awkward moments of little chemistry. This subplot needed much more development in order to be effective, because as it is, they speak to each other maybe three or four times within a three and a half hour movie. Nowhere near the screen time to warrant the attention it attempts. So essentially, this whole subplot felt like filler.<br/><br/>2. At no point had I felt that anyone was going to ""lose themselves,"" in the final challenge. Krum, the only example that comes close to this mock threat, was under Voldemort's influence (an ambiguous leap at best, by the way). Despite Cedric's courtship of Cho Chang, I had no reason whatsoever to suspect that Harry would ""lose himself,"" as Dumbledore forewarned.<br/><br/>3. I did not feel that there was really any threat, even from Voldemort. He seemed to be an afterthought, and the big confrontation at the end felt like a teaser to yet another sequel.<br/><br/>Another example of missed opportunity is in the supposed threat of the tournament. Simply saying that ""wizards have died,"" in the tournament previously does not do justice to what even a single visual example can. And let's not forget that the tournament didn't even kill Cedric; Voldemort did.<br/><br/>4. I felt that the entire opening, up until the point where the tri-wizard tournament began, was arbitrary and only served to set a mood. I feel that the set design (a major strength, in my view) and basic story did the job well enough. Not that it was badly done, but that the opening half-hour could have been used for better development of other subplots. By the end of the movie, and apparently Harry's fourth year, the audience is left scratching their heads, as no tangible chronology is provided for ANY PART of this movie.<br/><br/>I could continue, but my point is clear: an eight-hundred page book adapted into one three and a half hour film either cuts prominent sections of the original text out of the finished product, or tries to make a mad scramble to stay relatively close to the original work.<br/><br/>The result here, unfortunately, is a film with a lot of potential, and little else. The script is simply too unfocused, and the result is the ambiguous and underdeveloped mess this film slowly became.<br/><br/>Maybe Mike Newell would have been wise to listen to the studio's wishes. It could well have saved this film from what it became.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a feast for the eyes, but still only a well-directed train wreck."
"Slagathor","3","7","12","19 November 2005"," Embarrassing and Dull
","This fourth Harry Potter film represents a significant slide from the previous film, the Prisoner of Azkaban. Mike Newell's hamfisted direction pales in comparison to the nuanced and adult work of Alfonso Cuarón, and Newell's trite work more like the dull and insipid films of series originator Chris Columbus. Michael Gambon looked bored and embarrassed, which at least was better than Daniel Radcliffe or Emma Watson, whose incompetence only becomes more glaring with every passing film. Rupert Glint was upstanding as ever, but was likewise hobbled by an utterly facile, idiotic script. The film is too long to hold even the most ardent fan's attention, but the film's most important failures all center on its relationships with its source text and its audience. As far as the source text is concerned, Rowlings is not a particularly good writer, and fidelity to her text is not an ambition to champion. Many of her scenes are awkward enough in the original, let alone graceful when translated to the screen. Some are outright stupid, retarded, substandard according to any conceivable model of drama or narrative. The audience is another matter. This film simply is not designed for 14 year olds. The film reads younger than the previous two, whereas the entire point behind the series is for the material and the audience to grow together.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a creepy moment of pedophilia that all should be ashamed of... the Bathhouse Scene is perhaps the most hysterically embarrassing moment to surface in a teen film. Even John Hughes could have done better than this."
"okiijin","2","7","12","18 November 2005"," Wow, what a let down.
","Let me just start by stating, I love all the potter movies... all except this one. That out of the way, here's my synopsis: Acting and character portrayal -- Decent. Most of the movie seemed like it was done on take one. The actors seemed rushed in their parts to finish lines, but overall not too bad for a harry potter movie. (although much different from the previous movies.) Casting -- Some of the new characters looked way out of place, but i guess there wasn't really anything wrong here..<br/><br/>Plot line -- Wow. This was a problem. Most of the book was left out. that would be OK i suppose, if the plot remained the same. the other movies were different from the book and i didn't have a problem with them. this one somehow really just didn't work. It seemed like most of the plot was left on the cutting room floor, or maybe just wasn't filmed at all... which brings me to: <br/><br/>Directing -- Honestly, this is the reason I gave this movie a 2. The director obviously didn't want to film the kind of movie that the harry potter movies are and should be. Instead, this one was really mostly a comedy, and I'm not sure how he accomplished it. Most of the good bits were rushed or skipped completely, and NOTHING was explained properly, if at all. The only reason I knew what was going on (or what was suppose to be going on) is because i have previously read the book, and even then i was confused a little. I was sure to remember the name of this director, and believe me, I'l never pay to see another of his movies.<br/><br/>In closing, I'll say this: The book is not at all an action novel. It was not meant to be so. If you want to direct a pure action movie, Mike Newell, please do it with the appropriate material. I really feel awful abou this series now. There's 1, 2, and 3, getting better as they go, and hopefully 5, 6, and 7 will do the same. Then there's 4 stuck right in the middle with no continuity and no point. If I had money I'd go make the movie myself just to make it fit in the series properly. (and also to make it not suck)"

The film leaves out all the great scenes in the novel and presents us with a film a ten year old made on his IMac. The acting however is great however miscast should be the word used to describe it. Ralph Fiennes, a great actor, is not right for Voldermort. He in my opinion is too nice. If it wasn't for JK Rowlings stance on an all British/European Cast, the character would have been greatly realised. In my opinion either John Malkovich or Willen Dafoe would have been amazing in the role. Miranda Richardson, despite giving a great performance as Rita Skeeter, is just too pretty for the role. If you grew up in England during the 1980s, many would know that Richardson was a pin up, and in my POV still is. Brendon Gleeson however is perfect casting for Moody, he has the appearance and the behaviour. I hope he continues. As for the kids, Radcliffe gets worse as time goes on. Whilst Watson and Grint have 'Wasted Talent' written over their CV's, I hope they leave the Hogwarts set and enlist in another production. Robert Pattison as Cedric Diggory surprised me with his performance, shame he isn't younger cause he would be fantastic for the Harry Potter role. Whilst Katie Leung as Cho Chang is beyond description since she is rarely seen, also she's annoying. Overall this film lacked all the imagination that made the book great. Not recommended for either HP fans nor for the uninitiated."
"dr-strangelove-1","1","12","24","18 November 2005"," Disappointing
","The movie series seems to follow the books, on a far lower level. While the third movie finally showed some character development and well-done plot instead of drawing by numbers some scenes from the novels, everything collapses in this fourth installment. This is partially due to the necessity of omitting lovable subplots which saved the novel. In the movie, the stupid main plot becomes clearly visible - a way to big machinery is installed for reviving Voldemort. Instead of capturing Harry at so many possible situation, or just turning his left shoe into a port-key, the evil secret agent employs incredibly involved tricks to teleport Harry to the cemetery where you-know-who wait for his reincarnation. This comes along as a boring CGI-hopping that lasts almost three hours. <br/><br/>Indeed, the movie is rather ""dark"" (whatever that means), but this doesn't indicate quality. The few humorous scenes that escaped shed some flashes of light but were far from saving the movie. The coming-of-age scenes were just painful, and the three younger main actors do definitely worse than in ""Azkaban"" (almost the same low level as in the ""Philosopher's Stone""). Brendan Gleeson is good as Mad-Eye Moody, indeed the only character adequately transferred from the novel (not that difficult, actually). Ralph Fiennes (mainly CGI) is OK as Voldemort. Other CGI is often cheap or just garbage, like the dragon-fight. Where did all the money go? The plot holes are numerous, even more than usual, caused by strange cuts. For instance, what happens between Voldemort's and Harry's wands, is ""explained"" by Dumbledore by a Latin word that would need itself explanation (which is omitted). Such things happen almost every few minutes. If this pattern continues, the fifth installment (with the underlying worst book of the series so far, ""imagine there is war and no one is interested in"") is really something to be afraid of."
"zodraz","7","6","10","23 November 2005"," short film from a long book
","Concise edited highlights, although what was kept in was done very well. Although the film is two and a half hours, there are some very abrupt cuts from one scene to another, and a lot is out of sequence. That said, there are some scenes which are directly from the book, while others are similar but missing a key point - when the boys are oggling the Beauxbaton girls, Hermione has a good retort - ""if you too would like to put yours eyes back in"" instead we just get a shot of her looking annoyed. One or two changes which I liked were the dance lessons, and the rebirth of Voldemort. Some of the things I disliked were very obvious mistakes, like Voldemort having normal eyes, the cup being made of crystal instead of silver, Amos having no beard, a lot of missing characters, wormtail cutting off his hand with no reaction, he should be writhing on the ground in pain and so on. I dislike changes being made to the story for no apparent reason. There is very little in the books that would not work on screen, and having read Steve Kloves scripts for the first three films I think he did a very good job. Pity we did not see his script on screen. I still think each book should be done as a mini series to cover all the details and bring to life jo's wonderful dialogue."
"KateB79","8","6","10","21 November 2005"," Great Film! Two Thumbs Up!
","I saw this at 10.00am on the Friday morning of the 18th November and was so excited beforehand! And to be honest, I don't think I was disappointed. I thought the film was fantastic, and certainly the best one yet.<br/><br/>I know that the Harry Potter purists dislike the lack of subplot, but I'm sure they can't argue that as a movie it works. I think you have to look at the film and the book separately. (Think about Bridget Jones II - Rebecca's character is totally different from the book, but the film works better because of it). I love all the book, and yes there are changes and lots missing from the fourth film, but it kept me gripped all the way through. With the first task I thought the dragon chase was brilliant, and the underwater scenes were great and yes the maze didn't have the blast-ended screwts but it was still scary.<br/><br/>The bit at the end where Harry arrives back at Hogwarts with Cedric and the band starts playing before people realise what's going on had me in tears and was better than what I had in my head from reading the book. And the extra scene with the dance lesson made me laugh out loud when the girls were all eager, and the boys all slouchy!! and I loved Ron dancing with McGonagoll.<br/><br/>I'm now looking forward to the DVD which I believe will be released in April and to see the extra scenes and footage.<br/><br/>I give this film two thumbs up!"

","This was the first full Harry Potter movie that I've seen. Honestly.. I was bored, tired, and unfulfilled..<br/><br/>This movie was just random goofy names (from characters to potions), and endless banter about some ""legendary"" tournament.<br/><br/>Not much happened at all except what you knew was going to happen. Potter got picked for the tourney.. no way? really? The ""good guy"" was really the ""bad guy"". I figured that one out just before the Superman preview..<br/><br/>The acting was okay. Average at best. You cannot expect much from generic actors though, so I didn't.<br/><br/>This series has to be beat by now. I've seen this movie 15 times in the last 10 years, just with different titles and characters.. oh yea, and a more mature audience..<br/><br/>Throughout the movie were little pieces of special effects.. from a blue flame on a cup, to a tiny beam coming from a little wooden wand.. Although most effects were underly impressive, some were nice.<br/><br/>The only real action in the whole movie was Potter having the same ""battle of magic beams"" that was in Star Wars Episide III. Only this time it ended with Potters mom telling him to stop.<br/><br/>I did find parts of this movie humorous, although, I cannot say whether it was from sheer boredom and winning bets with myself as to what came next, or if it actually had decent comic relief..<br/><br/>This movie received a 3/10 from me, the 3 is high, only for the few laughs I did get and some decent effects.<br/><br/>Sorry to all of you bandwagon fans out there, but I hope this series dies with Beanie Babies and Tickle-Me-Elmo."
"Movieguy_blogs_com","6","17","37","15 November 2005"," I still feel there is too much missing in this film and I did not read the book.
","In 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' the gang has returned to Hogwarts for yet another school year. This year is special, for Hogwarts is to host the TriWizard tournament. Contestants from rival schools (Beauxbatons Academy and the Durmstrang Institute) have come to participate. This is a very dangerous competition, so dangerous that only one upperclassman from each school can compete. However, when Harry Potter's name is selected as a fourth contestant, the involvement of the evil Voldemort is suspect.<br/><br/>This is the fourth installment of J.K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter books. I did like this much better than the last film 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', but I still think the first two were better. On it own merits, there is very little character development if any in this movie. You do not really learn much about the new characters that are introduced. Plus you can see several areas where there holes in the plot. I feel these books are getting just too big to cram into one movie. This book should have been made in to two films. It is two and a half hours long, but the time goes by really fast.<br/><br/>I think the director (Mike Newell) did a better job bring the look and feel of Hogwarts than the director (Alfonso Cuarón) of the last. Be that as it may, I still feel there is too much missing in this film and I did not read the book."
"LordAndrew","Null","26","61","18 November 2005"," Something Has Got to Give
","There is clearly a big problem with adapting an 800 page book as a 150 minute movie. In order to do this successfully a great deal of solid film-making craft is required. I don't believe either Steven Cloves or Mike Newell are even remotely capable of this sort of craft.<br/><br/>Did the film cut too many things out, was that the problem? I don't think so. The problem seems to be that they tried to include as many of the little details from the book as they could and failed to ever do those details justice. For instance, what was the point of including the reporter? What did the scenes with the reporter add to the story? The plot point only established that Harry is an interesting character, which we already knew. The total dismissal of the reporter character throughout the rest of the story should be an indication of her importance. With a novel of this size the goal should be to capture the essential pieces of the story, to recreate whatever it is that makes the book interesting. I would have cast my vote for focusing on the experience of the three leads.<br/><br/>The only thing that really disappointed me about the movie was the lack of depth of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.<br/><br/>Whoever does the next film should do himself a favor and check out how L.A. Confidential was adapted, hopefully he'll learn something."

","The only thing that was in common between the film and the book was the characters names!!!! I appeciate the fact that the book is indeed rather long and showing its entirety in the film would be impossible; but it feels as if someone has simple read every other chapter and made the film; this film should have been another hour longer!! The beginning of the book has simply been removed from the book and we start about one fifth of the way in, so those who have read the book will be annoyed from the start. Out of all of the Potter books the goblet of fire was by FAR my favourite, and from what I have read, the favourite of most, and so I had high expectations from the film, and was castastrophical disappointed. I went to see the film which some girls who had never read the books and they thoroughly enjoyed the film, as did the small children who were in the cinema. Credit were it is due though, the special effects are better than the previous films, and generally the acting has indeed improved, and for this reason I have not given the film a 1 rating, though I was tempted.<br/><br/>I know that those who have read the book will indeed go and see the film anyhow, but I must warn you do not get your hopes up."
"charcoalactivity","2","5","8","9 August 2006"," If you haven't seen this movie, this review will HELP you decide.
","Where has the magic gone? One would expect that the fourth of the Harry Potter movies should have improved and should have been better than the previous three-- DEAD WRONG! This is the worst Potter film yet.<br/><br/>The ghosts that make Hogwarts unique amongst many other fantasy films have ironically been ""magically"" vanished. Not one can be seen in The Great Hall and/or in between classes. Moaning Myrtle, of course, was spared for a cheap laugh. This movie has officially lost its magic.<br/><br/>Some of the young actors, however, have improved. Daniel Radcliffe, who had the worst performance in Prisoner of Azkaban, showed a bit of improvement with his ""crying"" skill(s)-- but just slightly. His improved acting skill doesn't justify Goblet of Fire's bad direction and editing.<br/><br/>Mike Newell did a terrible job capturing the natural magic within the world that JKR has created. Anyone could feel the absence of the nature of the magical world that Alfonso Cuaron has beautifully executed in the third movie. Hell, I didn't really like Cuaron's Potter film as much as I am fond of Christopher Columbus's classic Potter films, but I prefer Alfonso's directing and ideas SO MUCH MORE than Newell's. Newell's handling of the camera angles and rushed cuts were terribly directed.<br/><br/>Back to the returning young actors and actresses... Whoever has been complimenting Emma Watson and her acting skills should get an acting lesson with the actress herself. Watson completely turned this movie into the most annoying film EVER. Her over-the-top enunciation of every syllable of every word was very irritating. Her heavy breathes in every line in every scene were as disturbing. Of course, with the contribution of Michael Gambon's menopausal Dumbledore, it's officially become the worst film of the year.<br/><br/>Where has the twinkling blue eyes gone? All I see from Gambon's Dumbledore is the clear lack of authority. Dumbledore has officially (can't find another word) become a dumbarsse. Oh how I miss the late Richard Harris-- the perfect and most brilliant Dumbledore ever. And what happened to Snape? Why has Snape become a physically sadistic sore loser? Steve Klove's brain must be deteriorating (he's the screen writer, for those of you who are not aware).<br/><br/>Now, on to the new characters... The Triwizard Champions: do NOT expect to see or hear much of them in this movie. They are as ""extras"" as the talented Rupert Grint (aka Ron Weasley) is in the movies-- sadly. Katie Leung, the ""popular"" newcomer (aka Harry's first love interest) did an okay job for a first-timer. At least she didn't make me cringe... a lot.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson who played Mad-Eye Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, is clearly a very talented actor. But honestly, he is NOT the Moody that I imagined from reading the books-- not only physically, but the way his character's attitude was executed in the movie was just not how it was written in the books.<br/><br/>Miranda Richardson, who played the nosy journalist Rita Skeeter, was one of the few good aspects of this movie. She was simply fantastic. She carried Skeeter's character VERY, VERY well. Her execution was just perfectly SPOT ON.<br/><br/>And Ralph Fiennes, who plays He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named VOLDEMORT--- *sigh*--- HE REALLY SAVED THIS MOVIE. Just when I thought I couldn't see anymore of this movie's worsts, Fiennes impresses his viewers with the most convincing, terrifying, and quite loving Voldemort ever. He showed Voldemort's character in a very genuine way. I absolutely LOVED him (except of course the blue eyes which were supposed to be red, but that's more of the production staff's fault/decision).<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie SUCKED. There were NO house elves. There were NO house ghosts. But there were the worst performances in history such as Gambon's and Watson's.<br/><br/>And yes folks, I have to say that the First Task/Dragon scene was painfully boring and way too long. I believe it was only there to show off some fancy effects which I thought were pretty lame. I'd rather see the natural ghosts running around Hogwarts than a freaking stupid-looking dragon.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 2/10 (for Fiennes' and Richardson's great performances). But seriously, I'd rather watch the first movie, Philosopher's Stone, any bloody day. Even with its not-so-good Quidditch effects, it's still a classic by Chris Columbus."

","I loved this movie. Though I am a greater fan of the Harry Potter books written by J.K. Rowling, I am almost as equally excited when a new movie comes out. I love seeing how these artists have used their imaginations to portray the story by using different means, a screen. Many Harry Potter fans have shown anger and disappointment towards Warner Brothers for not making the movies like the books. They don't realize that that would be almost impossible. Though many of us raving fans would love a 4 hour long movie, the general public would not, therefore resulting in the movies not making nearly as much money as they do now.<br/><br/>Film makers will try their best to capture the essence and mood of the story with the imaginations they are given.<br/><br/>Books will be books. Movies will be movies.<br/><br/>Movies can't be books."

","I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan, and have even used the books to teach my children to read from hahaha. Also...I understand that the movie is NEVER as good the books but...The first two movies were amazing! I LOVED them, as did my children...The last two however (The Prisoner of Askaban and the Goblet of Fire) were absolutely BUTCHERED! The special effects were amazing as usual, but they cut out WAY too many crucial elements to the story line...They changed WAY too much. I realize that many things need to change from book to movie but...These changes were just pathetic. Not to mention the fact that this Dumbledore is HORRIBLE! I realize that there will never be another Richard Harris, but...Is there No one that can see the vision of Albus Dumbledore as he did? As Mrs Rowling has written him? I will not go see another Harry Potter movie, and the Srocerers Stone and the Chamber of Secrets will be the only ones I own. I only recommend this movie to those who have NOT read the books!"
"Prince09","9","8","15","21 November 2005"," Awesome!!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this awesome movie!! I am a Potter fan and the first 3 movies dint impress me that much. But in this one, the director had succeeded in doing justice to the book, and as he says, brought it out as an ""action epic"".<br/><br/>Barring the over-energetic, screaming Dumbledore, I liked every bit of it. The acting from the trio (particularly Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint) has really improved, and their teenage woes are really well brought out. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Lord Voldemort, but the one who really stood out in the cast was Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody! I was skeptical when pictures of Moody came out before the release, but I was compelled to change my mind after the movie.<br/><br/>There are changes in the plot, but they settled well into the movie. A well deserved 10/10."
"lime_green_jello04","3","3","4","20 November 2005"," very poorly made
","As hyped up as this movie was, i was extremely disappointed. I am a huge fan of the books, and a fan of the other movies. I realize the director and writers had only a short time span to work with(even the most devoted harry potter fan would not sit through the 9 or 10 hours the full book would take up in movie form) but even so,they left out extremely crucial pieces of the plot, and instead of the intricately woven plot that Rowling put together in the book, the movie was summarized into a few jarring, disconnected scenes which barely captured the very essentials of the book. And even this wasn't very well thought out. The scene where Barty crouch jr. is revealed is the place in the book where everything the reader has been wondering about is suddenly pulled together as voldemort's ingenious plan is slowly unraveled. Instead in the movie, when the time comes, nothing the viewer didn't already know is revealed. And now for those of you who are shaking their heads at my comment and saying ""they did a terrific job with what they were given"" even you can't argue with my next point. They altered the very personalities of two main characters. For the observant ones out there i'm sure you know I'm referring to Cedric Diggory and Albus Dumbledore. Lets start with Diggory, in the book he was known as a kind hearted, noble boy who always did his best to be fair(a bit of a pansy in my opinion, but maybe thats a little harsh) in the movie, in the scene where harry and Cedric are desperately sprinting towards the cup(minus one giant spider....but i'm done complaining about all the things they left out) Cedric not actually *shoves* harry out of the way as he runs, not giving harry a backwards glance. And as they approach the cup together, instead of looking at harry with a mixture of longing for the cup and thankfulness to harry for saving his butt, he snaps at harry to take the cup with seemingly nothing in his tone but regret and anger that he feels he now owes the cup to harry. thats not the Cedric diggory readers of the series have grown to love. And albus dumbledore was much more fierce and violent than he is in the books. the whole purpose of dumbledore is that he is quiet, calm, and above everything. almost godlike(before the 6th book) in this one, when he discovers Barty crouch with harry in the end, he actually *throttles* him with his bare hands and asks to know where alastor is. This type of muggle violence is so uncharacteristic of the real albus. So all in all, quite disappointing movie, although i will say one thing. Daniel Radcliffe and his crew have come a long way. The fact that this movie was a total travesty is by no means the fault of the crew, who did an excellent job. And looked very good doing it. (I'm referring mainly to the ill fated Cedric diggory. may he rest in peace)"

","I'm mad sorry. but this movie was trash. i don't want to seem mean. but to make a movie based on a book which a gazillion read and then change the whole ruddy story isn't much of a good idea. personally, i was immensely disappointed with the fact that 3 important characters where missing, and not only that but around 20 scenes or so which will definitely effect the rest of the movies weren't there. where was bagman? dammit guys, he is a big part? ooorr winky? she basically sets the base on the point of the movie at the quidditch world cup! and dobbie!! where is he? smoking? he jacked the gilliweed not neville! sigh...

","I really find it hard to believe that at the moment i am writing these comments, this awful film has managed to get an average vote of 7.8!! When i watched this flick, i had already gone through three really sad movies (the first three of this series of course) though the first one, The Philosopher's Stone wasn't all that bad. But The Goblet of Fire takes the series down the drain, completely. In an age where special effects are seen in every second film, i really wanted more in this movie than the special effects. The book had so much more to offer, and in the hands of a better director, this movie would have had so much more to offer. But instead, what the viewer is given is a back of the cover summary of the book. For some stupid reason, the entire World Cup match isn't shown in the movie, and all of a sudden (after some crap at Hogwarts), we have the three stages of the contest with nothing really filling up between each stage. Alright, the one star that i have given is for the climax of the movie, where Voldemort really is well depicted and enacted. But hey, if i wanted to see a special effects movie, there's loads of better movies out there, with much better story lines. At the end of it, i really am not going to wait for any of the remaining movies of the series. They're gonna be right down there."

","I went to see the fourth harry potter movie yesterday and i found it rather intriguing. I am a harry potter's books fan and i was very disappointed at the fact that Winkie never showed up, the fact that important explanations were missing and personal relationships poorly explored. All I got from the movie, let's say 80%, was action, the tournament occupies the screen for most of the time. But, and there is always a but, the scenes that were filmed were great, flawless, powerful. Newel made a great job, but i must say that the script could have been better. Rupert is great as Ron and Emma was a surprise, as for Daniel.. he grew up..as an actor and as a boy. I believe that the actress casted as Fleur could be more magnetic, i couldn't see none of the Veela's blood in her, except for the fact that she is blond... It was in my opinion the best HP movie... but I considered it a high treason to the book. As I say... I couldn't make up my mind..."
"three_am","9","4","6","21 November 2005"," Loved it, with reservations
","I loved the new Harry Potter Movie (Goblet of Fire) and this is despite some things I didn't like or agreed with.<br/><br/>I loved the British humour. I loved that Fred & George Weasley got more speaking lines and were the hams the way they were in the book - they stole the scenes they were in. I thought the director made wise decisions with little things like Ginny having screen presence and portraying Cedric as a favorite. The special effects were phenomenal, almost on the same level as Peter Jackson's Wing Nut Film LOTR movies. The dragon, (OMFG), was awesome! Goblet of Fire is easily the best eye candy of fantastic effects of all the Potter movies. The Myrtle/Prefect Bath scene was exactly how I imagined it as I read it the first time in the book. Although I was disappointed to not see the other champions fighting their dragons, the extension of Harry's battle with the dragon was worth it. And was it just my theater or did they not show the miniature version of that Chinese Fireball dragon? The Yule ball scene was great. Everyone was pretty to look at. I think Dan Radcliffe does an excellent job of being Harry Potter. The other scene that awe struck me was the graveyard scene. Ralph Fiennes did a great job portraying Voldemort and I thought the director showing the importance of Voldemort being able to touch Harry was a big clue into what is to come with the upcoming books.<br/><br/>The things I had issues with:<br/><br/>Mad Eye's eye needed to be more menacing. I wanted to hear him repeatedly shout CONSTANT VIGILENCE to the students.<br/><br/>The acting of Emma Watson. I thought she overacted her scenes. (Although I thought her tragic scene on the stairs after the Yule Ball was classic teenage drama). I also think all the movies so far is portraying Hermione as being the one level headed friend Harry has, but this is not true. The screen writer is delegating Ron as slapstick, bitter and lazy and it just annoys me.<br/><br/>The fact that they can't slap green contacts on Dan Radcliffe. Harry (from the book) has green eyes and they should have changed it because I was so reminded of Lord of the Rings when I was watching the movie - it seems the close up shots of Dan Radcliffe was projecting Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins.<br/><br/>Dumbledore being very off character from how he is portrayed in the book.<br/><br/>Fleur was supposed to be head-turning gorgeous. She was a beautiful actress; they should have played up her looks.<br/><br/>If I didn't know the book, I would be lost with the strange somewhat emotional intense wand battle between Harry and Voldemort. And Dumbledore's whispered priori incantatem was not good enough of an explanation to me. Harry should have said, huh?<br/><br/>Even though I had issues with the adapting of the book to this movie, it is still worth watching in the theatre. There were cuts made to the storyline that was understandable (it was a 700 page book) but I disagree with characters and scenes they chopped, switched, and massaged (Dumbledore, Priori Incantatem explanation). HP Goblet of Fire has an epic fantasy feel to it that any sci-fi/fantasy fan will appreciate. I think my favorite movie in the series so far is Prisoner of Azkaban (for the storyline  its my favorite out of the series, unique direction, better transition between scenes and an overall stronger impact)."
"kdskicat","1","9","18","18 November 2005"," come back Cuaron
","After a pleasant, enjoyable romp with Chris Columbus, and a true suspenseful masterpiece by Cuaron to venture into the dark world of Harry Potter, Newell falls completely flat attempting a poor mix of the two genres.<br/><br/>The movie exposed the acting talents of the child stars previously deftly covered up in the earlier movies. I know this comment will fall on deaf ears for all the blind love that goes along with Harry Potter, but this installment was a true disappointment.<br/><br/>does anyone else share this opinion? I have faith in the IMDb users that at least some out there will agree with me."
"Atlasxxiv","9","9","18","13 November 2005"," A darker, more suspenseful Harry Potter...
","I won't give away a single plot line (if you really want to know - read the book) but I was much happier with this film then the last. Maybe I just don't like Alfonso Cuaron's style, but this movie had you mistrusting everyone. The Prisoner of Azkhaban seemed so frivolous next to this Mike Newell version of HP4.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire asks as many new questions as it answered the old ones. I loved the new characters they introduced and Brendan Gleeson's Mad-Eye Moody was amazing. Much less involved was Hagrid and Snape but we all know they factor more in the upcoming story lines.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up - and DON'T wait until this one comes out on DVD. The special effects have to be seen on the big screen. I believe Daniel Radcliff did all his own stunts in this one as well, which makes the underwater scene all the more impressive... and this was a very impressive film."
"PetraB","6","27","69","18 November 2005"," Disappointing.
","How unfortunate that ye-ol-movie-factory could not wait for Alfonso Cuarón to complete Azkaban so that he could direct this film. Rather they gave it over to Sappy-Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral Mike Newell.<br/><br/>Although Cuarón changed some of the story from Azkaban overall he made a film not only true to the tone and main plot of the book, but also a beautiful picture. He provided a level of artfulness to the Harry Potter films that had been missing and unfortunately it appears it has gone missing again.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire seems to be more concerned with winking at the audience when each ""cool"" thing from the book is included rather than actually showing a true story or tone of the book. How unfortunate that this film, even at 2 hrs 30 min, feels rushed and appears to missed the point.<br/><br/>As a big Harry Potter fan this movie makes me feel more like re-reading the books than watching the films.<br/><br/>If you are a fan you will find yourself smiling and maybe even cheering in the movie theater but end up going home feeling disappointed and empty. If you have not yet read the book, go check it out from the library and read it cover to cover before you go to the theater because the cliff notes version Mike Newell released today is far from complete or satisfying."
"mr-imdexter","1","6","11","24 November 2005"," A good movie
","The newest Harry Potter movie will not disappoint the Potter fans. I am not a fan of Harry Potter, nor do I dislike the franchise. Still, I would like to give my comments about this movie and the more than 5000 people who gave it a 10. <br/><br/>Do not expect excellent acting performances from any of the actors. They did a good job but Daniel Radcliffe is not on par with his friends Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The latter two have a better facial expression and seem to feel more at home on the set. I was glad to see that Ralph Fiennes had the role of Voldemort even though he was on the screen for less than 5 minutes. <br/><br/>The special effects were quite good. I expected them to be a little bit better since we are in late 2005. Movies like Lord of the Rings and Sin City are prettier in that aspect.<br/><br/>I may have the facial expression of a stone but when a joke is funny I will laugh. I did not laugh more than 1 time throughout the entire movie. Yes, Ron did succeed in making a grin on my face a couple of times but I was still disappointed. In my opinion the movie lacked some serious action. I am not talking about XXX or James Bond type of thing but some scenes were to slow. Now, you can interpret the next sentence in a few ways and you can even call me a little boy but: the only thing that made my heart beat faster was Fleur Delacour in her bathing suit. <br/><br/>This movie was not a waste of money, none of the Potter movies are, but it is in no way worth the perfect 10. For those who voted a 10, would you rate Schindler's list or the Godfather a 15?"
"junk-751","2","6","11","20 November 2005"," OK...was that supposed to be Harry Potter?
","For being my favorite book of the series, it's surprising that this is my second least favorite movie so far; if it weren't for the airborne dementors of the Prisoner of Azkaban, this would definitely be it.<br/><br/>This movie shows a blatant disregard for the details of the book and way too much interpretation. In the book, Harry and co. cannot figure out how Rita knows all these details. When someone suggests that she may have planted bugs, Hermione says that's impossible because there's a charm at Hogwarts that jams electrical devices. Then please explain to me how in the movie there is a punk band with electric guitars and microphones at the yule ball!? I don't remember a rave in JK Rowling's version of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>A few more little qualms:<br/><br/>Victor Krum is not a mindless jock. He is supposed to be modest, caring, and honorable.<br/><br/>Beauxbatons girls are supposed to be attractive, not repulsive.<br/><br/>Dumbledore cannot decide if he's English or American. He also can't decide whether to strangle Harry or just scowl at him.<br/><br/>I remember there being veelas in the story.<br/><br/>I remember Rita turning into a beetle.<br/><br/>Why waste the time introducing Sirius into the movie if he's only in one inconsequential scene? Put the important stuff in instead, like veelas and beetles."
"tommyt-4","6","6","11","19 November 2005"," The Worst Yet
","I enjoyed the first three movies. I thought they were fairly good to the books. In my opinion, the first two were just good movies, while the third was amazing. Therefore, I had high expectations going into the movie based on my favorite book in the series- and I was completely disappointed.<br/><br/>It felt like the director hadn't even read the book. Dumbledore was freaking out in this movie, which is completely contrary to everything that was in the books. The point of Dumbledore's character is that he is not only a great wizard, but the stabilizing force for the good side of the wizarding world. When everybody else is losing their minds, Dumbledore is calm. In this movie, he is almost angry. For instance, when Harry's name comes out of the goblet, Dumbledore pushes Harry against a wall and yells at him, whereas in the book, he merely asks him kindly. In the book, Dumbledore trusts Harry and is frightened for him that he is in the tournament. In the movie, it seems like he has the same opinion of Harry as everyone else.<br/><br/>Likewise with the character of Moody. In the books, Moody is a crazy old man who was a great auror. He is crazy, but crazy because he is suspicious of everything and will hex anything that moves. In the movie, he seems like a mental patient with a crazy gleam in his eyes. He seems to have no control over himself. Moody was my favorite character in the book, but while watching the movie, I just wanted him to get off screen because he was so much different from the books.<br/><br/>I am not criticizing the actors in this movie. The acting was in my opinion, quite good. However, I blame the problems on the director. He completely changed the personality of Dumbledore, even from the previous movies. Likewise, the movie felt very rushed. They considered making this into two movies, and it was a bad decision not to. Most of the book was left out, which will I'm sure anger more than just myself. The three tasks took up the majority of the movie, and far too many scenes were combined to satisfy me.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that the whole movie was a waste. I thought some of the things that the director did were great. For instance, the Quidditch Cup was good (although they left out the actual match). Likewise, the young actors continue to improve, and the veterans were solid as usual. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape needs to get more scenes because he steals every one the he is in.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought that the movie was far too dramatic and overacted. I give it a 6. I can't say what I would have given it had I not read the books, because the movie was indeed well done. However, I can't justify ranking it higher because of my readings of the books."

","Easily the best and the funniest in the Harry Potter series, this film really is brilliant! What makes it as well is its intensity. The danger factor has been enhanced from the book considerably, as evident in Harry's battle with his dragon during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. The book merely has Harry riding around a bit to avoid the dragon but the film has the dragon breaking it's restraints and following Harry around the school's turrets in an attempt to roast him alive. The action is definitely better with the special effects used in the telling of the story rather than overused.<br/><br/>One bug bear about this movie: I'm not sure that Daniel Radcliffe and some of his actor friends are going to last the distance on this series. They are all definitely older and its far more noticeable, particularly in the case of Rupert and Daniel. Both seem to have grown up at an alarming rate (particularly in Ron's use of language). The challenge for the next films (should Daniel and Rupert continue with them) is going to continue to retain the age and experience perspective relevant to the character (Harry is supposed to be 14 in this film, but he appears to be a bit older both in appearance and attitude but thankfully, no facial hair yet). That said, the teenage raging hormone factor is extremely funny, particularly in their sparring with Hermione and her decision to go to the Yule Ball with a rival to Harry in the Tournament. This annoys Ron very much and leaves him to wonder why he never viewed Hermione in this way before. Other funny moments include Harry's visit to the Prefects' bathroom to find out the secret inside his golden egg (a close encounter with Moaning Myrtle ensures). This sequence particularly highlights the actor and the character's age although Daniel does cut quite a figure underneath the school uniform (he must have been working out).<br/><br/>That said, all the signs are that this series will continue in a very successful vein and I hope it does. I also hope all of the cast continue with it, as to cast anyone else in their parts would have a detrimental effect and I don't think any other actors can play Harry, Ron and Hermione quite as well. Their character dynamic together is both hilarious and quite charming. Other characters have also matured considerably, especially the Neville Longbottom character who has grown out of being the constant fall guy."

","This movie really should of been a two part series. The movie is so choppy that if people hadn't of read the book they would not of known what the hell was going on. It was like they pulled out the best scenes, some one liners, and tried to work around the character relationships. I was glad to watch the movie, but very disappointed with what the directed and producers decided to do. The book is so massive now that the movie should of been two parts. Not only that, but the book was a major turning point in the series. The first three were mainly back story, but in the fourth, we find out a lot more about Harry and the other characters as they grow up. I also agree and wonder about why they let Dumblerdore lose it? He is always calm and it was very out of character to have him shake Harry. They really should of known better. I think many more people will be disappointed like me."

","The bottom line is that the first two films engaged us on the sheer visual invention of the magical world. The third film was a good film as a film, architectural, Sculpted rhythm that matched the physical spaces shown.<br/><br/>This one fails on both accounts. Oh, you will read that it attempts too much, coming of age meets thriller and so on. But I think it was simply a matter of not having a creative team in place that cared to make a good movie.<br/><br/>There was only one cool effect: the seven Pegasii. And there was only one interesting character, Moaning Myrtle. Just one. <br/><br/>So on the superficial level, the comment is that the basic film-making skills were absent.<br/><br/>But wait! This is the guy behind ""Pushing Tin"" and ""Enchanted April,"" both supremely well done.<br/><br/>So it must have been the producers that made this bloodless, a walk through the required scenes.<br/><br/>So very strange, because the last one was all about rich film-making, It had a center, following the Orson Welles tradition that anchored the thing in the buildings.

","I've recently seen Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and I came out feeling extremely disappointed. While the graphic effects were amazing, the story that was the Goblet of Fire seems to be totally different. Whilst non-readers of the books sat in amazement at the sight of dragons and mer people I sat furious that characters such as Ludo Bagman and Winky had been cut. Acting for most part was awful, with Daniel Radcliffe's cringe worthy attempts, Ralph Fiennes seemed more comical rather than horrific and Michael Gambon plays Dumbledore with a portrayal that makes him appear to be Lord Voldemort himself. If I was JK Rowling, I'd be furious at the pathetic attempt to bring Goblet of Fire to life."
"suckeggs","7","7","14","18 November 2005"," Good, but not great.
","Honestly?<br/><br/>Coming from an avid reader of the books, this movie was not as fantastically wonderful as I'd really imagined it to be. Of course, I understand that time is of the essence and that cutting down on certain parts of the book is to be unavoidable. However, while leaving out some 'quite-important-but-okay-not-to-have' parts, the movie concentrated on some very unimportant, insignificantly retarded parts. Parts that have been added in by the screenwriter and weren't even in the book to begin with.<br/><br/>And I'm thoroughly disappointed with the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris was a FABULOUS Dumbledore, Michael Gambom pales in comparison next to him. In the movie, Dumbledore certainly doesn't ACT like the Dumbledore we all know and love in the books, and that really got on my nerves throughout the movie. Mad Eye Moody, I can forgive. But not Dumbledore, never. Also, they've wasted the talents of Stanislav Ivanski (Viktor Krum) and Clemence Poesy (Fleur Delacour), both the characters having less than 20 lines each.<br/><br/>However, that having been said, Harry Potter And The Goblet of Fire does have its redeeming qualities. Certain scenes will make you laugh till tears roll down your cheeks, the Weasley Twins, having finally been given more airtime, will steal the movie away. Neville Longbottom grabs more airtime as well, and you'll find yourself endeared to this forgetful, cute fellow.<br/><br/>The graphics are magnificent, and I was blown away by the sceneries and details they'd place in each scene.<br/><br/>Though not up to the readers' standards, I say that this movie will still blow your mind away."

","I think of all the films I've seen this year, I was the most excited to see this one. Unfortunately, it did not live up to Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>For the first time in an HP film, it felt like they were just going through the motions, as if there was simply a checklist of events that had to happen in the screenplay which were leading the film to its ultimate goal, of course being the return of Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>Unlike the last film, there was no cohesive theme, no attempt at a character arc for poor Harry. In Cuaron's Azkaban, Harry had to really come to terms with the tragedy of his parents' deaths, and he did so by conquering his fears of being alone. In that respect, it was much more than ""just another Harry Potter movie"", unlike this new one. Director Newell removes the inner journey in favor of cramming in as many plot points as possible.<br/><br/>The best thing about Goblet of Fire was by the end, there is even more anticipation for an excellent fifth film.<br/><br/>Just imagine if they gave this adaptation screen writing job to Fran Walsh, Philipa Boyens and Peter Jackson. Wouldn't that have been awesome?"
"siit","5","5","9","26 December 2005"," Lacking that bit of magic !!
","The Harry Potter phenomenon has become an entity unto itself. Mention Harry Potter, and its met with overwhelming ad orations, excitement and a fervor not unlike football fanatics. The marketing machine has everything Harry Potter and the general atmosphere of the franchise is one of infallibility and automatic hit before release...<br/><br/>I wish it was so. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of Harry Potter and its air of childhood innocence and.. well... magic. However, the Goblet of Fire has lost a lot of what made it Magic.<br/><br/>Gone is that trademark booming and lovable Harry Potter 'theme' that usually opened the movie.. that music itself IS Harry Potter and is as recognisable as melodies from Star Wars, Indana Jones and Star Trek. Gone is the next step in evolution of Harry's Foster-parents... Harry was just where he was. Very few nice little treats of pointless excitement - ie the chocolate frog, all flavoured jellybeans, the fun of practicing new spells.. all gone. Even the continual grin of Radcliffe has disappeared, and when he did try to do it on the bridge, it looked forced and out of place.<br/><br/>What also is gone is the noble persona of Dumbledore. Once a character so eloquently played by Richard Harris, he was the epitome of what a respected, all knowing, and controlled Headmaster.. and all powerful one at that has come to resemble. In the Third we had to get used to Gambon and understand the differences, but now he's a failure. Lack of the same poise, he's now another character no more or less powerful. He's bumbling and has lost that dignity.<br/><br/>The rivalry of Draco Malfoy also mostly non-existent with a token showing of him in the movie, which in the scheme of things WAS token and pointless.<br/><br/>Snape lost his edge though the reference to his past was interesting.<br/><br/>The overall continuity was disappointing and the promise was not delivered. They built up the World Cup then let us down with not even a match shown or the possibility of Harry's involvement as THE Seeker. Krum was a bore, the build up of the Tri-Wizard Cup and its terrors wasn't even close to being realised.<br/><br/>The whole move lacked the grandiose of the first two movies and is even way behind the third. It no longer had that fairy tale like feel, and to me was 'just another sequel'. And I am VERY disappointed.<br/><br/>What it successfully did do however better than other past Harry Potter movies was shout for a sequel. I for one can only hope that it re-establishes that magic.<br/><br/>I personally have chosen to read the books AFTER seeing the movies. Therefore I am finding myself looking forward to reading Goblet of Fire as I envisage it FAR superior to the silver screen version (I hope!!). I sincerely hope that the Harry Potter franchise doesn't fall from the special and unique pedestal it now sits on, to the depths of mediocrity - or heaven forbid, like a Rocky 5, Rambo 3, Batman and Robin, etc - 'We should have stopped at two!!!'"

","I have always been a huge J. K Rowling fan. Have waited anxiously for the release of this new film! Read lots of review online about the film before hand (Did my homework). As usual, some rated the film A++ and some D. I figure out that it can't be that bad. After all, it has a great story line. It was pissing cats and dog in Britain last Friday. However, i braved the thunderstorm and freezing subzero temperatures to make my way to the cinema. The film was a HUGE, MEGA, GIGA disappointment! I felt like crying after watching it. Mike Newell (the director) killed all the magic there is to the film. It was meant to be a magical story!! A dreamlike story not one full of battles!!!! If i wanted to watch Lord of the Rings, i would go for LODR and not Harry Potter. My guess is that Warner Bros wanted to aim for adult audiences as well as children. hah, who would have guessed that the film was rated 12A instead. It is like turning Cinderella into a night with Paris Hilton! This is not right! All there was, was battles and battles and battles. I would name it Kingdom of Heaven 2. Other than that, when was it even mentioned in the book that Harry and Ron's brides wore SARI to the ball. No offence to the Indian culture, i love ethic clothings but sari and cheongsam in a world of magics seem a bit too far-fetched! Hello, it is not halloween. The prom dance seem more like a world cross-culture ball than a wizard's ball! Michael Gambon who played Albus Dumbledore just must have either not read the book or decided that he was a better author than J. K Rowling. He killed the headmaster of hogward! As far as my memory serve me, I remembered Dumbledore as being cool and calm in all situations. No all panicky with a screw up face most of the time. He was meant to be kind and fatherly. The only actors that played their roles well were Ron Weasley, Harry Porter and Hermione Granger, Professor Snape and Lucius Malfoy. Mike Newell blanked out all the parts that made the book special like sweets that were not just sweets but with spells in them, the ghostly pictures in the halls, the fat lady that guards the door and what happened to the Nicholas the headless ghost? I guess they decided that he was dead and wasn't worth it. By the way, did anyone notice how dark and gloomy the film was most of the time? Makes you think that the producers were going to save of lightings. Well, even with the soaring prices of electricity, i am sure the public would understand if they utilised a little more electricity. Afterall, they made $1.06million on the opening day. I am sure they can afford the utilities bill."

Why did they have to have harry and the Hungarian Horntail fly around the school. At one point they even forgot that the dragon could fly when it was trying to climb across the roof. 2.Voldemort. Where were those red eyeslits and where was his snakelike voice? why did his wand look nothing like Harrys? 3.The maze. Why were the only things they came up against were roots and wind. Where was the shpinx? overall a very disappointing film - did the filmmakers actually read the book."

The script (by Steve Kloves) was so poor there is no evidence he read more than the Cliff Notes. The students for the other schools looking like idiots (a boring girls Synchronized swimming team and I goofy bunch of boy scouts with sticks to make tiny sparks with) so very sad! The Casting Team had to be both blind and deaf because their choices nearly leave me mute. The special effects (especially the Dragons) are good but is the only saving grace to this rotten film."
"bcmac4","2","5","9","23 November 2005"," To put it bluntly, I was disappointed
","I don't know if this is actually a spoiler but where were the house elves, dobby and winky? Also, Harry never sees Barty Crouch Jr. at the World Cup, why do they need to change that, it doesn't make sense to me. Also, They sat in the minister's box at the world cup, not in the highest seats possible, why change it? And since when was there a spell that propels Harry out of the water? Also, the dragon doesn't chase Harry around Hogwarts, in fact she stays close to her eggs because she is a nesting mother, that's right eggS plural, not just the golden egg, this actually presents more of a challenge than a dragon that is willing to leave her eggs. The only good scenes I thought were the graveyard scene and the opening scene, I though Voldemort was very well done. But what was with the maze? First, the maze is not the size of Rhode Island, it was contained within the Quidditch field, thus providing the stands for the viewers. Also, there was more than just wind and crazy branches in the maze. Where did the Skrewt go? Where was the Sphinx? Where was the fog that inverted the world when Harry walked through it? I also thought they should have put in the imperius curse, Moody putting it on the students, because that's a pretty cool part, the process in Harry's mind that is. I thought they could have made the movie 4 hours long and made it more true to the book and no one would have complained, I would have been happier. Also, what's gonna happen with Fred and George in the next movie, they didn't get the gold that Harry gave them in this one, so how are they going to start their shop? The grounds also make no sense, it seems like they just make up parts of the grounds that will fit the movie that aren't there when they first show the grounds in the movie."

I eagerly await the next installment. I think what really made it nice for me was the fact that Quidditch was finally back in the movie! Yes, it wasn't for very long, but it was there nevertheless, and that was one of my main complaints about Prisoner of Azkaban.

This film is horrible from a production stand point, a music stand point, and acting stand point, a writing stand point, a directing stand point.<br/><br/>Lets get started shall we? This was a rushed production, loose ends left right and center, and if I recall right I saw a crew member on camera during one the scenes.<br/><br/>Music. Patrick Doyle makes me sick, its one thing to take the original score by john Williams, but to take themes from start wars and Jurassic park with it is just horrible and discussing. The music was not written well, it had no depth. And on the screen it was just there. I shouldn't be able to hear the music unless I try. Music is to set a mood which Doyle did not do very well.<br/><br/>Acting. Dan can't act his way out of a paper bag in this movie. Every line seemed forced and every acting seemed reluctant.<br/><br/>Writing. The script didn't flow, it was jumpy and poorly written. Good comic relief from the book was replaced by shoddy and poorly written comic relief. If you had not read the book this movie would of left you in the dark all the way through. No one would have known who frank was unless they had read the book. Where the hell were the Dursleys? I know they had been cut a long time ago. But I hoped they would still be able to make the script flow. I was wrong. Also where was the character development? Oh that's right there was none! Not once could i get in side a characters mind and fell what they did.<br/><br/>Mike Neweal or who ever he is. You should be ashamed of this crap heap you call Harry potter and the goblet of fire. You cant direct to save your self. Stick to low profile films, and leave the big ones to the big boys.

The British cant make movies they can just act in them.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to this movie ever since to book was released. This entire production let me down, Guess Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is still the greatest Harry Potter film produced. This production has so much potential and it was all destroyed by bad writing, HORRID music, mediocre acting, and Horrendous directing.

","The latest Harry Potter (and the Goblet of Fire) is a sad example of bad movie making.<br/><br/>The kids (Harry, Hermione, Ron) who have shown outstanding skills in the former movies, weren't given any chance to show their abilities. Mainly in relation to an inconsistent plot, existing out of stills lasting only seconds, performing qualities could not evolve this time.<br/><br/>And here we are: The plot. Given that the director is an experienced one, the screenwriter no rookie either, the outcome is that of a newbie. Scenes introduced only seconds before they happen, scenes started but not finished properly, gap fillers where other scenes essential for understanding are not completed. Most scenes make appetite for more, but the appetite nearly never is satisfied in the end.<br/><br/>Granted, as most kids and grown ups know the books by J.K. Rowling by heart, the plot is widely known. But my friend does not read. She will not be able to follow the plot. And give it another 10 years, another generation of kids not infected with the Harry Potter fever, neither will they.<br/><br/>Close to 1; only due to the fact that the movie had some funny moments and created throughout its lenght some laughter, its a 2.<br/><br/>My advice: Save your money for the next book."

","I'll just come right out and say it: I'm quite disappointed with GoF.

At one point, I was so bored that I found myself wondering what size knitting needles I should use to make my next Gryffindor scarf ... <br/><br/>My main complaint is that the movie focuses solely on the Triwizard Tournament; every discernible subplot in GoF was cut to make room for it. It is also very choppy--because it goes quickly from one tournament event to the next, it seems that hardly any time passes (however, snow does appear on the ground about halfway through the movie). My other grievances are of the nit-picky, hardcore fan variety, so I won't bother listing them here. <br/><br/>The actors did a fine job, though some new characters are very different from how I imagined them (a first for me as far as the HP movies are concerned ... everyone else has perfectly fit the bill). There are a few scenes where the Hogwarts faculty look very confused and quite uncomfortable, and for no obvious reason. <br/><br/>I should warn any potential moviegoers that they will be terribly confused if they haven't read GoF, and if they have, that they'll be annoyed by choruses of, ""Mommy, who's that? What's going on?"" So do yourselves several favors: read the book first, and go to a very late night showing. And, if at all possible, avoid paying money to see it.

Goblet of Fire miserably failed to live up to the book, which isn't even one of my favorites of the series. The most crucial plot line of the whole story wasn't even properly explained. That would be the whole thing with the Crouch son and his father. One of the most important scenes is when he is interrogated by Dumbledore and confesses everything. I understand they have to skip parts, but that was the scene that explained EVERYTHING that had happened for the last year. This movie was really about the special effects and not the story lines. The scene with the dragon was highly unnecessary and kind of boring seeing as how it dragged on Way too long. They also left out important things such as Rita Skeeter being an animagus, seeing as she comes back in the next one being blackmailed by Hermione. Winky was very important too, but seeing as they decided to forget about that whole storyline i guess it doesn't matter. Ludo Bagman wasn't that important but still, to not even mention him? They are going to have a very hard time with the next movie, trying to fill in the holes that were dug with Goblet of Fire. The next movie will be confusing for non book readers because they weren't told what happened in the this one. Also, the guy who plays Dumbledore is AWFUL. Not saying hes a bad actor, but he SOOO isn't Dumbledore in any way. No way would Dumbledore grab Harry by his neck, even the Dumbledore from the movies. And what the hell was with that maze? How weak was that? If i put aside my feelings over the movie compared to the book, it still wasn't good. If you want to be awed by special effects and thats it, this may be the movie for you.

Now, the biggest disappointment for me was Dumbledore. So cold, distant and rough. He isn't the Dumbledore that we all know and love.<br/><br/>Mike Norwell cut a lot of parts but this one really 'bugs' me (ha ha pun intended). The reporter, Rita Skeeter was not mentioned as an Anamagus which is partially relevant in the fifth film. I know that if you kept every single part of the movie, you would be in there for 4 hours but I don't think they cut out the right parts. I fell asleep watching it in the Theatres! The special effects could've been better from the dragons to the scenery to iunno, everything! This truly was interpretted by Mike Norwell as one of the darkest books.<br/><br/>I did get the after movie jitters when I finished it in the theatres but now that I watch it maybe the third or fourth time around (partially), I realize that this was the worst out of the four movies that are out.

He was no Yoda, he was Anakin Skywalker, a over-reacting schoolboy!<br/><br/>This movie could have been good, if it was made into two full-length features with more emphasize on every one scene, connected with something like the womping willow shuffling it's treetop.<br/><br/>Actors: 5-8 stars (Please let there be more time on every single character) Dumbledore: 0 stars (I know, brilliant Richard Harris is death, but please give, also-brilliant Michael Gambon some other role, as he totally misses the character) directing: 1 star (for the decision to cramp 734 pages into one movie and to disconnect the remaining scenes) script: 3 stars (As Steven Kloves was not able to catch the chemistry between the 3 main characters and to screw up the new cramped connection between scenes AND to make all this little mistakes in every single one scene I forgot because i shoved this movie out of my brain)<br/><br/>This rubbish put together makes no more than 2 stars, as I was totally confused about the story and some basic mistakes they made with the cemetery-scene, the hacked-together movie, bad Dumbledore and ruining the wonderful feeling I had with reading all books over and over and the feeling which had been installed with film 3...<br/><br/>Shame!"

The whole maze scene lasts about three minutes, while in the book it lasted for half a chapter and had A LOT more detail. In the maze there was no blast-ended Scroots, no Sphinx, no Acromantula, and the maze decided to eat the champions instead. harry and voldemort are supposed to rise in the air. the world cup was completely retarded and it didn't even occur. and durmstrang and beubaton arrived 5 minutes into the movie. in the book winky was accused of cunjuring the mark and in the movie winky doesn't exist. this movie is incredibly retarded and i hate it."

","In Hogwarts, three different wizard schools compete in a dangerous competition called the Triwizard Tournament.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter has dark nightmares, while Voldemort's Death Eaters are preparing the return of the evil Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the weakest Harry Potter's movie, but it is still good. The plot with the very hazardous competition and the winter ball is very silly, and the strong part of the screenplay is the return of Lord Voldemort and his duel with Harry Potter.

"Bretta_23","1","4","7","5 March 2006"," Why did Rowling allow this????
","I couldn't believe how much I hated this movie. I'm not sure if I would have liked it more had I not read the books, but I have, so it is all I have to go off of.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I love these books. LOVE them. I think they are one of the most terrific book series ever written. They are beautiful, sincere and unique. I absolutely cannot get enough of anything HP related--<br/><br/>Except for these flippin' movies.<br/><br/>What was JK Rowling thinking by approving the production of these movies?? I actually didn't mind the first couple, but the first couple of books were so simple to begin with that there seemed to be less to mess up. But considering the Goblet of Fire is one of the longest books in the series, I felt as the though the entire movie was a cheap fast forward of the entire book. It skipped important parts that make the story (and future books) make sense and come together fluidly, and despite the fact that I realize it is hard to fit hundreds upon hundreds of pages into a 2 hour movie, I felt that they could have at least attempted to touch on some of these things.<br/><br/>In addition to this, I question whether the actual descriptions (characters, places, etc) in the book were actually read. And if they were, how they somehow didn't make it halfway to the movie.<br/><br/>For example (and this is really only one example), Dumbledore's office is described to be a beautiful, large office on top of long extravagant staircases. The office is round and light and airy, silvery and whimsical with whirly gadgets and the beautiful Fawks near his desk with the portraits of past headmasters all about. In the movie his office is, essentially, a dungeon. On top of this, Dumbledore's demeanor itself is so extremely different than in the book. In Goblet of Fire he is aggressive, old and crusty. He gives little advice to Harry and no bond is apparent in their relationship: something that is a huge deal throughout the course of the book series. In the book he is Harry's mentor, confidant, and an extremely kind, gentle and incredible wizard. And why was everything in this movie so DARK?<br/><br/>I could go on for hours.<br/><br/>This movie was a complete sellout."

","I am begging on me KNEES to have Chris Colombus come back!!! I am so horrified and angry at the new director. He went WAY too fast. In the beginning, Mr. Weasley was supposed to send Harry a letter, telling him he will pick him up for the World Cup, then Mr. Weasley comes by floo powder to come pick Harry up. None of that happens. They start with Harry already at the Weasley's. Also, the World Cup lasted less than 5 minutes!!! They didn't even show the veelas nor Winky-which is a key character in the next books. Overall, the crew skipped practically 1/3 of the book..And made the rest up!! They were also supposed to figure out why Rita Skeeter has been able to get all that gossip, she a flippin animagus...she turns into a beetle. This is the worst Harry Potter movie yet."
"j_m_nave","6","4","7","10 December 2005"," Weakest of the Harry Potter movies
","This is definitely a good movie but certainly not a great one. It does not compare well with the other Harry Potter movies. This one is big on special effects and action and although it touches on the characters' emotional issues it never addresses any of those issues in depth. This is unfortunately a typical Hollywood blockbuster type of movie that lacks the charm of the prior Harry Potter movies. There is no uplifting feeling to any aspect of this movie. When it's over, it's simply over. Certainly Azkaban was not as charming as the first two, but Azkaban replaced that charm with a definite edge. Goblet lacks that edge. Since the cast was excellent, with the exception of Michael Gambon who continues his lethargic portrayal of Dumbeldore, the blame must fall squarely at the feet of new series director Mike Newell. I can only hope that the DVD fleshes out some of the many themes from the book that were abandoned by the movie."

","Another Harry Potter Movie. Another wondrous extravaganza full of glittering special effects and the unwinding plot against harry by the dark lord.<br/><br/>Only, there didn't seem all that much unwinding this time. The intricacy is gone.<br/><br/>The Dursleys are gone too, and it is a sad loss. Repulsive characters though they were, they were fabulous.<br/><br/>Even worse, Hogwarts is gone. Yes, the whole movie is set in Hogarts, but they've pretty much excised all the interaction in the classrooms.<br/><br/>At one point in the movie a major character simply disappears from the scene without any explanation or reference.<br/><br/>I assume all this was to try to keep the film to a reasonable length. They succeeded somewhat there, but the cost was too great. The movie lacks a sense of richness and depth of the earlier films.<br/><br/>I guess that most people will overlook this and just be happy that there's another HP movie, but I cannot help but be left with a melancholic sense of loss. There was an opportunity to make something great here, something truly remarkable, but they've settled for something that is just good."
"rodagor","4","4","7","30 November 2005"," Not accurate to the book
","OK, I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and was entertained by the special effects, the music and the acting. They were all good BUT . . .<br/><br/>This movie is only understandable by those who have read the book. Read the comments written in this forum by Reed Armstrong. He is absolutely right. The antics with the Dursleys, OMG! how could they leave that out? I would like to add also, that, in the book, Neville did not give Harry the Gillyweed it was the house elf, and speaking of the elf, he was also at the Quiddich World Cup scared out of his mind. he wasn't in the movie either, I believe this was key to the story on the Deatheaters, also the attack of the Deatheaters in the movie ,GIVE ME A BREAK, they just walked around chanting, the book had more action. Also the maze scene, how cheesy was that? That was the scariest part of the story, not even the big spider was there, they left too much out of that. I believe this story should have been more like a two part deal like Quentin Taratino's ""Kill Bill"" series, or maybe even a week long TV miniseries, there is just way too much in Goblet of Fire that is important. I understand 'cause of movie length issues, they couldn't re-create the whole book. Maybe also, they could have extended the movie a little longer and added an intermission. I'm a big Bollywood movie fan, I go to see Bollywood at theaters all the time, Bollywood movies are extremely long that they have intermission, and the crowd doesn't seem to mind. Anyway, As I said.. the music, acting, and effects, along with visual imagery was awesome, it's the telling of the story that sucked. Out of the 6 books, Goblet of Fire is my favorite, that's why I take this criticism personal."
"Spirit-o-moonflower","2","4","7","28 November 2005"," How on EARTH did JK Rowling think this film would do the book justice???
","I was so excited when I went to see Harry Potter yesterday with my husband. I just couldn't wait any longer, so my hubby surprised me by taking me out to a movie. From the very first scene (aside from some very amazing cinematography), I was sitting there, arms crossed over my chest, almost pouting. Maybe I had high expectations seeing as Goblet was my favorite of the books, and based on what I had seen of pictures of the film, as well as reviews from fellow fans...I went thinking that, like PoA, sure there'd be some stuff left out, but that overall, it was still going to be a good adaptation, and an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>I left the film (I was actually the first person out) with my brows furrowed, asking myself how the screenwriter and the director, and even JKR allowed such a complete waste of time to be made, and the amount of money that was spent! I loved how the little bit of scorched parchment appeared saying 'Based on the book by JK Rowling'. I actually laughed at that, and said to my husband that it should have said 'VERY LOOSELY BASED on the books by JK Rowling (who was actually unconscious when we asked her to approve this script)'.<br/><br/>I know that I am going to get a lot of flak for writing this post, but that's okay. I know there are some fans out there who think that Harry Potter and his creator can do no wrong...however, this film should have been directed by a different director, and the screenwriter should be shot. How dare they take such liberties on changing the ENTIRE story around to suit them and their plans?? Barty Crouch Jr being at the Quiddich World Cup, and HP seeing him there, as well as in his dream in the beginning?? And the dream took place while he was at the burrow? Where the hell was Mrs. Weasley? Where was Bill and Charley, and even PERCY!! The Dursley's were non-existent...what happened to Madam Hooch? Correct me if I'm wrong but I know for a fact that Fleur had more then one line in the book. Winky...Dobby...the gillyweed! The only scene that really resembled the book was the end sequence with Voldemort coming to power...however in my minds eye, I saw a lot more death eaters showing up, not four. Aside from the lack of death eaters, that scene was by far the best, and very well done (although he looked just as he was described in the books, Voldemort was not very scary...).<br/><br/>And before people start flaming me, saying that they had to change things to suit the 2 1/2 hour time frame they had...let me say this. Was the entirely CGI scene where Harry had to get the golden egg need to be fifteen minutes long? I don't remember the dragon breaking it's chains and chasing Harry around the bloody castle! The time that they could have saved by leaving out the completely unnecessary scenes of the castle's grounds and the owlery, they could have been used to put IN the scenes they left out, due to time constraints! Overall, I was so annoyed with this film, and if the guy who directed this one is responsible for the destruction of any other of the books, I will for one, be boycotting it. After all, we are left to put up with Dumbledore's character being ruined by the man who's playing him...don't make us put up with the entire movie being completely messed around with too.<br/><br/>Now, that being said, I didn't hate the movie...I just was disappointed, and therefore annoyed that the movie I had been looking forward to for three years was just not good enough. I'm sorry if you guys don't agree, but this is my opinion, and I'm sorry if I was less then impressed with it. Thank you for listening to me rant!"
"thybittersoul","5","4","7","26 November 2005"," Disappointment for all die-hard Harry Potter fans
","After the release of the latest Harry Potter movie, I anxiously awaited the day in which I would watch the 4th installment. I wisely decided to view this film on the weekend after its release, in fear the mob of Harry Potter fans flooding the theaters. After seeing this movie, a great sense of disappointment engulfed my heart. I, being one of those obsessive fans who annually re-read the series, was outraged because Mr. Newell simply did not do justice for the beloved book. It was quite obvious that the director was in a race against time to try and fit everything into the movie. It ran at such a fast pace that I could scarcely begin to enjoy one scene when it suddenly jumped to another. Also, I cannot begin to speak of the great irritation I felt every time a portion of the book was left out, mind you these were parts that I enjoyed. At the end of the movie I was just so greatly relieved that the agony was over.<br/><br/>The most odious part of this movie was the complete obliteration of scenes that I so dearly longed to see, such as: the Hagrid/Madam Maxine ordeal, Rita Skeeter's bigotry article, Harry's button attack at Ron, the capture of Rita Skeeter as a beetle, Sirius/Dumbledore/Harry discussion, and many more that I don't have time to list. And, to add insult to injury Mr. Newell completely rewrote a few scenes to accommodate the absence of others. So much was skipped that I do not know where to begin, but I was absolutely appalled at the incredibly brief participation of Sirius, Molly and Arthur Weasley, Malfoy, and other characters in the movie. Even more appalling was the complete absence of the Creevey brothers, Bertha Jorkins, Winky, Dobby, and Mr. Bagman - all of which played significant roles in the book.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I realize that Mr. Newell had a great amount of content to cover, and also I take into consideration that his film was completely under budget. However, it would have been a wise move for him to create two separate films instead of trying to fit all the action, adventure, romance, drama, and etc of a 734 page book into a 2+ hour film.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was an incomplete summary and cannot even compare to the book. There were just too many scenes that lacked content and were merely ""glossed over"" with insufficient details that could not make them as interesting or adventurous as the scenes in the book. It was not an accurate adaptation and I highly recommend people to save their money, lest he/she would like to be deeply disappointed as I was. Mr. Newell left out the many small details that J.K. Rowling meticulously implements, and those details prove to be vital aspects of the book that make it so great and enchanting to the readers. There is much more that I would like to add however, my great anger and disappointment calls me to re-read the Goblet of Fire so that I may be left with the euphoric sensation that I did not receive after watching the movie."
"proximo_sinister","10","4","7","22 November 2005"," Harry at his best
","I thought that this was by far the best of the Harry Potter films. Yes, they had to reduce certain parts of the story in order to make the film and acceptable length, but the editing was done well. The only short coming to the film was the fact that the director left out a scene in which the characters announce that the Order of the Phoenix is being called up to fight Voldemort - however, this omission does not hurt this film the way that the omission of the explanation of the names on the Marauder's Map hurt the third film. Apart from this being the only real shortcoming, this film exhibited a higher level of humor, truly British in its nature. The fact that Mike Newell is the first British Director most likely has some part in this. I found that the theatre resounded with laughter on numerous occasions throughout the film. The characters also seemed to blend together in a more seamless manner than they have before. I feel that it would be in the film maker's best interest to keep Newell on for the remainder of the series. This is the best acting thus far that I have witnessed on behalf of the younger actors. The only recommendation that I could make would be to include the adult characters more. Such wonderful actors are cast in the supporting role - I would love to see them with more air time."
"zeefense","10","4","7","21 November 2005"," A job well done
","I was a bit worried with so much missing from the movie, that this would not live up to the Harry Potter name. I was mistaken. Although yes, it is true, there is no Mrs. Weasley, The Dursleys, Dobby or Winky, and even the introduction of the older Weasly boys, Director Mike Newell did the best job possible with the limited time he had. The effects were great, as expected, and the movie flowed very well. The movie could have been longer just because it really didn't feel like a 2 hour and 20 minutes movie. One thing I greatly enjoyed was that someone finally got the idea of Fred and George. They screen time must have doubled from the first three movies combined. A lot of funny moments and Fred and George were a part of them all. It's just too bad they didn't have Percy in there as I would have loved to see Fred and George cut him down as they do in the books and movies past. All the main scenes from the book was pretty much done to form. Ralph Fiennes nailed the performance of Lord Voldemort and I would not be surprised to hear a buzz start with Brendan Gleeson being nominated for an Oscar as Mad Eye Moody. Miranda Richardson caps off the great performances with her portrayal of Rita Skeeter. If I had to make a complaint, the only one it might be is that Rupert Grint was hard to understand at times, however, it was only in very small doses. It is fine to take children under 13, although there is your standard violence, but nothing compared to Lord of the Rings. There are a couple of deaths, but only one is shown and it is not bad. A little flirtation, like when Moaning Myrtle is floating around as Harry is taking a bath, but the little hinted jokes really won't be noticeable to kids. Only other ""iffy"" issue when it comes to sexuality, oh, maybe Hagrid in his slow dance with Madame Maxime, but if you can't handle a butt grab, you probably didn't plan on seeing the movie anyway. Oh, and a lot of people were confused by Neville Longbottom being upset as he saw a spider creature get tortured. It is brought up in the pensieve that Barty Crouch Jr. tortured his parents, but a lot people didn't put the two together. Enjoy!"

If you have read the books up to and beyond Goblet of Fire, you will notice a significant portion of the original story is missing from the film, to a much greater extent than the earlier films.<br/><br/>I understand that certain things would have to be removed - the book is _big_, however many key elements are missed out, many of which will have a significant impact on the later films as the storyline is incomplete.<br/><br/>Perhaps the inevitable ""Special Extended Edition"" DVD will fill in some of the gaps!

"jinnaw21","2","4","7","19 November 2005"," What was Kloves thinking?!
","I open the newspaper and all i see is outstanding reviews of ""Goblet of Fire"" and i don't really understand why. I mean yes it is the best out of the four films but it didn't really have to work to hard to get that title. I am usually and open minded person when it comes to harry potter. I was expecting that the movie wouldn't be as good as the book of course but i really wasn't expecting this.<br/><br/>Firstly I must say what was Steve Kloves (the screenplay adapter) thinking?! I mean yes the book was long but the movie cuts out so much of the plot. There is hardly any explanation of why Barty Crouch Jr. was using the polyjuice potion to impersonate Moody, or how he got there, and why harry was the the quidditch world cup and for that matter what it was.<br/><br/>And please parents do not take the PG-13 rating lightly. There are some very intense scene with images of voldemort and violence that may disturb your children. This doesn't mean that kids shouldn't come but if your child is scared easily you might want to wait for this one to come on video.<br/><br/>As for the acting I must give Emma Watson some credit. She has improved greatly throughout the films and is definitely the best of the trio. She brings graceful presence to Hermione but unfortunately sometimes is a little to glamorous for our little bookworm character.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe seems to be getting all of this praise for being such a wonderful actor but I find his performances dry and not very well acted. Because of his lack of acting abilities and the fact that Harry is such and emotional character the makeup department seems to be covering his face in wounds and sweat so that no one will notice that there are no tears coming from his face Rupert Grint has always confused me. Sometimes i don't' like his style yet he never fails to make me laugh. I think he could use some improvement but bring a quirky charm to the character of Ron The adults in the film always put on a wonderful performance. Maggie Smith is an amazing actress as well as many others. But Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is a bit too angry and aggressive for my taste. It may just be that I am comparing him to Richard Harris and he to me seemed like the ultimate Dumbledore. In the great hall scenes Gambon yells and seems somewhat agitated the entire time, where as Dumbledore is supposed to be a stressed yet gentle character.<br/><br/>I hope I am not being too critical, i just expected a better adaptation from such a wonderful book."

My husband has never read any of the books and he was lost throughout the movie and I wish we had known that this was better for those who had read the books. They cut out too much important stuff that supports the next book and it seems like they rushed through this. The cemetery scene and the first task with the dragon was depicted well, but they kept out the 2 house elves, the Dursleys and Mrs. Weasley, and I didn't like how Dumbledore or the Madame was portrayed. Understanding of course that time is not on a directors side, but information and detail was definitely lacking. The main three are still great together and thankfully they kept the twins more involved. But it'll be interesting to see how the twins are able to get their magic shop started without the reward money. Overall, I think they could've done better."

We reserved tickets almost 2 weeks ahead of time for the opening weekend and choose the best theater in St. Louis we could to see it. This was a monumental book of the series and had a number of subtle plot threads and twists all the way throughout. A lot of these threads were snipped to keep the movie from running 3+ hours but so much was cut it was almost as if I were seeing a different story from the book.<br/><br/>The movie itself was good. The CG, the actors, and the images all were fantastic. But the interpretation from the book was horrendous, not only was critical points snipped but a lot of the things that I looked forward to in the movie (like the veela dancing during the world cup) were simply ignored.

","the direction of this movie was horrible. let me preface the rest of this comment with the fact that i am an avid harry potter fan. this movie was the worst of the three so far. if you think i am wrong, bring someone to see it who hasn't read the book first...and then enjoy explaining the entire movie to them. granted, the special effects were amazing, and a lot of the scenes were great, but that is all they were: a bunch of scenes. there was no link from scene to scene. there was nothing explaining what was happening. bad direction.<br/><br/>the story was obviously wrong. there was not a single mention of a house elf (the main driving point of the original plot), Veela (a fun new species...and half of the lineage to one of the new main characters), and there was no ludo Bagman, a fun character which would have made for a very good time. however, i can concede that you cannot fit everything in that massive book into this movie, and one (the director) must pick and choose the most necessary parts.<br/><br/>but, somethings were just off. one can argue that the following things are nit-picky and not worth mentioning. however, if you're going to make a movie from a series of novels with such ravenous fans, you must be consistent. these mistakes just show that the cast and crew were not fans of the series, but rather just looking to put out a movie. and after the last movie, which was done so well, its a big let down. 1.Cornelius fudge never was wearing his obligatory green bowler 2. Pavra and lavender Patil are in...DIFFERENT HOUSES 3. harry, after fighting the horn-tail, was sitting at the table with an arm in a sling, and stitches...so where was madam Pomfrey? and, anyone who read book 5 realizes how wrong it is to give harry stitches in book 4 4. Fleur was not the hottest of the hot, all other Beaubaton girls looked better 5. where were the creatures in the maze? no Skrewts, no sphinx, no spider.(and we know they had the budget) 6. who is this new Flitwic? 7. the Wizengamot...that is not what it looks like. how do you send harry back there, in that situation, for the next movie? 8. magic eyes don't need to make mechanical noises 9. Dumbledore now likes to yell at people. he developed a temper, rather than a calm, collected amused powerhouse of Wizarding. thanks for the new, hotheaded character, its a great improvement.<br/><br/>there are more, but i cant write forever. JK, please don't let us down again.<br/><br/>there were some pros, however. the special effects were great, but that doesn't even matter anymore. Rita skeeter was perfect, even though we got no hints of her being an Animagus in this movie (thell just thrust it on us with no explanation in the next one). Barty crouch senior was great. the twins were great. other than that though...this movie is a harry potter movie only on the surface, and should be a let down to anyone who is thinking about the movie."

","I have liked all the movies so far, but this one you could tell they left a lot out and/or changed the story because they were too lazy to tell it right. I am a strong supporter of making a movie as long as it needs to be to tell the story right. Setting a certain length and trying to squeeze material in is just downright sloppy. Mike Newell has only proved one thing to the world with this movie -- he is not ready to play with the big boys. Stick to your sloppy B movies Mike. Stay away from making movies that have the potential to be masterpieces. If the next movie, which thankfully is being directed by someone other than Newell, veers away from the storyline in the manner Goblet of Fire has I would say the Harry Potter series is essentially doomed at least for those of us who have read the books and see what a mess Newell made of it so far. Tell the story the way Rowling has told it, tell it in the same order, and don't change things to make your job easier. Sloppy sloppy sloppy!!!<br/><br/>On a side note however that has nothing to do with Newell or the storyline -- <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes's acting was incredible and I think that needs to be mentioned in his role as Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>I hope this is the only movie that gets half-as*ed in the franchise or the series will be ruined. If the movie needs to be 3-4 hours, then make it 3-4 hours or two parts even! Reference Lord of the Rings Extended Editions if need be to understand why!!! People will be more than happy to sit down for four hours to watch a movie if it's told right and feels complete. It's movies like that (again reference Lord of the Rings which is 10-12 hours running in extended form) that people sit down and watch again and again and again.<br/><br/>I hope the next director reads these reviews to make a better movie off of Mike Newell's mistakes. Thanks very much for the opportunity to write this."

"ripleykramer","Null","4","7","18 November 2005"," A waste of my precious time
","Having read the first three books and being thoroughly unimpressed, I was unsurprised by this film. Knowing before-hand that John Williams was not continuing his role as composer for the film, I should have expected that any charm the earlier films had held would evaporate with this fourth instalment. The story itself is incredible enough-why would any school permit a tournament in which students are so frequently killed?-but compounded with the seemingly tacked on sub-plot of romance which is never completely fulfilled, the film itself ends up being an incredulous piece of garbage, even within its own setting. While the film looks extremely impressive, the set design is not enough to distract from the flailing plot and the unconvincing characterisations"
"info-6576","3","4","7","18 November 2005"," jumbled mess of a film
","First, I am a big fan of the books but understand that the films need to stand on their own. This one does not though it is so rushed and chaotic at times that it assumes that all have read the books and can follow what in the world is going on. Prisoner of Askaban was creative inventive and a clear case of someone doing everything right from the use of soundtrack to spell bounding lighting and visual effects. The opposite is true of Goblet of Fire. We are sadly back to square one with the films back to the paint by numbers approach that still can't save the director from getting lost in his own jumbled mess of a film.<br/><br/>Luckily the source material is some of the strongest that JK has yet produced and it saves the film from being a complete waste. But there isn't the sense that the director cares knows or believes in the source material or at least not enough to have been inspired by it. Nor does he seem skilled enough to be able to take us on a fantastic ride. I kept relaxing my grimace and telling myself now it is going to come together and it would for a flicker have its's moments and then sadly the film would rush on when it should have waited and hurried when it should have sped up the pace. Where as Prisoner of Askaban enchanted from the first notes of the score all the way through the clever ending credit sequence, Goblet of Fire feels half cooked and rushed with little in the way of something like dare I say magic. And those poor kids must feel like the characters of the books always facing a new director or is that defense against the dark arts teacher? Lets hope they find someone better next time. That is if the franchise can survive this clunker."
"eichelbergersports","8","7","15","14 November 2005"," Goblet: Easily the best of the series, so far.
","They're a little older; the direction is a little tighter; and the stories are a little darker, but the three kids remain fast friends, no matter what happens  or who comes between them.<br/><br/>Of course, we're talking about Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his buds, Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Gint), who are now in their fourth year at the Hogwart School of Wizadry. And though not much of a Harry Potter fan myself, the action in this one was spectacular and the vision even darker as directed by Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Donnie Brasco"") than part three, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban."" <br/><br/>As per usual, sinister beings and evil magicians are pursuing Mr. Potter as he tries to complete his fourth year of school. To protect him, the academy's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon, ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"") assigns ""Mad Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson, ""Braveheart"") to protect him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Hogwart's has been named the host venue for the annual Tri-Wizard competition, in which the best spellbinder from each school is chosen to represent their classmates. The competition is only for those 17 years of age and over, but, somehow, the magic Goblet of Fire spews fourth 14-year-old Harry's name, as well.<br/><br/>Forced to battle dragons, evil mermaids and a horrible, claustrophobic hedge maze, Harry discovers he is fighting much more than just his Tri-Wizard opponents. This is made quite clear when his old nemesis Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, ""Quiz Show,"" ""Schindler's List"") re-appears to face his young conquerer.<br/><br/>The title character is hard-pressed as usual, but finds he can get just as far by using his heart and head rather than brute force or warlock powers.<br/><br/>While dark and atmospheric for the most part, ""Goblet"" has some fun moments, as well. The opening Quiddich World Cup  between Ireland and Bulgaria  brief as it is, is still a wonder; also the Yule Ball  in which we get a hint of who is attracted to whom  is very well done, sweetly realistic and even a bit sad.<br/><br/>Speaking of love, the hefty Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) falls head over heels for the 7-foot-plus French school headmistress, Madame Olympe Maime, in the film's best comedic moments.<br/><br/>The most outstanding feature of the movie, however, is the terrific cinematography (by Roger Pratt, ""Troy,"" ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets""). His lush landscapes, snow-covered mountain peaks, towering spires and rich, barren forests are absolute wonders to behold. Look for an Oscar nod to come Pratt's way in January.<br/><br/>And although a bit older than the 14-year-olds portrayed in the film (Gint is two years ahead of Watson in real life), the trio seems as young and fresh-faced as the author, J.K. Rowling envisioned them in this particular episode. For actors who have really only known one part in their careers, these three make the most of the opportunity and do a fine job.<br/><br/>Overall, though a tad slow in a few spots, the picture is a triumph of good storytelling, sincere acting, amazing cinematography and seamless special effects, making it easily the best of the four in the series, so far."

","I've never been so disappointed in my life. Watching that movie made me feel like I was on drugs because it was so sporadic and had no continuity. I understand that there was an immense amount of material to squeeze into one movie but it could have been handled so much better. Basically if you hadn't read the book you would have had no idea what was going on. The only good part of the movie was from the point Harry and Cedric grabbed the Triwizard Cup portkey until the end. I hate this director with a passion. I honestly think I was shaking my head through the movie more than I was appreciating it. And to think I believed the movies were getting better..."
"brianjamesgottschalk","8","5","10","23 November 2005"," ...""BEST movie I've seen in my entire life.""
","This movie was extremely well put together and few movies have displayed the quality that I have seen in this one. The movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat from beginning to end. Especially if you haven't read the book before. The only flaws I found in this movie were that it was too short, leaving out a lot of scenes I would have liked to see from the book, and that Hermione appeared to be on an emotional roller coaster, at times displaying acting brilliance and at times taking it over the top. The other problem I see is that sometimes the director made Harry seem sort of weak. In the dragon scene, Harry had almost no problem taking the egg from the dragon, but in the movie there was a great deal of struggle for him. Although I understand that this is just good action, I would like to see Harry get more credit for his power, he is the one who is Voldemort's nemesis. Especially in the graveyard scene, where they didn't show him resisting the Imperius curse, and when harry was escaping he was taking down Death Eaters in the book as he ran, but in the movie he just fled, and the Death Eaters didn't depict as much fear of Harry Potter as I had interpreted from the book. However, albeit its flaws the strengths overcome them and make this movie the BEST movie I've seen in my entire life. The action was outstanding, the storyline was true, and there were no large alterations from it. I loved the Ule Ball and all of the events from the Triwizard Cup. The raging hormones of the teenagers was hilarious, and contributed to a large portion of the humor from the film, if not all the humor. At this point, I would give the movie and 8.5/10, but what brought the movie to a 10/10 for me was LORD VOLDEMORT. He was amazing, every bit as evil as I had expected and every bit as powerful. He was probably the best part of the movie for me, and the reason that I was so excited to see it. This movie was outstanding, very well directed and an edge of your seat action/comedy/drama/mystery movie, the likes of which I have never seen before."

"cleric20","9","6","13","6 November 2005"," First reaction from the UK...
","""Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry."" These are the words of warning that Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore gives Harry in his fourth film outing. But 'dark and disturbing' would be an apt descriptor for The Goblet of Fire, because here more than in any of the previous three, the powers of darkness are gaining strength and closing in on young Mr Potter and they mean to finish him. Goblet of Fire is great movie version of the book - sure they've had to chop loads out but it still manages to capture the spirit of the original and bring it vividly to life... For me this is where the Harry Potter films change from spooky children's fiction to supernatural adult fiction based in a children's world. It's by far the darkest one yet, stepping into real horror territory at points, with a sustained sense of menace and a gruesome climatic graveyard scene certainly worthy of its UK 12a certificate."
"ManchesterMatthew","6","3","5","10 August 2012"," Unnecessarily Spoiled
","Firstly I should say that I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter books, but that's not to say that I'm not able to enjoy the films in their own right - and I do enjoy all of the Harry Potter films, to differing extents.<br/><br/>The thing I find about The Goblet of Fire is that it could so easily have been better. There are just so many scenes that are spoiled by senseless additions, extreme over-acting, poor character decisions, or a combination of all three.<br/><br/>The over-acting is perhaps the worst thing about the film, and in particular by Emma Watson. She was excusably young in the first two films and did sufficiently well enough for an actress of her years. But the third film marked quite a dramatic change (for me, at least) and her acting significantly improved. <br/><br/>So it was something of a surprise that it should so suddenly revert to once again being a series of exasperated gasps, irritated sighs, eyebrows with a life of their own, and lots of anger. This is when she isn't speaking like she'd been raised as royalty rather than the daughter of two dentists, or as though she's going on 40 years old.<br/><br/>And speaking of anger, one very jarring annoyance about this movie is Dumbledore's character. I appreciate that this might not be such an issue for viewers who are unfamiliar with the books but it's even a stark contrast to how he is portrayed in all of the other films. And when he isn't shouting at everyone, he's always looking in the wrong direction towards whichever digitally-added effect he's meant to be interacting with. It's just dreadful, really.<br/><br/>Beyond the over-acting there are many other scenes where things simply don't make sense. Krum is the world's best Seeker and in the books he is (as would be logical) slim and gangly. Yet in the film he's some kind of beefcake. Or in the first challenge, the dragon breaks free, and not a single teacher or official acts to control the situation. <br/><br/>There are many examples like the dragon one, whereby scenes were added, but added carelessly and which made no sense. To my mind it would have made sense to either keep more of the original book in the film, or to take extra care when adding new scenes so that the story or characters aren't compromised. But instead of this approach they just butchered the book to its bare minimum and added many ""just because"" scenes instead.<br/><br/>In fact, they took a book with a great deal of sub-plots and interesting characters, and turned it into nothing more than a showcase for the three main Triwizard Challenges.<br/><br/>All in all the film is disappointing. Later films (particularly the final two) were to show that all of the actors and actresses were capable of so much more, and indeed even the previous film to this one showed this, too.<br/><br/>So, to my mind, this film's lacklustre entry into the series isn't really forgivable, and I'm glad that the director didn't return to ruin any more of the series."
"Elain-ee","3","3","5","10 June 2009"," Totally inconsistent - and misogynistic to boot!
","It was a terrible, awful mistake not to convince Cuaron to direct this movie. Mike Newell obviously has a VERY different vision of what a Harry Potter movie should look like - think Baz Luhrman for tweenies - and he was obviously unwilling to sacrifice any of that vision for the sake of consistency. There is no reason why he could not have filmed the sequel to Prisoner of Azkaban in his own style while remaining true to the central characters, as directors have done with the previous three films. Instead, he directs GOF as if it's part of an entirely different series of books, resulting in so many inconsistencies and loose ends that the film becomes unwatchable.<br/><br/>First off, we have these militant looking, Cold War/SS dudes appearing out of nowhere, conducting trials and making threats in growly, Eastern European accents. Who were they? I still have no what the *&^% they wanted! Secondly, as many other people have already pointed out, Dumbledore has undergone a radical and inexplicable change in his character. Instead of the solitary, solemn and often-overlooked wizard, we now have a growling power monger (all the men in this movie seem to growl when they speak, for some reason). The new Dumbledore also makes threats, shouts and fraternizes with the Cold War baddies as if they were his oldest and dearest friends.<br/><br/>Bafflingly, the rest of the cast all behave as if Dumbledore's behaviour is entirely normal. Meanwhile, anybody who has seen the previous three movies knows that this is not the same Dumbledore. And yet Newell offers no explanation as to why he's changed.<br/><br/>Thirdly, and most disappointing of all, is the demotion of Hermione from the 'bloody brilliant' girl who was 'the brightest witch of her age' to an insecure piece of arm candy. What a coward Newell must be if he can't even bear to have a 14 year old girl playing a strong role in his film! I also wonder how this sudden change in Hermione will affect all the young female fans of the Potter movies, for whom she must have been a bit of a role model. They probably came away from this flick thinking that it's not okay to be strong once you're a woman; that having boobs and boys means that you can no longer be outspoken or intellectual. What a load of misogynistic BS! I don't blame the author however. I haven't read the book but somehow, I just can't imagine a smart woman like JK Rowling painting such an unrealistic portrait of a girl on the brink of womanhood. Confident young girls don't normally morph into wallflowers once they hit puberty. If anything they become louder, more snappy and quite confused. Hermione, on the other hand, has become totally one-dimensional. But then Newell is probably setting her up to play a diminished role in future films, so he can focus even more obsessively on Harry.<br/><br/>Actually, I found that the almost all of the women played second-class and hyper-sexualized roles in this film, to the point of being nonsensical. Take, for instance, the French babes that arrive in skin-hugging outfits at the start of the film, flaunting perfect 36-28-36 figures. There aren't any teenagers in the world who look like that!! And why are they even at the competition? The only magical ability they demonstrate is the ability make showers of fluttery, flowery shapes appear out of thin air. They too are nothing but arm-candy in this film.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, I think that the Harry Potter franchise should fire Newell and make Goblet of Fire over again from scratch. That is probably the only move that could improve this film."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","3","5","22 April 2009"," Dark and engrossing!
","I liked this film very much. It is much darker than the previous outings, but not as faithful to the source material. The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful. I don't think it's as dark as the book, and I wasn't too keen on some of the casting. Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant were fine in their roles as the Crouches, but their characters were changed significantly. I did wish they made Crouch's disappearance more mysterious, instead of giving it away, ruining the suspense that was quite compelling up to that scene. I am not too keen on Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, I just don't remember Dumbledore being violent as they made him. As I've said already, I much prefer Richard Harris as the character. I am also on the fence about Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson is a very talented actor, evident in films like In Bruges and The General. He looked the part, but his voice wasn't exactly what I had in mind for Moody. I have listened to the audio tapes by Stephen Fry, and I imagine Moody's voice as low and gravelly. Although Gleeson mostly succeeded with his role, I personally think he tried too hard. My brother also noted that he didn't like the execution of the three tasks. I didn't like the third task, and the other two were fine. I did think on a positive note that Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was suitably scary, and with the exception of Dumbledore everyone else was well done. All in all, a flawed but quite engrossing film, that doesn't quite live up to the darkness of the book. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"kdo0105","1","3","5","28 June 2008"," worst of the potter movies, severe disappointment
","OK it wasn't a bad movie just as a movie. My bias of being a huge Potter fan (especially of the books) lead me to the feeling that this movie was a train wreck. The Goblet of Fire was perhaps the best book of all of Rowlings. In my opinion it was the most suspenseful and throughout the story it was full of action, romance, humor, suspense and MOST IMPORTANTLY a mystery. Yes the best part about the story is the mystery surrounding the man who put Harry's name into the Goblet and what the motivations were behind it. Which no one knows until the end when imposter Moody is revealed.<br/><br/>THAT is where my biggest disappointment is. they almost entirely butchered the Crouch storyline and it was left unexplained. The story as it goes on becomes a more suspenseful mystery as clues are thrown out that could lead you to the conclusion that Moody isn't actually the real Moody, he is a fake and that he put Harry's name into the Goblet. The most important part of the books was about the mystery. The movie it was mostly about Harry's tri-wizard adventure, romance and as much humor as they could put in.<br/><br/>Look I wont complain about the triwizard tasks although the first task was severely dramatized(in a good way in terms of the casual audience perhaps), the third task was completely messed up. In the book it had everything it was an amazing chapter in the book and in the movie it was a bunch of ATTACKING branches.<br/><br/>Next up....Voldemorts return. Horribly rushed. If they had put in more to that scene and less to the stupid Yule Ball then it would have been terrific. The graveyard scene was so rushed but not as much as the shrieking shack scene in PoA.<br/><br/>LOOK, it wasn't THAT bad from a casual viewers opinion, actually pretty good. But from a huge fan of the books it was a mess in my opinion and it really hurt to watch again. The best book in the series is matched by the worst movie of the series. Both GoF.<br/><br/>PS: I hate how they make Ron a sissy with no special abilities. Ron isn't supposed to be the sharpest tool in the shed out of the three and certainly not the most skilled with a wand but its like he is a comic relief character and that was his purpose."

"nayruslove14","2","3","5","8 March 2008"," A Disaster
","Where to begin? This movie started off a disaster and ended a disaster.<br/><br/>I understand that given how long the fourth book was, some editing needed to be done. But to this extent? The whole movie was altered so drastically from the book, it almost seemed like a whole different story altogether. What was left of the original story was far and few in between and was filled with plot holes and inconsistencies.<br/><br/>The Dursley's were never shown in the beginning, Weasley's Wizard Weezes was never even mentioned nor was Harry giving the twins his Triwizard earnings. Ludo Bagman wasn't in it at all. There was no S.P.E.W. There were no Veela's. Hardly any of the classes were seen and we never actually see the fake Moody putting Harry and his classmatesunder the Imperious Curse or find out exactly why the Cruciatus Curse bothers Neville so much. Rita Skeeter was given very little to work with (almost all of her articles were not shown) We never found out about Hagrid's half-giant status or saw Hermione blackmail Rita Skeeter. Those are just a few of the smaller cuts in the film.<br/><br/>The larger ones include the trio not meeting Sirius in Hogsmeade and finding out about Crouch Sr. and Jr.'s histories, Harry never witnessing the Lestrange's and Barty Crouch Jr's trial. All we have is Kakaroff telling us during his trial that Barty Crouch Jr.was a Death Eater and then Barty acts all snakelike and his father stares at him blankly and says that he is no son of his.<br/><br/>In the book we actually see the trial. I'm saddened that it wasn't included. The original scene was done so well, it had so much emotion. I almost felt sorry for Barty Crouch Jr. when he is sobbing for his father to not send him back to Azkaban and his father is refusing to listen. Not to mention, that is when we are introduced to Bellatrix and she stands up and says that the Dark Lord will rise again. But of course, they had to ruin it all.<br/><br/>There is of course more. No Winky and Dobby (or any house elf for that matter) no testing Crouch Jr. under Veritaserum. So therefore we don't know how Crouch managed to escape Azkaban or exactly how he found Voldemort or anything like that. His father is killed and it is never elaborated on as to why. We don't see Fudge arguing with Dumbledore over whether or not Voldemort is back or get told that Barty had the Dementors Kiss performed on him. The whole reason that no one believed that Voldemort had returned in Harry's fifth year is because there was no one to give testimony to his having returned besides Harry. Barty Crouch Jr. obviously couldn't anymore.<br/><br/>I could go on but there is little point. The film as a whole was as I said before a disaster. Even the cast seemed to be horrendous. Michael Gambdon was off as usual and Alan Rickman was given limited screen time which is a shame considering how talented he is and how important that Snape is to the fourth book and indeed the rest in the series. David Tennant while a good actor, did poorly here. I don't blame him though, he really didn't have much to work with. Ralph Fiennes was laughable as Lord Voldemort. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all did well as usual but even their performances were not enough to save this film.<br/><br/>Two out of ten stars."

"mcsheehey","5","3","5","26 May 2007"," The Worst Harry Potter Film
","Let me start by saying that I did enjoy watching ""Goblet of Fire."" Unfortunately, it was still the worst of the four first Harry Potter films.<br/><br/>The fourth film takes place during Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts. The basic premise is this. The Hogwarts school is hosting a tournament called the Triwizard tournament, along with two other schools. Harry is mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor, and must compete in three daunting tasks to win the tournament. At the same time, Voldemort is slowly gaining power, leading up to a confrontation between Harry and him at the climax of the film. Here are the problems with this could-be masterpiece.<br/><br/>1. No Quidditch: About ten minutes into the film, when the trio and the Weasley's sit down in their seats at the Quidditch World Cup, I suddenly got very excited. The Cup was the highlight of the book, and I was finally going to see it on screen! Unfortunately, the scene stops abruptly before the Cup begins, which was very angering and made the first part of the film seem - well - not as good.<br/><br/>2. No Magical Score: Unlike the first three films, the musical score of ""Goblet"" is bl;and and unoriginal. John Williams created the real magic in the first two films with his enchanting Hedwig's Theme, and the composer of music for the third film gave it a very different and spooky quality. The music in this film is terrible, making the magical quality much less intact.<br/><br/>3. Cheesy Lines: the script for ""Goblet"" is full of lines that made me want to cringe. In the first three films, bad lines were somewhat acceptable due to the innocence of the children. However, they are now too old to be staying ridiculous and stupid things.<br/><br/>These, among others, are the reasons that ""Goblet"" is my least favorite Potter film.

","Turning an extremely popular fantasy book into a movie is never easy (especially if its over 600 pages long). Of course I have read the book, which probably made my expectations unfairly high. Even so this film still fell way below what I had hoped for.<br/><br/>There is nothing terribly wrong in the Goblet of the Fire. The cast is good, the effects are well done and there is a fairly solid story line. However so much is cut out from the book and this leaves a gaping hole in the story. Daniel Radcliffe has barely improved since the first movie, which is a shame because most of the cast are excellent.<br/><br/>There is nothing extraordinary throughout the whole film and although I wouldn't call it a drag I wouldn't call it exciting either. What I can't believe is that this film has a rating of 7.8 Are you trying to tell me that this extremely mediocre film is better than for example most James Bond films? Because thats what the ratings say.<br/><br/>If you do watch this try not to think of the book because it was always going to be vastly inferior. It isn't bad but it isn't good either and considering the expectation, cast and budget I would call this film a flop."

Things that are so important for the Harry Potter story line that i am terrified of how horrible the next movies will be with these things left out.<br/><br/>Last thing i will mention about his movie: why does the sun never shine throughout the entire movie? The thing i like about Harry Potter is that its fantasy that takes place in the real world. I've never seen a full year without 1 day that the sun shines. It gives the movie a sad look.

","Before i move into a whole bunch of negativity towards this movie, i'll say that the special effects were great and they are probably the best i have seen in a while. If your hoping to read a good review on this film please do not continue reading. First off I can't say it in any nicer way so... Dumbledore sucked. It was the completely wrong actor to get for the role. His voice was horrible, his personality was very unlike the Dumbledore we read about in the books (which are one of the best series) and whats this stuff about when Dumbledore chokes Harry when Harry's name came out of the goblet. Yea Dumbledore seemed very calm. The lenght of the movie was just a shocker. The book is large and i don't expect them to fit it all in but it could have been possible to make two parts to it instead of just cramping random stuff in. If you have not read the book it will be impossible to get the story line. One of the things that disappointed me most was that the situation with the Dursleys didn't happen. It's such a laugh in the books and the movies where the Dursleys have something horrible happen to them. Instead they had to cut it out and just start of with Harry at the Weasleys. Hermione in this one was so over dramatic and she spent half the time upset. Shes not even like that in the books. I believe in the previous movies (which were excellent) she did a way better job. Overall i think this movie is really unsatisfactory and its nothing compared to the books."

And every time I'm hoping for something more, but now I know that it's never going to be perfect. <br/><br/>It's just a movie. A frustratingly bad one. But it's 'just a movie'. With kids who were cute on the first movie, but have grown up to look completely different from what I imagined them to be. This is what happens when you try to make movies like this.

Although the whole fiction story is based on European fairy tales, you will see even African tribes men in native dress and a lot of cliché.<br/><br/>You know, some movies can be compared to books. Like, for example, the Lord of the Ring. This movie can be compared to postcard at it's best. Fancy, with a lot of effects, but empty. I hope that next time the tradition of changing directors of the movie will not give a false shot, and maybe at least the next movie will worth viewing.<br/><br/>Oh, and what a miserable trying to show, that Harry is a male.

","I first saw this movie in a movie theater, and then bought it on DVD. My husband and I were the first of our family to see this movie, to preview it for our children (ages 10 and 4). I'm a huge fan of the books, and highly recommend them to anyone who loves to watch a character grow through a series of novels. I have to write, first of all, that I miss Columbus as the director. His vision of Harry's world was beautiful. And that's probably the main issue with why Warner Brothers went with another director for these ""darker"" movies further on in the Harry Potter series. I also understand that Rowling really enjoyed how the director Newell crafted this movie, and agreed with what he had to cut out.<br/><br/>The primary scene I was looking forward to being adapted from the book was the quidditch match for the world cup. Overall, it was a short and sweet adaptation. But from that point on, you really just need to hold onto your seat/couch, as this movie takes off at super sonic pace. Again, where is the lovely banter between the characters? Where is the character development? Because of that same pace, that concern to pack into the movie as much of the story as possible, the director seems to have missed that central element of the Harry Potter franchise: the characters and their relationships to one another.<br/><br/>How will Harry and Dumbledore ever get together in terms of having their pivotal scenes in the latest book (Half Blood Prince)? How can anyone buy into these two characters growing with each other? We know Harry cares for Dumbledore and is loyal to him, but beyond that, do we even sense from the movies that Dumbledore cares more for him than any other student? This relationship is something that we know about from the books, and feel their bond so well due to Rowling and her craftsmanship. However, as far as the latest movies are concerned, we don't get that sense at all. And how about the 3 main relationships between Ron, Hermione and Harry? We rarely get to see that at all.<br/><br/>Another note: I have never shown the Voldemort scene (the one of his rebirth) to our children. Neither child is at the point where she could watch this scene and not come away from it with nightmares. I agree that it needed to be in the movie, but be forewarned. Children do not need to see this scene. Probably one scene I would have cut from the movie was the scene where Moody teaches his first class and manipulates a spider. It's gruesome and unnecessary. Especially if you view it repeatedly on DVD...which we have done, and we usually skip that scene as well, at the request of our children. <br/><br/>As Harry and this franchise ages, parents please be prepared. Some scenes will not be viewable by children, and parents should always preview these movies prior to letting their children view them. MPAA has rated this movie as PG-13 for a reason. And I'm sure each HP movie from this point on will have the same rating. As the fake Moody says, ""Constant Vigilance!""<br/><br/>And from what I understand, Oldman will not be back for Order of the Pheonix. So, once again, how will moviegoers actually get to see Harry and his ""father figure"" Black interact with each other? Again, this is a pivotal relationship for Harry.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is good. But it could have been far better with better editing. This movie wasn't seamless in the least."

Harry Potter is not an action hero. Some stuff he does in Harry Potter movies are more far-fetched then Master Chuck Norris' and Steven Seageal's action moves, even though he has magical powers.

"Whythorne","3","3","5","15 April 2006"," Kids' film is terrifying in its own way
","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the sort of profound cinematic achievement that prompts the following, agonizing question:<br/><br/>Will this series NEVER end?<br/><br/>Devotees of the Harry Potter books seem to get a big kick out of these movies, but I am not sure how anybody else can. It is hard to tell one movie from another, as the series is just a prolonged - and extremely tiresome - display of special effects and three boring characters' attempts to look awed at various magical/fantasy events as if they are just encountering the world of magic for the very first time.<br/><br/>And that is in spite of the fact that after four years at Hogwarts School of Magic, where one can't even spend time in a bathroom without being pestered by supernatural phenomenon, they must have seen it all by now.<br/><br/>What doesn't help this series is that Harry Potter has to be the most trite fictional character to come along since the Hardy Boys.<br/><br/>The script leaves no room for a buildup of suspense and action as the plots of these movies are always jam-packed with the same stock elements: <br/><br/><ul><li>a constant parade of uninspired magical effects, made even less interesting by their over-saturation, </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>characters you could care less about being introduced by the boat-load (literally), </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Harry's tedious run-ins with student rival Malfoy, </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>magic contests and tournaments that in spite of always being life-threatening (if I was one of the kids' parents, it would be a good case for home- schooling) are nevertheless yawn -inducing</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>plot ""twists"" that have all the unpredictability and impact of a dripping faucet,</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>and the evil bad guy that just won't go down, a la Jason or Freddie Krueger (I can't remember the nemesis' name...it's something of a cross between ""Walmart"" and ""tort reform"").</li></ul><br/><br/>And what a shock it is when Harry emerges victorious! Does anyone watching these movies ever feel like Harry is really in trouble? I mean really? It's like wondering if Austin Powers is going to escape Dr. Evil. (Actually, I take that back...the Austin Powers flicks have much more tension.)<br/><br/>New characters are always being introduced as the series progresses, forcing the series' accumulation of cast members into requisite cameo roles that keep getting shorter and shorter. Not that it matters. Even the three main children characters who get plenty of play time have personalities as exciting as damp dish rags and characterizations that are onion-paper thin.<br/><br/>One truly entertaining aspect of the film is the fact that the ages of the three main ""children"" actors is outpacing the ages of their characters as the series trudges on. As old-looking later teens they hardly look like the cute fourteen year-olds they are suppose to be. And Potter and Weasely, with their ever-lengthening scraggly hairstyles, are beginning to look more like hippies that would appear just as comfortable with a marijuana joint in their hands as a magic wand.<br/><br/>For kids only. I give this three stars only in deference to my children. Somehow, the film does manage to keep their attention, which is what terrifies me the most about these HP movies (Sorry, guys...love ya!)"

You know the sort of stuff: ''Not even the most Powerful and Evil Magician in the World can defeat a Mother's Love' (eh, why not? I thought he was the most Powerful and Evil Magician in the World, etc) The 'kids' are now reaching adolescence and so are sloppy, charmless, foul mouthed  but they still can't act. In one scene, the guesting Bulgarian Cup team come marching into the hall, tight formation, disciplined action  in reality they would have slaughtered our sloppy Brits in the tournament, and perhaps that would have made a better picture.<br/><br/>Ah well. I really did like the last Potter though, even though they are all the same formula  that had a foreign Director who was obviously a Craftsman and an Artist, and it had a script that didn't seem like it was trying to cram an entire ludicrously unedited novel into a limited running time.<br/><br/>Probably the trouble with this entry it is that it is the first in the series directed by an Englishman, and in that chippy way English artists of whatever stripe have, he most likely wanted to eliminate anything in the content that might be construed as simultaneously Charming and English."

","having read and re read all of the HP books, I was dying to see the Goblet of Fire on the big screen. The previous movie adaptations had, I thought, at least captured what made the HP series and franchise special and quintessentially British; the whole getting ready for school thing, the first day of school, the sorting issue etc. In essence, the whole feeling of British boarding school uniqueness and stiffness, coupled with the humour and originality of Hogwarts being a school for magic.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire the movie failed on many counts to deliver this, instead diving straight into big screen action (massive CGI scenery of the Quidditch World Cup, sadly reduced to 15 seconds on screen - the almost immediate first Triwizard task of the dragons), missing out on the subtleties of school life entirely.<br/><br/>There are so many scenes and incidents left out from the book which affect the relationship between the principal characters that it appeared that the movie was to be totally centred around 3 major scenes; the dragon, the underwater task and the graveyard, with no thought for tying them together or building any further relationship between Harry, Ron and Hermione in the meantime.<br/><br/>Without having read the book, I would have found this movie, as a movie, totally without focus. As a movie about fantasy characters fighting dragons and mermaids it wasn't the best you will see. Without the inherent magic - the setting of the British boarding school with its quirks - the movie falls on its face badly"
"Deacon_Frost8","1","3","5","5 January 2006"," I don't think so
","I can say some with certainty that this movie was as faithful as a married woman in a roadside motel. There were no explanations as to why certain things happen or didn't happen. Other things are left out completely which is understandable given the size of the book, but in this case not really. There were several holes in the storyline. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were as stiff and bland as ever. Plus the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore has proved to be the biggest blunder in the Harry Potter series so far. He's too energetic and he doesn't have any gravitas whatsoever. After GOF, I don't know if I want to see the next one.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge HP fan. Been following the books since they first came out, have read each of them 3 times, and have seen each corresponding film in the theater, and I am very disappointed with the way this one turned out.<br/><br/>Mike Newell did to Harry Potter, what Joel Schumacher did to Batman with Batman Forever and Batman & Robin and look how they turned out."

","Direction of the movie is quite pathetic. It looks as if we are watching a compilation of trailers. The focus of the movie is completely missing. The sets in the movie were spectacular and the build up to the each of the three tasks was alright but the tasks themselves looked pretty ordinary. It seems that they had big plans for each of the tasks but then had to cut them short because either of the money constraint or time constraint. One of major disappointment for me was the entry of Voldemort. One would expect that such a great moment in the story should have been made to stand out and have an impact on the audience but for me it looked ordinary just as any other scene in the movie, there wasn't enough thrill in that scene. At the end of movie, i was thinking of what have i seen in last two and half hours. I can just sum it up in 4-5 sentences. I have already read the book so i knew what is happening, but i doubt if somebody who hasn't read this book would have had any clue of what's happening in the movie. It looks as if they have tried to put in little too much within a short span of time. Underwater task is the only one which has done justice to the book. The acting of the child actors has improved considerably. But the charismatic Dumbledore was missing. He looked vulnerable. He should have looked calm and composed as he is always.

Like the dragon fight and the ballroom could have been cut in half. The left out the whole part of Barty SR house elf and the end was a bit of a let down. Also left out the part about Rita Skeeter being able to transform into a bug and spy on people and when Hagrid asked Madam Maxim if she was half giantess.

"TheNorthernMonkee","6","3","5","25 November 2005"," inconsistent adaptation
","SPOILERS So here we go, the fourth of the series. It's four years since Daniel Radcliffe first put on the trademark Harry Potter glasses, and each year the series has gotten increasingly dark and more mature. Unfortunately though, as the films have progressed, as has J.K.Rowling's ego. Creating a mammoth book, there was no way that the Goblet could ever be properly transfered to the cinema, and it shows. At times rushed and at times slow, the film never really feels comfortable and the direction of Mike Newell leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>It's Harry's forth year at Hogwarts, and it's the year of the great Tri-Wizard Tournament. Drawn out of the hat as a mysterious, under-age forth contender, Harry (Radcliffe) finds himself forced to undertake rigorous challenges whilst simultaneously dealing with typical teenage problems, not least his best friend Ron's (Rupert Grint) jealousy.<br/><br/>Since the source material is so overwhelmingly long, it comes as no surprise that this adaptation struggles at times. Whilst we are instantly thrown into the action with a ridiculously brief Quidditch World Cup, events slow to a crawl halfway through as certain scenes are stretched out to unbelievable lengths. Gone is the smooth feel of previous films, and instead we have what feels like a taster to the inevitable extended edition (due Christmas 2006 perhaps?). It's annoying that this has happened, but we have to question how much of this is to blame with the writers of the script, and how much is instead put at the feet of Rowling. By the time this book was released, the film series was well underway, so it's hardly like she was unaware that the story would become this media too. It's weird that she'd write such a ridiculously large story, but for so many it is the favourite book, so perhaps she deserves praise after all.<br/><br/>Script and plot speed aside, there are other flaws with the film. Like the rest of the series, the three main young stars still aren't what you would consider to be decent actors. Whilst Radcliffe, Grint and Emma Watson are all improving as the films progress, let's not fool ourselves by pretending that they are anywhere near acceptable standards. If anything, by the series ends, if all three see it out, we might finally see them reach a worthy standard to do more serious films. Ultimately though, it remains to be seen.<br/><br/>The special effects are also a bit of an inconsistent mistake here. Whilst nobody should see fault in the magnificent scenes involving Harry and the dragon, so much else in the film feels awkward, rushed, and awkwardly artificial. It feels like the entire budget was blown on that one scene, and whether the scene is amazing or not, that doesn't excuse the weakness elsewhere.<br/><br/>Mike Newell's direction too is hopeless and inadequate. Many of us held high hopes for the first British director in the series, but he lets us down massively. With disastrous camera shots and some equally fallible lighting, he never seems to fully grasp the mood of the film and as a result the film fails.<br/><br/>For all the complaints, this is still another Harry Potter film. Thousands will rush to the cinema to see it, and so they should, but it is a crushing disappointment. Arguably on a par with the second instalment, it never lives up to the hype that the book creates. With a story cropped to fit into a two and a half hour slot, the plot changes speed at ridiculous times and it's difficult to really get absorbed into the story. The third film was able to engulf the audience and really make you forget where you are. In this case you find yourself at times actually wondering what time it is and looking at the audience. It's a shame this has happened, and not something which was expected. With bad direction, mediocre acting and some woeful special effects, the film really isn't the masterpiece that it should be. People will still go to see it, but truthfully you are better off with the third chapter. A less than magical experience."

","In the 4th installment of J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series, Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") takes over as director for Alfonso Cuarόn. 10 minutes into the movie, at the Quidditch World Cup, it's obvious that Newell is aiming to make the movie scarier than the other three, when we see a group of guys in skeleton masks and hoods walking through camp lighting everything on fire. This is most likely what earned the movie its PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) wakes up from a dream of an old man who gets murdered by Wormtail, Voldermort's assistant. Harry wakes up, and he's at Ron Weasly's house. This is one part I don't like, because I enjoy the parts where Harry is at his aunt and uncle's house. Right away, he's at school. In the book, this is about 10 chapters long. As soon as he's at school, the other two schools, Beuxbatons and Durmstrang, arrive. Right after that, we hear about the Tri-wizard tournament, which, in the book, took much longer and was developed better.<br/><br/>Most of the stuff I look forward to in the other movies, such as the House Sorting, and the Dursley's, and the banquet at the beginning of the year, were all left out, because the Tournament takes up most of the movie. One of the most popular characters, Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), is barely in this movie at all. Some characters new to the story are Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy), the representative in the tournament from Beuxbatons, Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) the representative from Durmstrang, and Professor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson), a new, extremely paranoid teacher. Also, Katie Leung plays Cho Chang, and Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion.<br/><br/>There are two problems with basing a movie on a book. One is, people who have the books memorized will be upset that the movie doesn't follow the book exactly. If it had, it would've been about 8 hours long. Already, at 2 hours and 37 minutes, it's much longer than average. The second problem is, if you read the book, then go see the movie, there's no surprise. You know what's going to happen, so you spend the time waiting for the end, and you don't enjoy the movie as much."
"ccm043","8","3","5","24 November 2005"," Not too bad.
","This is my favorite of the four movies so far. The pace is brisk and keeps the action moving along nicely. Thank God the director realized that we don't need so much unnecessary exposition. Although that stuff might work in the book, for a movie, it just sets it up to be long and boring. It's already assumed that we know who Voldemort is, that they live in a magical place, that the students go to class. There is little time spent on whimsy and the wonders of the magical world. There isn't even a scene with the Dursleys. And that's perfectly fine. You shouldn't be watching this movie if you haven't seen the previous ones. Whatever exposition is given, is for anything we don't know about and the plot itself.<br/><br/>Another good point is the acting. All three of the leads are doing a great job. I'm glad that they stuck with Ratcliffe, Watson, and Grint. They really get the characters across nicely. Also, the new professors and students taking place in the Tri-Wizard tournament are perfectly cast (and from what I understand, the actors are from the same areas as the characters they portray). The new Dumbledore is adequate, though not as convincing to me as the original (of course, that can't be helped). And of course, you still get Hagrid, and, perfectly cast, Snape.<br/><br/>The plot is engaging and mysterious. However, I couldn't help but get the feeling that if I had not read the book beforehand, I might be a bit lost. Still, the mysterious portions are done very well, and I think would keep anybody guessing and surprised.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING: I only had two problems with the movie. First, the beginning rushes too much. The characters are supposed to go to the Quidditch World Cup, but there is no footage of it. Yeah, I know, we've seen loads of Quidditch games through the first three movies, but it would have been nice to see the big one, especially since it's the reason everybody went to the stadium in the first place. Unfortunately, it seems the Quidditch World Cup had to be sacrificed to get in more plot.<br/><br/>Second, there was not enough character development, especially for the other three witches and wizards in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. I mean, Cedric barely interacts with Harry at all. You'd think that they would give some more characterization for somebody who is killed off. And Krum and Fleur aren't that much better.<br/><br/>END SPOILER WARNING All in all, I would say if you liked the first three movies, see this."
"terryl2","8","3","5","23 November 2005"," The Best So Far But no Longer Artistic
","This Movie is an Amazing movie and i recommend it for everyone. However it has had 3 movies in front of it who have made almost all of the design choices for it. the film future for the potter line is fairly well set in stone. The looks of the sets and costumes will not change in the future which stops this moving from fulfilling its artistic potential, but that is problematic of all book-movie conversations. What is left to be artistic is the directorial view (i.e. camera motions, filters, lighting levels, staging etc.) this film (as well as Prisoner of Azkaban) is darker than the rest, which sets it apart and gives it it's ""unqiue factor,"" that is the element that sets it apart from other films of the same type. most interesting to me is the study one can do in plot line. if you have not yet read the books and you are a artistic individual i would recommend you not read any more books till you have seen the movies of them. to many people this is an unconceivable thought but please listen to my logic. first off i have read the first 3 books and am reading the 4th now. every time you see one of these films there is always going to be someone there who read the book first and these individuals all sing the same chorus of ""they cut so much out!!"" this is true. However if you ask those who have only seen the movies they will say they understand the harry potter plot line. that is because while Rawlings books are very entertaining and have many many side stories and interesting facts about her wizard world, her book s are still largely ""fluff."" and that is why i made my recommendation. you can see these movies make coherent plot lines out of these books and not included every detail. looking in-depth at these changes after you have seen the movie makes both the book and the movie better in my opinion. this study in plot analysis will give you a more keen mind to what makes a story and what doesn't. i encourage everyone to try this, if you still can, and your movie going/book reading experiences will become much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>For those who are curious, i suggest seeing the movies first then reading because obviously the books offer more information and when seeing the movie it can become more difficult to keep the two separate in your mind. if you start with the smaller and add to it things will stay more organized and you will be able to flush out Rawlings style, making the books more enjoyable. thanks you."
"paul-bissette","9","3","5","23 November 2005"," Harry comes of age
","Like many others who have left their comments here, I feel this is the best Harry Potter treatment to date.<br/><br/>Although fantastic to an HP fan, I suspect that anyone NOT familiar with the HP world may find it confusing. It does jump around quite a bit and (I suspect) we are encouraged to fill in the gaps from our knowledge of the books.<br/><br/>OK. With that (very) small gripe out of the way I can only say what I brilliant job all have done with this movie. The methods used to show the beginning of Ron's feelings for Hermione were great (of course we can thank the source material here, JK wrote it that way). Also Hermione looked pretty fab too - Emma Watson really is starting to grow up all at once.<br/><br/>Special effects? Yep they were there but not once did I feel like saying 'wow, what a great effect'. Basically all the effects were in the right place and only served to enhance the movie proper.<br/><br/>Yes, the film was long (2.5 hours) but then consider that the book was 3/4 the length of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and that it took Peter Jackson 3 movies to cover that ground (leaving out a similar amount to that left out of Goblet of Fire in the bargain) and I think you'll see why I rate this the best HP yet.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, then do so.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the others, then where have you been???? If you haven't read the books then do so (although Order of the Phoenix was very long and dragged a bit in places compared to the rest).<br/><br/>Everyone loves HP (it seems) and the reason is obvious - Everything about HP and the HP universe smacks of magic!"
"frogger612","8","3","5","22 November 2005"," Niiiiice....
","Probably the best installment so far.<br/><br/>The film seems more professional than the last three--very well done in all technical aspects. The actors are progressing nicely and I believe all gave their best performances to date.<br/><br/>The action sequences (dragon, maze) are well done--nice CGI work and camera work--really keeps you on the edge of your seat. However, this is why the movie earned a PG-13 rating. If your child has read the books, they know what to expect and I shouldn't worry about the rating. The images can be graphic (they show Harry's arm being cut open, a character being killed at the end, and Voldemort returning) but if the kids have read the books, it shouldn't bother them too much. However, if your child hasn't read the books, I would recommend caution. The last half-hour is rather tense and scary and deals with 'Dark Magic.' Make sure he/she is ready for all that.<br/><br/>Although, the last half-hour of the film is what really makes it great, I think. Wonderful emotions and intense action and horror make for a compelling climax.<br/><br/>I've got only a few nitpicks--the film seems slightly rushed, particularly at the beginning. Also, some of the information necessary to understanding the whole story is thrown in once and if you don't catch it, you'll be lost. Pay attention well to catch all the information that's thrown at you--it's essential.<br/><br/>If you've not seen the other movies/read the books, please don't jump in on this one--you'll be confused, I assure you. Watch the others first.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're a Potter fan, you'll love the action and excitement in this one, as well as a healthy dose of humor and romance. Watch for all the movie's subtleties to really enjoy it. Have fun!"
"doofy-5","5","3","5","22 November 2005"," Disappointing, too much missing.
","I wonder if they thought we wouldn't notice? Where were Dobby and Winky? Winky was an important part of the film especially regarding Barty Crouch Jnr. I was also quite disappointed that in the pensive scene the trial was never properly explained, and other characters that will become important in future were completely missed. Hagrid is back as caretaker and not care of magical creatures teacher as he should be, and the part regarding his parentage is glossed over completely. Blink and you missed it. The annoying Rita Skeeter was so insignificant i wonder why she was there. My personal opinion is that it was maybe too big a book to take on, there is really just too much missing. Finally the maze, where were the magical obstacles to overcome? Agreed a talking sphinx could be troublesome, but what about Hagrids Blast ended skrewts? Surely someone could have come up with something !"

","I have every potter movie and have seen this movie twice already. Yes the writers left out a lot, don't forget it is a movie and every book to movie there is stuff always left out. J.K. wrote 700+ pages and the movie was only 150 or so. I believe this movie is just as great as the other three, if not better. It really hit the most important parts of the book. I think that in this movie all the characters became real, and for once Harry was able to see and speak to his parents and to know that they are always there. Yes the book was better every book is always going to be better then the movies. I say that I was very happy with this movie and can't wait for the next ones."
"degrazio7","5","3","5","19 November 2005"," Thrilling at times but a big disappointment regarding details
","I am beginning to wonder if this movie franchise is becoming ""the thing to do"" directorially speaking concerning the last two HP ""efforts"". I feel that the dignity of the series is getting lost in dollars and cents. Watching GOF, I could not help but feel as though I had grabbed onto a port-key and was whisked forward at breakneck speed, seeing one scene painfully blurred into another. The book (which is a favorite in the series so far for many, myself included)is very detailed and I am sure anyone would sit through a three hour GOF to see on screen what their mind's eye saw as they read the book. Not that another half hour would cover everything in the book but at least the viewer might not feel as though they've been shot out of a cannon landing head first in a soggy Quidditch field. The scope of the GOF story is a tremendous epic and I agree with many fans that way too many vital details have been left out completely. This is a shame because many of the subplots lead into the next story. Most disturbing, especially if you are a fan of the book is the fact that some of what is shown on screen has been altered unnecessarily. For what purpose? Yet, the feel of this story and the series does come across on screen. <br/><br/>The movie soundtrack, music composed by Patrick Doyle, is utterly spectacular. However, John William's haunting HP theme(Hedwig's)is only hinted at in GOF. A sign of innocence lost? The theme, which we've all come to love seemed to frame and shape the previous stories. Now it appears as though it has been flushed in Moaning Myrtle's toilet and lodged helplessly somewhere in the u-bend. Can we get a plunger please, resurrect it, and include the theme in the next HP installment!?!?!?!? <br/><br/>Dan, Rupert, and Emma were great on screen. It is interesting to see their acting ability begin to really soar. The trio are definitely fun to watch as they help draw us deeper into the story. I agree with others in that Dumbledore did not appear steadfast and in control as in the previous movies. Yet, script aside, Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is great. The other regular's were just as good in their roles. I especially enjoyed Alan Rickman's Professor Snape. Rickman, a truly terrific actor, took a shaved down part and worked it beautifully. His intolerance for the trio keeps getting better and better with each movie. Miranda Richardson did justice to her Rita Skeeter character. Her role in the film was short but Miranda delivered her part flawlessly.<br/><br/>The Tri-Wizard Tournament which is the centerpiece of the story, translated from book to screen fairly well. The first task (which by the way, that Hungarian Horntail just may be the nastiest dragon on screen to date) was certainly thrilling. Yes, she did break free of her chain, contrary to the book, however in this case, I felt that her freedom to fly and chase Harry around the grounds and the rooftops of the castle itself only added to the tension of Harry's suicidal task. The second underwater task was very well done. Love those merpeople! The gillyweed, which helps Harry to breathe underwater was not given to Harry by Dobby the house elf but by Neville Longbottom which in turn was orchestrated by Barty Crouch Jr. A slight twist from the book. Speaking of house elves...none to be found in this massively trimmed movie version of the book. The third task was somewhat disappointing as there were no Hagrid raised Blast Ended Skrewts, Spiders or Sphinx to thwart the Champions efforts to succeed in getting the cup. <br/><br/>The cemetery scene in which Harry (and the viewers) finally see Voldemort's rebirth to true form is truly frightening and definitely creepy. Ralph Fiennes brings the biggest literary baddie in history to life in an elegant yet truly evil vision. The makeup for his character is remarkable, yet not overdone. <br/><br/>If you have not read the book, you will not fall under the spell of so many who expect more from the script and direction and will enjoy the film for what it is. For those who really love the GOF book, you may feel a bit like Sally in ""It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"" who trusted Linus and missed a night of Halloween fun because she sat waiting for the Great Pumpkin, who of course never came. And like Sally you may feel slighted and ripped off for waiting on a movie that could not deliver all the goods."
"arcxer","7","3","5","21 November 2005"," Enjoyment level lower then expected
","Well, it looks like WB decided to save some money on production of this one. They probably thought: ""Hey, the fans are addicted already, they'll go see it anyway."" So, they cut some corners. What a shame! It is understandable that the book is too big to fit into one movie, but cutting plot lines and abbreviating should still produce logically complete picture. But this one -- looks like they overdid it with the cutting. It looked like they made it a set of visual illustrations for the book. Spectacular, but incomplete and quite incomprehensible without reading it.<br/><br/>For example, what that with Barty Crouch Sr.? So, HP found him in the woods, either dead or unconscious, and then what? Did he say to anybody about it or just left him there? The next scene Harry walks into Dumbledore's office like nothing happened.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm little disappointed. It felt like it was too short, just sort of extended teaser. Where's the real movie then?"
"Lauranaej","4","3","5","21 November 2005"," huge let down
","I thought this movie was terrible. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I had a lot of hope for this movie, but I was greatly disappointed. I felt that the whole movie was rushed, there was no time for the trio (Harry, Ron, Hermione) to bond at all or discuss stuff like the usually do. I thought that the movie made Harry out to be a blubbering idiot. In the books, Harry actually spent a lot of time practicing spells and learning new ones to prepare, while in the movie, it showed nothing of what Harry actually did to get through the Triwizard Tournament. The maze for the Tournament was terrible! Where were the challenges that lurked around every corner? Where was wit needed to reach the center? All they did was run around to escape the ""blowing wind"" and ""roots."" Terrible! Dumbledore's character in the movie seemed much more sinister and downright mean. I never got that impression from the books at all! Where are they getting that?? Dumbledore never yelled at Harry in the books, i was quite shocked in the movie. There were good parts to the movie, special effects were amazing and i loved the design... But when comparing this to the book, I thought the movie was a huge let down."
"deowen-1","5","3","5","20 November 2005"," Wait for the rental
","I felt everyone did a bang-up job except screenwriter Steven Kloves. His adaption of a great story stunk! If you are a HP fan, disappoint will be yours. The Movie itself was beautiful to watch. The special effects were spectacular. The music for the most part was boring. As I watched the movie, I felt as though I was an unwanted guest to a best friend's party; Warner Bros took my gift (money) and then proceeded to rush me out the door - the movie rushed through the story; thank you Mr. Kloves. Show your support for this review by boycotting the theaters. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is not a terrific movie. I suggest you save yourself some money and wait for it to hit as a rental."
"jmbwithcats","8","3","5","20 November 2005"," Harry Potter, maturing but not quite scripted
","For my self, I did feel the movie had some scripting problems. Dragon scene and some cohesive structuring near the end could have been better conceived, but overall it was a truly enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter story matures with every film, as it should, the only thing I did not really like was that each test Harry underwent, he did not seem to solve on his own through any ingenium of his own, except for near the end when he has the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade-style choose loyalty or greed, and he chooses wisely. I felt they could have structured those tests to make Harry appear a little more competent, though I suppose it fits his character. He is supposed to intellectually mundane, and not some standout genius or spectacular type except by birthright.<br/><br/>For this I find the story very nice because it adds complexity to an otherwise straightforward story, and thus takes on a feel we all can relate to.<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun with the movie, it had some nice dialog, plenty of different experiences to enjoy, and great effects for wallpaper making on the computer, which I love."
"Scaramouche2004","7","3","5","20 November 2005"," Harry Potter's star fades slightly
","With Goblet of Fire, being my favourite book of the series, I had been waiting anxiously, perhaps a little too impatiently, for the release of this film.<br/><br/>GoF, was the first of Rowlings novels to reach an epic length, as Harry, Ron and Hermione witness glory and destruction at the Quidditch World Cup Final, battle through the dangerous tasks of the Tri-Wizard Tornammment, and face the harsh and tragic realities of Lord Voldermort's ultimate return and the re-awakening of the Death-Eaters.<br/><br/>With such source material I was anticipating a likewise epic movie, yet I cannot help but feel that for the first time a Harry Potter movie has failed to live up to expectations, as its adaption from page to film is poor to say the least.<br/><br/>I think the people in the Harry Potter camp have made a serious error in believing they can successfully adapt a book of such size and content into a two and a half hour movie. Big screen adaptations of other world renowned novels such as Lord of the Rings, and Gone with the Wind, have all benefited from extended run times and I see no reason why the Harry Potter movies should be an exception. It's still over 150 minutes long, but in my opinion, to have given true justice to the plot and the characters, another hour was needed....at least. By overlooking this they have not given the movie the scope and depth it deserved and anyone who has read the book, will probably find this film, patchy and disjointed.<br/><br/>For instance, why show scenes of the Quidditch World Cup and not have any footage of the actual match? The chapters covering the event in the original book, were exciting and dramatic, yet Mike Newell and his team, have completely ignored them, opting instead to only feature the the opening ceremony as to serve as an introduction to fellow Tri-Wizard champion Viktor Krum. However when Krum's character is given so little screen time or development for the remainder of the film the scene becomes redundant and pointless in hindsight.<br/><br/>Even five minutes of match play would have been welcome, especially focusing on 'The Wronski Feint' a daring Quidditch manoeuvre performed by Krum, which Harry could then have used later in the film in the dramatic aerial chase with the Dragon.<br/><br/>Also the Tri-Wizard Tornament itself failed to thrill on the screen as much as it did in the book, especially the third, final and supposedly most dangerous task, where the four champions are sent into a deadly maze full of obstacles and creatures, to find the much coveted prize of the Tri-Wizard Cup itself. These scenes were empty and shameful, as Harry didn't come across one obstacle or test, one Boggart or monster. Apart from saving a fellow contestant, he just seemed to just walk in and find the Cup with minimal effort.<br/><br/>Also missing were several supporting characters from the original book like the two house elves Dobby and Winky, Ludo Bagman a former England International Quidditch Player who now earns a living in the Magical Games and Sports Department at the Ministry of Magic, and most notably The Dursley's, who are not even given a mention. There is also no mention of Hermiones new pet project, S.P.E.W. which in the book lends itself to some comic and exciting confrontations between her and Ron, confrontations which would have transferred to the screen well, adding further and much needed depth to their love/hate relationship.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after giving Sir Micheal Gambon benefit of the doubt in Prisoner of Azkaban purely because he wasn't given a great amount of screen time, I feel Goblet of Fire does nothing to warm me to his portrayal of Dumbledore. In Gambon's Dumbledore, we see nothing to make us believe he is a truly great all-powerful wizard. We cannot take seriously that he is the only one Lord Voldermort ever feared. Gambon's Dumbledore, loses his temper, he shakes small boys in fits of frenzied anxiety, he seems befuddled and confused at almost every turn. All these traits were not apparent in Richard Harris' portrayal, and in the first two movies, Dumbledore gives of a truly powerful glow, the embodiment of great courage, strength and intelligence and a rational calm and ready wit, despite the dangers and perils he faced. Gambon needs to adopt these qualities for the remaining movies if he is to convince Potterites that he is the greatest wizard that ever lived.<br/><br/>One of the redeeming scenes however, is the graveyard scene. This film is exactly as I pictured it in my mind while reading, and Ralph Fiennes turns in a wonderful film stealing performance as the newly reborn snake-like Voldermort. It was the climax of the book and a scene that could not be cut, edited or glanced over no matter how hard they tried. In fact its the only part of the original book, which seems to have remained unchanged, and appears almost word for word on the screen as it did on the page.<br/><br/>Although it looks like I have out and out panned this film, I feel it fair to say that despite the inaccuracies and poor adaptation, it is not without excitement, and it is still very entertaining. The performances are excellent and although they could have done so much more, it still stands up a pretty good movie, although undoubtedly the weakest of the series thus far."
"cstewart27","2","3","5","19 November 2005"," JUST OKAY - ADULT REVIEW: Movie is disjointed and missing too much from the book to be AWESOME like the first three
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire missed the mark in so many ways that I must say I was GREATLY DISAPPOINTED. We paid to see each of the previous Harry Potter movies at the cinema 2-3 times each when they were showing. There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to go see this movie more than once. I am sure we will purchase the DVD when it is released, but it will only be to complete the series.<br/><br/>As an adult, I feel that the fourth book is key so to much of what occurs in the fifth and sixth book. The previous movies cut out portions of the previous books but still came across as AWESOME. My daughter (now a high school senior) is devoted to JK Rowling and the HP books 150%. So much that my husband and I have involved ourselves in the HP magic just to stay in touch. We have enjoyed the first three movies just as much as she did - they were all totally AWESOME. Given all of the hype that preceded this movie, I was really expecting it to be just as AWESOME as the first three movies. This movie was definitely DISAPPOINTING. The technical details that make up the movie may be great and wonderful (are they?) but I was expecting a Harry Potter movie, not technical details.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING There was so much focus on Voldemort and most of the portions of the movie where Voldemort is involved make up the best parts of the movie. The movie starts off wrong by adding Barty Crouch Jr to the opening Voldemort scene at the Riddle mansion. There are no house elves in the movie at all. Rita Skeeter is introduced in the movie, but the majority of the story line on Rita Skeeter is missing from the movie. Sirius is touched on in the movie, but his relationship that continues with Harry is basically missing from the movie. The three tasks in the tri-wizard tournament are presented but they are deviated from in so many ways that the movie does not accurately represent what actually occurs in the book --> it doesn't even come close. The dragon breaks lose and plays King Kong on the castle with Harry (how creative is that???) And what ever happened to the horntail dragon - it just disappeared! BOTTOM LINE - The movie is barely just okay. It had to be made to get us to the next - but this movie should have been what the fourth book in the series is: MY PERSONNEL FAVORITE - this movie is so far off the book and it is so disjointed that I have no need to see it again.<br/><br/>The only chance of redeeming this movie will be with the DVD release, but consider what extras where provided in the previous DVD releases I don't expect to see much improvement. SO SAD."
"shivanideshpande","5","3","5","19 November 2005"," Has the Director ever read the book?....
","As an avid HP fan I must say that the movie was huge let down. I mean the director or the scriptwriter...have completely missed the point of the book. The book is not only about how Harry wins the Triwizard tournament or how Lord Voldermont returns....yet it seems as though thats all the movie is about. All the interesting interactions of the characters have been cut for adding unnecessary mindless (however spectacular) action. The movie is VERY CHOPPY and never allows the viewer time to actually register any of the events. Though overall the movie was not at all what I expected here are some of the things that I really hated: Cheesy dialogs like Harry saying ""I love magic"" when he sees the tent for the Quidditch world cup.<br/><br/>Added footage to given to the first task, where as the tricks that Harry played on the dragon in the book seem so smart and exciting, the entire chase of the dragon in the movie seemed only aimed at showing off some special effects. Somebody needs to remind the makers of the movies that the fans do not go to watch HP movies to see a bunch of special effects.<br/><br/>The makers of the movie seem to have completely missed the point of the entire Ron-Hermoine scene at the end of the Yule ball. The reason why Hermoine is upset with Ron is more that he does not ask her for the ball himself and not so much that he spoils her evening as they have shown. Also, the way Ron keeps hinting at Hermoine never being able to get a date was stupid and very cruel, something Ron in the book is definitely not.<br/><br/>Harry actually tells Sirius and Dumbledore about his dream in detail, whereas in the book he seems to forget the details and only tells Sirius that his scar hurt. Also I would have liked to see Dobby and Winky and the whole SPEW angle of the film because, it shows Hermoine as someone who thinks of more things than just boys and balls.<br/><br/>Also, why does Hermoine keep hugging and kissing Harry unnecessarily?...I mean whats the point of putting things that are NOT in the book? If the makers already had less time to show all the things in the book why add such stupid irrelevant comments and scenes just to earn a few laughs? I agree, that the movie is finally made so that it sells, but I think that it could have been made into a much better movie by sticking VERY closely to the book and making it a bit longer. (its only 2 1/2 hrs...we cud watch more) I think the director did not understand that the whole point of HP books is not the sense of adventure alone but showing the existence of a whole different world with real people albeit with magical abilities and their struggles. If he did, he would not have made a half action half comedy movie with no time for any of the characters to really grow on the viewers.<br/><br/>However, I must be fair and add that it is not ALL bad.<br/><br/>The entire last sequence from the start of the 3rd task to Moody being captured was very well done. And I must say that Dan Radcliffe's performance during this entire sequence was absolutely brilliant!! The second task was also shown quite well and the underwater sequences are very pleasing and they mostly stick to the book.<br/><br/>Also, some of the humor was quite good and I guess the non HP-book fans really needed that kind of break.<br/><br/>But still I would say that this was the worst Harry Potter film till date and I am GLAD that they have a new director for the 5th book. (Someone please tell him to STICK to the book as far as possible and somebody please tell J.K Rowling to make sure her books are not turned into more soul-less movies like this one.)"
"motorolatimex","4","3","5","18 November 2005"," Somewhat disappointing (Read only if you have read the book)
","After reading the book I was very interested in seeing the Goblet of Fire, but as a fan of the books there were many things that were left out which are important to the story. Anyone following the movies only, will have problems following along as they move so quickly. You do not have a chance to enjoy the type of depth that the previous movies portrayed. For example, during the first 10 minutes, you go from Harry seeing the vision of the caretaker, to waking up in a bed at the weasly's. Then after being woke up they are out the door and going to the port-key. The Dursly's and Weasly's are to me an important part of tying the movies together and giving us a home base if you will. Compared to the book, you miss the weasly's trip via flu powder to get Harry and getting stuck in the Dursely's fireplace, and it exploding to reveal the Weasly's. And what about Dudley, eating that thing that makes his tongue get extremely long by one of Ron's brothers and then the showdown where Auther Weasly tells off the Dursleys. That scene would have been most enjoyable and would add a little comedy as well. <br/><br/>Granted there are some very funny moment's in the movie, but overall the movie in did not stick to the book. For instance, the book mentioned that Dobby was the one that gave Harry the Gilly weed which is stole from Snape. At the time, when the Dark Mark was conjured, winky was the one caught with Harry's wand (while sitting by winky Barty Crouch's house Elf near an empty seat during the quiditch championship match) behind a tree. In the book there was some time, for the students to settle before the other schools showed up, as this is not as important, but the book added tension to the fact that something was going to happen as Howarts this year that has never happened before. Ron brought his dress robes from home and did not arrive as a package. <br/><br/>As annoying as Rita Skeeter was, we did not get to see how much trouble she caused, and how Hermione got her revenge. Sirrus showed up only once when in fact he help Harry much more, and Dumbledor just appears not to be who he is in the book. He is easy to get upset, and does not have the mystical sense of power that is portrayed of him in the book. Basically, we no longer have the same sense that you really know the characters anymore. Regarding the end of the movie, the real talk that Dumbledore had with Harry did not come close to what really took place, which was very important to the story, and helped to transition us to leave the world of Harry Potter until the next book. This movie went so quickly that you had no time to enjoy any aspect for long. <br/><br/>I understand that they could not do everything that was in the book, but I feel that more care should have been taken in what was chosen to be in the movie, and that it should be more true to the feel of the previous movies. There is a lot of hype about how scary this movie is. My six year old went, and was more afraid of the last movie than she was this one. I will keep my fingers crossed for the next one."
"Erowyn","7","3","5","19 November 2005"," does not do the book justice
","While I did enjoy the movie it did the book no justice. There were 5 major characters who were almost completely left out of the movie, there was no lead in at the end for the next movie, they tied up no loose ends, and excuse me by why are the Weasley twins in classes with Harry, Ron and Hermione? There were so many things that they could have done better that would have only taken moments... and although it added humor the dance lesson with Professor McGonagall was completely unnecessary... I was extremely disappointed with this movie by the end. I'm glad I saw it because it is still after all a Harry Potter movie... and I guess if you've never read the books it was probably a really great movie with a really great story but for someone who knows what happens all the twists and turns of the book this movie really left something to be desired... I don't feel it did Rowling justice... I really don't especially compared to the first 3."
"thisvezis4ever","8","3","5","17 November 2005"," If u love the books, the film will annoy you.
","Its 3am and i have just got back from seeing Harry Potter 4! I was impressed and i certainly enjoyed it thought the beginning did annoy me a little. occasionally it was more like a trailer, jumping from scene to scene with no connection or explanation. however the characters seem to have developed their own laid back personalities so i found them much more likable. this film has only two modes, dark and funny. both were spectacular. two and a half hours whizzed by, i felt liked i'd been in there for minutes. the only thing i will say is that for those who are big fans of the books, you may be disappointed. the film only bases itself loosely on the books as they had to cut so many of the sub plots out, even those connected to the main plot. either way i spent a very enjoyable and emotional time in the cinema, well worth the money i paid!"
"Quentintarantado","8","4","8","16 November 2005"," Quite good adaptation of my fave book
","Goblet of Fire is my favorite of the Potter series because he's clearly out of his depth in the tournament but bit by bit he survives. I can certainly relate to that.<br/><br/>I like the pruning done to shorten the film. I would have liked to see those pruned moments if possible, but I think what's left is pretty darn good. It's not art, but it's very solid entertainment.<br/><br/>All in all I'm eighty percent happy with the film (would want it longer, but as it is, I enjoyed it very much).<br/><br/>The things I love about Goblet: how they continued the look of Cuaron's Hogwarts, that covered walkway, the mountains and lakes. I love Brendan Gleeson's Moody, and I love the new battle in the first trial. I also like the interaction between the kids now, they seem to act like real British kids, with their idioms. After all, an American has been writing the script. I think Newell is emphasizing the Britishness of everything.<br/><br/>I also love the moments given to most of the characters. They may not have WRITTEN lines, but they do have memorable scenes, like the Weasley twins, or Cedric Digory's moments when he shows he's not just a handsome hero but actually a decent guy, or Snape pulling back his sleeves shortly before reprimanding Potter and Weasley. I think these are Newell's specialty.<br/><br/>Some minor complaints: though I praise the movie on its choices of what to omit, I do complain about the pace; it's just too quick. Yes, I ""get"" most of it and I am entertained and not helplessly confused, but everything seems to be such wonderful and yummy eye-candy, and even some of the more dramatic moments are quite good, that it makes me want to slow things down and savor. I'd understand scarfing down a fast food burger to get back to work ASAP, but it doesn't make sense to swallow whole a Chateaubriand and that's what this movie makes me want to do. I wouldn't mind another thirty minutes, honestly. <br/><br/>It's going to take some time before I can decide which I like better, Prisoner of Azkaban or Goblet of Fire. I like the bold direction Prisoner had taken the series, and to me, Goblet only seems to continue it, though Goblet does this well. I like the feeling that Prisoner is less ""stuffed"" and ""rushed"" than Goblet, though Goblet's story is my favorite of the books (and I still prefer ""Goblet""'s story even in the movie version over ""Azkaban""'s movie version of the story). <br/><br/>About the next few films, I like Order of the Phoenix the least, but I'm looking forward to the adaptation of the Half Blood Prince, and more Alan Rickman, yay!"
"mseal","4","12","34","18 November 2005"," Corniest so far
","I saw the movie yesterday at 6:20. The books get progressively darker. The movies do not. Too much was cut. The plot was all but missing. If I hadn't read the book I know I would not have followed the story. It's not a complete waste of time but it could have been done so much better. Basically a let down. The new Dumbledore comes off as more crazy than an eccentric genius. He is supposed to be the only person who Voldemort ever feared you're left wondering why? The plot was also not really resolved it just ended. I think one of the problems was that the people who are making the movies are still trying to target the younger audience but their audience is first off getting older and second these are not children's books. Rowling has said repeatedly that these are not children's books. The movies should reflect this. With more content the problems with the movie could have been fixed."
"copabm","2","2","3","5 May 2019"," Disappointed
","I'm a new Harry Potter fan. Goblet of Fire so far is my favorite book in the series. It was an emotional rollercoaster. The movie stunk. It did not capture the emotions that the book made me feel. Prisoner of Azkaban movie was also a disappointment. I'm wondering if I should stop watching the movies."
"zkonedog","Null","2","3","6 March 2017"," The First Big Showdown
","During the previous three Harry Potter films, a showdown between Harry Potter & Dark Lord Voldemort was always hinted at but never quite fully conceived. In ""Goblet of Fire"", however, that confrontation does indeed finally take place and vaults the series to new heights.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Goblet"" begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), & Hermoine (Emma Watson) attending the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasley family. While at the Cup, the Dark Mark of Voldemort appears in the sky along with a series of attacks on the crowd.. Thus, when the trio report to their fourth year at Hogwarts, it is with an air of caution and suspicion. This is no normal semester at wizarding school, however, as the Tri-Wizard tournament is revived for the first time in ages, allowing the Hogwarts house to see students from other wizarding academies. As the competitions begin, Harry (as usual) plays a key role in the proceedings, as well as the search for Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) followers.<br/><br/>In terms of spectacular visuals, the fantastic aspects of the Tri-Wizard tournament make this film a perfect vehicle to really showcase some impressive special effects...which it takes full advantage of. ""Goblet"" is a visual treat to observe and really makes it feel as if you are completely immersed in the Potter universe.<br/><br/>In keeping with the book, the character development and drama only amps up in this installment. The scenes at the Wizard Ball provide more insight than ever into the relationships between our favorite protagonists, while the big confrontation between Harry and the Dark Lord is absolutely riveting and almost steals the show in and of itself. A better actor than Fiennes could not have been cast for the role, as he truly is a frightening sight to behold.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Goblet of Fire"" (like its novel namesake) is the best installment of the franchise so far. It perfectly combines adventure, drama, characters, music, and even some lighter moments to create a nice entertaining mixture. A few plot lines from the book are excised completely, but other than that there isn't anything else to criticize here."
"anifanmc","5","2","3","13 August 2008"," A poor adaptation at best
","Prisoner of Azkaban, the previous film, had me quite excited for this movie, not least because it has one of the most significant events in the entire septet of novels. However, as I sat down in the theater and the events of the movie transpired, I closed my eyes for a few seconds following the initial scene at the Riddle Mansion. All of a sudden the film is at the Quidditch World Cup.... what? This is the main shortfall of the film - it is rushed, relies far too much on tacky transition devices, and feels overall like a chick flick, not at all congruent with the darkness of the third film. The film rushes from Harry's dream to the Quidditch World Cup, completely bypassing the Dursleys.... okay that much I suppose I can understand, it's a slightly tedious and unnecessary event... but then the Quidditch World cup is shown within the span of two minutes. What the hell's the point of even introducing it then? All of a sudden the entire camp of wizards is obliterated by people looking like the KKK (uh, those are the Death Eaters, I suppose?) and are only alluded to by a barely mumbled line from Arthur Weasley... the whole subplot of the elf Winky is left completely out, thereby basically ruining the whole point of the twist later on. Oh, not to mention, the Dark Mark is fired up in the air when nobody's around on the camp grounds. Way to forget the bloody point of the Mark, Kloves.<br/><br/>At this point my heart sank. I knew the movie was going to be extremely dismal. I watched as the kids are suddenly at Hogwarts and they introduce Mad-Eye Moody, the Triwizard Tournament (by a poorly acted Dumbledore by Gambon) and then it becomes disconnected and patchy. Hell I can't even remember most of the movie now - only that at some point they show Sirius's face in the fire, Harry gets accepted as a competitor (with Dumbledore throwing him against the trophy case?... What?) and then the first task.<br/><br/>This is where the movie got incredibly boring and stupid as for half an hour I am treated to tween agonizing about who Harry should go out with. Yes, we know what happens, we don't need the terrible music of whoever the hell composed it (it sounds like a bleeding cartoon) to make it any more obvious. Yay, half an hour of watching kids preen and dance to bad alternative rock. Can we PLEASE get on with the story?<br/><br/>Blissfully, it ends and tranistions almost immediately, and we're stuck with Harry trying to figure out what to do for the next task, and voilà, they decide to completely eliminate Dobby's role. The movie slugs on and then we see a rather comically proportioned Pensieve scene with Dumbledore being the jerk headmaster (paraphrased: ""It's none of your business!"") instead of trusting Harry like he does throughout the novels.<br/><br/>I was shaking my head in disbelief at this point. Then, the third task comes up, and I perk up for a second. Maybe, just MAYBE this movie can redeem itself through the graveyard scene.<br/><br/>My hopes are dashed. The scene is rushed, looks again cartoonish instead of refined and stylized, and the Death Eaters look once again like the Ku Klux Klan. Over in five minutes, what should have been the pivotal scene of the film.<br/><br/>I left the movie slightly annoyed and very bored. The only high point was the good acting on the part of Ralph Fiennes, who gave his character a bit of frightening quality. That was moderately undercut by his actions being annoying and comical.<br/><br/>Steve Kloves should never have been appointed to make this travesty of a film. I hope that at some point in the far future someone decides to ""re-imagine"" these films and decide that this one was as campy and boring as the Joel Schumacher Batman films.<br/><br/>Frankly I don't care that they took out a lot of scenes; it's the fact that they took out a lot of the scenes that MATTERED and saturated the film with fan pleasing and enough info to make tween girls and fanatic ""shippers"" squeal every time they watch the scene between Harry and Cho.<br/><br/>Thank god this isn't in movie theaters anymore, otherwise I'd say, don't waste your money on it. 5/10"
"jar5202","5","2","3","15 March 2006"," This movie was a travesty
","I just finished watching this movie, and I must say that I am extremely disappointed by it. I am not so much disappointed by how much was left out, because with a book the size of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, portions must inevitably be left out in order to produce a movie that one can watch in one sitting. (It wouldn't have hurt, however, to have added another 30 minutes to the movie (for, say, plot development). I am confident that even with a 3 hour movie, Harry Potter fans would have still turned out to theaters in droves.) <br/><br/>Here are a few of my grievances. (1) The music was uninspiring and generic. Enough said. (2) The acting of most of the adolescent actors and actresses, excluding Rupert Grint, was horrible. I am particularly disappointed by the performances of Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. One would think that the acting skills of Daniel and Emma would have improved after 4 movies. It hasn't. It has, in fact, gotten worse. Their performances in Prisoner of Azkaban were far superior. I absolutely loved (and was completely charmed by) Watson in Azkaban. (Radcliffe didn't do too bad either.) (3) Most of the blame for their poor performances, however, must be laid at the feet of the director. He obviously was not able to extract even mediocre performances from Watson and Radcliffe. Many of the actors and actresses who had no previous experience acting outshone Watson and Radcliffe in this one. (4) The screenplay failed to capture the essence and spirit of the book. Furthermore, it was utterly and completely incoherent, i.e., there was no development of plot. Steve Knowles seemed to just take--from the book--a snip here...a snip there...patched it to together then called it a screenplay without any concern for coherency and plot development. If I had not already read the book and thus known the story, it would have been most difficult to figure out what the heck was going on in this movie. The screenplay was that bad.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie was without a doubt the worst of the bunch. If it had not been for the graveyard scene (which was a little better than mediocre) as well as the spectacular Hungarian Horntail dragon and other special effects, I would have considered this movie a joke--a disaster. As it is, it is merely a disappointment."

","I'm absolutely disappointed. The stuff they've published doesn't represent the book's meaning at all they just picked out a few exiting scenes of the book and left out the rest. Of course if everything would have been published the movie would last about five hours, but at last they could have put in the house elves and Hermione's organization. This movie is not dignified to be called Harry Potter. All the Harry Potter movies that were made by Chris Columbus are a thousand times better than this rubbish. I can just hope that the films that are still left to be made will be better. But you might ask yourself now why I have given it 3 points and not just one, but of course there are not only bad things in this movie, there are still some good facts about it:<br/><br/>the stadium at the Quiditch world cup looked quite like I imagined it while I read the books<br/><br/>Voldemort looked quite funny, but here I must also mention that the death eaters were absolutely terrible: How the hell got the film makers the idea of giving them Sido's masks!<br/><br/>The yule ball was also funny but perhaps a little bit short.<br/><br/>There were lots of jokes in there.<br/><br/>So all in all ""the goblet of the fire"" was the worst Harry Potter I have ever watched, but it is still an event to pass the time."

","Everyone's talking about Harry Potter this Christmas, ""I saw Harry Potter yesterday!"" or ""Haha, I've got preview tickets"" But after seeing it, I honestly think it's not that good. I saw the preview (at 10:50) but it wasn't really worth it (finished it at 1:30am) If you've read the book, you'll be a bit disappointed. The main reason is other characters are excluded (like the rotten Durselys) and Katie Leung only makes a few brief appearances and says a few lines, which is a big disappointment. People flock to see Harry in action with the ladies, and what do you get? Nothing, she's just a gimmick. One of the book's main focuses is Harry's interest in Cho Chang, which gives the film it's cute appeal (and why most flock to see it)But instead, we have to witness the hate and hostility between Hermione and Ron, who has a seriously dodgy haircut. And come on, 2 and a half hours? Sure, the previous films were as long, but it seemed to go by quickly, this film just seems to drag on, Columbus and Cuaron did it better. There's definitely room for improvement, let's hope the next one doesn't disappoint...<br/><br/>PS: Feel free to degrade my review, but this is the opinion of one 12 year old, we all have our own thoughts about the movie.

When you compare the story with the book, there were big gaping holes in the plot. There were also major changes to the plot line that I think ruined the story. Also many of the background stories/information were left out and a person who has not read the book may be left confused. I do understand that it is not possible to fit everything into two and a half hours but certain information are important for the remaining books.

Harry and the gang growing up to be adults and their love interests were well rendered. Radcliffe as Harry was charming and so was Ms Watson, who is blossoming into a charming lady. Ron did n't seem to have too much to say in this movie I think. Lot of puns on him though!! Poor Ron!!! <br/><br/>The visual effects were fantastic as usual and the return of Lord Voldemort pretty ghastly. My wife thought he looked ghastly! The only haunting experience was the death of a fellow Hogwarter, which I believe kids don't like.

The casting was phenomenal--I was thoroughly impressed with the choices for the characters of Fleur, Krum, Cedric, and Rita Skeeter (she turned out exactly as I pictured her while reading the books).<br/><br/>Going into the movie I was also a bit nervous about how the movie was going to turn out, as there was a new composer for the soundtrack for this movie, but I was proved wrong for that as well.

First of all, Daniel Radcliffe fits the Harry Potter part perfectly. He has the same, ""Whatever, I just want to get through the school year"" kind of attitude, just like in the books. This movie was also the perfect length. Every scene was well done, and I think the director did a fantastic job. Also, many teenagers along the female variety found some of the guys in here very attractive, including myself, but that's not really relevant. Anyway, I think this movie was so well done, and although the next film isn't expected to come out for a while, I really am looking forward to it."

The movie could have been longer, but it did not have to be, Newell took so many liberties with the book, extending key scenes unnecessarily, ( task one- the dragon was ridiculous ), when he instead could have developed the ""story"" more... funnily that's what I thought a directors job was!! The scene with Sirius in the coals of the fire was not only wrong, completely, but overly long with a 30 second end that could have been used elsewhere, I just cannot put into words my despair at seeing the might of Hollywood fail so utterly in continuing what has become one of the most eagerly awaited and popular series of films for years.

"titanrd1","9","2","3","7 December 2005"," A Magical Experience
","Well, the film that has the potential to be the biggest blockbuster of the year has arrived. The fourth installment of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise has made it to the big screen. ""The Goblet of Fire"" opened across the United States on November 19 to very eager audiences. Making over 100 million dollars at the box office in just three days, it has easily claimed the fourth spot on the best opening weekend list.<br/><br/>""The Goblet of Fire"" begins just as the book, in the Riddle house, where Voldemort and two of his more devout minions are plotting the untimely death of the one and only Harry Potter. The dark tone of this film is set right away, when Voldemort welcomes, the eavesdropping muggle caretaker, by way of an unforgivable curse. With a death in the first five minutes, it is clear that the films, like the books, are becoming more grim with each sequel. <br/><br/>Far away, Harry awakes in the comfort of the Weasley home, his scar in searing pain. Hermione has just arrived. After a very brief greeting, Harry and the gang depart for the Quidditch World Cup via portkey (an enchanted item, in this case a shoe, that transports those who come in physical contact with it to a predetermined location). For anybody who hasn't read the book, it would be wise to remember what a portkey is.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Quidditch World Cup is cut short due to a fierce attack by Voldemort's followers who are known as ""Death Eaters"" and before you can say ""you know who"" Harry, Ron and Hermione arrive at Hogwarts for their most eventful year yet! Almost immediately, the students are informed that this will not be an ordinary year (is it ever?) for Hogwarts will be host to the Triwizard Tournament (think olympics meets magic). The tournament consists of a series of three potentially fatal tasks, each designed to challenge the participants endurance and skill. Traditionally there are three champions, one from each of three magical schools, but in a mysterious twist Harry's name is spit out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth contestant to compete for ""eternal glory."" After a heated debate, it is decided for Harry that he must compete. As the year progresses, the four contestants are pushed to their limits as they struggle to retrieve a golden egg from a fire breathing dragon, save their friends from a watery grave and navigate through a perplexing labyrinth.<br/><br/>As Harry fights for his life, he must also deal with his peers who have largely abandoned him in support of the other Hogwarts Champion, Cedric Diggory. Jealousy has even turned his best friend, Ron against him. Tension runs high as the story culminates to a climactic showdown with Voldemort, who is more than willing to finish what he started nearly fourteen years before. ""After tonight no will ever again question my powers. After tonight they will only remember how you begged for death, and I, being a merciful lord, obliged.""<br/><br/>As usual, the special effects are topnotch, but it is how they are put to use that makes them great. They never overpower the real story, which is that of Harry and his two closest friends. Daniel Radliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) have matured both as young adults and actors with each successive film. It is undoubtedly a great asset to the franchise that the studio has not recast the main roles as originally planned.<br/><br/>The Director, Mike Newell did a fair job in going from ""Mona Lisa Smile"" to this big budget blockbuster. This is also the man you can thank for convincing the studio not to release ""Goblet of Fire"" (a 734 page book) as two separate films as originally planned. His argument was that he could cut enough of the book's bulky subplots to make an effective film. I think two separate films would have been a complete travesty, but my biggest problem with this film is it's pacing. It is unbelievably rushed and the elimination of several subplots has a negative effect on the overall story. Film 4 is great if you have not read the book, but it's hard not to be a little disappointed if you have. Dobby, S.P.E.W., the giant spider in the maze, and the invisible stair are just a few things fans of the books may miss. Granted, the movie is 2 hours and 37 minutes, but SO much happens so quickly, that I can imagine those who haven't read the book getting lost easily. It strikes me as odd that the studio felt they had to rush the film as they did. I'm sick of guaranteed blockbusters like this and ""Star Wars"" playing it so safe. They need to pull all the stops, if it take three hours to tell the story the way it was meant to be told, than so be it. It's surprising how much studios will still fight to keep running time down even though giants like ""Titanic"" and ""Return of the King"" currently reside atop the all-time box office. There should be no time limit on a good story.<br/><br/>Despite the rapidity, several scenes (most of which I can't discuss) were executed flawlessly. One in particular was the ending which is the first of the Potter films to satisfy me (I hate the firebolt freeze frame of film 3 with a burning passion). This is by far the most exciting adventure Harry Potter has gone on yet and it earns it's PG-13 rating (at least by MPAA standards). I certainly hope this pleases most fans because it has to tide you over all the way until 2007 when ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is scheduled to be released with ""The Half Blood Price"" to follow a year later and the untitled film 7 expected to conclude the story in 2010. 8.8/10 (3 ½ /4) stars"

","HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE <br/><br/>I have found these films to be enjoyable ever since THE SORCERER'S STONE, and yet I still continue to be surprised by how much they are able to continually strengthen the visual style, and tighten up the books in more appropriately cinematic ways with each passing film. GOBLET OF FIRE is superior to the earlier works and yet it still fits in very well with the preceding films.<br/><br/>The film is a visual feast. The Quidditch match in the very beginning is beautifully portrayed, and Newell handles every elaborate sequence (virtually every round of the tournament, though especially the underwater segment in my eyes) with a confident, and selective eye.<br/><br/>However, what was most incredible to me was the way that Newell managed to take something as simple as a boot (the turnkey) in the very beginning, and make it my favorite image in the movie. As the camera chases the Weasleys, Potter, and Hermoine up the hill rolling through the grass towards a beautiful sunset... only to finish the shot on a tattered shoe. It captures perfectly how magical Potter's world is, yet also how simple.<br/><br/>The screenwriter deserves massive amounts of respect for condensing the book in a major way (and I loved the book when I read it 3 years ago)... however, he never loses the central theme of the novel or it's main narrative drive (having not read the book for a while and not remembering the specifics, I barely noticed anything missing b/c I was kept so involved). He also manages to balance out the dark/tragic elements in the end with the lighthearted innocence of children in school perfectly, never does one tone feel detrimental to the other.<br/><br/>The adult performers always manage to do strong work with their small roles. I still view Watson, Grint, and Radcliffe as less then stellar actors... in every film I feel like I am watching them mimic EXACTLY what the director had to INSTRUCT them to do (I just don't feel like they really live and breath the characters, I always see a wheel turning). But, they look the parts, are enjoyable to watch, and I think they continue to slightly improve in each film.<br/><br/>In the end though, this isn't a film that I go to in order to admire the performances. It is a popcorn flick, however one done with a lot of artistry. The plot developments are exciting, the characters are amusing, the imagery is beautiful, the action sequences thrilling, and the story engrossing.<br/><br/>Highly entertaining... and the best POTTER film so far.<br/><br/>...

","Goblet of Fire is of course, well done and beautifully shot. Not having read any of the Potter series, I wasn't disappointed in the movie at all. From what I have heard, many underlying plots and characters may have been skipped to streamline the movie and keep its focus, so the readers might be disappointed, I don't know. ""Fire"" is darker than the rest of the movies. Seemed to lack some of the humor that gave the previous films some levity. Great storyline, fabulous effects. LONG though. It's about 2.5 hours long, so make time for it. It's worth it to watch and goes quickly. Throughly enjoyed it, but not my favorite of the bunch so far."

","I found this movie to be a big disappointment. It was very abrupt and staccato in the storyline which made it very hard to follow. The general feel of the movie was not right. In fact, it felt like I was watching a play rather than a movie. None of the characters were developed in this movie. It was WAY too much crammed into 2 hours. <br/><br/>This movie should have been two movies. Perhaps they should have released them a month apart or something. Bummer because I was really looking forward to this movie.<br/><br/>Another problem was that the characters were wrong. Dumbledore seemed to be ""out of control"" or loosing control. In the books, Dumbledore is always in control or at least up to the last book."

","First of all, I have to say that I really enjoyed the movie, and I would have rated it a 10 if not for the following reasons. My favorite characters, other than the main ones (Harry, Ron and Hermione), were completely left out of the movie. The scene with the Dursley's (in the book, when the Weasley's come for Harry) was so great, it should have been in the movie. I was really disappointed about not seeing Dobby or Sirius. Okay, maybe they aren't absolutely necessary, but they are both pretty important in Harry's life. I would rather sit through a longer movie that includes all the essential parts of the story than a shorter version with outstanding special effects."
"shadow-moses","10","2","3","5 December 2005"," Fantastic film, Straight out of the book!
","I love the Harry Potter series, it's a very imaginative story that dose not dumb- down whatsoever. This becomes all the more true as the series goes on and Gobblet is a dark turning point in it. The film follows right along, recreating the images I saw in my mind as I read the book. <br/><br/>One great thing about Gobblet is this is where the children begin to mature. This installment has a charming school dance, which brings to light a dual aspect in Harry Potter, he has faced countless deadly situations and came out alive, but is absolutely terrified of the prospects of romance. The dance is very cute and plays out in a realistic way. <br/><br/>The dark climax of the film is very well done and satisfying. If you've read the book it will not disappoint, Newell held nothing back. If you haven't read the series then I think you will be surprised by the intensity of the climax. In either case see this film, it's fantastic."
"mcittone2","3","2","3","4 December 2005"," Worst one yet
","I actually liked the first 3 (?) but this one just isn't worth seeing, at least not in the theater. There's not much of a story here. The special effects just get int he way of the story, the attempts to address the students' coming of age seem disjointed, and basically its more of the same. Even within the imaginary world of the storyline, things don't seem to make sense. The main mover of the plot is a gruesome tournament among wizard schools which is over the top and doesn't serve well as a basis for a plot. What did I expect? I thought this might develop from the earlier charm of the first movies to something more thoughtful as far as story, development of character, and development of the fictional background for these stories. Admittedly, I don't read the books so perhaps I set my expectations too high. More of the same without the charm of the previous ones."
"petesake33","3","2","3","1 December 2005"," The worst of the 4
","I must say that I was sorely disappointed with this film. As an interpretation of the book, I think it was a good idea to cut out any details that were superfluous to Harry's specific story. However, the script and, more to the point, the direction, is simply a random collection of unconnected events. As a result, this film is a choppy, disconnected and clumsy collection of snippets from the book. There is almost no continuity in this film. Important scenes have no buildup and seem to happen at random. The pace is constant, never allowing the movie to breathe, and, as a result, the underlying themes that are so important to the story never surface.<br/><br/>At its heart, this is a story about coming of age and, more importantly, the loss of innocence. But because the thematic and character development is almost nonexistent, we never feel these ideas. I recently remarked to a friend of mine that watching this movie was like being in a room with a group of imposters. The characters we've come to know and enjoy so well have been replaced by cardboard cutouts. Even Hogwarts, itself a vibrant, magical character, has been stripped down and replaced by a gray, colorless and magicless place. Its intimate splendor has been constricted; even the Great Hall seems so much smaller. <br/><br/>The mark of a great movie is one that can draw the viewer in and tell a story with few words and little screen time. Think of the great movies you've seen. In the first 10 minutes, you begin to know what the characters are all about and get a feel for the story. In this movie, you never know the characters and for that I fault the director, Mike Newell. Exposition of the story is done mostly through dialogue. The characters have to tell us what's happening; Newell never shows us. Much like he did in Donnie Brasco, Newell never has a feel for the material and the result is a film that just ambles, with no beginning and no end, just a bunch of stuff in the middle.<br/><br/>In many ways, this movie reminds me of the most recent Star Wars films, in which very good actors (Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neesson) have been neutered by poor direction. In Goblet of Fire, the characters constantly seem out of place, their emotions seemingly plucked at random. Emma Watson, in particular, is guilty of overacting as she never seems to find the right chord. This is a shame, because The Prisoner of Azkaban showed her to be an up and coming actor, as Alfonso Cuaron was able to extract a much stronger performance from her. And while much of the criticism of Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore is warranted, a stronger director could have guided him towards a more faithful portrayal.<br/><br/>Ultimately what dooms this film is a complete lack of nuance. There are no slow, soft moments to contrast with the action and nothing to place any of the characters in context. It is a movie done with crude, broad strokes. I remember thinking that it felt like the director used a hacksaw when he should have been painting with a small brush. The result is a soulless, off-base movie that feels nothing like the story we've come to love. Let's hope a better director is chosen for the fifth film before this wonderful franchise is ruined."
"DestinyDeferred","4","2","3","1 December 2005"," OK at best.
","In all fairness I confess that I can't separate the book from the movie. That being said, I did not like this movie. It certainly wasn't a ""bad"" movie, but it was disappointing compared to the wonderful 4th book. Cramming 700+ pages into a 2 1/2 hour movie is certainly no enviable task....though I suppose pleasing teenagers and the general public requires it.<br/><br/>The Good: The Weasley twins, Ralph Fiennes excellent portrayal of Voldemort, the musical score, most action scenes done well, the return of favorites like Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>The Bad: Seems choppy and rushed at points; though humorous, they add rather tacked on scenes instead of the very ""Harry Potterish"" humor from the book; Daniel Radcliffe's continued wooden performance; And yes....all of the wonderful things from the book that I know they had to cut like the Weasleys crashing the Dursley House, Winky, SPEW, Ludo Bagman, Dobby and the fleshed out Rita Skeeter subplot.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. An affront to the character of Dumbledore!! He would never manhandle a student! Or stand around looking scared! This is simply unforgivable. I saw a suggestion of Peter O'Toole, sounds great to me....anything but this guy.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie, but I can't fairly pan it either."
"nzyhp","1","2","3","1 December 2005"," CRAP!!! I wasted my $$
","This movie should be a bomb... But it won't because of the popularity of the books. I've read all the books and just like everyone else, buy it on the day it's released. Then usually have it completely read the next day. The first movies were also less than spectacular, but the story line in this movie leaves you wondering, ""What happened to the rest of the characters? What of the house-elves, S.P.E.W, Padfoot meeting in Hogsmead, etc... What happened to Dobby? Did they not want to go into post production and make a little CG character? At least he was in the last one. They made short work of the first 12 chapters of the book, condensing them into about the first 15 minutes of the movie. You never see the twins Fred and George do anything more than try to get past the age line. Didn't they have a lot more candy and stuff? Didn't Harry give them the $$ to start their joke shop? There wasn't even a mention of the prize $$ in the movie at all! Don't these people read the books before starting a film based on said book? Basically my opinion is don't waste your money seeing this in the theater, even though I know you will. Next time, I'm waiting till it comes out on free TV like the others are now."
"adastrame","4","2","3","30 November 2005"," Not doing justice to the book
","WARNING! This may contain spoilers for anyone who is not familiar with the book! Since my opinion is rather negative, you should probably also not read it before seeing the movie.<br/><br/>Positive: Um, this is hard. I liked Luciuses hair. And I thought there was more of a 'schoolish' atmosphere in some scenes. The band at the Yule Ball looked like a goth band or something. Filch's way of running gave me a laugh. He was really funny in this movie, but that's probably also negative because he's not really supposed to be funny. Some stuff is just nice to look at.<br/><br/>Negative: I don't know where to start this. Well allover, the movie felt like a total haste. The scenes were incredibly short and HUGE amounts of detail were missing (again...). But worse, they even added some total crap to the plot, stuff where you just think 'What's this sh*t supposed to be?'. For example Barty Crouch Jr. in the Riddle Mansion. Didn't make sense at all and spoiled the whole plot. Also the Pensieve scene with him was ridiculous. Dumbledore wasn't Dumbledore. He was some weird crackp*t or something. He was just mean. Dumbledore is a wise, silent old man, and that wasn't him. Richard Harris was so much better, especially his voice and his way of speaking. No Sirius at all (that fire thing doesn't count). Also, no Dursleys. I was looking forward to them meeting the Weasleys... too bad. And no Charlie Weasley at all. They totally could have left out the Quidditch World Cup. Those two seconds weren't worth it. The whole dragon chase was unnecessary. The Great Hall looked scarily small to me. I remembered it to be a lot bigger in the first movies. Daniel Radcliffe's leg hair is rather gross. Yuck. Mad-Eye Moody also didn't look like anything I ever imagined. He's supposed to have no nose and have a scared face. Well... The music at the maze was really ridiculous as well. Sounded like German Oktoberfest. The maze was also weird. No obstacles? On to the interesting parts... The Death Eaters looked, as a friend suggested, like a mixture of Sido and the Ku-Klux-Klan. Ridiculous. And Voldemort himself looked totally nice. And harmless. Nothing at all like the Moste Evile Wizarde of all time. He didn't have any crinkles (he must be at least 65 years old), he wasn't tall at all, and his nose looked stupid. His eyes weren't really red. His fingers weren't really long. His toenails were quite ugly though. I always imagined him a head taller and much thinner than any normal man. The whole graveyard scene didn't scare me at all. There's nothing really evil there. The 'vibe' isn't there. The Prior Incantatem was also not really stunning. I thought they would be floating. And I didn't understand the ending sequence. Why the f*ck are they all so happy? Stupid.<br/><br/>Thoughts:I could probably rant and ramble on like this forever. But it's true, you can never do a book like that justice with a 3 hour movie. I really think they should have made a TV Show of this, one season per book, maybe 12 or 15 episodes per season. Then there wouldn't be any details missing. Also, the people who create this still hold on to the thought that this is for children. It's NOT. Poor children, honestly. But by trying to make this viewable for children, they ruin the whole thing. It has to be a lot darker and a lot more depressing. Especially all that evil stuff. That wasn't evil. I couldn't see anything evil there. But maybe the actors are just bad? Who knows... The kids, especially Harry have to learn how to become more emotional. There was a lot of emotion missing, especially in the end. Nothing can ever do justice to one's own imagination. That's one of the reasons why I started to read the first book again yesterday night. I'll go for all six now. Haven't read one after another in quite a while now.. Must have been at least two years or so ;)"

This movie was poor in almost every way possible, the lack of story in the movie, the bad editing, the bad direction,its only slight 'saving grace' was the acting which i must admit was pretty damned good. <br/><br/>However does not make up for the fact that this was the worst movie yet!"

","Prior to seeing 'Goblet of Fire' I have never read any of the novels. I was just a fan of the movies since their debut. But after watching 'Goblet' I was finally convinced to start reading the series. That's the effect this film had on me and now I'm very much into the Harry Potter world. I can see that this one was rushed more so than the others, I wouldn't have mind if it was longer, but unlike me most people would object. I think what is most satisfying, especially to someone who never read the books before is that Harry, Ron, Hermione and everyone else is growing up and the problems they face are getting more serious. I've seen 'Goblet' three times now and I plan on seeing again it on IMAX. So for those who are already avid readers of this Rowling series, it does cover the important points, but they are rushed. And for those who are just movie-goers who could care less about the actual book itself, I think you're in for a real treat. Plus, I thought Cho Change (Leung) was a cutie, just how she is supposed to be, hope to see her the next one."

Everything that was not included were what I would consider make the book that extra bit special. The parts that were lucky enough to be included were good. I suggest that for anybody who really liked the book and has not yet seen the film that they do not go to see it as it will ruin something that you like, as it did for me. Understanderbly curiosity will get the better of you."

","The other three Harry Potter movies were made for large demographics. Mainly, kids love the books, but there are many adults as well. The movies were originally made for all types of people, age and preference wise. There was fantasy, adventure, romance, horror, etc. This movie was based on adventure. And for anyone who has ever read the books, this movie was NOTHING compared to the book. They left out so much from the book, that they are going to have to do some re-editing somewhere, because information that they left out, some of it was vital to the next book/movie. As just a movie, I would give it a low rating as well. For someone who had never read the book, it was very confusing. My best friend had never read the book, and the first ten minutes of the movie, she was leaning against my arm and asking me what the heck was going on. All in all, it was a major disappointment and I hope that the next one will be made closer to what the original three were."
"laertes-4","3","2","3","27 November 2005"," I want my life back
","What an absolute waste of 2.5 hours of my life. Let me get this out early, I do NOT fault JK Rowling for a bad story, quite the opposite. This movie had significant shoes to fill with the first 3 installments ranging from great to interesting, but this latest entry into the franchise was far and away a sub-par offering.<br/><br/>Okay, so what did I find wrong with it. Quite simply THIS MOVIE CAN NOT STAND ON ITS OWN. It should not be a pre-requisite to read the book prior to seeing the film. I don't want homework assigned to me to go and spend $18 for my wife and I to enjoy an evening at the movies. I walked into this film as someone who saw 1 and 2, and had high hopes for 4. Both of us were extremely dissatisfied.<br/><br/>I can excuse several issues that my wife could not get past. 1. The movie was too ""dark"". No, not content the actual lighting on many of the sequences was too dim to really make out what was happening (quidditch match, underwater, etc..) If the content is dark, you do not have to be literal and make the viewer feel as if they are wearing sunglasses during the film (I get it already, ooo danger all around). 2. The editing was horrible. In your face, fast panning, extreme closeups, etc. While I'm not expecting a beautiful Kurosawa film, how about some medium shots, let the visuals tell some of the story (and let me SEE the visuals (see #1)). 3. Dialogue. Here's a great idea, let's take some teenagers (who as a group tend to not have the clearest diction anyway, thank you Ron Weasley) and put multiple accents in the script so you are sure to miss at least 20% of the lines throughout the 2.5 hours. 4. Big Build-up, little return. Okay, so was the director capped by how long the film could be? He started off strong, lots of action with the wizard's cup scenes, but then at the end, guess what..we're gonna wrap it up in 5 minutes or less. I'm sorry, the ending seemed to be nothing more than a ""tune in next time"" bid for viewers to return for the 5th film instead of drawing conclusions to the film that we've already paid for. What about Voldemort? How did people celebrate the wizard's cup winner? these are just a couple of questions that don't even get addressed at the end..<br/><br/>I know I'm going to get flamed from a lot of people who love this movie, but I'm telling you my opinion. Without a frame of reference of having read the book, don't waste your time or money on this film. It's not our responsibility or problem that the book was 8 million pages long..make it a 3-hour film, have an ending, or make it a 2-part movie, something. The story should not be sacrificed, and in this case, it was. Truly a shame."

Not only did they leave out a lot of information that was provided in the book, they changed many scenes as well. I know that this was necessary to fit the book into a 2 hour and 30 minute movie, but like i mentioned before i was disappointed. They changed the entire maze at the end of the movie, Harry's dreams regarding Lord Voldemort in the Riddle house, and even the entire situation regarding Mr. Crouch. Overall i feel that the Harry potter movies should begin to be filmed like Lord of the Rings. With the length of the books they should begin to film these movies at a duration of 2 hours and 59 minutes, as well as release an extended addition to explain more of the movie in detail. If i didn't read the books i would have loved the movie, but since i know all of the information that was changed and left out i can only give this movie 6 out of 10."
"doctorow","4","2","3","27 November 2005"," Potter movies are going downhill...
","Both of us agreed, the Goblet of Fire was a soulless, mechanical, disappointment. The latest Potter movie has no humor, no wit, and substitutes frenetic action for plot and dialogue. The characters seem made of cardboard, being moved about by the director to advance the plot. There is none of the subtlety, or wit of the first movie. None of the character development and advancing friendship between the main characters of the second movie. As the Potter movies advance, they have steadily deteriorated. These movies now absolutely are not for children under 16 and are largely a waste of time. Special effects do not make the movie any more. We give the Goblet of Fire two thumbs down for sloppy script, lack of intelligence and substitution of mishmash for coherence."
"rinkmurray","7","2","3","27 November 2005"," Snap, crackle, fizzle.
","Like James Bond without Q or M, how can you have a Harry Potter film without the Dursley's? They were probably cut because they were not ""essential"" to the story and because this book was the longest of the 4 that have made it to the silver screen.<br/><br/>But in losing the Dursley's, the movie seems to have lost its way a bit. Since time was limited, I would argue that side plots should have been cut more. The Ball and teenage angst was cute, but took far too long. <br/><br/>In previous installments, the emotional power that drove the film was the extreme loss felt by Harry due to the death of his parents at the hands of Voldemort and how he is a child between two worlds.<br/><br/>The movie should have expanded on the emotional aspects of the film and it should have stayed focused on advancing the key elements in the plot (the rising of Voldemort and the way the wizarding community responded to it).<br/><br/>This would have given the movie greater continuity and allowed the director to have fewer loose ends. <br/><br/>In the past, as with this story, I have not read the Harry Potter books until after the movie -- simply because I didn't want to spoil the movie. After seeing the movie, I read the book. This was the first time in the Potter series that reading the book was essential to understanding the movie. That should not happen. <br/><br/>Indeed there was much from the book that needed to be cut to make a manageable movie. It seems a lot of ideas from the book were introduced halfway, then dropped. These holes in the storyline were very distracting when I was watching the movie. <br/><br/>I would argue that less emphasis was placed on the teen angst, and that time directed toward advancing the elements that lead to the next story. <br/><br/>While the movie had spectacular special effects, it lacked the emotional content of the previous works.<br/><br/>It was still an enjoyable movie, but as far as the series goes... it was by far the weakest of the lot."

What about the killing of Crouch Jr. and the ministry not believing that Voldemort is back? This really has upset me because this was my favorite book in the series and now my least favorite of the movies.

We were looking forward to seeing the Dursleys reaction to the Weasleys showing up in their fireplace and Dudley eating the ton-tongue coffee: gone. Harry's excitement regarding the World Cup: gone. Crouch Jr in Harry's dream, what was that? Albus Dumbledore would have never yelled or pushed Harry about, not would he have sat himself down on the steps nervous and fretful, he appeared feeble minded. I must say at this point of the movie, I was ready to go home. I was disappointed not to see Sirius Black, and I don't mean the few raise embers in a fireplace. (Not convincing)<br/><br/>The film did not flow, and too much was left out. The movies thus far have been offspring's of the book series, but The Goblet of Fire was not. The movie in and of itself is mainly about the triwizard tournament and leaves so much that makes the story out. I understand it was considered to make 2 movies to cover the Goble of Fire. It would have been prudent to do so."

They changed so much of the story so if you are looking for the books you will most likely want to walk out. Besides that the movie was extremely rushed jumping from scene to scene with no continuity. If you aren't going to do it right what is the point in even trying. The first two tasks are at least sort of like the book, but the third was the stupidest thing I have ever seen. It looked like the maze was just trying to eat them all. They left out the importance of the unforgivable curses and are turning the point of the movies to love stories. The love stories are supposed to be played down in the series cause they give nothing to the overall point of the story. The graveyard scene was the only part of the movie worth watching. <br/><br/>The acting in the series is still great and was the only reason I didn't leave. Moody was portrayed well except for the eye which is supposed to be part of his head. Dumbledore was much to overzealous(I wish we still had the original). He isn't supposed to show fear yet. I just was overall disappointed with the movie and wish they would just stick to what J.K. writes."

","The only experience I have had with Harry Potter is the first film. My spouse reads the books fanatically and sporadically sees the films. A number of my friends also do both. I've not read the books and not really kept up with all the movies, but I can say that I really enjoyed this film. Like the first, it was well made, intelligent, and visually interesting. Nevertheless, don't expect to get it all if you haven't kept up with the books, and if you have, don't expect to be given it all. Movies can not be as rich as books - especially lengthy and well written ones.<br/><br/>This film finds Harry experiencing frightening dreams and mysteriously enrolled in a deadly wizard's tournament which he is too young to be part of, mentored by a new professor with unusual teaching methods, and experiencing serious growing pains. His friends Hermione and Ron are also back, and so are his usual teachers, and they are all just as likable as ever. Despite the inexplicable rating, this is a family film, well worth seeing for its entertainment value."

","I feel that this movie is not as good as movies 1 and 2. In the first place, magical elements have been taken away from the show. For example, u do not see as many moving pictures and flying staircases and other magical elements inside Hogwards.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie cut too much from the book. The part for the World Cup was awful. Instead of showing Kruum's big face, the movie could have used the time for showing how the game was played between the Irish and Bulgarians.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the portrayal of Madame Maxime and Alsator Moody was awful. They aren't supposed to look like that in the book.<br/><br/>Fourthly, I thought Veelas should be bright and shinny?

"sarah-beth","4","2","3","23 November 2005"," The flame in the goblet is slowly diminishing
","I am an avid reader of the Harry Potter books and love the movies despite certain well loved scenes being cut. J.K. Rowling said in an interview that she has always told directors to stay true to the spirit of Harry Potter if they couldn't do the movie exactly like the book.<br/><br/>I feel that this is the biggest monstrosity to befall the spirit of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Why on earth does Dumbledore slam Harry up against a wall demanding to know if he put his name in the goblet? Is it not obvious that he loses his cool in almost every scene? This man is our inspiration in the Harry Potter books and Rowling consecutively portrays him as a man who does not need anger to solve situations. His humor and light heartedness has always seemed to give Harry a sense of hope. If we were to compare the past movies it would be obvious that this mishap is not one of the actor's own doing but that of the director.<br/><br/>So many Harry Potter fans said that Richard Harris was the perfect Dumbledore and that it would be extremely hard to find someone to fill in his shoes. Well the new man on deck in Prisoner of Azkaban was hard to tell apart from Sir Richard. He was that true to the spirit of Dumbledore. His mannerisms, his spherical character were more than enough to ease audiences fears of what could have been a drastically bad choice.<br/><br/>How could someone so perfect in the third, epic film change so suddenly in just a years time at Hogwarts? It is clear that the director of the film wanted every character to match the dark and ominous mood of Voldermort's return and in the headmaster he made a gargantuan mistake. Dumbledore is the only person He Who Must Not Be Named fears and there has always been great contrast in the two that make a child believe the angry and violent can be overpowered by the humble and wise.<br/><br/>In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Voldermort and Dumbledore are one and the same and those who do not read the books can be extremely excited that the movies are turning into another Matrix film.<br/><br/>There is no spirit of Harry Potter left when you take away the glimmer of hope that a truly good book can hold the same feeling in a movie.<br/><br/>It's a lovely film for younger audiences who, of course, are only drawn to a film for more than ten minutes if something is fire breathing or adventurous, but I have to wonder whether or not the true spirit of Harry Potter that made the underdog children on the playground who were picked on feel they had something of worth has been lost in the glitz and glam of the Hollywood world we live in."

","Damn. Just saw it. I think it's actually the best of all the films, until now. But, yeah, a GREAT BUT. It's not really a movie about the book. Its just a movie INSPIRED by the books, at least, thats what seems to me... Crucial characters aren't there, and the story is extremely different than the story from the book. For an example: The Quidditch Worldcupmatch, is gone. Only an intro, and then you'll see Ron and Harry celebrating. And, Dobby and Winky are also not there. During the whole movie, they aren't there!! And Dumbledore is I am Sam meets Jack Sparrow. Since when is Dumbledore an aggressive gay? There are two things, what make the movie worth seeing. The first is the great soundtrack. And second, Emma Watson. Damn, she's hot. The reason why my rating isn't a one out of ten, is that the story is so brilliant, and the specials are amazing. The acting isn't awful at all, it is even pretty good. So, go and watch the movie, but don't expect the greatness of the books..."
"ocfam2","6","2","3","23 November 2005"," Good, but...
","I waited with great anticipation for this movie and, sadly, was disappointed in the overall production.<br/><br/>The greatest factor in the books and movies thus far has been the characters and their development. This movie focused on the action scenes, and though very well done, neglected and even changed basic personalities of some characters. As an example, after the names were drawn from the goblet and Harry's was amongst them the following scene shows Dumbledore rushing into the room, grabbing Harry and shaking him while yelling, ""did you put your name in?"". That was so very wrong of director Mike Newell! Didn't he even read these books? Dumbledore is NOT a raving lunatic; it's his calm, quiet, intelligent way that personifies his character.<br/><br/>The book really wasn't focused on the tournament; it focused on Voldemort and his quest for power. The scenes with Sirius, which further enhances the character development were cut but for the fire scene. If I had not read the book, I would not have understood anything that was happening. Another issue I had was with the early ""tell"" of who the real bad guy was. Every other movie keeps you guessing throughout and questioning yourself and your choices, but this one gives it away immediately when Moody does the tongue thing with Barty Crouch. Why they bothered to bring in just a small bit with Rita Skeeter I don't know unless the director is a friend of Miranda Richardson and wanted to bring her in the movie. If I hadn't read the book, I would have been wondering what the bird was doing on the windowsill.<br/><br/>The worst part was the end. There is no scene, as in the book, with Harry telling of who he saw at the graveyard with Volemort (incriminating Malfoy & the rest) the head of the Ministry of Magic refusing to believe it, Dumbledore saying that they are alone and must make people hear, and Dumbledore explaining why Harry saw the spirits of his parents and others during the battle with Voldemort. Instead Dumbledore tells him something to the effect that he didn't see them or they weren't there and the scene at the gathering when he speaks to the students telling them what really happened to Cedric Diggory.<br/><br/>As I said, the tournament was well done, but the movie missed the mark by not bringing the important factors of the book into play. The rise of Voldemort and what that entails was only briefly touched on which is what the story was about. Hopefully, Chris Columbus can be brought back to properly direct the rest of the movies."

","Hate to sound a discordant note, but felt this was the least impressive Harry Potter so far.<br/><br/>Marvellous special effects, sure, but far too much missing, the good bits were far too rushed (they could have made SO much more of Voldemort's reappearance) and some of the characterisations were very disappointing: Dumbledore, far from being the quiet, calm, wise old wizard, came across as just a confused, jumpy old man, and the Dark Lord himself was angry and agitated instead of the cold, sinister, calculating and cruel figure he should have been (try listening to Stephen Fry's audio for a much more chilling and convincing portrayal of him). Not the actors' fault, I'm sure, but rather the way they were directed.<br/><br/>Worth seeing - what Harry Potter film hasn't been - but the reaction of our 14 and 10 year-olds to the suggestion that we see it again when their Mum was free was perhaps telling: ""Do we have to?"""
"divaclv","9","2","3","23 November 2005"," Franchise on Fire
","Coming at the exact center of a seven-book series, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" represents a turning point for both its hero and Rowling's writing in general. Harry's youthful innocence is replaced by the moody complexities of adolescence, even as his arch-nemesis Lord Voldemort transforms from a vague, shadowy threat to a very real evil presence in the wizarding world. The moral issues hinted at in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" become even more prominent: good people die, heroes are flawed, and even the saintly Dumbledore proves to be only human. The film version of ""Goblet of Fire"" reflects this, and, like all movies that capture the essence of its source material, is a delight to behold.<br/><br/>Mind you, when I say ""essence,"" I mean the underlying thematic material, not strict adherence to the written text. Weighing in at 700-plus pages, ""Goblet of Fire"" would be impossible to render completely faithfully on film, even if one were allotted double the two and a half hour running time of the finished product. Screenwriter Steven Kloves has his most difficult assignment to date, taking the story down to its essentials while still maintaining a sense of dramatic coherency. Several plot points and sidebars have been condensed, shifted, or left out entirely, which will no doubt irritate the more adamant purists. But if you're willing to give Kloves and director Mike Newell the benefit of the doubt, ""Goblet of Fire"" works wonders.<br/><br/>It works because, like last year's ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the movie is true to what really drives Rowling's series: the coming-of-age of its title character. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, giving his best performance of the character yet) may be surrounded by magical creatures, eccentric supporting players, and mighty portents, but for all that he remains a growing and often confused boy who doesn't quite know how to talk to girls and is more than a little embarrassed by all the attention he receives. Take, for example, the sequence where Harry is selected to compete in an inter-school competition known as the Triwizard Tournament, despite the facts that a) Harry is three years too young to compete and b) Hogwarts already has its official representative. That dirty work is afoot is obvious to Harry, Dumbledore, and the audience, but everyone else believes Harry must have cheated to get into the tournament, even his best friend Ron. So Harry walks down the school corridors alone, trying to ignore the virtual hail of insults and slights from his classmates. Anyone who's dealt with the short end of the teenage social order knows his pain.<br/><br/>Of course, the eccentric supporting players and big set pieces are still in abundance. With each installment, the Hogwarts roster becomes a little more crowded, and it's remarkable that the movie has room for as many cast members as he has. The majority of the returning and new adult playersMaggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Jason Isaacs, Timothy Spall, Miranda Richardson, and David Tennant among themare limited to short bursts of screen time but make the most of what they have, as if trying to prove that old adage about small parts vs. small actors. Brendan Gleeson, as a mysterious and slightly disturbing new addition to the faculty, gets a bit more to do and enjoys himself doing it. Newell delivers on the story's key sequences: a Quidditch World Cup that looks like the Super Bowl crossed with the biggest SCA event on record, encounters with a dragon and merpeople, Hogwarts' first school dance, an enormous hedge maze that would make the Goblin King in ""Labyrinth"" weep with envy, and Harry's confrontation in a graveyard with the newly emerged Voldemort (Ralph Finnes, whose elegant malevolence calls to mind Emperor Palpatine in the ""Star Wars"" movies).<br/><br/>The movie stumbles a bit at the end, where things wrap up too quickly and some set-up for the next installment is left out. But its hard to complainthe film of ""Goblet of Fire"" is everything the Harry Potter books are at their best: exciting, humorous, heart-tugging, and magical."

"bigdogpoo","5","2","3","23 November 2005"," Could have been better
","A very entertaining film, but my feeling is that it fails to bring all the threads together in the end. There are several glaring omissions in the storyline, which will be readily apparent if you have read the book. I thought that it was a complete waste of time introducing the character of Rita Skeeter (Richardson), with whom very little was done. Dumbledore (who should really be called Bumblebore by this time) is very superficial throughout, leading me to wonder if it's directing or just Gambon's performance. I know the book is very extensive, but in all fairness to the film, in order to sell the story, maybe Warner Bros. should not be so afraid of giving it the Peter Jackson treatment and stretching it to over 3 hours instead of 2.5. I was left wanting more in the end, feeling a bit dissatisfied."

","Book 4 is my favorite of the 6 so I was worried how the movie would butcher the book (I had avoided the first three movies because I didn't want the director's vision to interfere with what I thought the characters looked like). I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was very good. The Quidditch World Cup was glossed over, Winky and Ludo Bagman were eliminated, no SPEW, and the third task was quite different (no sphinx!), but what was there was good (especially the beautiful cinematography). Cedric did not come off as as good/heroic as he is in the book which took away some of the power of his death. And no mention of Fleur with veela blood! I loved the Yule Ball: gorgeous dresses, good mix of old and modern music. I'm looking forward to the next movie!"

I'm glad the movie audience finally got to see what truly great characters those two are.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliff and Rupert Grint (Ron saying ""Bloody Hell"" when Hermione woke him up at the beginning was hysterical) play the perfect awkward teenage boys as well. They had great comedic timing in delivering lines and tripping over themselves around girls.<br/><br/>Cedric, Cho, Fleur, and Viktor were all perfectly cast, but had too few lines.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman, as always was Brilliant as Snape. It was also great to see Professor McGonagall as a more fully developed character. Neville getting more screen time was good as well.<br/><br/>Cedric's death and Voldemort's return was very powerful.<br/><br/>As far as things that were in and things that were cut, I think that the things that made the film should have been finished on. Like the Quidditch cup, the Stadium and campground were really cool, but why show all that then skip the match. I felt like the filmmakers were shaking a pop can and when they opened it, there was a mere hissing noise.<br/><br/>Why put Rita Skeeter in at all if they aren't even going to reveal that she is an animagus? That's important in book five. That would have been a much better way to end the movie than Hermione saying things are going to be different now aren't they? Gee Voldy's back, Captain obvious to the rescue! Oh and Ron's reaction to Fleur kissing him was great, but where was Hermione's jealousy. They put in the post Yule Ball argument, so why not enhance it? It would have taken two seconds to show Hermione's jealousy, and it would have been funny.<br/><br/>The wands connecting was important, but the Phoenix song was never explained, and are people who have only seen the movies going to remember the wand core thing from the first movie? And Hermione is a character I feel the filmmakers have not properly interpreted. I mean the Yule ball scene bugged the crap out of me the way she came down with that smug look on her face! Ugh! I liked Hermione better in the book when she was smiling sheepishly, she was just more endearing that way. And her dress and hair made her look more like a five year old playing dress up, as opposed to a blossoming teenager. They should have followed JKR's description when designing the costume. Periwinkle would have been more flattering than pink, IMO.<br/><br/>I'm glad Ginny got a wee bit of face time here, but she'd better not get the shaft in the OotP movie, if they give Hermione her lines there, I will be POed.<br/><br/>Anyway I did enjoy this movie overall, but being a huge fan of the book, I couldn't help but nitpick, LOL"
"rachelprice78","5","2","3","22 November 2005"," It sure looked pretty.....
","I think some of the ""magic"" was sucked out of this movie! I am a devout Potter fan, and have enjoyed the three previous movies for what they were. As an avid reader, I never expect books to measure up to movies, but as long as the essence is caught, I'm good. Part of ROwling's magic is to insert details (seemingly small ones) at various parts in various books, and turn them into a larger story line later. I feel like the next movies are going to have to be dramatically altered. WIthout going in to all huge parts left out and all the ""twists"" from the original story that other reader did, suffice it to say that the whole think went by in a blur. No significance was given to anything. You don't feel passionately about anything! Not the fact that Harry is Prentiss (because of the absence of Sirius), not the struggle in the tournament, nor his developing crush on Cho. I was severely disappointed by Dumbledore's representation, but as always, loved Ron's!"
"Route 66","5","2","3","22 November 2005"," Weak and Overly Fast-Paced
","The latest rendition of the Harry Potter books is not quite as intriguing as the last three. While the casting and acting remained excellent, there were several poor directorial decisions that ultimately contributed to weakness of the film.<br/><br/>It makes sense that story must be changed from the book, especially since the fourth book in J.K. Rowling's series extraordinarily long, but the filmmakers made several poor choices in developing the plot of the film out of the story of the book.<br/><br/>The most unfortunate of these decisions was the elimination of several key character-developments and plot elements in favor of longer action sequences that have more computer generated animation. While the special effects are wonderful, I think that the films were better when there was a smaller budget and they had to limit the amount of CG effects. In changing several scenes subtly, especially during the Tri-Wizard tournament, the filmmakers did little justice to the humour, the mystery and the magic of the story. Instead of amusing the audience with fun little character elements and quick, witty lines, it seemed like much more time was spent WOW'ing the viewers with epic chase scenes and battles.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed when watching the film was that every scene seemed cut off and abrupt. They limited the dialog to what was absolutely necessary, and over used boring, ""epic"" shots of things that were not particularly interesting.<br/><br/>My main concern is for the fact that, alone, it does not stand up as a film. Even having watched the previous three films in succession immediately before this one, there are so many things left out of the plot that viewers will be utterly confused as to what is going on. This once more comes down to the decision to replace the finer details of the story with wild and crazy special effects.<br/><br/>The next problem with the film that I foresee is the issue regarding future-proofing the plot. In eliminating so many details, the director has done one of two things. He has either set up the next three films to have few details much like this one, as they have nothing to build on, or they will have to be much longer than the past ones, to explain the key plot elements that were left out of this one. Certain key points were excluded from the film, leaving them to be explained by what the viewer remembered from the books, which ultimately yields a rather weak final product.<br/><br/>I was extremely disappointed by the outcome of this film, as the fourth book was my favorite of the six available currently. On the whole the film did little more than create a bridge between ""young Harry"" in books One through Three, and ""Older Harry"" in books Five through Seven. It's really unfortunate that they made this bridge in such a way, as it had the potential to be the best of them yet.<br/><br/>-R66"
"DWeiser05","3","2","3","22 November 2005"," What a disappointment!
","I would like to personally thank the director for ruining arguably the best Harry Potter book and making it into not only the worst movie of the series, but a pretty awful movie in general. By eliminating essential plot points and characters, such as house-elves and Mrs. Weasley, we miss the intricate world that JK Rowling created. This film has been reduced to merely the three competitions of the tournament and the rise of Lord Voldemort. We miss out on the richness of the characters and their relationships. Harry's friendship with the Weasley family is one of the most touching aspects of the series and it grows to become an essential part of Harry's character as he discovers that he can create his own family to draw strength from. Plus leaving Sirius out almost completely reduces his importance as well, and has ruined a great deal of set up for the fifth installment. Additionally, I just find it offensive to Rowling's fans to completely change the plot of Goblet of Fire. The ending of Goblet of Fire is completely surprising, and the film maker has changed it to be completely predictable by introducing characters at inappropriate times and eliminating others. The mystery in Goblet of Fire is completely absent from the movie. Albeit, the humor in this movie is enjoyable, but I'd rather the director not have included his fabricated dance scene and stay truer to the book. The editing and timing of this movie was choppy. Most of the scenes were extremely cheesy, I was laughing during the dragon battle rather than worrying about Harry. Also, the degree to which the characters were portrayed inaccurately was painful. The movie was reduced to mere events and no overall plot. Overall, this film was a huge disappointment and I left the theater wishing they could remake it to be true to the book."
"pixiechic-2","8","2","3","22 November 2005"," Harry Potter 4 ""could"" have been better
","Well, I was pleased and let down by this movie. Yes, I know some of you thought it was great, and some terrible, but we must all realize that, this movie would have never covered the whole book unless it was about 36 hours long. I really wish they would have explained Harry's connections with Lord V. and Cho more. They completely left out Rita's secret, and what was that part with the Horn Tail chasing Harry about? AND!! when i found out they were leaving out Dudely's scene I almost didn't want to watch it.They also left out Winky, how can you leave out someone who connects the plot, without Winky there is no Barty Crouch Jr. mystery. But these are just my own probs. with this movie. I was pleased to see that this movie made me laugh, somethings within the movie really will have you rolling. I loved Ron's attitude, and Hagrid's scenes too. I really don't think I could ever be mad at anyone's attempt to create a Harry Potter movie, at least the director tried and I can see how hard it must have been, ...I guess. I really wish they would have just made the movie 10 hours long, then none of the true Harry Potter fans would be upset. Oh well what's done is done, we just have to hope the director for Harry Potter 5 will read these comments and make the next movie better. I hope they do start making the movies 10 hours long, I think it would really be cool to see if someone could really sit that long. (I think I am up for the challenge)Maybe I am just too wrapped up in Harry Potter...........HA!yeah right, I think anyone who doesn't admit they like Harry Potter and the whole wizarding world should not be allowed to read at all. Overall I really did enjoy the movie and I really thought that it was very intense towards the end. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!"
"silverglass19","10","2","3","22 November 2005"," The very best yet!
","As a massive fan of both books and movies, each in their own right, it seems that I personally have an easier time with the Harry Potter adaptations than other viewers. I went into this installment knowing that certain things had been cut and anticipating that still more things would be. I also went with an understanding that first and foremost this story is about *Harry*--anything that doesn't directly propel his storyline is fair game to find itself on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>That being said, I think Goblet of Fire is truly the most remarkable of the Harry Potter films to date. The imagery is beautiful and intense, and the acting is greatly improved, especially by Daniel Radcliffe who has certainly grown in his comfort level on screen and pulls off his emotional scenes flawlessly this time around. I was also pleased with Michael Gambon's job as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. I loved Richard Harris, and I believe that had he lived on he would have continued to be the perfect Dumbledore, but what the naysayers must keep in mind is that Dumbledore is not only a kindly, chuckling old man, he is also fierce and powerful and, regrettably, fallible--something which I think Gambon is embracing more fully in his own portrayal. He needs only to add back that element of Harris-like nobility and quiet charm, and his Dumbledore could very well be spot on.<br/><br/>Now, being such a fan of JK Rowling's books, I understand completely where others come from when they complain about the little changes, but what confuses me is that when I walked out of the theater at 2:30am on November 18th, I was thinking to myself that GOF had been *very* booky in fact, and an excellent movie besides! For me, the prior knowledge of the book just fills in the gaps for whatever was cut in the film and enriches the experience. <br/><br/>I think the negative viewers sometimes narrow their gaze too completely on what was left out and subsequently overlook the little details, straight from the book, that were left in. For instance: Fred asking Angelina to the Yule Ball; the ""Potter Stinks"" buttons; Madame Maxime's flying horses only drinking ""single malt whiskey""; Moaning Myrtle's talk of disappearing bubbles. It's things like that, I think, that make it very clear that the movie makers really DO care about the books and those of us fans who read them. The fact that Dobby wasn't included to serve a purpose easily served in other ways frankly doesn't bother me at all.<br/><br/>My only issue with this film is that it will undoubtedly be much more difficult to understand for those audiences who haven't read the book. However, those that *have* been fortunate enough to have read Rowling's masterpiece should go to see this movie and try to keep an open mind about it. All the best scenes are there, don't worry. And the heart-and-soul is still the same."

","I thought this movie was well done and fairly true to the book. Book 4 is my favorite so far of the Harry Potter books and I found the movie to be very good. So many people are upset because not everything from the book made it into the movie but realistically if they did that the movie would be 4+ hours long and then you would complain about that! The books are getting darker and so the movies naturally should follow suit. The main part of the Goblet of Fire is the Triwizard Tournament and most of the movie was concentrated on this. They skipped quickly through the beginning of the book so they could spend more time on what was most important. The scenes with the tasks were great, very dark, very gripping. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the Harry Potter series. But if you want all the details, read the book first!!"

I barely understood what was going on. I am disappointed. I hope they do better for the next three movies. As for the acting, it was alright, but the fight between Ron and Harry was a little boring, and I didn't realize that Hermione would be so heartbroken over the Krum/Ron situation-- she cried! But I loved the bath scene with Harry... except for Mrytle-- she was just being sad and pathetic there. I do think that they did a very good job with the maze scene, but Voldemort said Dumbledore's line about love, which made me sad. I hated it when Voldemort tortured Harry, that made me cry, along with Cedric dying at the end. All in all, it was an okay movie, but I do hope that they make a better attempt with the others."

","Note: I have read only the first four Harry Potter books. Take that as you will.<br/><br/>Isn't this inevitable in any cinematic series? Maybe even more so given all of the behind-the-scenes changes between the Harry Potter films? Isn't one of the movies eventually doomed to fall short of its predecessor? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" did.<br/><br/>The story of ""Goblet"" takes a different turn, as the once-in-a-generation Tri-Wizard Tournament comes to Hogwarts, whose top students are joined by comrades from two other schools of magic in battling each other and colossal obstacles for the top prize. As the tournament progresses, Harry Potter endures issues with relationships and a mysterious pain emanating from the famous lightning bolt on his forehead. A very promising premise that ultimately shortarms its potential.<br/><br/>The roots of ""Goblet""'s shortcomings lie in its predecessor, Alfonso Cuaron's ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"". Had ""Goblet"" been released after Chris Columbus's two faithful but uninspired renditions, this movie would have been better. But Cuaron raised the bar for the screen translations with his breath-taking scene-setting and finely crafted shots. He infused the series with life by adding a dose of reality to Columbus's magical world. Newell wisely maintained the grounded portion of Cuaron's tone, but inexplicably drained it of Columbus's child-like wonder, while fading into typical technical film-making, feats that constantly leave the audience wanting more of everything.<br/><br/>""Goblet"" is an epic book, a linchpin as the middle tome of seven. After You-Know-Who was absent in Azkaban, his presence returns here, turning the series in an entirely different direction. But despite the enormous themes of life, death, courage, and danger; despite the fact that Goblet contains more action than ""Azkaban""; despite scenes with Quidditch, dragons, and mermaids, nothing in the movie gets the blood pumping. Even a massive confrontation in the final act leaves one feeling short-shrifted, emotionally for those who know the story and informationally for those who have not. The same material produced a pulsing thread of underlying tension throughout the book, and the absence of that drama points to the way the movie was made. While Cuaron adroitly fashioned a soul for his movie and built everything around that hub, Newell and cinematographer Roger Pratt (""Chamber of Secrets""), who semi-successfully warms up the screen by emphasizing oranges and greens, seem to have ploddingly shot the movie on cruise control. By utilizing far too many close-ups and intercutting tight shots, and eliminating much of the enchanting background, the scope of the movie leans toward claustrophobic rather than expansive.<br/><br/>The music doesn't help either. The fitful work of Patrick Doyle leaves one longing for the occasionally melodramatic John Williams, whose lingering themes are the only memorable part of the orchestrations. The veteran Doyle, who has a few quality scores to his credit (Henry V, Hamlet), seems determined to tell the viewer what to think and how to feel, as though composing from a How-to-write-a-movie-score book. The music intrudes at some key times, then suddenly vanishes at others, screaming PAY ATTENTION THIS IS IMPORTANT in its absence. Like the movie, Doyle's compositions never find a rhythm with the story.<br/><br/>The pacing of that story doesn't aid the rhythm. Even though Goblet as a whole moves quickly, small portions less integral to the core story periodically stagnate the movie. Numerous new supporting characters require valuable time to be introduced; several decent but truncated scenes and characters (Quidditch World Cup, Rita Skeeter, etc.) should have been omitted altogether but were probably crammed in to appease fans; and the broad humor seems forced and out of place. The end result is an choppy episodic olio that deprives the movie of any rapid undertow that might whisk an eager audience into the story.<br/><br/>All of these issues prove that a Harry Potter director should not be merely a guiding hand, but a creative force as well. Fortunately for Newell the source material for ""Goblet"", as in his Donnie Brasco, is so potent that even his workman-like turn doesn't cripple Rowling's towering tale. But his restraining hand lowers the level of exhilaration, the difference between admiring the Grand Canyon from on high and hang-gliding directly between its prodigious walls.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, ""Goblet"" is not terrible, and the massive amount of genuine effort is apparent. The majority of credit for the movie's success though stems from the original story, which weaves classic motifs into a richly textured saga. To transform the book into a bad movie would be a truly stunning feat, one not accomplished here. Many of the effects-laden magical scenes are a treat despite being underdone, and familiar characters in new situations are rarely dull. Most of the adult actors are virtually reduced to cameos; but they perform admirably, except Michael Gambon, who is misrepresenting Dumbledore by stressing anger over wisdom. Separating the kids from their roles is difficult, and perhaps actors with more training could more effectively display a range of emotions, but even that is difficult to say, because these actors are their characters. Replacing these cinematic friends at this point would be utterly ludicrous.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Goblet"" isn't bad, but neither is it actively good or absorbing. Very little wows or stokes emotional fires, a fact exacerbated by Azkaban's pronounced excellence in such situations. If the first and second movies were simple melodies, and the third blossomed into classic four-part harmony, then ""Goblet"" is a barbershop quartet in which at least one part struggles throughout, missing notes and creating a movie that never enraptures as it could, leaving the uninformed viewer partially in the dark, and the informed viewer underwhelmed, longing for a film that fully addresses all the fantastic elements that comprise ""Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire"".<br/><br/>Bottom Line: ""Goblet"" tries to soar to great heights, but finds itself chained down by its own shortcomings. 6 of 10."
"oriflamme24","6","2","3","22 November 2005"," Watch this on a flat screen!
","I saw Harry Potter at an IMAX theatre. Bigger, better, right? <br/><br/>Apparently not so.<br/><br/>First, the IMAX experience. I now believe that IMAX screenings should only be for IMAX-shot movies, not merely reformatting feature-length Hollywood types. IMAX movies are projected onto a 5-storey dome screen. While this makes natural landscapes awesome, the curvature distorts images e.g. buildings. And after 2.5 hours, this reviewer is also left nursing a stiff neck.<br/><br/>Next the movie. Visually, Mike Newell uses beautiful sets and the right measure of special effects at the right time to create a breath-taking and magical movie. He also balances the foreboding grays and damp mood with apt interjections of humour.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment is that the movie merely follows the episodic structure of the book but lacks the pacing, rhythm, defeats and climatic showdown of a quintessential hero movie. <br/><br/>My second disappointment is that Newell's character treatment is sorely lacking. Hero movies hinge on the audience's ability to empathise and root for the characters (think Rocky, Frodo, Bruce Lee). This is a pity as Rowling is gifted at bringing characters to life. As the fourth instalment, this is a watershed moment for Harry. The Tri-Wizard competition offers Harry a series of tests before he takes on Lord Voldemort, the baddest mutha in the human and wizarding world. I'm all for Harry who triumphs with courage, respect for human life and choosing the right decision over the easy decision. However, I feel that Newell should take more than a page off Rowling's Harry  a hero who struggles (genuinely).<br/><br/>With the right ingredients, The Lord of The Rings trilogy has shown us that great books can be made into great movies. Let's hope that this can also be said of the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>Ratings: IMAX Experience  1/5; Movie  3/5; Book  4.5/5"

","Having four nieces its only natural I as a (29 year old) get hooked on the Harry Potter books and movies. I have to say that by far GOF has been my favorite book so far mainly because I am rooting for the Hermoine and Ron coupling lol, so naturally I found myself even more so eagerly awaiting this movie. The thing I liked is that for the most part there were minor changes here and there, but for the most part it stayed very true to the book.<br/><br/>You could feel the awkwardness each was feeling at dealing with the opposite sex. You could see the jealousy that Ron felt when he finally realized Hermione was a girl and her pain at him just seeing it when shes wanted him to notice her all along. I loved how comically gruff Moody was and I was surprised to see that despite my own imagination Madame Maxime was nothing at all how I thought shed look. Most of all I loved the darkness and the edge of your seat feeling you had, especially knowing that Voldemort would be shown at some point they did it so you had no idea when and when they did show him, you had to gasp at his grotesqueness."
"Nevermore1001","10","2","3","21 November 2005"," The Golden Goblet
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was without a doubt my favorite movie so far. The emotions, the story, the music, everything about it was magnificent.<br/><br/>I don't know if this will contain spoilers, but be warned, I may let something slip without noticing. Where to begin?<br/><br/>I'll start with Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes was the perfect person to play the evil menace of the series. Even without a nose, and the cg for that was flawless, he did probably the best performance I've ever seen. The way he casually said lines like (SPOILER) ""I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter"" so casually, and the pure evil that he caused you to feel were perfect. I clearly could tell that this was the ultimate evil standing in front of Harry.<br/><br/>Next we come to the music. Patrick Doyle follows John Williams with a spectacular score. The music for (SPOILER) Cedric's death nearly pulled tears from my eyes, mixed with the screams of Amos Diggory. Voldemort's theme made you see the evil of the man, and the use of ""Hedwig's Theme"" was bone-chilling.<br/><br/>The actors were quite good as well. Harry got the emotion thing down perfectly this time (I don't know if you recall his lack of tears when he was crying in PoA). Fred and George finally lived up to the characters that J.K. Rowling created, and the tasks were quite thrilling. While a lot of the book had to be cut from the movie, they did a fantastic job cutting the right stuff to make it work, even throwing in the backstory behind Neville Longbottom. The beginning, however, was somewhat rushed, even (SPOILER) cutting the actual Quidditch game from the movie.<br/><br/>(MAJOR SPOILER) Now on to the saddest scene of the movie. When Harry returned to Hogwarts with Cedric's body, the band starts playing the upbeat ""Hogwarts March"", which I believe adds to the effect that they have no clue what is going on. It is perfect when they show the faces of Dumbledore, Mr. Weasly and Amos, and Hagrid as they realize that Cedric is dead. The music suddenly changes to the heartbreaking ""Death of Cedric"", intensifying the pain throughout Hogwarts. Amos's scream of sadness could bring a tear to anyone's eyes, showing the first really strong emotion in the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>Altogether, this was by far the best movie in the series (in my opinion). This one finally seemed to catch the feel of the loved books by J.K. Rowling, and the dark themes blended perfectly in this one with the somewhat craziness of Hogwarts and the Wizarding World. I give everyone who worked on this a standing ovation, and two for the person who made it all possible, Mrs. Rowling herself.<br/><br/>The major problem now is that we have to wait until 2007 for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."
"lv9101","5","2","3","21 November 2005"," My favorite HP book but my least favorite HP movie
","I was very excited about this movie and very interested to see how they were going to fit 700 pages of novel into 2-3 hrs on the big screen. Well, now I know... they take a little bit from each chapter, flash 10 min of it on the screen..then go on to the next ""random"" scene. I found my self getting very frustrating to know how important the scene was and what was about to happen, just to be whisked away to another point in time. The actors did a good job though it seemed that Dumbledore was very different from the book. This time around they took many liberties in straying from the original storyline. It is definitely made for people who read the book, people who didn't were getting lost at certain points in the movie. I almost think they should have made it a 2 parter. It had so much potential but was very disappointing."
"pc-67","7","2","3","21 November 2005"," Excellent creation, poor direction/production
","The Harry Potter films are relatively easy to visualise now thanks to previous films and the books already having told the story.<br/><br/>I personally felt that the casting was good, the effects superlative, and the overall story is excellent. It is well worth seeing.<br/><br/>On the negative side I felt that much of the producing work was very poor. Much of the timing doesn't feel right and several things were missing or not done correctly. It was clear that the creators were trying to tell the story in the book but had missed much of the feeling and buildup that had been carefully written into the book, and clearly missed the importance and significance of many things. I'm trying to not put in any spoilers, but I could cite examples quite easily.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe's acting begs a lot more training in certain areas, although his performance as the film progresses seems to improve and nearer the end it finally seems to show some passion.<br/><br/>The direction in general is reasonable, although I actually cringed in a few spots at how poorly thought out some camera directions and movements were done.<br/><br/>In the more climactic scenes the need to throw the camera around too much whilst zoomed in and not give enough of a general view was slightly annoying. They also changed several aspects of the biggest scene of the film (probably to shorten the scene) that really killed the danger and buildup aspect.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that the film is well worth seeing. The special effects department has done a superlative job, the story itself is excellent, the acting from several actors is fantastic. (Although Dumbledore does not seem to be the character from the books at all - he strikes me as extremely badly cast). Alan Rickman's much-needed touch of comic relief whilst maintaining the integrity of his character brought a few chuckles in the cinema. Although Snape is intended as more nasty the laugh is not at crazy antics but rather at the situation and his dismay over what happens."

The underwater prisoners were more like fake dummies. Yuk!<br/><br/>High Points - Everything else! The scene at the Quiddich World Cup and the Death Eaters was EXACTLY how I imagined it!

","There was much to like about this movie, but the thing I must state is that I thought the portrayal of Dumbledore was completely against the character and is irresponsible. He would never lose control like that. If you go back to the book, he uses the same lines with Harry, but he is described as asking them calmly. What is up here? Don't these people read the books? Harris's death was very unfortunate, but for the franchise it's proving deadly. Gambone is so off track that I was offended. I wonder what JK thinks? If I were she, I'd be livid. Too much was also omitted from the end where we are set up for the controversy surrounding Voldemort's return and this made the ending fall flat. Where are all the reactions to what Harry has reported? It was a let down ending."
"yamiseirei-1","7","2","3","21 November 2005"," Just a few thoughts i have about the movie
","Well overall the movie was good with a good mix of teenage problems, scary stuff and humour (Hagrid's love life springs to mind!!) But on the other hand i won't be taking my 8 year old to see the movie firstly because i think the scenes with Voldemort are too scary and there's too much swearing for my liking. I know Ron swears in all the movies but there was more in this and i know it's a 12A but all the same she's pretty grown up for her age.<br/><br/>Anyway i digress, i was disappointed with the music i thought it was a mere shadow of previous movies when i have dashed out and bought the soundtrack as soon as it appeared, there was nothing memorable about the music in this movie. Also i was very disappointed in the fact that the Quidditch world cup seemed to be cut largely i would have loved to have seen more of that - there was precious little Quidditch in Goblet of Fire as it was without no world cup as such either! There was also no big deal on Rita Skeeter's character and she was a huge part of book 4. She was found to be an animagus and revealed about Hagrid being a giant as well as other stuff so i think that could have been expanded. Also there was nothing about what happened to Barty Crouch after he was caught out in the end, In the book he was killed which meant Sirius Black was still to blame and lots of other things like that which as a Harry Potter fan i would consider big deals.<br/><br/>However the good points of this movie are, Hagrid's love life which was hilarious, Ron's dress robes, the Yule Ball which i thought was excellent and the humour but i won't be going to see it again (and this is from someone who went 9 times to the cinema to see Chamber of Secrets!)

"lindamackey2","7","2","3","20 November 2005"," The missed theme
","Let me first start out with a confession: I am a 47 year old Potterhead, who has read all of the published the books way too many times. My four kids, ages 11 thru 18, come to me for answers to their Potter trivia. I'm just this side of obsessive.<br/><br/>Weeks before the Goblet of Fire (GOF) premiered I was surfing the web for clips and tidbits, feeding the burning excitement to flame. I re-read the series to be fresh for my two and a half hour ride with a barrel of popcorn and a free-refill soda. The Saturday morning after opening I serenely hunkered in my favorite theater. It was time! The movie had an excellent opening. Sure I missed the Durseleys and the house elf, but hey- it's a 734 page book! I could deal with most adjustments, and there were quite a lot of them, and most worked quite well. The young actors had matured so nicely, all of them. I loved the way they brought truth to their relationships, in particular Rupert Grint's Ron and Dan Radcliffe's Harry. New additions to the student cast were also top notch.<br/><br/>We were introduced to students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, rival schools with Hogwarts in the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous wizarding competition in which one wizard from each school is chosen to take part. I thought their entrances were a little silly, even out of place, but I didn't mind that too much, nor was I overly concerned with Professor Flitwick's ridiculous new look. But when under-aged Harry Potter's name came out of the Goblet of Fire, a magical device that chooses the champions under a magically binding contract, something went horribly wrong with the movie.<br/><br/>Dumbledore threw a hissy fit, slamming Harry against a wall! Dumbledore, who is gracious yet firm, protective, loving, full of humor, would never manhandle his students -especially Harry. Michael Gambon seems to have no idea as to who this most remarkable wizard is, yet I don't put the blame on him alone. Director Mike Newall had the responsibility to block that scene. Or was it written that way? There were certainly things written for Dumbledore that shouldn't have been, especially in the scene when he confesses that he is so confused that he doesn't know what he is doing. Bad business, that. Instead of inserting doo doo like that the writers should have expanded his speech at the end to set up the split between the ministry of magic and those who would follow Dumbledore. We never really saw Dumbledore in GOF.<br/><br/>In addition, Voldemort's return in the graveyard was much like a poorly done community theater with somewhat cool computer graphics. Ralph Fiennes must never have heard that stillness is strength; he was flopping all over like it was his first acting class scene. He was trying too hard, but again I blame Newall. His Wormtail and Deatheaters had no real fear of Voldemort, with Lucius Malfoy almost defiant with him instead of reverently fearful. The costumer couldn't seem to find a robe that made him look like a Lord, and his eternally shiny skin looked a bit fakey, as well. The scene was rushed, devoid of suspense, and left me cold when I should have almost wet myself, what with a free refill soda already in my bladder. <br/><br/>By the end of the story we should have felt Harry's sense of isolation from a happier school full of students who had never been in the graveyard, but again, Newall fails to give us this. It seemed that he started to, but changed his mind mid-scene. We should be left with anticipation for the next movie, for the beginning of the war between good and evil to come, not just by some vague lines, but by a troubled Harry and his concerned friends, trying hard to smile but not truly succeeding.<br/><br/>While GOF was technically beautiful and astounding at times, and while the teens going through their hormonal madness was enjoyable, it failed miserably in making us, along with Harry, love Dumbledore and what he stands for,and fear Voldemort, hating what he stands for, the major theme of the Harry Potter series."
"loki-cg","5","2","3","20 November 2005"," Piece of w/e
","This movie if one could call it a movie was somewhat depressing for many facts some being that jumps from section to section with incredible space there is no build up to any kind of climax. Newell screwed up horribly on this and should be fired, in my opinion combine the abilities of Chris Columbus, and Alfonso Cuaronin the fifth one to hopefully recover from the tragedy of this film. I will admit though that some of the scenes were very beautifully done but that does not make up for the constant go - stop motion of the movie. Bloody horrible. Bah. In there attempt to not make the movie to grown-up is blasphemy the characters are growing up so must the characters in the movie. The movie only flows at the end so if you want to waste money on watching it over and over and say its the best yet, would be tarnish the good book. All in all the movie is maybe 2 stars tops 2.5."
"squirrellover69","7","2","3","20 November 2005"," Strong special effects but story is lacking
","I felt quite a bit disappointed after seeing this movie and spent the whole car ride home arguing with my husband about the quality of the film. If you are looking for a lot of great special effects then this is the movie for you, if you actually read the books and are looking for the film to replicated the feel of the book then you will most likely be disappointed. It seemed to me that the director was to caught up with making the audience go ooh and ahhhh over the effects that he forgot about the story. I did like that Warner Bros. didn't try and P.G. rate this film because then it would have just been awful. Little Harry is not so little anymore and I was shocked at the number of children under age 6 in the theater, most of whom were completely uninterested or scared by the film. As a fan of the books first and the movies second, I must say that this has been the biggest Potter disappointment to date. I just hope that Warner Bros. finds a better director for the next film that will actually work in some type of underlying story to go with the special effects."

I thought that it kept an exciting pace, but the dialogue between characters was a little confusing. The other three contestants hardly said anything and the whole thing seemed a little disjointed. Some of the special effects were outstanding, especially the underwater scenes. The ending seemed particularly rushed. Well, we better hurry up and get the bad guy in here now, so we'll be sure and be treated to another movie. I really liked the other two movies but this one was the weakest.

"xtarget","5","2","3","20 November 2005"," Bad Editing and Transitions
","Loved the first 3 HP movies. Enjoyed them 100% This one was just OK. It could have been much better. My biggest problem is technical editing and transitions.<br/><br/>For example, in the beginning, the viewer doesn't even get to see a bit of the Quiditch game, are never more than introduced to Krum, when everything is shift to inside the Weasleys' tent and the Death Eaters start mayhem causing Mr. Weasley to get the family moving out. Next thing you know everything is a burning ruin, with little to no explanation. Then the Dark Mark is displayed in the sky. That's it. Not much more, and pretty much we're in Hogwarts next. Transitions were non-existent. I have no clue how anyone who does not know the story could know what might have been going on...<br/><br/>And the most terrible example of editing came three quarters of the way into the movie when Harry, Ron, Hermoine and Hagrid were walking through the woods (for no particular reason I could discern) and there was a momentary flash on Barty Crouch Sr. laying on the ground. The next thing you know Harry is going up to Dumbledore's study, and no subsequent explanation for that scene is ever uttered for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Of course, if you've read the book, you already know about Crouch being in the woods, but the movie had the one fleeting and unsupported scene, with no apparent connection to anything at all."

I know there is a huge cult following for Harry Potter, and I just don't see why. I could care less about any of the problems these nerds had. I wanted to smack that red-headed kid in the face so much for his wining and his latent homosexual tension our hero Mr Potter. Jeez, what a rip.

","i really, really wanted to like this movie. i love the books, as most people do. but. i don't know. just everything was not quite right. i know they had time crunches and its hard to get everything from the book into the movie. but. some things, it's like. it wouldn't take any more time to do. i really wondered if the director actually read the book. first off, the traditional HP music wasn't there. i love the music, and i think that the music is REALLY important. and when Cedric died and when harry came back from the graveyard, the scene didn't evoke any emotion from me. i cried when i read the book, but, i was like...um? this is corny music. also. Dumbledore's whole portrayal. he just seemed so agitated in the movie. he couldn't control his emotions. in the book, its not like he suppressed his emotions or didn't feel the guilt of everything that was happening, but in the book, a lot of is was shown through the eyes. and that he was a strong wizard...so he wouldn't get so frazzled. (for lack of a better explanation) i just didn't think that Michael Gambon did a good job at portraying the essence of Dumbledore's character. the acting on a whole... i just didn't like. as the story progresses (the books) the books are darker and darker. and i don't think Daniel, Rupert, or Emma really did a great job at it. it seemed forced. i don't know. you didn't feel the pain nearly as much as you should have. or how much of an impact it had on me in the book. it was superficial, you could say. they showed like...almost nothing of the World Cup and wasn't Barty crouches Jr.'s hair blonde? and i thought Moody's hair was dark brown. it wouldn't have cost THAT much to get actors with the color hair that was correct. there were just so many little things that didn't go parallel to the book. oh yeah. and Barty Crouch Jr. wasn't even in the first scene with Wormtail...in the maze, i mean, the maze was pretty cool, the helicopter scan, but, i mean. what was the thing with the moving bushes? i don't ever recall there being any hedges that strangled people. the spider, the sphinx, or the sparkly field wasn't there. but devil's snare was there. and that wasn't in the book. the graveyard scene wasn't even that intense either. when the reflections of all the people Voldemort killed came out, i remember in the book, they looked almost solid, almost real...but i could hardly see what they looked like. oh and they didn't show Bertha Jorkins come out. they left her out the of the movie totally. everything just didn't seem to scale very big. i mean. the crowd before they went in the maze....it seemed so small. it seemed more like a circus room with the band. oh and the lake looked more like a river. and the landscape didn't even coincide with the book. when harry looks in the pensive at the scene with his father, they were lounging around the lake on grassy knolls besides the lake. i don't know about you. but. those cliffs don't look like you could chill on them. maybe i'm a purist about the movie. but when there are so many blatant mistakes...even with small details. i liked the other three movies, just not this one."
"camums08","9","2","3","19 November 2005"," A Fantastic Movie
","After the third movie, I thought the fourth won't match up to it. But, lo and behold, it was, in my opinion, the best Harry Potter adaptation yet. It was faithful to the text most of the time, which is great because it gives the other people (who haven't read the book) the opportunity to watch and understand it based on the real story. It is fantastic how the movie people were able to add humor and romance to it. The visual effects were AWESOME. I, as a reader, couldn't imagine it any less than the effects they showed on screen. It was a little disappointing, though, that the Quidditch World Cup wasn't shown fully. But the presentation of the leprechauns (of the Ireland team) was enchanting! (too bad they weren't able to show the performance of the veelas). I was also a bit sad that they didn't show Bagman and all the other important characters (like Dobby and Winky) although I commend the cast for their excellent acting. They are indeed growing up (Radcliffe, Watson, Grint, and the others) however they still are the perfect actors for the characters of Harry, Hermione and Ron. No one can do it like they can. Cheers to another great Harry Potter movie! Hats off to the actors and to the people who worked behind the scenes, you've done a marvelous job. Overall, it was a movie definitely worth watching and would be an outrage to miss."
"AustinML37","3","2","3","19 November 2005"," Part 1:Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire review
","OK its me and my friend Caitlyn...we just we're so disappointed about this movie because we had such high hopes...here is part 1 of our review: This is the official Harry Potter review written by freakishly obsessive HP freaks, Aubrey A. Rose, and Caitlyn J Leiter-Mason. Enjoy! First of all, we are not going to try and talk you out of going to see it, because we know you will. No matter we say you are going to want to see it for yourself so go see it and be warned, but remember what we tell you!!! <br/><br/>1. Mike Newell seemed to not be able to make up his mind on what kind of film he wanted to make. Maybe he missed the memo that he was doing the fourth and best HARRY POTTER MOVIE!!! Instead he tried to be artsy, big mistake; you get all these random artsy shots that make no sense just for the granola loving freaks. Then there is the cheap over done comedy, with all the freaky jokes that make no sense, there are a few good actual ""Harry Potterish jokes"" but when you get to those you can't properly enjoy them because all the other jokes were so forced and out of place. Also, Mike Newell seemed to have some kind of short-term memory loss because he placed foreshadowing hints that he later forgot about them. WE hope to god he is not asked to continue filming, luckily the Harry Potter directors rotate yearly.<br/><br/>2. We'll start by saying that the whole theater was filled with forced laughter from the poseur Harry Potter fans! The whole first half of the film was filled with cheesy ""teen movie"" jokes. The film was so obviously directed towards the teenage a.k.a ditsy generation.<br/><br/>3. Dan's performance was shocking! For some reason, his acting was too forced and did not seem as real as it used to. I'm afraid that some of his mediocre acting rubbed of on his friend Emma Watson, for her performance was surprising too. The two of them acted no where near their potential, could it be there aging? The stress? The new director? What ever it was, let's hope it corrects itself in the next two years.<br/><br/>4. The beginning was AWFUL!!! It didn't feel at all like Harry Potter, the opening was all weird and they messed around with the theme and used violins playing the theme in MINOR!!! It set the stage for a totally screw up of a movie.<br/><br/>5. The best part about the 4th book was seeing was Frank Bryce thought about everything. He didn't over hear anything and they used the same clip at least three times in the movie!!! Barty Crouch Jr., who I'm sure you all know from the books, was introduced rather awkwardly and was thrown into the first scene with Nagina, Wormtail, and Voldemort. No one could follow this scene and it was not dramatic enough. It was so rushed! 6. Suddenly we were in the Burrow and it did not feel like it at all. Mike Newell screwed the whole house up and it just sucked! By the wayÂ…no Mrs. WEASLEY! She was not in this movie probably for good reasons. I'm assuming she saw how much of a screw-up this movie was going to be and bolted! Anyway, the Weasleys' walk in their backyard into a horribly animated forest. U would think that with all the money coming in from the first three movies would cover a set for an actual Burrow and a forest. Instead we were stuck with cheap animation. They are then greeted by Amos Diggory and Cedric jumps out of a tree. Need I say more? Randomly, they are on top of a mountain and surrounding a boot 7. The port key scene, wow!!! I am guessing, well hoping that Mike Newell has a bunch of spy kids obsessed kids, because if he doesn't then, wow, he needs serious help. The people are spinning around like the thumbs-thumbs do, personally I wouldn't have noticed if they have thrown them in there.<br/><br/>8. They get to the quid ditch cup and all the tents were set up, here's how the quid ditch cup went: Irish, Bulgaria, Snitch and over. You don't even know who wins. There is a dancing leprechaun,and animated Krum flying everywhere and it looks like crap. Nothing works of feels right. No Winky! Fudge releases a snitch and it ends a bunch of jokes about Ron and his special friend Krum and its over!!! It was horrible!!!!!! 9. Then Mr. Weasley walks into the tent and is like ""kids we got to go to the port key"" and they are like ""huh?"" and they look outside and there is chaos. No one in the audience had any idea what was going on and it just looked like a bunch of football fans running around being chased by the Klu Klutz Klan."
"ser478","5","2","3","19 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the Gigantic Disappointment
","This movie could have been great. It had amazing potential. But director Mike Newell squandered that potential and hacked this wonderful book to bits. Granted it is a huge tome and cuts were necessary, but the story could have been woven back together much more seamlessly in capable hands. Instead, it felt disjointed and rushed, almost as if Newell had a checklist: Quidditch World cup...check, Dragons...check, Voldemort...check. The imagery was fantastic and the world of Hogwarts is growing ever dark, as it should be. However, the characters seemed flat and devoid of any depth this time around. There was plenty of action but little emotion. The one bright (dark?) spot in this film is Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Lord Voldemort. Perfectly evil and inhuman and sufficiently creepy, Fiennes did an excellent job. And the kids are getting better with each film. Unfortunately, all the talent in the world couldn't save this movie. As others have summed it up, great visuals, horrible content (or lack thereof, rather)."
"ouchoooof","5","2","3","19 November 2005"," Cut to almost nothing
","SOOOOOooooo should have been split into two movies. With what was worked with the story was very incomplete. Granted, it's not possible to condense 750 pages of book into 2.5 hours of movie; much the reason for splitting.<br/><br/>Fluer was wooden. Krum and Diggory were spot on, and Harry and crew put forth a fairly good performance. The Quidditch World Cup was a major disappointment showing only a minute, if that, of action.<br/><br/>A high point, the Weasley Twins do play more prominent parts.<br/><br/>And Since when did McGonagall teach the Gryffindors how to dance??? Come on Hollywood there are more than enough ""Good"" laughs in the original text why do you have to make up something that was good for a single ""HA!"" when you could satisfied all the fan boys and girls out there with JKR's material?"
"dereksmith27","7","2","3","19 November 2005"," Let's get a Dumbledore who can act!!!!!
","There are many redeeming and highly quality performances in the Goblet of Fire, however, I don't feel Albus Dumbledore is one of those performances. In Prisoner of Azkaban I felt that Dumbledore's performance was uninspired at best, in Goblet of Fire he was hyperactive, constantly seeming weak and deferring judgment on important matters to others.. I feel as though Richard Harris was far better because he played the role in a way that oozed confidence. I felt as though he was in control of every situation and would allow it to play out as it would with the confidence that good would prevail. In a word, he was wise. Wisdom that comes from experience. The actor who plays Dumbledore now does not convey the confidence or control that I feel Dumbledore (as portrayed in the books and in my mind) possesses. Richard Harris was a Dumbledore that was as constant and steady as the North Star, this Dumbledore seems more like a weak and fragile old man who doubts himself and his abilities.<br/><br/>Mad Eye Moody, however, was spot on. I thought Hamish (from Braveheart, don't remember his real name) was awesome and stole the show in almost every scene he was in. Overall, good movie, but could've been so much better."
"dstarr-4","6","2","3","18 November 2005"," Missed opportunity
","I loved the first three Harry Potter movies and have been looking forward to The Goblet of Fire. But this movie wasted some great material. For instance...the arrival of the ship and the flying carriage with no warning or subsequent explanation. My wife had to ask me what they were for! It seemed like most of the dialog was shouted and rushed. There was almost no character development and little interaction.<br/><br/>At least a few scenes were good: the dragon chasing Harry and the graveyard scene with Voldemort. But what happened to the house elves? Any of them! We see Rita Skeeter for about two seconds! Whoever decided to make the movie in this form should keep in mind all meanings of the word ""rubbish!"""
"cherryblossom419","4","2","3","18 November 2005"," Definitely disappointed
","yea sure its got more action then the other films but thats just about it. the acting has dropped a bunch, there was overuse of words by twins and lots of poor hollow acting. I was really disappointed at how pathetic voldemort was, come on hes suppose to be this mighty person but he was portrayed as this higher pitched man. i was expecting booming low or something frightening. There was definitely a lack of character development everything was like event event event and just kind of lost its magic for me in the process. If you are a die hard fan go see it but if it didn't have the glory of harry potter and bringing a well known book to life i really don't think it would get very far."
"jay-burgess","9","2","3","18 November 2005"," Good film but bits missing.
","Just seen the film & thought i had to write a short comment about it<br/><br/>With out spoiling the film too much for those who haven't seen it. Do not read to book before you go & see it, I thought i would refresh my memory by reading the book a couple of days leading up to watching the film. This is fine all the main part are in the film but as its 2hours & 40 mins long i guess they had to cut out a couple of story lines & re gig some scenes so the film would make sense. Like many people now I have sat through all the L.O.T.Rings too which were a lot longer than that. I would have preferred if they had put in an extra 40 mins & got the missing story lines in the film. Everything else visually about the film was Fantastic. Great & Believable special effects, Shame it wasn't a bit longer:)<br/><br/>(Spoiler coming up) Did the writers not read the book there was a character called ""Ludo Bagman"" in it & where was Molly Weasley??? What happened to Rita Skita,Sirius Black (3 mins) & there was not one house elf in the film. Worst of all Idon't remember( & correct me if I'm wrong here) One mention about the Longbottoms being tortured, Which is, (If you have read all the books)a crucial part of the story line. Lastly what happened to the awaited challenges in the third task? Bogarts,Spinx's, Giant spiders. Disappointing not to see them at least rather than a psychotic hedge?<br/><br/>OK Gripe over The film was fantastic, Funny, exciting & moved along swiftly. Keeping to the main points of the book based around the Tri Wizzard tournament. Dealing with adolescence & some fantastic acting by all involved. Faces new & old all played their characters to the point that JK would be proud. Even Mad eye Moody was convincing though I expected more of a grizzly version of a ""Rif Raf"" rocky horror cum Richard OBrien type character. The World cup was excellently stunning visually but no match to watch for us quidditch fans. Overall I give this Film 9/10 as the only thing that let it down was the missing bits from the 2nd best book of the series. (I hope film 5 will be more in keeping with the book.) <br/><br/>Note to Warner Bros' Please try to make the next one a little more like the book.Its disappointing when JK goes through all that trouble to build a scene in your head & you wonder how will they do that or what will that look like in the film only for it not to happen. Lets see those house elf's in the directors cut eh?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance."
"Blacklab92797","Null","2","3","18 November 2005"," This Sucked!
","This movie was horrible in my opinion, they left out so many crucial details. Like Harry gives the Weasley twins his winnings. And where the hell is Sirius throughout this movie? And Ludo Bagman? And I wanted to watch the match, but No they cut that out. Where are the Roberts flying up in the air? And what happened to Harry and the rest running for the woods? And wheres Winky and the top box and Harry's wand being stolen? and Dobby? and S.P.E.W????? And where are Bill and Charlie??? and why wasn't Harry at the Dursleys' house? and what happened to Cedric's mom? Where the hell did she go? and Bertha Jorkins???I just can't imagine how anyone could like this movie, if they read and enjoyed the books. This is just my opinion."
"andrewmhough","6","2","3","18 November 2005"," Half Empty Goblet
","Well after its long awaited release, does this film live up to the Hype? The answer is NO, Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire was a big let down. Mike Newell had the perfect opportunity to exploit the 500+ page JK Rowling novel but instead only scratched the surface.<br/><br/>The film from start to finish moved slowly and at times almost stopped this was apparent by the number of kids in the auditorium talking amongst themselves.<br/><br/>I think it's time for Mike Newell to hand over the Directors baton to someone else for the next HP instalment. Might I suggest a Mr Peter Jackson?"
"nervous2006","10","2","3","17 November 2005"," Deep, Emotional, No Messing Around
","You could say that the other 3 movies are just fun kid movies compared to this one. Things get more personal and serious. In the other films they would let little mistakes and things pass, but in this one, there's no messing around...You already know the characters, so this movie doesn't take much time to just show them hanging just having random conversations. Instead this movie is non-stop intense straight to the point action. Amazing is what it was, AND LONG TOO. Long in a good way, some long movies are bad, but ones like this that are very informative the whole entire time, with intense action a long side that are why movies are made.<br/><br/>This movie takes you to Hogwarts! In the other films it mainly concentrates on showing you what its like. But in this one, you already know about it and so your there.<br/><br/>Good movie, Emma Watson is beautiful and does a good job, so does Radcliffe and Grint.<br/><br/>AWESOME MOVIE, GO SEE IT, OF COURSE......"
"christianlozono","10","2","3","17 November 2005"," Awesome Movie, director has done a good job ....
","Well, I am not a Harry Potter fan, I never read the books and it never bothers me, but as my friends took me to this movie, I immediately fell for this. I recognized a very deep character change / alter, which is totally new in the Potter movies (I watched 1,2,3 directly afterwards). The characters grew up and mutate into young sentimentally people with many adventures and creatures and particularly magic. What can I say, it's truly the best Harry Potter movie ever, and I hope the next will get even better, what I really doubt. It's kinda weird, but I think it couldn't be done any better, so i recommend it for everyone - young and old.<br/><br/>10/10"

","The dark forces of the fourth Voldemort gradually emerged, deliberately throwing Harry Potter's name into the Goblet of Fire. Harry Potter grabbed the Goblet of Fire with the help of Sirius and friends.And he was transmitted to the land of Voldemort's rebirth. Diggory was killed. At the crucial moment, Harry Potter's parents used magic to save Harry Potter, and gradually raised the confrontation between Harry Potter and Voldemort. This one is a turning point, starting with Cedric's death and Voldemort's return, which means that the Harry Potter series is no longer a teen movie, but is slowly turning into an adult-oriented adventure movie, and the war is paved the way."

Never having read the books apart from a chapter to my nephew years ago at bedtime and scared him,so he said,I dont have prior knowledge and well it's witchcraft innit so all reality is binned and anything can happen despite at its core,a kind of restrained version of St Trinians,with most of its characters middle class and despite an enormous suspension of disbelief, respectful old buffers who just happen to be carrying wands.Add to that some impressive baddies and the sweet friendship between the front three and you have a hit.All done without Judy Dench,

"nitro72","6","1","1","4 January 2019"," Overblown Pomp & Circumstance

"alcantaraj-16594","10","1","1","24 November 2018"," HP MEETS HUNGER GAMES
","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is nearly as good as its predecessor thanks to the triwizard tournament, the Yule ball, Voldemort's return and the story. It genuinely felt like I was watching a hybrid of HP and Hunger Games. I definitely consider it as one of the best HP films of all time."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","1","19 November 2018"," Not kids' stuff anymore...
","Starting with a frightening gallery of skulls out of which emerges a menacing snake, the first shots of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", directed by Mike Newell, are already tainting the atmosphere with an unusually disturbing darkness. Yes even by Hogwarts' standards, there's something quite unsettling in the opening flashback.<br/><br/>From the perspective of an elderly gardener, we see a young man mentioning the name of Voldemort while leaning his head over a cradle whom occupant needs no hinting. The ugly sight of Peter Pettigrew makes the instant connection with the previous film. Finally, a snake seals the fate of the poor gardener who's zapped from existence in a lightning flash that reveals it was a vision from Harry Potter all along. A grown-up Harry.<br/><br/>And this time he's already in good company as it's Hermione who awakens him with Ron not too far. From the absence of the Dursleys, I felt the saga reached a point of maturity that allowed it to start without the usual preliminaries. And the film does make quite an impression from the start, showing Harry and his friends at the Quidditch World Cup, a part that made me expect an orgy of CGI-loaded acrobatic stunts.<br/><br/>Yet just when I thought the film was going to exhaust itself with special effects, the chapter is abruptly closed with the interference of the Death Eaters, frightening creatures who look like the kind of minions Voldemort would have and whose sense of fashion remind of some triple-lettered Organization. When Harry was knocked over and woke up in a landscape of ashes and desolation, I was confused. Why would the film set us to such exciting game just to cut instantly into it?<br/><br/>Well, technically, the part represented 200 pages in a book four times longer and it wasn't much an adaptation as it was a compression of a story of epic proportions, a story whose length was probably justified by its key significance in Harry Potter's canon. The film could have worked perfectly without the World Cup but it' a memorable moment nonetheless and it ends on the ominous note of a skull and snake forming in the sky, to keep us on guards before the return to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Then the tone changed so drastically I couldn't see where this was leading to. I guess there's a reason why these films are so long. Now, I don't know exactly if I should go into the Triwizard contest hosted by Hogwarts or that final act directly. I guess both work for the exact same purpose as they highlight the maturity of the main characters from the first crushes that start to titillate their hormones to their studies. The contest offers a perfect backdrop for what constitutes a great blending between the high school movies and Harry Potter's usual formula, adding new layers of complexity... with the same old recipes.<br/><br/>So for one hour and half, we see Harry battling a dragon, trying to decrypt a message, learning new secrets from the new Defense Against Dark Arts Teacher Alastair 'MadEye"" Moody, you know... routine stuff. In the meantime, we also see him asking a girl out, getting into a feud with Ron... we see Hermione finally blossoming into the beautiful girl that never fooled us and Neville getting more confident. It's all the more natural that the Hogwarts regulars (Dumbledore, Hagrid...) are relegated to the periphery of the story. Kids are growing up indeed. We finally discover that Hogwarts had its jock all along in Cedric Diggory (a pre-""Twilight"" Robert Pattinson) a nice and popular kid who's so perfect I knew he would be involved in some dark twist. How wrong I was while still being right!<br/><br/>So the middle-act while spectacular, exciting and full of intriguing subplots, i rather conventional and not without a few loose ends... but it culminates with a last event taking place in a maze and whose final outcome is Harry and Cedric grabbing the trophy that turns out to be a Portkey and then transports them in a setting we've never seen before and well, what goes after is the kind of ""thing"" I could not have guessed coming. While processing the ending, it all makes sense, it's all been leading up to that point. I said about ""Chamber of Secrets"" that it made the first film feel like an appetizer, well that's what ""Goblet of Fire"" does for the first three movies.<br/><br/>Indeed, it was time for Harry Potter to meet his nemesis Voldemort... and he makes quite an entrance in Ralph Fiennes, whose traits, voice, mannerisms and hideous face truly match the fear he's been inspiring during the previous films. The shock coming from his reveal and the death that goes with it announce us the real path the adventures of Harry Potter are taking as we have to accept the imminence of a confrontation between the forces of Evil and the Good. Yes, the series is taking huge mythical proportions... but are we surprised?<br/><br/>I said that ""Azkaban"" put the franchise at cruising speed, I should have waited till I saw ""Goblet of Fire"", it was merely a take-off and while the film just feigns excitement and fun, harboring the usual stuff of action-adventure and youth oriented film with all the usual manufactured special effects, all these elements are instantly disclosed with that final act whose erupting violence totally justifies its PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Yes, there's quite a gulf between the first and the fourth opus and even the audience is expected to be mature enough to handle the secret that goblet of fire is hiding. ""Goblet of Fire"" is a departure from the tone of the previous films and can be regarded as both a masterpiece of direction and... misdirection."

","In this installment of Harry Potter,Harry is at his 4th year where he has a crush on a girl and tries to ask her to prom,Ron gets jealous of Hermoine being in a relationship with another guy who asked Hermoine to the prom and we even get to see Robert Pattinson as Cedric who's a new character. Harry of course ends up completing a tournament where he ends up anticipating in this tournament(who didn't even sign in). The tournament involves a fire breathing dragon. Of course we get new charcthers like Cedric including actors Brendan Glesson(as Mad Eye Cow),Timothy Spall and David Tennant are all in this film. Mad Eye Moody(Gleason) is a new teacher who teaches Harry and his very peculiar towards Harry Potter. Could he be Voldermort in disguise or someone working for Voldermort(aka He Who Must Not Be Named).<br/><br/>Overall I liked this film. It is scary towards the end and I like how we get to see Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger are sorta starting to become more closer(even like I have mentioned Hermoine goes to the ball with someone else and she ends up being mad at Harry & Ron).<br/><br/>The effects are great and I love the dragon scene. Robert Pattinson was great too in this film."
"colm-hearne365","9","1","1","15 April 2017"," The best Harry Potter movie ever!
","The reason why I think Goblet of Fire is the best out of all the Harry Potter movies is because it's the most exciting, action-packed, darker, suspenseful or even romantic. <br/><br/>One of the things I loved about it was that it was the one with the most new characters: Victor Krum, Cedric Diggory, Fleur Declour, Rita Skeeter, Cho Chang, Mad-Eye Moody, the Patil twins, Barty Crouch Sr., Barty Crouch Jr.. They also did a really great job on the Tri-Wizard Tournament. The tasks were so action packed and fantastic. My favourite character in this one is Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson was so great as him. And he's probably one of my favourite actors from my country. <br/><br/>Another thing I really liked about the first touch of romance in it. There were a lot of fine girls in this film: Hermione Granger, Cho Chang, Fleur Declour and the Patil twins. One of my favourite scenes was the Yule Ball. Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) looked so beautiful in this scene! One of the biggest things about this film is the return of Lord Voldemort. I just loved all the special effects and magic and how organised the plot is. The Harry Potter books and films really inspire me to become an writer myself. Also, happy birthday to the very talented and beautiful Emma Watson!"

","Harry Potter number four can't be accused of being the best of the bunch, but it has its moments. The addition of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory was good, a role he plays better than Edward in Twilight. And Brendan Gleeson as Professor Mad-Eye Moody was excellent.<br/><br/>The closing minutes of the film are truly the best, frightening maybe, but the scene in the graveyard makes the movie. It's at this point in the series that you get the first glimpse of Voldemort in his true form.<br/><br/>It's too bad that Robert Pattinson couldn't have continued in the Potter franchise, as it would have benefited him far more. The mood of the entire series changes during this installment, from sunny and warm to dark and cold!"
"Kweh-chan","2","1","1","1 April 2016"," An absolute insult of a film
","An incredibly vibrant and powerful book has been turned into a bland and outright offensive pile of garbage.<br/><br/>When a novel is adapted into a film, I know that not every detail can make it into the final cut, particularly when dealing with such an enormous work, but in this instance, I feel that the complaint is justified. It feels almost as if a completely different work were adapted. The acting ranges from poor at best, to just cringe-worthy on a number of occasions; this would be upsetting on its own, but in one instance, it completely alters the characterisation of Dumbledore. Here is a wizard known for his calmness and placidity, now turned into an unpredictable and almost violent being, when he grabs Harry and actually pushes him into a glass cabinet. The casting choice was awful for Dumbledore, but that's another complaint for a previous film in the series. Emma Watson grows worse with each passing second in the series, making her character little more than an overly dramatic teenager. There's not really a single character with more than two lines who is well-acted in this film.<br/><br/>It's not just that the writers have left out entire key details from the novel (Ludo Bagman, for example), but many have been replaced, entirely. The maze is the worst offender of this. Originally intended to be the most challenging trial of the tournament, it was, in the novel, filled with a variety of mythical creatures and concepts, which would test even the most skilled of witches and wizards in their Defense against the Dark Arts knowledge and capability. This is, instead, replaced with a simple, nondescript hedge-maze, and vague hints of possession, condensed into about three minutes. The entire final act of this film is just incredibly rushed. It's as if they went all out on the first two trials, even excessively so with the dragon chase, and as a result, left no time, creativity, or maybe even budget for the final and most important test. It felt like little more than an obstacle to the writers, which just needed to be overcome in order to get to the climax with Voldemort...which was equally clumsy, rushed, and cringe-worthy. <br/><br/>I could go on and on about how bad this film is, and make entire lists of every cringe- inducing moment, from Hermione's fake French-accented ""Grindilow,"" to the overblown entrances of the students from Durmstrang and Beauxbaton, to Mad-Eye Moody's own entrance. It's just an awful, AWFUL film, and, in my opinion, an insult to Harry Potter novels. I'm not a Potter fan, but I've read the books countless times, and they are dear enough to me to actually cause me anger when watching this film. If you want an exciting, vivid, imaginative, and even deep journey, go read the novel, and stay as far away from this abomination as possible. If, however, you're looking for a cringe-inducing couple of hours to blow on a mind-bogglingly awful film, then grab your popcorn."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","1","20 January 2015"," Part 4 of the franchise, the kids are growing up
","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is film number 4 in the series and probably my 3rd favorite. Films number 1 and 3 are still better I believe. It is directed by Mike Newell (""Donnie Brasco"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), the only film by him just like with Cuarón previously. It's adapted by Steve Kloves as usual from Joanne K. Rowling's novel. The film was Oscar-nominated for its art direction and it is the first movie that does not start at Potter's home with his aunt and uncle.<br/><br/>Basically, this film is another great adventure with more competitive aspects than the previous movies as Hogwarts takes places in a complex tournament (Triwizard Tournament) against other magic schools and we find out a bit about the Quidditch world cup and also about a companion for Hagrid. The addition of Robert Pattinson before his Twilight success and maybe with the role that helped him in becoming Edward is also worth a mention. Also, it has Brendan Gleeson, who is as much fun as always as a grumpy mentor to Harry, who, however, seems to have his very own interests as well. There's some cute humor like Dumbledore (played by Gambon again after Harris' death) telling Mad Eye Moody to keep an eye on Harry. Then, there is also some arguing going on between Ron and Harry and Hermione finds another potential love interest. For Harry, it was Ginny in the last movie, here it is the Asian girl. The arguing part, however, felt weak to me. It was undeveloped and just included to create some tension which never really added much to the film, however. Meanwhile, Harry and Ron are looking for female dancing partners as well.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was maybe the dragon egg sequence early on. Myrtle gets a short comeback too, but her role is much smaller than previously, which is fine as she is a character that never did too much for me anyway. Another criticism would be that Potter almost becomes too superhero-like for my taste here. That whole innocent schoolboy aspect seems almost completely gone and occasionally the way he is portrayed as the new messiah is slightly cringeworthy. All the different challenges are fun to watch though and there is really nobody in the cast who doesn't give an at least solid performance. Especially Fiennes and Gleeson work very well with their characters. The fight between Potter and Voldemort reminded me a bit of the light saber sequence from ""Star Wars"", so powerful and colorful, red vs. blue. One thing I was wondering about, however, was when there was all this trouble and hullabaloo with somebody missing from Azkaban in the third film and here nobody really recognized what was going on until Moody re-transforms into his real self?<br/><br/>It's probably not a perfect film, has a flaw here and there and may be worse than previous installments, but ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", which runs for over 2.5 hours, is still a very entertaining watch I believe. Recommended."
"OllieSuave-007","6","1","1","16 June 2014"," Getting to the darker side.
","Based on the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, this is the fourth film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story where Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year, getting himself participating in the Trizwizard tournament, his name having been picked out of the Goblet of Fire to take part in the challenge, even though he is under age. In addition to dealing with dragons, sea creatures and a terrifying maze, Harry must come face-to-face with the invading Dark Lord. <br/><br/>Based on just the movie itself instead of comparing it with the book, the story takes on a more darker tone and tense drama as we see more of the Dark Lord and more of Harry's struggles as his past and his enemies torment him. I think the actors did an OK performance in this one, not very convincing or powerful as in the previous three films. At times, I even thought the acting was a little juvenile among Potter and his friends. I do, though, especially like the part where MadEye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) turns Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) into a rodent or some sort. <br/><br/>The special effects were pretty good and the battle between Potter and the dragon and him getting zig-zagged in the maze were exciting. But overall, this is a slower-paced movie and not as captivating as the previous films. <br/><br/>Grade C"

","It is rare that a film lives up to the book, quite understandable. Any spectator & Harry Potter reader is aware of it. But how much you can indulge? I don't comprehend how Rowling could agree on this script. The movie is a disaster. And I see Kloves get the job for the next part as well? If I was a producer I would not give the dude any job ever again. From a magnificent plot tailored by Rowling he managed to make some atrocious and puzzling B rate movie script. Obviously cuts leads to some alteration of the original plot. Still things make you wonder and frown, or even worse, you want to scream ""what the f**!"" Why on earth the shy, mysterious and rather subtle Krug was made into a testosterone pile of muscles? His romantic relationship with Hermione stays, yet it is made completely ridiculous – listen to that and hold on your chair firm, at some point Hermione tells Harry (about Krug) : victor is more of physical being.not particularly loquacious. WTF???????? You won't see a trace of house elves, thus the whole Barty Crouch Jr plot was altered. You won't hear about his relation wit his father, you won't hear his confession explaining various mysteries accumulated along the storyline. And best of all, he pops in 1st scene of the movie, in the room where Voldermort is discovered by the old housekeeper. In the scene when Harry experiences Dumbledore memories Crouch Jr isn't even on trial (wtf?) . He's denounced by Kharkaroff and appears like a possessed fanatic shouting and screaming... Raping the plot isn't the only thing Kloves managed. He also managed to add stuff of his own (God forbid him ever write a script again) – like the 1st task scene where all sudden the dragon instead of guarding the eggs comes off flying and chasing Harry all over Hogwarts. 2nd task, since there is no Dobby, brings Neville giving Harry the gilliweed, apparently a rare ingredient, which of course Neville got outta nowhere. 3rd task is a joke, NOT ONE creature appears in the maze, just wind and mist. No sphinx, no spider, nada. The movies is full of bad written scenes and things happening deus ex machina. Harry finds Barty Crouch dead (again creative touch of Kloves... sigh) and goes to tell about it Dumbledore, but never actually does! (lol?) The 2 schools arrive at Hogwarts, a scene of cheering and interested looking students, yet the tournament wasn't even announced. You won't see an inch of quidditch except a short glance on teams entering the stadium during the world cup. Of course , no Veelas either, which rapes in its turn the whole Fleur Delacourt intriguing charm aspect. Hagrid brings Mme Maxime to show her the dragons, she shouts ' Magnifique!' while you don't see any dragon yet, they are in crates and only then few moments after break out... Karkaroff is showed entering the room with the goblet of fire, yet his involvement in the plot is never revealed. We are to think that he did put Harry's name in it. If he didn't , why he ever entered that room so sneaky way at all? Fact that Karkaroff runs away after the 3rd task is not even mentioned. Dumbledore runs and shouts like an enraged nazi... When Harry talks to Moody in his room, the chest moves and shakes suspiciously (hint for morons added by Kloves) We got a dancing lesson scene, not in the book, which Kloves obviously found of more added value that all the things he shamelessly cut out already. Weezleys don't appear for the 3rd task at all. There is no argument, no developed scene between Dumbledore and Crouch which would explain what problems will be facing Harry, Dumbledore in the next part. Rita the paparazzi, animageus? Nope, you wont even know. I pity people who came to see this film, not having read the book, because they might be confused and lost, and I pity all HP fans for having endured this. If Reader Digest rewrote Harry Potter, it would be not bad as this. And from what I hear the next part is even worse. Read the book, it's fantastic. Watch the movie at your own risk. Few weeks passed and I still can't shake the disbelief you could make it so bad."
"elfflame","6","1","1","18 June 2007"," Not even half the story this time--and certainly not the important part
","An intro: I am a Harry Potter fan and I hated this movie.<br/><br/>Just so people who read this review will understand where I come from, I have to say I'm a Malfoy-booster. It's not that I think they're good-hearted or anything like that. I just don't think they need to be turned into cardboard cut-outs. I was thrilled we got to see them at the World Cup, but even though they had lines, they just seemed too flat. I wanted Lucius and Arthur glowering at each other. I wanted a Harry/Draco faceoff!<br/><br/>And the Ferret scene? Just painful. Why did he go into Crabbe's trousers? And we were completely robbed of Draco in dress robes. But it was the graveyard scene that really upset me. In the book, that scene is chilling, and Lucius still managed to somehow hold his own against Voldemort. I was glad he was there, but he just sounded like a whiny kid.<br/><br/>Snape fared better, but his best scenes were completely disposed of. I did enjoy him knocking Harry and Ron's heads while they studied, and his scene threatening Harry with the Veritaserum was nicely done. But even so...We needed to see that Snape had the Mark on his arm, and to see him shove it in Fudge's face. <br/><br/>I came away from the movie thinking ""There's no way they'll be able to keep going...They've dropped too many threads."" No Bella. No explanation for how Barty Jr escaped (or why the guards wouldn't have noticed...). No blackmailing Rita Skeeter. No explanation of WHY Moody's lesson affected Neville so heavily. And, of course, there's no absolute certainty that Snape's a Death Eater! Or how about Fudge's utter denial that Voldemort is back? They've left so many of the pieces unmentioned that the next movie will have no cohesion at all.<br/><br/>Oh, and the major subplot--Barty. Now, I knew this would make or break the movie, because it's the central part of the plot. And they totally failed. I know they were trying to avoid having to explain certain things, but honestly, this is getting ridiculous. In the book, there's a lovely ambiguity to Barty Jr in the Pensive scene. It's utterly important to have that to show how he and his father interact, in my opinion. And that not everyone is JUST good, or JUST bad. It's part of JK's message. They made Barty into this total caricature, and it really didn't work. <br/><br/>Other bits:<br/><br/>* The pensive scene: I can understand why they did only one scene, but it should have been Barty & Co's. That would have been much more effective to show the Crouches's relationship. If they didn't want to deal with the Lestranges, they could have cut them out. It would have worked fine without them. And it would have made both characters far less ridiculous than they became.<br/><br/>* I do think that Fiennes was excellent. Not creepy so much as subtly evil, and I think that was exactly what we needed--a slow build to the fight. The cauldron changing with him was a bit much, but walking around barefoot was a nice touch. When he moved Cedric's head with his foot, I shivered. The end of the scene--the fight and escape--came too abruptly, though I'm thrilled they showed the ""shadows"" at least. Lily and James actually got to speak... And speaking of parents, Amos cheering for his son when they appeared... I think my heart nearly broke... <br/><br/>* I loved Cedric. I think some of his scenes seemed a bit much, but when it came down to it, we got all of his character in one movie, so they did a good job, considering. I did want to have Amos going on about how his son beat Harry Potter, though. It seemed rather central to his character. He seemed too bland in this one.<br/><br/>* The DE costumes: I can see how they could take those tall pointed hats as sort of the ultimate wizarding accessory, but they looked ridiculous. Couldn't someone have said, do we really want them to look that idiotic, or that much like KKK members? I did like the way Voldemort whisked the masks off their faces, though.<br/><br/>* I wasn't sure about Gambon in POA, but now--I don't like his Dumbledore. He's too angry throughout this film, and it really bugged me. Harris would have pulled it off so much better.<br/><br/>My favorite bit: Neville. Neville and all his reactions, particularly Neville and the gillyweed! Nev actually got to help Harry for once. And Neville dancing. Neville and Ginny forever, man! He was so adorable. I just wanted to give him a big kiss on the cheek."
"mcgriswald","5","1","1","28 January 2007"," Everyone got shortchanged
","For the apologists for this movie, I have to admit they have a point. The special effects are exemplary, and to the non-Potter reader, it certainly is an eyeful.<br/><br/>For all the British schoolchildren who are Potter maniacs and have universally expressed their extreme displeasure, I feel your pain. Goblet of Fire is my favorite of the Harry Potter books, and it is a pleasure to read the extreme detail and careful subplots that JK Rowling has crafted.<br/><br/>The biggest loser, however, was anyone with a financial stake in the movie: Rowling, the studio, and the investors.<br/><br/>Originally, GOF was planned as a two-parter, to be filmed simultaneously like the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The two parts could have been released 8 or so months apart, and would have effectively doubled the income from the film--had it been true to the book, repeat viewings and increased DVD sales might have tripled that income.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for both the fans of the book and the monied interests, the director was talked into condensing the book into one film, and the result is less than satisfying to all concerned. During filming, JK Rowling was either pregnant or had just given birth, so her attention was expectedly elsewhere, but I don't doubt that if she was giving her full attention to the film she would have insisted on a two-parter.<br/><br/>Given the reaction of her fans to the movie, I am sure she has some second thoughts about that decision."
"kalikat2010","3","1","1","10 January 2007"," More CGI, Less Magic
","The first two were fantastic, and the third one was average. The fourth is horrible. This installment in the Harry Potter saga is a shame to any Harry Potter reader.<br/><br/>The three tasks were wonderful in the novel, but in the film they were drab and lifeless. The first task was probably the best of the three. The dragon was well done. The second task was very lame. The mermaids and weird squid-things were very fake. The third task was so disappointing. They made you think it would be good when they showed this huge maze, but then the cup is found in less than five minutes. Also, what was up with the wind blowing through the maze? Voldemort could not have been any stranger. He looked like Michael Jackson. He wasn't menacing or evil enough for my taste. One final thing, why were they wearing designer clothes? The robes made it more magical. Very, very upsetting.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was too dark, stupid, and it didn't convey any sense of magic.<br/><br/>Unless you didn't read any of the books and like teen angst, it was a terrible experience."
"joesgirljeri","2","1","1","17 October 2006"," Another movie... another disappointment
","Having been so thoroughly let down by the previous three movies, I waited a long time to see this one. Not for its big-screen release, not for the dollar theater, not even for the DVD release... I waited until I could borrow it from the local library. I didn't miss anything.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has proved that a complex and intricate fantasy novel can be translated convincingly to the big screen with Lord of the Rings. The team working with Harry Potter however, is not proving as successful. The HP movies are less of a brilliantly realized vision of JK Rowling's fantastical wizarding world and more of a caricature; all of the high points exaggerated with none of the depth and texture of the original. <br/><br/>As usual all the interesting details that made the books so enjoyable are completely missing. The movie lurches along from highlight to highlight, special effect to special effect with no thought for the plot whatsoever. Crucial characters are left out (Sirius, Bagman, Dobby, Winky, Fudge) while the effects-laden first challenge takes up way more screen time than necessary. Where is Dumbledore's final disagreement with Fudge? What happened to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes? Where is Percy as Crouch's assistant? Where is the back-story with Bagman, Crouch, his son and the Death Eaters? Where is the end of the movie with Dumbledore sending out his team to combat the growing threat of Voldemort's return? Where is the budding attraction between Ron and Hermione? Why does the director seem to be an advocate of Harry and Hermione getting together? No part of this story holds together, because all the little bits that tie it together are missing and it's certainly not setting OOTP up to be a success either.<br/><br/>With the exception of Snape and McGonagall (excellent performance as always), the rest of the cast appears to have mistaken voice-volume for acting. Characters scream and holler at each other during every critical point of the film. Hermione makes her Oscar-bid by resorting to near-tears-shouting every time she tries to make a point. Moody yells his way through each scene. Ron bumbles his way around, far more clueless and stupid than he should be. At one point Dumbledore actually grabs Harry, yells in his face and shakes him, so totally out of character for Dumbledore that I was ready to turn off the movie altogether. Harry actually doesn't do as much yelling as his fellow actors; he plods through his performance with all the emotional range of a garden rake. Apparently he thinks that if you throw out enough baffled looks and end every scene with a meaningful-seeming raised eyebrow, the audience will mistake this for a stirring performance. The end scene with Cederic, Voldemort and Harry's parents should be tense, exhilarating, frightening and passionate yet I felt nothing; Daniel Radcliffe isn't a protagonist that you can really root for.<br/><br/>Worst of all is the portrayal of Dumbledore. Gone is the kind and wise yet subtly dangerous old professor, to be replaced by a confused, bumbling, shouting (of course) and abrupt one. Dumbledore in the first movies was exactly as the books depicted him, this new character falls far short. <br/><br/>If you haven't read the books, I don't know how you could possibly expect to understand the movie on its own. It doesn't set up the 5th movie very well. I think I'll wait for that one to come out on TV to save the trouble of driving to the library to borrow it for free. It's a nice movie to look at, just don't expect to understand what is going on. All in all, a major disappointment."
"cunctator-2","1","1","1","13 August 2006"," The worst Harry Potter movie!!!
","One thing I'd recommend to every person who votes HP-4 as the best in the series, or anything but a disaster, would be to go back and watch it again or, more importantly, read the book at least few more times to get a sense of the story, characters and many other elements,... Dumbledore, Voldemort and... almost every other character in this film are portrayed as though the director had never read any of the Harry Potter books in his life. I watched the film only once and will never watch it again... unless, I really want to torture myself with a type of pain that any cruciatus curse would ever deliver to a tasteful person's mind. P.S. Most likely the worst Harry Potter movie ever!!!"
"jlbart74","2","1","1","8 July 2006"," Harry Potter Goblet of Fire a let down
","I have seen all the Harry Potter movies that are out now. Harry potter and the Goblet of Fire was a Disappointment to say the least. I understand completely that they cannot put everything that is in the book in movie. But they could have at least not cut so much of the book out of the movie. They cut so much out of it that I had to go back to the book just to find out what was missing because it didn't fit together the way the scenes jumped around. The beginning of the movie left out why they were going to use a port key and where they were going. It just left him asking questions as to why they were doing anything they were doing. Didn't explain why Krum was such a big deal. Which is also at the beginning of the book."
"RimonaSkywalker","5","1","1","15 June 2006"," Different world
","My first reaction on this movie was something like: ""Oh my god, they totally changed the whole story!"" And I still think it's true. I know the book four is too extensive to get everything in one movie, but than they should film two parts! That would be absolutely great. I missed so many wonderful scenes like the Quidditch World Cup (they didn't even say who won!). The storyline was crowded into too short time, one action scene by other. People who didn't read the book may like it, but everybody who did must know how many things they changed.<br/><br/>The worst thing in this movie was the atmosphere. I was always imagining Hogwarts as a medieval school, full of ancient things and with that medieval atmosphere. Prisoner of Azkaban has everything I wanted Hogwarts look like. But this movie is more from nowadays, for example the discotheque after the Yule Ball-I truly hate that scene. Of course it's nice idea, but it doesn't belong to HP world. <br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like is music. Patrick Doyle is good, I kinda like some of his scores, but after real master John Williams it seems so poor and without emotions. I rather do not mention that song ""Do the Hipogryff""...<br/><br/>Okay, that's almost everything for the bad =o) Just that scene with the dragon. Too long, too boring. I really don't thing the idea with breaking the chain was good. I would delete that scene and add something better-even from the deleted scenes, maybe that one with Snape and Karkarov.<br/><br/>But of course it's still Harry Potter, at least the main characters are still the same, so I can't say I HATE that movie. I just don't like it so much as the others. For acting I would like to show my opinion that Emma Watson was much more better in the first movies before she grew up and ceased to play spontaneously. I think she's endeavoring too much. Rupert Grint is still the same for me, that means not the best, yet not the worst. However I can put glory on Daniel Radcliffe. I didn't like him so much in the first movies, but now I can see he's getting better and better. I'm not professional to talk about acting, yet I see he's really good. He's playing with a lot of emotions and mainly with heart. When I see him on screen I'm not looking at ACTOR, but at HARRY POTTER. You may say that's normal because we know him mainly from this role, nevertheless I do not see Hermione, but still the actor. I can't explain it, it is just so.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed was the scene at the graveyard. Even if I didn't think Ralph Fiennes will be the right one for playing Voldemort, I think he did great job. He wasn't so scary, anyway I liked him. When Harry gets back with Cedric's body and don't want to drop him, I am always close to tears. Daniel played it so emotive!<br/><br/>And that's all I guess. Sorry for my English, I'm not so good at it."

","This fourth movie presents almost totally new genre in Harry Potter -movies. This ain't any more a recollection of the events taking place during the WHOLE year. Movie itself is a very good one but it concentrates way too much on the competition leaving behind all too many characters and incidents. I read somewhere that there were plans to make the fourth book into two films. Why on earth they didn't!?! This is no longer a Harry Potter -film if you compare it to the first three; This is a film of Harry Potter's one adventure - as if someday there would be films called 'Hermione Granger and The Decline of Dobby' or 'Doing Time With The Dursleys'"

""He just runs away for 2 hours. Then learns one spell that just happens to save the day"".<br/><br/>Again the kids acting is bad. Ron is improving somewhat.

"uknortherner2000","8","1","1","21 March 2006"," A truly entertaining movie, but some ropey acting and appalling dialogue disappoints in places
","We're now into the fourth year at Hogwarts, and of course Harry Potter is in mortal danger. Well, isn't he always? We are introduced to the Death Eaters, he finds himself being put forward for the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and to round it all off, he comes face-to-face with his old pal, Lord Voldemort. So at the very least, the core storyline makes it across from the book. And that's about it.<br/><br/>What we get is a two-and-a-half hour roller-coaster of action scenes, melodramatic situations and suffering, all uncomfortably compacted with little room to spare for the side-plots that the book puts in place for Order of the Phoenix. In fact, there are many questions left unanswered, even if you just stuck to the films. For instance, why is Sirius in hiding, and how will Rita Skeeter's much reduced on-screen presence affect the plot development in the next film? There isn't a lot of effort made in tying up the loose ends, to link Goblet of Fire to Prisoner of Azkaban, or even to set the stage for Order of the Phoenix, but I think a lot of this comes down to the fact the franchise seems to run through as many directors as Hogwarts runs through Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers. The lack of consistency from one film to the next is starting to show, and the risk is that the later films will simply become standalone 'episodes' rather than a series as it should be.<br/><br/>The dialogue can be weak in places. There didn't really seem to be a need for Ron to swear at Harry at all, especially after ten seconds of deafening silence, and for some inexplicable reason, Emma Watson (Hermione) seems to have developed the urge to overact again, in a similar fashion to Philosopher's Stone. We know she can turn on the waterworks at will, but there are times when you hope she can portray Hermione being happy, just for once and without a forced accent.<br/><br/>With the absence of many key characters from the book, several elements of the Tri-Wizard Tournament are left to the main characters to pick up. Dobby the House Elf, who featured heavily in the book, is absent altogether, even though he plays an important role in the second challenge. Instead, it's Neville Longbottom who has to pick up the slack there.<br/><br/>Yet despite all these problems, the film is actually pretty good. The dialogue though weak in parts is genuinely funny, as is some of the on-screen antics of the characters, with several instances seemingly more ad-libbed than what had been written in the script.<br/><br/>If there was one major gripe I had, then it would be with Michael Gambon. I thought he played a good Dumbledore in Prisoner of Azkaban, but I'm less convinced this time around. Dumbledore is rarely aggressive in the books and there's no reason why he should be in the films either. I feel it is pretty bad form not to carry out some research before reprising a role. In this case, Gambon should've been reading the books in his spare time.<br/><br/>A minor gripe to coincide with what I've written above is the general atmosphere of the film. The book was extremely dark, and there were moments where I really felt emotionally strained reading it. Sadly, this isn't so for the film. The dark atmosphere has been toned down considerably which removed some of the heightened sense of fear that was supposed to permeate throughout not just Hogwarts, but the wizarding world as a whole.<br/><br/>The Yule Ball, a fairly minor event in the book it has to be said, also seemed to water down the moody atmosphere, although the set-to moments between Ron and Hermione were as good as I could've hoped. In those rare moments you actually see Hermione being happy, you could almost guarantee Ron would find some way to scupper it. In fact, the funniest moment came during one such argument, when Harry turns up out of nowhere only for Hermione to order both him and Ron to bed, like she was their mother. If there was one moment when the on screen character had been a virtual copy to that of the book, this was it.<br/><br/>Overall, it's still worth seeing. It may lack the tension and atmosphere of the book, but in no way does that make it a bad film. I'm still curious why the content earned it a 12 rating here in the UK, when it was far less scary than Prisoner of Azkaban, but that's the censors for you. It's not necessarily worth owning on DVD (although I do), but it is worth seeing at least once. Truly entertaining, but technically not the best Harry Potter offering to date."
"sbrobin","5","1","1","20 March 2006"," Average film unless compared to the others
","As a fan of all the previous Harry Potter films, and having read all of the books, I was really looking forward to ""Goblet of Fire,"" especially since it was my favorite book as well. That may be why I was so disappointed after actually seeing it. The main problem with ""Goblet of Fire,"" is that Director Mike Newell tried to condense way too much into a two hour movie. I know this has been a criticism of the previous films, but I have never agreed with it until now. There is no way to include everything from the books into the films, and in most cases the cuts in previous films have been just. However in this case, the book was way too long for a two hour movie.<br/><br/>Noticeably absent are the relationships between Hermione and Ron, Harry and Cho, and Harry and Draco. Harry and Draco are enemies, and their rivalry has always played a very large role in the books, especially given Draco's actions in future books. His character had roughly 60 seconds of screen time in this film and a handful of lines. His scenes could have been cut out completely and it wouldn't have changed the movie much from the way it turned out. Professor Snape was given a similar treatment. Newell tried to display jealousy between Ron and Hermione, but it failed miserably as they did not have development for the audience to believe in it. The character of Rita Skeeter was introduced as a nosy reporter, however she added absolutely nothing to the movie and is another character that is very prominent in the book, but could have been completely cut out of this film and it would not have made a difference.<br/><br/>The majority of the movie focused on the Tri-Wizard tournament, which was very well done, but was not the focus of the book and made for a film that kids would probably love, but does not do justice for the adult viewer who wants to see more character development. The final task of the tournament, the maze, was not adequately explained at all. In the book, the maze brings out the worst fears in someone and turns them against themself. In the movie, it was condensed to just being a creepy maze that attacked you with roots.<br/><br/>My other biggest problem was with the casting, specifically Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum. I've heard the complaints of Gambon not living up to the precedent set in previous films by Richard Harris, and never believed it until now. He comes off completely out of character from the Dumbledore in the book. He is gruff and abrasive in this film, at one point grabbing Harry and shaking him violently. Where is the wise and compassionate, yet still powerful, Dumbledore from the books? Ianevski looks good on the posters, but his acting seems too unseasoned for a role this big. Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour are very well casted however."

","Maybe I was spoiled by the first movie where they didn't cut out half of the story, Harry didn't look 25, and Dumbledore seemed calm and sage instead of a jumpy crack head, but the Goblet of Fire was a major let down.<br/><br/>I am not sure how they justified cutting so much of the book out of the movie, unless they were trying to save money on making the film. <br/><br/>Maybe the director has a hard time reading and just had someone animate the book for him, but I couldn't have anticipated such a poor translation to the big screen. All they cared about was the action, the story seemed to be trivial."

"kool_83","8","1","1","4 March 2006"," Harry Potter Fans won't be disappointed this time
","I for one love the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling. I can't wait for the 7th book to come out! But I hate it when movies based on books do not measure up to the original. This movie however is an exception. Harry Potter fans won't be disappointed by this flick. <br/><br/>To better explain my position, lets first review one of the previous Harry Potter flicks. I was a little upset by the fact that the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie didn't explain information that could help non Harry Potter readers to understand the plot more. One such example is how the movie didn't explain the reason behind why Harry's father (James Potter), Sirius Black, and Peter Petigrew became 'Animagus' in the first place...""So that R.J. Lupin wouldn't be alone when he transformed into a werewolf"" (This detail is a real tear starter in the book). The third rendition of the Harry Potter book is in many peoples opinion, their favorite book in the collection. But the movie failed to capture the heart felt and especially touching qualities of the book. I do however give director Alfonso Cuaron props (I also like his previous work especially for the movie Y tu mamá también ... I implore people to watch it) for capturing the darkness of the book. He managed to make Hogwarts castle and all its surroundings as goth and dark yet majestic in size like the Harry Potter books suggest.<br/><br/>So, what makes a movie based on a book good? it is one that does not fail to explain important information that keeps the plot going. Even the littlest of details can astound a person and should never be underestimated. This flick is one movie that does recognize what is important and whats not. It succeeds in capturing everyones qualities; Harry Potters (Daniel Radcliffe) will to prove himself, Ron Weasleys (Rupert Grint) comedic grace, his desire to for once be noticed like his friend Harry, and his puppy love for Hermione, and Hermione Grangers (Emma Watson) cleverness and emerging beauty at the wizarding ball (sorry no glass slippers Cinerella...just wands). I mean, the movie even captured Hagrids human and giant blood as he tries (note that 'tries' is an understatement) to clean up for Madame Olympe Maxime. <br/><br/>What also makes a movie good is when it can target an audience of all ages. You won't get bored with this movie...its a never ending campaign of deadly battles of Harry competing against the 'supposedly' ""of age"" elite potential young wizards of the wizarding schools until the end...the challenge to reach and capture the goblet of fire hidden away in a labyrinth of tricks and ominous schemes. The movie truly keeps you on the edge of your seat with its magic spells and magic duals with enemies like Vodemort (Oops! I mean 'He Who Must Not Be Named') The movie keeps you wondering ""who did it"" until the climax and the truth is all revealed...sorry that you have to wait until the end of the movie to find out. But I promise you won't get bored! <br/><br/>This movie proves that Harry and the gang are all growing up with the raging hormones to compete! The majority of the important details of the book are in this movie. Hey I'm definitely getting the DVD for this flick! This movie does leave you feeling like you left the theater on a Firebolt!"

","This is one of the best movies of the series so far, The Prisoner of Azkabhan was also incredible, I am 35 years old and as a father of an 11 year old I have seen all of the movies as soon as they come to the theater. This is by far the best one for adult viewers and still appeals to the young people as well. My son and I both agree that this is the best one so far and I hope that next ones will be as good. The movie has a tight storyline as expected and the cinematics are superb. The only complaint I would have is that the story was cut up so much to make it fit into the time line of the movie. If you are interested by the movie, I would recommend reading the book to get the whole story. As a matter of fact if you are interested by the movie and haven't done so yet, read the stories from the beginning."
"Elswet","9","1","1","24 February 2006"," Beautiful, But Disappointing.
","There was a lot of debate at the beginning of this project concerning the options of making this two separate films, going long (there was talk of a 3-hour film), or just trying to lump it all into one feature-length film and be done with it. I must say, I was hoping for 2 separate films. I don't think I would have minded that sacrifice just to have a comprehensive chapter of this saga.<br/><br/>But before I start, let me say that all three main actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, have grown exponentially in their talents!<br/><br/>There were many things left out, nuances from the novel which went unused, and whole ideas/parts of the original literary work which were entirely ignored.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!! <br/><br/>Fleur was not nearly as saucy as the novel portrayed her. <br/><br/>There was no giant spider in the labyrinth. <br/><br/>Neither was there a sphynx; a creature I was highly anticipating, by the way. <br/><br/>After seeing the treatment of the hippogryph Buckbeak in the PoA, I was certain the sphynx would be completely AWESOME. No sphynx/sphinx. <br/><br/>And also absent was Hermione's campaign against the abuse of house-elves known as ""SPEW."" <br/><br/>And, I must add that I was a bit...disturbed by the wardrobe choice for the Death Eaters. They were dressed as KKK members, but in dark robes instead of white. I realize this style of dress far predates the Klan, but in this day and age, it's the first thing to be brought to mind by that headgear. Perhaps this is just an American phenomenon? Are the KKK not world-wide? Or was this intentionally done to demonstrate to the children that these are evil men?<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Gambon's interpretation of Albus Dumbledore this time around. He put more of himself into the part, and stopped attempting to ""do"" Richard Harris's Dumbledore. While it's NOT the Dumbledore from Rowling's work, I've come to admire his attempt in GoF. <br/><br/>Whether by natural aging or a decent dye job, Radcliffe's hair is darker in this installment, but oddly enough his eyes seemed to change from blue to green, off and on again, throughout the movie. Radcliffe's acting is maturing with him, but crying on demand seems nigh impossible for the lad. It could be that he's led such a sheltered and/or protected life that he's nothing upon which to draw that instantaneous grief many actors use to perform this task.<br/><br/>Fred (James) and George (Oliver Phelps) Weasley were suitably brought forward, marking their positioning for Movie 5 (OotP). Although Harry failed to hand over the gold coins won in the Tri-Wizard Tournament to the lads to begin their business, I'm sure the next director will make do with what set up was left for him, and find some way to incorporate that into the next installment. It's a necessary detail, in My opinion, which was totally left out of this chapter. It's needed, in order to maintain the continuous storyline between the cinematic attempts. Without that detail, there leaves a long, empty path which will remain untrodden in upcoming theatrical events. That would be highly disappointing.<br/><br/>We're shown for the first time how Neville reacts to the Unforgivable Curses, but not told why, as is appropriate. You don't learn until Book 6 (HBP) exactly WHY his reaction to Mad-Eye Moody's demonstration, was so strong.<br/><br/>Emma Watson (Hermione) was completely ready for this particular treatment. She was beautiful. Quite lovely and all grown up. I know her father must have felt SO proud to see her looking so lady-like, and without showing even the slightest hint of too much skin.<br/><br/>The best scene? For Me, it's a toss-up between Draco-the-white-ferret being tossed about by Mad-Eye Moody and Harry's scenes with the Horntail. <br/><br/>A CNN reviewer stated that this film ""tries to do too much."" Well, in my opinion, it didn't TRY, it succeeded! It started off well, ran well, and ended well. There was not one moment of wasted film. Not one bad cut, not one lost second. From start to finish, there was meat and potatoes, but that's not all it gives its viewers. There are lovely bits of wonderful pastries and a fine dessert as well.<br/><br/>Aside from what was mentioned above, GoF was everything for which I had hoped. As promised, the dragons were superb!!! I would have loved to have laid eyes on the Chinese Fireball, but if you really want to see what it looks like check out The Noble Collection, where you can also purchase a sterling silver Time Turner!!<br/><br/>The performances were beautifully directed, the cast was perfectly chosen, and the only complaint I had whatsoever concerning the performance executions was that of Fleur. Clemence Posey was the perfect actress for that part, but for some reason, Mike Newell traded in her sexuality and self-possession for a ""girl-next-door"" persona. I don't know why he felt the need to alter that character in such a drastic way, but it just did not achieve what he meant to achieve unless that was to rewrite a whole new personality for one of the principle characters in this chapter.<br/><br/>But for book lovers everywhere, take heart. The story IS here. While some of the details were left off due to time constraints, and some of the lines were moved around due to contractual obligations, the meat of the story (and there IS a LOT of story here) remains completely intact.<br/><br/>The flying horses are so realistically layered, textured, executed, and presented! I couldn't take my eyes off of them! They were magnificent!<br/><br/>I can't WAIT to own this on DVD!<br/><br/>It rates an 8.7/10 and is, by far, the best HP movie to date.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Budget: $140M Opening 2-Day Weekend Box Office Ticket Sales: $101M Not bad, you guys. Not bad!"

","Personally, as a movie fanatic and a HP book lover, I am sorely disappointed with all of the HP movies. Casting Daniel Radcliffe as the main character must have been the stupidest thing in the world to do. Mr. Radcliffe can not act, can not cry, can not do much but stand there repeating lines as from a script. I do not know why he was nominated (along with Emma Watson) for a Critics' Choice Award for his part in The Goblet of Fire, but I know one thing for sure, the only reason Harry Potter is even receiving attention is an international phenomena that has gotten too popular for people to notice the many flaws in the entire fandom."

","This movie was possibly the second worst movie I've seen in my entire life (only Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was worse). Not only did they fail to cover the nuances present in the book, but the acting was just plain dull. Sirius Black only appears once in the entire book and only through the flames! He's supposed to be staying in Hogsmeade in a cave! The problems with Rita Skeeter were downplayed dramatically as well, as were Harry's problems with his scar and Voldemort. To the director/screenwriter: don't cut so much. If the movie gets too long, oh well. If you're going to make a movie based on a book, you need the nuances that are present inside the book."
"TashC","8","1","1","1 February 2006"," Harry's Baptism by Fire
","In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth in the Harry Potter series, the adrenalin of competition, fear of the unknown and the surge of adolescent hormones make for a powerful potion indeed. This is a story of tournaments and trophies, where heroes are simultaneously idolized and envied. And it is a story fuelled by adolescence, with all the agony and uncertainty that accompanies self-awareness.<br/><br/>Adapted from the J.K Rowling book by Steve Kloves, who also adapted the three previous films, Director, Mike Newell, set out to create ""an absolutely classical thriller"". He admits to being ruthless in taking out elements of the book that are not consistent with this genre. With no time for our banal Muggle world, the film concentrates on the Magical realm with its limitless ability to amaze and surprise. As he builds on the dark moodiness of the previous film, Newell does provide some humorous relief and there is a highly suggestive and infectious thread of romantic opportunities.<br/><br/>As with the previous films, the CGI special effects are phenomenal and key to creating the magical and dramatic world of Hogwarts. With the entire film immersed in the world of magic, the integration of the special effects in The Goblet of Fire appears seamless and utterly convincing.<br/><br/>The return of the Voldemort's faithful followers, the Deatheaters, and their disruption of the Quidditch World Cup sets an ominous tone for another contest, The Triwizard Tournament. The tournament pitches champions from three of the largest schools of wizardry against each other. Delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang dramatically arrive at Hogwarts to learn that the Ministry of Magic has imposed an age restriction on contenders  only students who are 17 years or older will be considered to represent their school. The selection of the 3 competing champions falls to the powerfully magical object called the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>Although Harry Potter is only 14 and clearly not interested in the ""eternal glory (that) awaits the student who wins the tournament."" he is the unprecedented fourth champion selected by the Goblet. And so Harry is pitted against the other more mature and able champions in 3 life-threatening tasks that rely on both his knowledge and use of magic to succeed. If this was not daunting enough, the dark forces of evil manipulate and intimidate and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is finally given form.<br/><br/>But there is more than just magic in the air. Harry and his friends are battling to discover who they are and becoming more aware of those around them. The film masterfully illuminates this key crisis of adolescence. There is heightened excitement in the preparation for the Yule Tide Ball and the agony of securing a desirable dance partner in time.<br/><br/>As in previous films Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the only known person to ever survive the unforgivable curse of Avada Kedavra, is often an onlooker  observing from the sidelines. He is thrust into the spotlight against his will and without confidence in his abilities. He confesses ""I'm not ready for this"" only to be told ""You don't have a choice"" and in response to the question ""What are your strengths?"" he quickly admits ""Really, I don't know"".<br/><br/>Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) is responsible for many of the humorous quips in the film. A sports-loving, bum-ogling teenage boy whose mother has no idea of acceptable attire, he cannot help being envious of Harry and battles through the confusion of his role in events. ""Yeah, that's me. Ron Weasley. Harry Potter's stupid friend."".<br/><br/>Perspicacious and practical Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) seems to be way ahead of the boys in all things and is often frustrated by their lack of maturity and insensitivity. Though she does not suffer many of their insecurities, she cannot escape the changing dynamics of their friendship. Ron tactlessly tries to invite her to the Ball with ""You're a girl"" and she retorts ""Oh, well spotted"".<br/><br/>Whether a tribute to Mike Newell's directorship or a testament to their experience and maturity, all 3 of the key players  Radcliffe, Watson and Grint - deliver their best performances to date.<br/><br/>The film also introduces Mad-eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who is staggering as the new teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts. He is an incredibly damaged visual reminder of the dangers of battling against evil. And the sensationalist reporter, Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is appropriately brash with overt sex appeal and her lurid imagination.<br/><br/>From the awesome sensory overload of the Quidditch World Cup, where the stadium rocks with adrenalin, to the Triwizard Tournament at home at Hogwarts, hormones and competition rage and the pace of the film rarely lets up. Unfortunately, Evil is only just thwarted from outright victory, but Harry and his friends do win the battle for the emotional maturity we know they are going to need in the even darker times ahead."

","Admittdly, with my 41 years of age I am not the target group of watchers which is supposed to be addressed by this film. I am, nevertheless, fascinated by J.K.Rowlings novels, her incredible imagination and as a fanatic movie fan I also enjoyed the movies. I have to say, for me this is not the best movie of the series yet. It is certainly very hard to put on over-600-pages book into 2h 40 minutes film(I wouldn't have minded to stick around for 20 minutes longer) and that for certain things it had to be decided to leave them out for the greater good, but when I saw the movie for the first time I thought ""What is this....?"", especially the first half hour. I think is is very much o.k. for the film to get more ""adult"" as Harry and his friends do so too and I think it is very much o.k. for action scenes to be fast. Thats what they are there for. but all in all the pace of the movie is far to fast. the first 30 minutes are like ""O.K., we have to mention that and that and that.....o.k....done...next....!!! For someone who hasn't read the book it is very hard to follow at all. Except a few scenes it is all made as though everyone is in a constant hurry. Professor McGonogall and Professor Snape seem like puppets with only a few lines. The worst in Prof. Dumbledore. Richard Harris was the perfect Dumbledore. Her was quite, mystifying and a total authority figure. Michael Gambon is constantly acting like a total fidget. The scene where he asks Harry is he really didn't put his name in the goblet, is disaster. I can only imagine how Richard Harris would have managed. There are hardly scenes in which you have a feeling of real characters and depth, which should be the case in a coming-of-age story, which the books are as well besides being a fantasy and adventure story. For me so far, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best one. I think it is really enchanting and magical and whatever the outcome of the last book, I do hope that Alfonso Cuaron does at least that one again"

","First and foremost, let me tell you that the movie was worth seeing and I'll definitely add it to my collection of DVD's when it comes out. However, I must say that I was disappointed. Yes it was a large book, and I didn't expect them to fit everything in, but they tried, and they shouldn't have. <br/><br/>As I watched it, I was impressed with the special effects and the action, but they jumped around so much that it was totally impossible to personalize with any of the characters, and it was hard to genuinely enjoy the film. The conversation, what conversation there were, were so short and spotted that it was hard to follow if one has not already read the book and knew what was going on.<br/><br/>As far as movies go, it was excellent, but as far as a movie based upon a book, I feel that they have failed. A particular low point was the World Quidditch cup, and a particular high point was Voldemort (they portrayed his return very well indeed).<br/><br/>Again, I loved the movie, but I have to watch it with the idea that it is just a movie, and not the fourth book in the Harry Potter series."

As for computer animation and action scenes they are perfect, but I m tired of such films which have flooded the world. The film is made out of the achievement of previous films especially first two, very few new ideas were presented. Don't think this film is good for children some scenes are very scary:)<br/><br/>I liked Harry Potter for being magical movie, but this one is a film of everyday life a common American-style movie.<br/><br/>And also i didn't like the costumes, so common.<br/><br/>Thank you"

","I enjoyed the books very much, I enjoyed the movies even more, until now that is... What was the director thinking??? This should have been two movies! Now it was like a series of little one lined trailers taken out of the book. Suddenly not only Rupert Grint showed to be a bad actor, even Daniel Radcliffe himself was terrible. Even worse, besides the parts Emma Watson, Jason Isaacs, Michael Gambon and Alan Rickman played, it was like the editors had a great idea: let's remove all the scenes in which the actors perform well and let's show the visitors all the others can't at all.<br/><br/>It was amazing and shocking to see that the best parts were left overs from Alfonso Cuarón's Prisoner of Azkaban: the art and props department had very little to do I think, since they all used Alfonso's input.<br/><br/>But hell, what can one expect from a 63 year old director I guess.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't walk out of theater was because i was there with all my family of whom at least my mother seemed to enjoy herself with this movie.<br/><br/>I think the 12 year old next girl next to me illustrated this movie best: 30 seconds before something would happen she said to her mother exactly right what was going to take place (like: oh, there's gonna be a shocking moment now) and after the movie she told me she never read the books :( So a big thanks to mr. Mike Newell from turning the magical Harry Potter world into a bad seventies circus act.

"Juni78ukr","5","1","1","23 December 2005"," For the first time Harry Potter movie bitterly disappointed me.
","These comments might contain spoilers, especially for people, who haven't read the book<br/><br/>First of all, don't get me wrong. I'm not a hater and I liked JKR books (although I never mentioned them among the best books ever) as well as three previous movies (more first two more than third) so I went today to see Goblet of Fire to the biggest multiplex theater in my city. My expectations were high but this day I went through one of my biggest disappointments caused by a motion picture.<br/><br/>From very first shots of the movie, when I saw Barty Crouch junior, next to Voldemort I had a terrible feeling that something's wrong here and this feeling grew with every minute. And soon things were getting worse. After about fifteen minutes I realized that the movie is falling apart into numerous separate scenes (twenty or thirty  I didn't count, which looks like TV clips) or episodes hardly connected with each other or without such connection at all. Mentioned scene at Riddle house was followed by another one, already at Burrow (Weasley's home) and a minute later we are at Quidditch World Cup a couple of minutes before final match begins. But after only several shots (not bad) there was another gap and now (without quidditch at all) we see our heroes under the tent after the match. Another pause, another gap - that's happening all the time. After a half an hour two very simple questions have rose in my mind and completely captured it. Who wrote this script? And who was a guy who directed this movie? Despite numerous previous opinions, I have to say that fourth movie does not justify the book, does not justify its characters and its atmosphere. Too many things (and unfortunately important things) were completely missed or drastically changed that I begin to think that initial idea of making two separate movies wasn't bad at all. Most of characters and particularly such new characters like Cedric, Krum or Cho are entirely undeveloped. Albus Dumbledore from the greatest wizard of modern times was transformed into some kind of a silly old man. Krum, who wasn't mean at all in the book, become different in the movie. But what's the worst Cedric's character also suffered a lot. The scene in the labyrinth before they took Goblet was definitely one of the best in the whole book. All their inner struggles and hesitations have completely disappeared and instead of that we got ridiculous chase between Cedric and Harry. Cedric's death in the book is a really terrible loss and emotional episode because he's a truly good and honest character but we don't feel that in the movie. All scenes from Triwizard tournament in reality became one of the most ridiculous action sequences I've seen in a long time. At the beginning some genius has invented a dragon flying and chasing Harry all over the castle while everyone is waiting on their seats. What a load of rubbish! Next task was a lake, almost all the time deserted and quiet (except for mermaids, who were just watching) and finally there was the labyrinth. Somehow this ridiculous labyrinth was also completely deserted without any creature inside so the third task was transformed into a preposterous chase between lines of hedges. And I can go on and go on. Overall, the movie is very raw and rather shallow and incredibly rushed. Most of people in the movie theater, who haven't read Harry Potter books were completely disoriented and confused after only a few such mentioned in the beginning separated scenes or episodes. Mike Newell's direction unfortunately wasn't any better than a disastrous script. Instead the way of the book, common sense and cold logic he has chosen a way of cheesy coolness, surface polish, primitive dialog, and cheap and rather silly laughs. But this superficial coolness in most of cases is fake and senseless like in the scene with that stupid dragon or in the scene with Moaning Myrtle. Even with visuals there was nothing particularly astonishing and most of a few really memorable moments were already in the movie trailers. Another negative consequence of this kaleidoscopic rush was the acting. Alarmingly often there was simply no room acting. Among the very few things that I really liked were Emma Watson's performance and rather short the ball scene. Not pretty much from the whole movie. The other huge problem is that the movie in most of parts is emotionally flat and it is obviously that it wasn't supposed to be emotionally flat. The ending as practically everything else was rushed and shallow with rather a pathetic phrase, which we also already heard in a movie trailer. I've almost forgotten that somehow legendary John Williams was replaced and without his music the movie also has lost something appealing.<br/><br/>Certainly, I have no idea why so many people claim fourth Potter as the best Potter movie so far, as well about its commercial success. After the end of the credits the whole theater was dead silent and fair part of the audience looked pretty disappointed. I was pretty disappointed too and one thought bothered me the most. I believe that we a better script and with different director this movie could have been incomparably better and visually stunning (also because the fourth book is much deeper than previous three). And the very last thing I have to notice. Russian translation was really terrible."
"sol-","Null","1","1","21 December 2005"," My brief review of the film
","While 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' are both generally regarded as good films, ''Empire'' is generally considered to be vastly superior for taking the series in new directions while ''Jedi'' just provided more of the same. I feel that this type of relationship can be applied to this Harry Potter film and the third entry, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. The third film gave a whole new darker and more adult look to the series with a considerable amount of style. This fourth film carries on that style but fails to improve on it; as the director, Mike Newell does not add any touches that are distinctly his own. That's not to say that it is a poor film. It is well made, with excellent makeup, superb interior decoration and special effects that are as impressive as usual, but it is in no way up to the standard of the third film. The new music by Patrick Doyle is quite good also, in the same style as John William's famed composition, but with sensations of its own. The film still does have its flaws, and those who have read the book have also complained about it being the first poor adaptation in the series. It is not too well written either way, with too many love subplots that add up to nothing by the end. The plot also feels rather reduced to just sporting events. Directing-wise, the film often feels too busy, with much of the action looking like it is just for show, and although the cinematography is epic scale and grand, it tends to make the film feel too much like a roller coaster ride. It is yet again reasonably entertaining and engaging to watch, despite its drawbacks and its extreme length. It is full of parts that are amusing and interesting effects. It simply just is not too praiseworthy as a follow-up to the superb 'Harry Potter and the Prison of the Azkaban'."

","Have movie audiences been spoilt this year? We sure have! Continuing a long line of immensely enjoyable films at the big screen, the fourth instalment of the series is far and away the best, and considering the class of the last one, that is some achievement. This time around the director is for the first time a Brit, Mike Newell. Newell's appointment raised questions about whether the film would have the visual impact to impress movie fans, in the wake of the previous movie and of course recent fantasy epics like Star Wars and LOTR. All worries though were not needed because Newell knocks this one out of the park. <br/><br/>This year marks the tri-wizard tournament, hosted by Hogwarts. The tournament sees three schools competing against each other by sending out a single champion from each school. The selections are made using the Goblet Of Fire. Names are put into it and drawn out. The three champions are drawn but in a bizarre twist the Goblet fires out a fourth name, Harry Potter, despite the fact he's too young to enter. The whole school, including Harry's best mate Ron, think Harry has cheated somehow. However despite being too young the Goblet is a magically binding contract and so Harry has to compete in the three deadly tasks. All the while we have the re-emergence of Voldemort casting an eerie presence over the film. Also the Hogwarts prom night is on the horizon leading to the first awkward adolescent crushes of the series thus far. Yes Harry and his mates are indeed growing up and Newell doesn't want to pull any punches. When the film has to be nasty it is nasty, and when it has to have hormonally charged teenagers acting smitten it does so realistically. These guys are 14 years old in the film and like me and others when that age, are horny little buggas. Suddenly the guys are becoming gawky and awkward around the girls and Hermoine is sprouting into a young woman, and catching the eye of Ron and rival school competitor and quidditch God Victor Krum. The film actually has sexual tension and a fair old dose of innuendo in it so is quite daring. Not to mention Harry himself gets sexually assaulted by a ghost!<br/><br/>The film really captures the essence of being that age, whilst also keeping the adventure side suitably dark. This film really is dark and some people may find it too dark for a kids movie. However I now think along the lines that the Harry Potter movies are turning into more adult movies. Certainly the last one was dark and didn't appeal to kids of 12 and under as much as the candy coated first two films, but Potter 4 will probably alienate the kiddies. This film was pretty scary I have to tell you. I nearly crapped my pants several times and I urge you never to watch this film in a theatre or room with too many young children in because the smell would be unbearable. Newell is clearly making a film he'd like to see and being an adult he needs to be challenged viscerally and this makes for a great movie. This really is a top class fantasy film and Peter Jackson would be proud. <br/><br/>Visually as I mentioned this looks stunning, the cinematography is superb, the film looks Gothic at times, while we are given more focus on the actors. The camera gets right into them and stays for longer than previous instalments. This now means there is immense pressure on the kids to deliver acceptable performances and they duly delivered. Emma Watson, although a more peripheral figure this time is excellent, really coming along as an actress and will certainly have a bright future, while Rupert Grint as Ron is the same and really delivers a great turn. However up until now the one actually always considered the weakest of the three, Daniel Radcliffe, really steps forward and delivers a superb performance of maturity, that really goes hand in hand with the character of Potter, who has to learn to grow up fast. Newell clearly has spent time with these kids, and it shows, especially with Radcliffe who is given a testing role and doesn't put a foot wrong. Of course as with previous Potter movies we are blessed with an outstanding ensemble cast. Returnees Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are all top class. Then we have the always reliable and entertaining Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Current Dr Who David Tennant makes a creepy appearance to but the two standouts are firstly Ralph Fiennes who appears towards the end of the film as Lord Voldemort. He is cack your underpants scary. Fiennes is taking this really seriously, he wants Voldemort scary, he wants him nasty, he doesn't want any hint of the pantomime villain. When Harry comes face to face with him we know the boy will have to do something special to avoid dying. Fiennes though is eclipsed by Brendon Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody. Gleeson is superb as the dark arts teacher, who is clearly one sandwich short of a picnic. It's a great role and certainly a performance of both menace and quirk that could see him recognised by the Oscars.<br/><br/>Someone who'll definitely be getting a nomination is John Williams who continues this years fine form from Star Wars 3 and War Of The Worlds, to deliver his best score yet with this film. It's atmospheric, creepy, majestic and very rarely falls back to the memorable Potter themes. This is not a movie for repeating theme tunes the music has to creep in and out to match each scene, bringing in the recognisable Potter jingle with choice and subtlety. It goes without saying Williams could have three nominations this year! Outstanding film and the most exciting of the year. *****"
"Noriega220","8","1","1","8 December 2005"," Rushed but still a great movie
","It is hard for me to judge the quality of a Harry Potter movie. Simply because I am in love with the book series. For me watching the Harry Potter movies are like reading very entertaining spark notes. They are there simply to remind me of the world of Harry Potter. This is not saying that they are horrible. In fact the movies are a great sample of the magic of HP. Having said that the fourth movie is no exception. It does a great job bringing to life the events of the Goblet of Fire and for the most part the emotions as well. However, it is difficult to squeeze a 734 or so page book into a 2-hour and a half movie. It just can't be done. Some of the characters as well as a large amount of the beginning chapters had to be cut out strictly for the sake of time. The first 30 minutes of the movie fly by and I remember sitting in the theater praying for the pace to slow down. Luckily it did, and once everyone in the theater took a breath, we were all able to start enjoying the movie. Not to expose too much of the movie and to let you make your own judgments I will end this review here saying that if you are a fan of the book series then I would strongly recommend you see it, you will not be disappointed."

"tgbltd","6","1","1","5 December 2005"," Good Film but Disappointing for fans
","The film is enjoyable for those that have not read the book and are not concerned with continuity, plot consistency or the loss of characters and background information. Lots of the sub plots have been massacred or twisted to 'save time'. <br/><br/>My fear is that this will affect future films. Warner Brothers should have insisted on making the film either longer or into 2 films and they should have slapped some sense into Mike Newell, he obviously is not a fan of the books and this is evident in his butchery of the book. I hope a fan of the books remakes The Goblet of Fire or redo the film for the DVDs to be more true to the book. <br/><br/>Having said that the film was choppy to start with but once it got going it was a good movie (must be I saw it several times). So go watch it and enjoy it for what it is a good film which could have been excellent given the opportunity. Shame on WB and Mike Newell."
"Linda Lee","8","1","1","4 December 2005"," Brilliant special effects and some genuinely scary moments!
","I saw this film with a friend who had not read the book and she was (understandably!) rather confused! It is very much the fourth film in a sequence and expects some prior knowledge from its viewers. However, I don't think this is unreasonable - you can't keep explaining the rules of Quidditch! <br/><br/>It was never going to be possible to please all the book's fans but I think Mike Newell has done a great job. I don't know if it's because he's English but you certainly get a more authentic sense of boarding school life in this film. <br/><br/>The relationships between the young characters come across very well - I was particularly impressed by the Weasley twins who at last seemed comfortable in their roles and were genuinely funny. Ron Weasley was - as ever - a delight, spluttering his trademark 'Bloody hell!' with gusto but also revealing his burgeoning jealousy of Harry and his feelings for Hermione. Harry was excellent - much improved from the awkwardness of Prisoner of Azkaban, and showing real depths of emotion, especially after the tragic finale of the Triwizard Tournament. The real disappointment for me was Hermione - Emma Watson looked very pretty but turned in a really 'actressy' performance, every line sounding very mannered.<br/><br/>I did miss the other members of the Weasley family - no Molly or Percy, and we didn't get to meet Charlie or Bill. Neither Rita Skeeter nor Madame Maxime quite worked for me, though I find it hard to say exactly why. I also found it disconcerting to see the latest Dr Who as a 'baddie'! <br/><br/>The special effects were truly amazing in the first two tasks but I was rather disappointed by the maze. That scene in the book is very intense and the maze sets various challenges (the sphinx, the spider, the Boggart and the screwts) but none of these was in the film - just a lot of shifting conifer hedges! However, the terrifying graveyard scene made up for that and Voldemort's transformation certainly justified the film's 12A certification.<br/><br/>I had been waiting impatiently for this film, and I was not disappointed. I came out of the cinema buzzing and I now want to see it all over again! When does it come out on DVD?!"
"dominicdanielewicz","5","1","1","4 December 2005"," Harry Potter & The Goblet Of Fire - Review, Issues & Thoughts For Future Film-making. A short essay ;-)
","Harry Potter & The Goblet Of Fire is one good example of how the power of Hollywood is able to manipulate and force directors/scriptwriters into doing something they might not want to do and thus ruining a perfect story. JKR had yet again wrote a good (I dare not use the word excellent for the fear of being bombarded by hundreds of e-mails) book which delighted and captivated millions.<br/><br/>The central issues and themes of the book were obviously: friendship, death, conspiracy and many more second grade ones. However, they were only brushed on for cinematic effect in the film. Maybe I am wrong in blaming just Hollywood for dislocating this film, perhaps JKR actually wanted them to change the script completely - I could be extremely naive, however I doubt this is the case and I confidently believe JKR would not be impressed with the shredding and embarrassing restructure of the script.<br/><br/>There are many scenes (just two I will deal with in this short essay - although if I had more space I would have certainly like to discuss the absence of the elf's) that completely change the story within the book. Sometimes it is necessary to ""cut"" a certain scene - for instance if it does not build upon and characters or conflict - but not when that scene is vital part where true identities are revealed and the action takes a new turn. The first scene, where Harry is faced with his first task (retrieving a golden egg in a nest guarded by the most ferocious of three dragons imported for the challenge - the Horntail), it seems to me as if very frankly, the scene title was named ""SPECIAL EFFECTS SCENE"". It was not focusing on the skill of flying on a broomstick Harry inherited from his father, or the courage he has or the tension experienced by his friends. It was rather changed to boost the technology rating of the producing studio. Harry was sent flying round the castle falling on roofs and off them - it did not show how Harry used tactics from Quidditch to his advantage and won the egg, it merrily was a scene for the technology ""awe"" factor. I do not criticise the tactical use of technology in films (and in a film about magic it would be rather injudicious to say it shouldn't be used) in fact sometimes when used for the right effect it creates an effect not experienced in the book. However I was not the only one who was beginning to be bored with the scene. I noticed children from about the age of six to fifteen starting to fidget and stare at exit signs and fire extinguishers in the hope of something exiting. The fact is that no matter how many special effects you add, how many A-list actors you hire - unless you understand the subtext and it's importance - you may just ruin a perfectly good and important part of the story. This scene was supposed to be the first of three precarious tasks to be faced by Harry, it was supposed to put us on the edge of our seats. I felt as if the seat was more interesting, it certainly slaughtered the issues and themes in this scene.<br/><br/>I felt that the scene where Harry spots Barty Crouch lying in the forest was yet again an example of the eroding of the original text - and worse - poor cutting. It left me and other viewers confused about what was happening and why. According to the book, Harry stumbled on Crouch during the Yule Ball alone and immediately ran to Dumbledore's office where from then on Dumbledore went to find him. This was one of the most interesting and thrilling scenes I found in the book as it dealt with the first step towards the truth and it certainly made the reader begging to know what would happen next. In the film however, Harry stumbled upon him while in a total different scene while Crouch seemed dead not ""crazy"" like in the book - and the scene instantly cut to Harry casually walking to Dumbledore's office as if nothing had happened. It was certainly poor cutting and rushed post-production. It did not emphasize the seriousness of the matter and the theme of conspiracy in the scene. Yet again it left me confused, irritated and let-down.<br/><br/>Perhaps you are wondering why I decided to talk about these issues. Well when reviewing this film, I felt it necessary to let the two types of viewers going to see this movie (one for its accuracy according to original text, and the other for its action factor.) And therefore I must say, if you are a fan of the original Harry Potter book - you won't be impressed with this film. However if you are going to see it for the special effects - you should thoroughly enjoy this film.<br/><br/>I think that the acting was average (Daniel Radcliff looked as if he was being told exactly what to do instead of trying to use acting instinct) with certain characters (Rupert Grint) seeming more natural in their roles. Music and lighting were used very well to effect and sets seemed in magical perfection.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think that Hollywood needs to thank and respect the authors of these books for coming up with new and fresh ideas (which seem to make good profit at the box office as well) not just disrespect them by unintelligently cutting bits that told the story and expanding bits that did not. As always however, the Harry Potter phenomenon made this film exiting and I must admit it was the main reason why I rated this film at ""5"". I do hope they respect the next instalment not only as it is one of the most thought about - but it is also my favourite and I hate to be let down."
"ben_2876","5","1","1","3 December 2005"," Reasonably dedicated to the book, but poorly structured
","I have read the Harry Potter book series and rehashed on the other Harry Potter movies before seeing this movie, and after seeing Alfonso Cuaron's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban, I had expected great things from this movie.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I must say I was disappointed at the structuring of the movie, and this music (which is the only Harry Potter movie without John Williams) was, to say the most, mismanaged. Had I have directed the movie, I would have gotten rid of the entire segment of Harry Potter trying to find a girlfriend for the Yule Ball, and used that extra time (given that the movie is slightly over 2 hours) to give more build-up towards events in the movie.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you were looking forward to the Yiddish world cup, you will be disappointed as there is a small amount of build-up, but you don't see any of the actual game.<br/><br/>On the whole it would have been better directed by someone else, but the movie was reasonably enjoyable. The main events of the movie are, although changed (from the book), worth waiting for."
"geokalmc","8","1","1","2 December 2005"," Fantastic movie but the book even greater
","I really enjoyed this movie. It had fantastic effects, very good plot and a breathtaking ending battle (between Harry and Voldemort). Also it had many funny scenes and characters that are more mature than the previous films. Although it was a great film, I was disappointed by the fact that many elements included in the book , were cut in the movie. I'm sure that this was necessary so that the film wouldn't last more than 3 hours, but I would like to see , for example, how Harry's opponents ,in the triwizard tournament, dealt with their dragons . However, I strongly recommend the film to all of those who have watched Harry's previous films and like the magic that each film brings."
"accio_comet260","5","1","1","1 December 2005"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Flops?
","I am one of those people that has read all the books too many times to count, so I suppose I have an eye for things they may leave out. Although this was my personal favorite of all the films, it definitely was NOT because it was faithful to the book. The special effects, the acting, and the script was probably the best out of all four films, but it was the least faithful to the series we all know and love. Yes, I cried when Cedric died, and I was freaked out when Voldemort was revived, but through the whole movie, I felt myself thinking, ""Oh my god, I can't believe they completely cut Winky the House Elf from the entire movie!"" or ""Okay... if I had NOT read the book, I would be confused out of my mind right now..."" They cut so may important events from the story, and so many vital facts, that most people leaving the theater (that obviously hadn't read the book) were heard saying, ""So wait, what was with that one scene? It didn't make any sense."" And many of the things that were explained, were very discrete, and were hardly noticeable because of the speed of the dialog, or the tone of voice. Also, they attempted to condense a 734 page book into two and a half hours, making the movie seem too choppy. I know at one point the director was considering cutting it into two films, and making it have two parts. I think that was a much better idea; it would have made it flow through better, and seem more natural. I think that later in the series, they will look back at what they left out and realize that people will have to use the former films as references for future occurrences. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is probably the most important book to the series, because of the many proceedings that lead to important events in the future books, and it certainly didn't seem that way by the look and feel of the film. That is why I only gave the film five stars out of 10."
"formiddominatus","6","1","1","30 November 2005"," ""Goblet of Fire"" only suffers from Mike Newell
","After over a year of waiting and much publicity, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was one of the most anticipated films in recent history. It seems in recent years that films seem never to be able to live up to this anticipation (""AVP"" and ""The Phantom Menace"" come to mind). Fortunately for us, ""Goblet"" completely lives up to its hype.<br/><br/>The storyline is familiar; after all, it was a book. Very few people who saw ""Goblet of Fire"" were clueless as to what was going to transpire. The burden was on Steve Kloves to turn a 734-page book into a 2.5-hour movie. He certainly does his part; the story never seems rushed (Aside from the first twenty minutes, which, in this case, would not work if they weren't), the dialogue continues to be very good, and character interactions continue to be excellent. Character introductions are a bit speedy (Moody's only introduction is a quick ""That's Mad-Eye Moody"" from Ron), but the audience does reasonably well in getting over it. (It at least never bothered me.) The actors do their parts as well. Miranda Richardson, Brenden Gleason , and Ralph Fiennes all excellently and expertly adapt characters from the page; from the annoyingly snobby Rita Skeeter, to the intimidating and over-the-top Mad-Eye Moody, to the downright scary Lord Voldemort. The child actors continue to grow in skill and confidence, and the seasoned veterans of Harry Potter films, Sir Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, and the always enjoyable Maggie Smith, are spot-on as usual.<br/><br/>The one problem with ""Goblet"" is its director, Mike Newell. Consistently, the attention to detail and character development that Alfonso Cuarón brought to ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" are either less apparent or abandoned altogether. Newell focuses more on the visual aspect of the movie than is necessary; during the first Triwizard task, instead of focusing on Harry's attempt to snatch the golden egg, as was the intent of the scene, Newell leads an over-the-top five-minute chase scene around Hogwarts with the dragon. The audience seems to forget the golden egg even exists, while Harry, in a rather formulaic way, dangles by his fingertips from a rooftop.<br/><br/>If one puts the focus on visual effects in the back of his mind, the movie works fantastically. ""Goblet"" certainly earns its PG-13 rating; it is intensely frightening in some scenes, and incredibly emotionally jarring. The Triwizard Tournament tasks are vividly and spectacularly brought to life, and, dragon-chase aside, seem to be the most character-driven scenes in the movie. Lord Voldemort's dark, hair-raising rise at the end puts him among the most instantly reviled movie villains of all time; Fiennes's character will certainly rank up with Darth Vader in history among the villains everyone loves to hate. Despite all the violence and frightening scenes, there is just enough humor and human drama, particularly between Ron and Harry, to make ""Goblet of Fire"" still enjoyable and not too depressing.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" continues with the great tradition of the boy wizard, and will work very well in the storyline of the series and in moviedom in general."
"yehuda72","3","1","1","30 November 2005"," good script - bad direction - worst music
","It is amazing how producers can destroy people's illusions to save some money. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the summit, the best direction and music, they knew the next one was suppose to be a success, so why spend more money! lets make a cheap movie, it will make us rich!!! The script was OK but it was unnecessary to show the first scenes with the tournament, it could have been better to focus on the goblet of fire itself, more interesting scenes there. Brendan Gleeson was superb, the only that was really good one, really. It was shocking the change in music, I was used to John Williams good instrumentation. The direction was some time to oriented to show British education, too irrelevant to show here."
"serbach","8","1","1","29 November 2005"," Lots missing but you hardly notice
","I cannot say enough about Brendan Gleason and Ralph Fiennes, two actors that have given more in their respective performances than you could hope for. Everything that Voldemort represents, the way he looks and sounds, even how he holds his wand, all are exquisitely realized in Fiennes' performance. And Gleason's portrayal of Moody is more than masterful. It is fun and thrilling.<br/><br/>One reason why I continue to go to the movies even though I'm now 53 years old is the amazement I feel and the admiration I have for the movie makers' ability to show me something I never imagined. I've read GoF three times, but there were so many beautifully realized images given to us by the film makers that so far surpassed anything that I saw in my mind's eye. It's tough to tag the absolute best. I was as likely to be tickled by a small thing as by, say, the stupendous emergence of the Durmstrang ship from out of the lake. For example, the curtsy by the girls from Beauxbatons as they entered the Great Hall was one of those wonderful little movie touches that only last a moment but make a lasting impression. Certainly everyone was wowed by the moving TV screen inside the quidditch stadium, but I find the attention to detail in the less spectacular scenes to be more memorable.<br/><br/>Other examples: The owlery is now a separate tower from the rest of the castle. I thought that was a very neat idea. And making the maze fill up the valley behind Hogwarts instead of occupying just the quidditch pitch was nifty, too. The emulation of wallflowers by Harry and Ron with their moping dates was perfectly done. The tension in Moody's first Defense class was ominous and palpable. Snape climbing the ladder in his potions store was just right. The transformation of the spacious wizard courtroom of the novel into the crammed and cramped little chamber with the open air iron maiden in the middle was beautifully done. The sweet moments with Hagrid and Madame Maxime as when his hand slips down to her rump during the ball and she hoists it back up to the small of her back...the awkward and touching encounter between Harry and Cho in the owlery...Moody making faces behind McGonagall's back...these things are what make seeing the movies such a pleasure. And Goblet of Fire is loaded with them.<br/><br/>Sure, there were things that didn't please me as much. For example, the maze's only menace came from the clinging vines and a possessed Krum. No spider, no blast-ended skrewts, and no sphinx. But the climax in the graveyard made up for it.<br/><br/>I'm at the age where my ability to hear the middle tones of peoples' voices is affected. Thus my disappointment with Rupert Grint whom I'd considered the strongest actor of the big three. I had to keep myself from calling out, ""Mumbling! I can't understand you!"" as Willy Wonka would say. The theater in which I saw GoF had the volume turned way up so I shouldn't have missed any dialog. But, as it was, I had to have missed half of Grint's dialog because of his grunting.<br/><br/>Some of the things that are missing: Rita Skeeter is never revealed as an animagus; there is no confrontation with a disbelieving Fudge at the end; and no elves whatsoever! That I thought would have been difficult to pull off, but screenwriter Steve Kloves managed it.<br/><br/>But even as I think of the shortcomings and disappointments I'm again thrilled by all of the marvelous things in this movie: Sirius Black's appearance in the fire as a face made out of living coals; Karkaroff's confession from inside the iron maiden; McGonagall's scolding of Moody after he turned Malfoy into a ferret and forced him down Crabbe's pants; the departure of the Beauxbatons carriage and its salute of the Durmstrang ship way out on the lake; Miranda Richardson's performance as Rita Skeeter; Harry's leap out of the water once he has his gills; and Harry saying, ""I love magic!"" This movie wasn't a 10 or even a 9, and I still like The Prisoner of Azkaban better, but wow! What a thrilling ride!"
"cherioles2","9","1","1","29 November 2005"," The only thing that bothered me was Dumbledore
","I really hate how they make Dumbledore's character appear weak and less ""all knowing"". The original Dumbledore was perfect, more like the book. Even though a wizard as high up and smart as Dumbledore is, he still has some fault, but he doesn't show it. He is the pillar for everyone around him to look up to, to know what to do and to trust him b/c of that persona. I just don't like how the actor in this movie portrays Dumbledore. I know it's also how it's written and directed though so it's not all on the actor. In the book, Dumbledore would have never attacked Harry and had any doubt that Harry did not put his name in the Goblet. He knows better! And throughout the movie it continues, his uneasiness and concern shows too much weakness for such an intelligent and crafty wizard."
"Big Huge Doug","4","1","1","29 November 2005"," Disappointing entry after the blazing success of Azkaban
","Maybe it was just my high expectations after enjoying Prisoner of Azkaban so greatly, but my wife and I were both disappointed by Goblet. The plot seemed to be something of a rehash of Azkaban, Harry wasn't much of a hero (people did things For him and To him, but he didn't do a whole lot to prove what a great guy he was), lots of plot threads were included that didn't seem to be needed (we haven't read the books, but it's painfully obvious when something was included ""just because it was in the book""), and there wasn't enough teen angst, which was by far the best part of the movie. Less of trite snoopy reporters! More wistful puppy love! Also, there seemed to be a LOT of logic flaws--many things happen that don't make sense or don't go anywhere. Maybe they're explained in the book (in fact it seems quite likely). Maybe they'll be explained next movie. It's pretty annoying to have to wait two years, if that's the case.<br/><br/>The special effects were nice, but all in all it was a letdown."
"kellychitwood","9","1","1","29 November 2005"," The Best Yet
","What a grand movie, and what a relief that the cinematic Goblet of Fire captured the spirit of the Potter books this time around! Unlike the screen version of Prisoner of Azkaban, this movie ""gets it"" with regard to what is and is not important. While almost all of the book's sub-plots had to be omitted, just about everything important made it into this film, even if the way it was included was altered slightly. The changes were believable and the none of the essential elements of the story were lost. I add my voice to those declaring Goblet of Fire by far the best of the Potter movies.<br/><br/>I don't usually comment on special effects, but it would be a crime to ignore them in this case. I knew exactly what to expect from all the scariest parts of the movie, but even so, I was gasping and clutching my husband's hand during the dragon task and the graveyard scene. Amazing stuff. I had the advantage of seeing the movie in IMAX, and it felt like I was flying right along with Harry. If you have the opportunity to experience the film in IMAX, do it. It will be worth every penny. I really wanted to just buy another ticket and see it again, right then!<br/><br/>Excellent acting all around...Madame Maxine was not quite what I had pictured, but she worked. The kids improve with every movie; Daniel Radcliffe was superb in the scene immediately following the graveyard experience. I wish that we could have seen a little more of him and explored a bit more deeply the emotions he portrayed so well. If I have one criticism, it would have to be with Michael Gambon's interpretation of Dumbledore. He seems overly harsh and dictatorial, and I don't see him building the rapport with Harry that the character requires. I almost wonder if he has read the books. He is adequate, but Dumbledore really needs to be exceptional.<br/><br/>All in all, Goblet of Fire is a joy to watch. I plan to return to the theater at least once, and I'll certainly be adding the DVD to my collection. An absolute must-see for all Potter fans."
"Qbanita4620","10","1","1","29 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was excellent
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was by far the best movie I have seen in an extremely long time. The performances were extraordinary and moving. Not having read the book first and just seeing the movies, I have to say that Goblet of Fire was the best out of all the Harry Potter movies. It made me laugh, it made my cry, but most of all it made me intrigued. I enjoyed the movie very much, and I'm not speaking as a fanatic of the series, but as movie goer who enjoys watching generally good movies. I gave the movie a ten because I believe it deserved a ten. It was amazing: the special effects were awesome and the acting didn't seem like that of young actors and actresses, but of experienced and talented artists. I enjoyed the movie very much and I recommend it to everyone."
"adrianh-4","5","1","1","28 November 2005"," Great visuals, shame about the plot!
","Whilst I recognise and applaud the visuals in GoF, fans of the written word will be disappointed at the shoddy shoe horning of the, admittedly epic, storyline into such a short space of time. Characters such as Snape, Malfoy Jnr, McGonagall, Hagrid, Rita Skeeter are pared down to the bone, whilst others such as Winky, the Dursleys, Bill, Charlie and Mrs Weasley have been completely left out. The Quidditch World Cup has inaccuracies (the Weasleys should be seated in the Top box with the Malfoys), Rita Skeeter's many articles are reduced to only one, Barty Crouch Jnr does not appear at the beginning with Voldemort and Wormtail, the Death-Eaters did not turn the campsite at the QWC into the war zone depicted in the film. And so on. Probably the worst bit of 'plot changing' was having Michael Gambon (a very poor Richard Harris replacement - ever heard of Peter O'Toole?) actually grabbing Harry and almost assaulting him during the ""did you/didn't you"" put your name in the GoF scene. Dumbledore never touches his students like that and makes much of it when other teachers do it in Order of the Phoenix. All in all a sad disappointment for the discerning JK Rowling fan and, judging by the various comments heard in the cinema immediately after the end of the film, easy money for Warner Bros. 5 out of 10 is perhaps, somewhat generous."
"hugo3","7","1","1","28 November 2005"," too much ""action""
","I think this movie is too fast-paced. Magic and mystery have been sacrificed for pointless ""action"". Even Dumbledore is shown losing his nerve, which is totally contradictory to his character. Many things have been left unexplained, which must be quite confusing to those viewers who have not read the books. There is really nothing in the book that suggests that in this installment the pace of the action has to be stepped up like this. I always found that it is exactly the mysterious, dreamy atmosphere that held me spell-bound. Only very few scenes in this movie still have that quality, such as the one with Sirius talking through the hearth fire.<br/><br/>This is still an enjoyable movie; however, it is really unfortunate that so many opportunities for making it less superficial have been missed."
"dstill-4","8","1","1","28 November 2005"," Great film. But wow, is Gambon wrong for Dumbledore!
","Stunningly filmed, the latest Potter alternates between dark and light. the dark being a scary and forbidden sense of foreboding. The light being some really funny hormone driven teenage angst humour scenes.<br/><br/>A fairly faithful representation of the book. The screenwriters have decided to ignore completely the fairly large parts the House Elves (Dobby & Winky) played in the novel, probably because that may have aimed the movie at a younger audience than they wanted.<br/><br/>The cast, as ever, is well set. Mad Eye Moody is quite excellent. But there is one HUGE problem in amongst the casting.<br/><br/>I know Richard Harris is nigh on impossible to replace, and his natural successor Ian McKellern is already fully wizarded up as Gandalf, but surely the could find someone with more presence and who better portrays Dumbledores sense of Omnipotence than Michael Gambon. Gambon just cannot do Dumbledore. He does not carry enough of that special auror that Harris had.<br/><br/>I cannot wait for book 6 to hit the screens (OK, so I just ticked the spoiler box!!!) *-)"
"jeanwinchester","7","1","1","27 November 2005"," Could it have been made differently?
","Having seen The Goblet of Fire twice now, and enjoyed and thought much of it by the way, I am having disappointing thoughts that, firstly, a film of this length is not allowed an intermission of perhaps five minutes as was given in lengthy films in the past. The experience became a marathon for my bladder and bottom near the end and actually drew my attention away from the experience I was supposed to be having. Secondly, I am now convinced that the book, being so lengthy, should have been turned into two films, the second perhaps released a month after the first. That's not been done before? So what? The series is so ground-breaking anyway that not much speculation would have been needed for it to succeed. Because, amongst my general satisfaction overall for the film, I was nevertheless disappointed that so much was omitted from the book. However...as much as I enjoyed it, I am beginning to see the series as a vehicle (not a showcase) for our well-known British actors who seem to be 'jumping on the bandwagon' of its roller coaster and much deserved success I may add. These inclusions of famous faces, to me, draw attention away and prevent me from becoming completely immersed into the story. Perhaps its an age thing but I would have liked to have seen more unknowns in it, ones with no associations from previous films. One further complication as viewed through my speculative eyes is that it has become 'darker' as almost everybody has noticed. In my view and from a children's book point of view, this diversion from the original shows a lack of imagination and creation and furthermore, I believe, reflects the problems we are having in our present day societies. Therefore, this then becomes less of a fantasy which could be described as groundbreaking and a modern classic, and more about an author's unrealised fears. I think the film took itself too seriously. It is plain to me where JK Rowland is going. Beware Ron Weasley! Molly Cutpurse www.mollycutpurse.com"
"rebeljenn","5","1","1","27 November 2005"," Worthwhile but not my favourite
","'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is a decent film adaption and succeeds in being the best that it can be. The film did leave a lot out, but some of this was not as relevant to the story, and a lot of the details were taken out completely. However, the film does not lose its focus and the audience should be encouraged to read the book to get the extra scenes and information that cannot fit into the film. (I suggest that the book be read anyway, as both the film and the book compliment each other.) 'Goblet of Fire' is not my favourite Harry Potter story. It is one of the darkest stories, but the book seems to lose itself in an over-indulgence of events. The film avoids this and keeps a better focus, in my opinion. Horomones play a major part of the story as well. The main events were the three games and the ball. Both the film and the book seem to fail in an overall goal, and there seems to be less direction. It's really just from one game to the next and who can get a date for the ball, and who has a crush on who. It does not make the best Harry Potter story, and I missed the strong relationship between Harry, Hermione, and Ron. And, I did not care for the introduction of the new characters. (Realistic although it is for children to fall out with their friends, I missed the charm of the old novels/films and the adventures that the three main characters got themselves into.) Despite its flaws in a lacking story and some poor acting (disguised by some good special effects and other distractions), the film is worth watching. I'd even say that they've done a pretty good job with the adaption of the script. Not the best, but it's worthwhile."

","What's more frightening? Tackling a fire-breathing dragon or asking someone out on a date? Yet another improvement on its predecessors, Goblet of Fire is the funniest, most exciting, most emotional and most frightening Potter instalment yet. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint deliver their best performances thus far, showing a firm grip of the much darker and more emotionally challenging material here. Newell and Kloves ensure that the powerful material contained within its complex storyline is never lost; but they also manage to perfectly capture the angst and insecurity suffered by our adolescent heroes with a wicked sense of humour.<br/><br/>The ever-expanding ensemble are at the top of their game here, with top-notch performances from Tennant, Pack, Gleeson and Pattinson (I know, right?). But stealing the show has to be the Dark Lord himself, as Fiennes - with a little help from the CGI team - delivers a turn as Voldemort that marks a definitive transformation to the series. It's gonna be a rough ride from here on out.<br/><br/>Compressing a 600-page book into a film less than three hours long is never going to be easy, so the most faithful readers may not be totally satisfied with the absence of some material. For the rest, Goblet of Fire is simply awesome."

I personally was rather looking forward to seeing the Quidditch World Cup and the full opening ceremonies and was quite disappointed that it felt as if the first 6 chapters went by in a matter of a minute and half. More so than in any of the earlier Harry Potter movies, you really needed to see this movie after having read the book otherwise you may find yourself lost at various times through out the movie.<br/><br/>You still get the great special effects that you have come to expect from the HP franchise of movies, and while the trio is getting older, they still pull off a great movie and I highly recommend it to everyone, after they read the book."

","I finally saw this turkey last night and was terribly disappointed by it. The director, Mike Newell, should be sent to Azkaban for high crimes against the wizarding world. <br/><br/>1. The music was not by John Williams. The themes Williams created for the characters and the castle were not there and were sorely missed.<br/><br/>2. Lousy editing. Scenes were cut critically short and the edits left out crucial data.<br/><br/>3. Who won the World Cup?<br/><br/>4. The script hinted that Harry's wand launched the dark mark at the World Cup, but if you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't even have picked up the hint.<br/><br/>5. Re: the above...Harry's wand did not disappear nor get found at the scene of the crime.<br/><br/>6. The scene of the crime (Dark Mark) was in the woods, not in the campground.<br/><br/>7. Hagrid had a pathetically small role, but none of the characters had major roles in the movie and they screwed up the ones who did, for example:<br/><br/>* Dumbledore is a pillar of strength, not a nervous and scared old man as portrayed in this film.<br/><br/>* Snape is not a slapstick character as portrayed in the study hall, or exam, or whatever that scene was. (What was that scene? It was never explained.)<br/><br/>* Harry would never address a letter to Serius Black as ""Serius Black."" The letters he sent were to Snuffles.<br/><br/>* Snuffles had only one scene - and in a lousy portrayal of the Floo Network, at that. Shameful to leave Serius out like that.<br/><br/>* Hedwig took the letter to Snuffles and was never seen again.<br/><br/>* They had a new actor playing Flitwick, but so what? He added nothing to this portrayal.<br/><br/>* No Professor Trelawny, and Rita Skeeter was captured in her classroom.<br/><br/>* Speaking of, Rita Skeeter did not get her come uppence.<br/><br/>* No Dursley family, and the delightful story of the Weasleys rescuing Harry was sadly missing.<br/><br/>8. Harry's dragon never broke the chain in the story, and if she had, there were a dozen handlers there to prevent the needless car chase that followed. All that was missing from this silly chase was the requisite fruit carts to get overturned.<br/><br/>9. Did I mention that the editing was crappy?<br/><br/>The editing was so bad that watching this movie was like watching a 2-1/2 hour trailer.<br/><br/>I am not optimistic about Order of the Phoenix. I fear this director will screw up that story, too."
"marek-nuss","4","1","1","26 November 2005"," Michael Gambon has to go
","This review contains spoilers. First off I have to remark, that I didn't particularly like the book. One major plot flaw is, that Mad Eye Moody (or Barty Crouch Jr.) could have handed Harry a portkey whenever he wanted, Harry wouldn't have had to take part in the Triwizard Tournament. Any object in Mad Eye's study could have been transformed into a portkey and the only thing Mad Eye would have had to do is to have Harry touch it while having a cup of tea with him. It would have saved him all the trouble of getting Harry through the tournament and he could have done so at any time throughout the whole year. <br/><br/>Having said that, lets get to the movie. It didn't feel like a year at Hogwarts. There was just one DA lesson. The rest of the time was taken up by the Quidditch World Cup (without the actual match), the Triwizard Tournament, the Yule Ball (including one dance lesson with McGonagall) and the graveyard scene. Because of this the movie felt shorter than its predecessor even though it actually was not. Maybe it would have been better to cut some of the extensive action scenes (the dragon scene comes to mind  why didn't he just say ""accio egg""?) in favor of the story. <br/><br/>In general Mike Newell's direction wasn't really inspired. The humor was crude. Why was Filch limping when he informed Dumbledore about the arrival of the Beauxbatons Academy? It looked just stupid. Why did Hagrid grab the behind of Madame Maxine, why did she eat a flea or whatever out of his beard? The list could go on. The introduction of the members of the Beauxbatons Academy was ridiculous and cheap. One of the worst scenes was the bathroom scene with Moaning Myrtle. <br/><br/>But what really annoyed me was the portrayal of Dumbledore by Michael Gambon. There is nothing left of the wise, calm and competent Dumbledore as he is described in the books. Dumbledore in my opinion would never raise his voice the way Gambon did let alone get physical with Harry or any other student. Gambon didn't even have his dialect under control, when he got emotional. The studio would do well to recast this role (Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Sean Connery, anybody else). The rest of the cast did a good job despite of the mediocre direction. That goes for our heroes as well as the supporting cast (unfortunately Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman didn't get more screen time). There were also some genuinely funny moments (e.g. Ron dancing with McGonagall) and the special effects were awesome. <br/><br/>Concerning music I have to say that Patrick Doyle has done a good job. The music complements the movie well even though it lacks the complexity and originality of the scores by John Williams. What I really disliked though were the songs by Jarvis Cocker. <br/><br/>Since I didn't like the book much to begin with - if you were to frack up the one of the movies, let it be this one. For the future I hope that the studio will choose directors more carefully. Maybe they can convince Alfonso Cuarón to direct another installment or even the final two. For continuity please don't switch composers again unless you're willing to go back to John Williams."
"ptbissert","10","1","1","25 November 2005"," Great Movie
","OK, I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series. The first three movies, I thought were pretty good. When I went to the Goblet of fire, I was amazed. You will hear from a lot of people, that they left a lot of the book out, which is understandable, considering that the book was 900 pages long. If they put every little detail in, the movie would have been 4+ hours, which is a very long time at the movie theater. But don't worry, the extended addition will add a lot more to the movie, so that the die-hard Harry Potter fans will be happy. The movie was more intense, which made a lot better. They showed a good bit of all of the important stuff, such as the Triwizard tournament. He who must not be named. LOL. The Rita Skeeter drama. So on, and so forth. This movie was great to see, and I recommend it to everybody. Go see it."

Were they worried that people wouldn't see it if it was longer? Come on, everyone wants to see Harry Potter.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the fact it was rushed. Really rushed in my opinion. The Dursley's weren't even included. We saw none of the Quidditch World Cup and basically none of the beginning of school. It cut so much i was getting annoyed. But, beside that it was good. It really got going once the Triwizard Tournament started. Actors, were all excellent and i have to say Lord Voldemort was amazing. It was still a good film, i just think they should of made it longer."

This is without doubt the best in the series so far. the other films will have to be the best ever made to beat this! Some of the scenes were amazing from the Quidditch game in the large arena to the chase in the massive maze at the end. The acting is superb from everyone. There was not one performance in this film i did not enjoy - they were all equally brilliant! Another reason why i loved this film is that i did not think The Prisoner of Azkaban was that brilliant.

","The Acting saved this movie. As an avid fan of the books and the previous movies I've always had my complaints about the movies. I was particularly concerend about this movie because there was so much material and so many subplots that all seemed relevant that I wondered how it would be done. I agree with the fact that making two movies probably would have cost too much and may have ruined the series (ala matrix) BUT there were a few key details that were integral to the next book that were left out. Without going too much into that, its evident that the acting of the 3 main stars has vastly improved and to be quiet honest this movie would have failed without them. If you watch the movie from the beginning you can see that not only have the characters developed but so have the actors. Their working with very limited material and they do a heck of a good job. I will not say too much of the directing because the previous two directors took many liberties and Mike Newell is no exception. To be quite honest I think it lived up to my expectations and not more. If we want to go into technicality I would give it an 8.7/10 but its just easier to round up."
"pinayshawti","6","1","1","24 November 2005"," The movie..was half and half
","I think the movie was okay. The only things that I was disappointed about was Dumbledore's act wasn't really the character as described in the book. I saw the part where he was shaking Harry when he thought that Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire. I mean I thought Dumbledore was suppose to be wise and calm! This story didn't show that at all. Dumbledore seemed bitter in this movie. Also, I really hated that the movie definitely skipped so many important parts. The movie was lacking many scenes from the book. I understand it's too hard to put that altogether into one movie. But the solution is..that they should have divided it into TWO MOVIES. There were too many IMPORTANT scenes left out. I was excited to see a lot of those scenes and disappointed when they weren't shown.<br/><br/>The things that I liked were that the characters acted pretty good. The movie was funny and entertaining. But then again the movie would be even more funny if they included some scenes. I don't understand why there are some people that included in their comment what scenes were excluded. YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT!! Don't ruin the story, tell them to read the book. I advise all of you to read all the Harry Potter books.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","1","24 November 2005"," Hero Emerges
","In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" Harry (now older Daniel Radcliffe) arises as a hero. Though not a literary reference, Harry Potter's emergence is reminiscent of another dark hero in ""Batman Begins"". In that movie, Bruce Wayne's mentor Ducard tells his charge, ""The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act."" Granted aside from both movies being Warner Brothers productions, the analogy is not that far fetched. Director Mike Newell's fourth installment of the Harry Potter saga is the series' darkest and perhaps best. Harry (wonderfully played by Radcliffe) acknowledges and reclaims his greatness albeit reluctantly. He battles great evil and his own fear and insecurities through sheer willthe will to act. The evolving Radcliffe embodies his Harry with the right balance of vulnerability and courage as his character believes the best in others while acknowledging his own demons. Mike Newell masterfully crafts his hero's journey reflecting the great storytelling of author J.K. Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves. Hogwarts Headmaster Dumbledore advises young Harry, ""Soon we must face the choice between what is right and what is easy."" ""Harry Potter"" under the guidance of Newell does right. It's about character.<br/><br/>""Goblet of Fire"" opens with Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) attending the Quidditch World Cup. However, things go horribly wrong. The arrival of the Death Eaters and the Dark Mark in the skies foretell of the return of Lord Voldermort (malevolent Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>Representatives of two other rival schools arrive at Hogwarts to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. The names of the school champions are selected from the Goblet of Fire. The competition is restricted to 17 year-olds. The three champions selected are Viktor (Stanislev Ianevski), Fleur (Clemence Poesy), and Cedric (Robert Pattison) from Hogwarts. Surprisingly The Goblet of Fire makes a fourth selection: 14 year-old Harry. All contestants must endure three challenges where they could possibly forfeit their lives. Harry has the least training of the four. Also Harry knows he must eventually face Lord Voldermort, the man who killed his parents and failed to kill Harry himself.<br/><br/>This dark story of redemption is a compelling hero's tale. At it's emotional center is a powerful and compassionate performance by Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. He has great support from Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. Michael Gambon is perfect as the brave and wise Dumbledore. An almost unrecognizable Ralph Fiennes is a powerful force as the evil Voldermort. In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" Radcliffe's Harry arises from the ashes like the Phoenix reclaiming and embracing his inherent greatness, and inspiring greatness in others. It is not the training or wizard's talent, rather the power he distinguishes deep inside himself that saves Harry. Harry finds the will to act, and fights great evil while reconciling his own fear.<br/><br/>Mike Newell's ""Goblet of Fire"" establishes Harry Potter as hero. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry has emerged as a gifted and powerful young actor. May the evolving story of the wizard Harry Potter in the movies continue to transform and compel as this movie does."

There are vital parts and characters that are missing. They just cannot fit the book in two and a half hours. And it didn't turn out as a fast action movie. More like a series of sketches based on the book.<br/><br/>Also the actors were bad in my opinion. And 16-year-olds Radcliffe and Grint are just to big and mature to play 14-year-old boys like Harry and Ron. (Pretty soon Elijah Wood would be a better choice for HP than Radcliffe) Also I think I've seen this Voldemort guy in several movies playing extra-terrestrials! Now what was that all about?! It totally didn't fit the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Cho Chang was well chosen, and the Ball scene was pretty good, but these were the only good things. Well some effects too...<br/><br/>As a whole there are a large number of really short unlinked scenes sharing the same characters. The plot bounces up and down and...

I think he was the best of the 3. If you are expecting this movie to be fun and good for kids, you might try thinking again. Voldemort was so evil looking, and ran and acted so evil. It was quite eerie. And the death eaters were pretty scary too. But for the most part, it wasn't especially scary. It was just that part with voldemort (which lasted about 15 minutes) and the part with the death eaters which only last a few minutes. I have a bone to pick with the fact that so much of the book was left out. (((***SPOILER***)))they didn't show ANY of the World Cup tournament! I mean, come on! We all wanted to see that, did we not? Yeah, sure, they show them getting all seated and cheered up for the quidditch match, but then, just as the competition began, the freaking scene ended! They didn't show it! (((***SPOILER***))) Also, they didn't even show Cedric Diggory's funeral! COME ONE PEOPLE!!! UGH!!!!!!!!! Anyways.

I must admit that the action sequences in the tri-wizard tournament were very well done and looked very real. This Movie was definitely not as bad as ""prisoner Of Azkerban"".

"critical-escapist","9","1","1","23 November 2005"," Entertaining and simplistic, even thought it doesn't capture Rowling's original glimmer to the original fourth book.
","This film is the ""darker"" one, with the PG13 rating. Some fans consider this a treat and thinks of it as a better movie or something just because a ten year old can't get in alone. But I should just start off my review with negative feelings such as: I enjoyed the first film with the sugarcoating that was exactly like the book. That's how it would always feel like from here on. I'm not saying this is a good or bad movie, yet - but I just want to make my point so people won't come and destroy me in the middle of the review.<br/><br/>The beginning with Voldemort and the World Cup is really rushed. It seemed as if ten scenes were cut out and we are automatically presented with the Dark Mark, a sign of Voldemort's. The audience is told that ""he is back."" I think this film is really only for the people who read the book. I am sure if this film was presented to someone who never read it, they would be confuzzled in question marks. Nothing is explained in this film. It seems as if everything was just ""rushed into."" Nothing gets any development - not emotionally, physically, or even in CGI terms.<br/><br/>Then we get to Hogwarts - the ""excitement"" is about to begin. Anyway, we find out about the Triwizard Tournament and how Hogwarts is hosting it and how two other schools are also participating. Because of some great magical force, someone enters Harry Potter into the dangerous competition, even though he is below age limit and is not allowed and the whole thing would be too dangerous for him. The sad part is that we know everything is going to be just okay and he's going to come back victorious. Just the scene makes the situation just too predictable. Harry is joined by three other competitors - Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory. (sorry for any spelling errors - I'm typing this quite fast as the moment) The four is joined in three tasks that are all really dangerous and some might not even survive.<br/><br/>The film runs through its twist and turns and of raging hormones and puberty. Yeah. You heard me. Harry Potter is going through puberty. (Yeah, that makes me laugh, too) The Yule Ball is quite interesting, though, but that is also rushed, like some blocks of cement or something. The romance in this film didn't really work out well for me. I thought it was kind of pointless in a way because it was sort of crammed into the whole plot with the Triwizard Tournament. A scene in the Yule Ball I would like to mention is when the students starts partying like they are in some 80's teen flick. That felt rather ... strange. The whole idea just didn't fit in well. But it was really - interesting.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie goes on and on. There are some parts where it shouldn't be rushed but they rushed it. There are some parts that should be over ASAP, but it doesn't work that way. It just took forever.<br/><br/>Near the end, Voldemort rises from the caulderon. Do you know what's missing? THE SPEECH! He doesn't give a speech. He rises, and he talks to the Death Eaters (aka, the KKK - at least they looked like them - only with Halloween masks) a bit and then suddenly he feels like attacking Harry. If you haven't seen the film yet and is eager to see how Voldemort looks in full-form instead of the trailer one that shows him as something that looks like a ball of wax, think: Ralph Fiennes with AIDS and a bad nose job.<br/><br/>Now, the performances. I really liked Brendan Gleeson and Miranda Richardson in their roles. They were excellent comic relief and they really kind of ""saved"" the film in a way. The trio is okay, though. Not spectacular or anything, but okay. I really though Emma Watson is going to become the better performer, but now she kind of just levels with Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, which kind of disappoints me because since Sorcerer's Stone, she kind of was the leader of the pack and was really good at it, but now she just kind of ""floats"" in the role and is slowly fading. Whenever I see Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, I feel that I really miss Richard Harris. I thought Harris made a better Dumbledore. The supporting cast is still great, with Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman, which really makes the film shine. Ralph Fiennes makes a ""believable"" Voldemort. Not a great one, but acceptable, I guess - but dude, you can do better than that! I wished he had more screen time, really.<br/><br/>As much complaints I have about this film, I thought it kept me entertained. Mike Newell isn't the kind of director that lets emotions run through or lets everything go. The scenes felt tight and awkward at times and their real smiles seems fake and at times, the actors seem clueless. I'm not thrilled about his HP directorial debut and I'm not looking forward for him to make another Potter film. This film is OK. Just so. It had good performances that kept me going and the classic British humor that made me chuckle. It was enjoyable and fun and I don't really have anything to say. I just have to remind myself not to sweat the small stuff because this is really not that bad of a film. And I'm sure the PG13 rating doesn't stop little kids all over the world from watching this film.<br/><br/>And what happened to Hermione's SPEW? My rating: B (85%) - yeah. out of 100% (8/10 for IMDb because on IMDb I rate movies on how entertained I was, not by the quality)"
"wtmorrison","4","1","1","23 November 2005"," Well, it wasn't what I had expected.
","I don't want to give anything away, for those of you that want to know if it is worth seeing. Well, I have been an avid fan, and all this did was close a chapter. There were so many things missing in this movie, I can't even begin to list them. If I hadn't read the book several time, I would have been asking a lot of questions.<br/><br/>This is also the first movie where you really get to see Dumbledore put his wand to good use. He was supposed to be the most powerful wizard ever, and I got chills while reading the book. I was really disappointed when he came across as weak. The overall acting in the movie was slightly overzealous, probably due to the new director. It really just didn't live up to the reputation that the previous movies had established for it. At least the next one will have a different director."
"novinson","6","1","1","23 November 2005"," Way too dark, cast remains great but Newell must go
","Everyone I know that has seen this (7 so far)has been disappointed. Not all have read the book but all share the same disappointment. One of those that saw it with us commented that it seemed like a rush from plot point to plot point like someone was checking off a list.<br/><br/>There was no comparison between this film's composer and John Williams.<br/><br/>It needs another half hour and another director. Everything is too rushed but most of all it needs the balance that was in the book. Cutting out Hermoine's crusade was a big mistake. It would have been a much better film with it. Were they trying to save a few bucks in the CGI? The cast does a great job and the special effects are excellent for the most part. It is a low point in what has been a great series.<br/><br/>The loss of Richard Harris was offset by Alphonso Cuaron's great job of directing Azkeban. Michael Gambon is not the same Dumbledore and that is really evident with this director.<br/><br/>We can only hope that the next one will be a little more magical. They could start by buying some lights, paying John Williams anything he wants to come back and getting rid of Newell. They could also spring for more than one outfit for Gambon. He looks like he got into make-up and shot everything in one day."
"dtxtellsit","4","1","1","23 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the next in a line...
","The short and long of it... Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Should be called Harry Potter and the Next in a line of movies that are too long especially for a sequel-sequel. No way should anyone have to watch this movie this long. Acting was decent, however the scene stealer doesn't speak (you'll see). Special Effects are good-enough to keep you from walking out. Liking this movie hinges on details from the book(hope you read it) and how you relate them. One of the movies hopefully intended successes- it reminded me of everything I hated about being a fourteen year old boy. Don't worry if you're over fourteen and female it will remind you of everything you hated about being a fourteen year old girl. Nevertheless, I have seen much worse and paid more to see it. My suggestion wait until 2008 and watch parts three,four,and 2007's part five on DVD at home where you can take solace in the fact that you are no longer fourteen."
"sanj26","10","1","1","23 November 2005"," Simply Brilliant
","Those that read the book would understand how good the movie was. But, I have to say that Dumbledore doesn't have the charm he's supposed to have. I hate the guy playing Dumbledore. It's not that the actor did not do a good job, it's just he doesn't quite fut into the character. He doesn't have the serenity the kindness in his eyes as Dumbledore should have had. The first person to play the role of Dumbledore was perfect, but unfortunately he's not among us anymore. I feel that the person who played Gandalf(Ian McKellen) in LOTR would fit much better for the position of Dumbledore. But, overall the movie was excellent. The cast did an excellent job. I recommend everyone to go see it."

The actors are excellent!All the young ones all improved very well,they are far better than the first movie!Fred and George are funny as usual(I like them,always make me laugh)I really like the part when Harry and Ron keep talking with each other,well i like all that part,it was funny^^...the adults were good too^^but,like it says in another comment,i found Dumbledore weird.The way he talks to Harry and when this one comes back from the graveyard,it's as if he was yelling at Harry to get up and he shook him.It's as if he lost his patience.Well,probably it's done on purpose but,still a strange Dumbledore. I don't think he would act that way but it's only a book,not reality^^'Still the movie was good. Maybe the young child,under 8 years old,should not see it,there're some parts that they could find scary(like the part in the graveyard)If you don't know what to see at the theaters,well that's a good movie!"
"JJ-152","7","1","1","22 November 2005"," Missed Opportunity
","There was an opportunity for the 4th installment in the Harry Potter franchise to be nothing short of great. But I simply can't agree with those who have given this movie a high review, and here's why: As suggested by others, in order to bring a 700+ page book into a 2-1/2 hour movie, some (or a lot) of story elements would have to be deleted. Normally this isn't an insurmountable problem. However, in 'The Goblet of Fire' story, it is exactly those 'extra' elements that make this story wonderful. If there's one thing anyone who has read most or all of the J.K. Rowling books knows, it's that there are no unnecessary, unimportant, or otherwise 'extra' elements in her stories. That is one of the key reasons the books are cut above everything else. The end result for the movie is that we are left with an extremely jumpy storyline that simply follows the critical path, providing the viewer with only the most basic information to keep the plot moving forward. There is absolutely no in-depth character development whatsoever. The book was FILLED with wonderful character background history, especially the Professor Moody character. The movie barely scratched the surface. In addition, there was little or no continuity between the major scenes, and almost no feel for the passage of time. This was supposed to be an entire school year, but other than the changes in the weather, the audience would never know it. For anyone who's been to Disneyland, the best analogy I can think of is that this movie is like taking a trip to Disneyland, staying only 2 or 3 hours and only going on the 3 biggest rides - then rushing back home to heat up some microwave dinner. Now, absolutely that beats a trip to the dentist. But when you get home and think back to all of the things you missed, will you really be satisfied with the experience? I wouldn't . . . and I wasn't. Look, the bottom line is that these books (starting with Azkaban) needed to be multi-part movies, similar to Kill Bill Vol 1&2 or the last 2 Matrix movies which were actually one movie broken into 2 parts. Azkaban needed to be a 2-part movie and 'Goblet of Fire' needed to be 3-part. What really blows me away is that the studio doesn't recognize this. It couldn't have taken much more (if any) production time to make a 6 or 7 hour 3-part movie. In fact, I wouldn't doubt that the cutting room floor already contains the other two movies. Ticket sales would be just as high for each of the 3 episodes as it would be for the one (as proved by the Matrix), so why not maximize the studio profit and the audience viewing pleasure by giving this movie the full attention to detail it truly deserves?"
"dhananjay101","7","1","1","22 November 2005"," Good effort
","Although the pace of the movie seemed a bit too fast, I guess it was actually difficult to condense the 636 page book into a 150 minute movie. The graphics used were excellent, and seemed quite realistic. I felt it was a good movie for the one who's read the book, and had a background (seen the previous movies). If not, he/she's gonna have a tough time trying to grasp whatever's shown. The casting's also pretty decent, especially in the case of Cho Chang, Parvati/Padma Patil, Madame Maxime, and Rita Skeeter, and they've lived up to their characters. I was shocked at the non-inclusion of Winky, the elf, and also at the fact that Barty Crouch Jr. was shown conjuring the Dark Mark, when in the book, it has been kept as a secret. They've also not included even a hint of S.P.E.W, the House-Elf Liberation Front, the fact that it's Moody who saves Harry Potter from Snape's office and takes the Marauder's Map, and a lot more (for those who're wondering what all this is, go read the book). But again, it would've been next to impossible trying to include all this in a 150 minute movie. To sum up, it's a very good effort."

","Never have I experienced a book translate to silver screen where it was ""Deja Vu"" It was just as I imagined when reading the book.

The special effects are outstanding, the actors have really grown into there respective characters. I will be going again this week on request by my 4 year old son, who also loved it.. He is a huge fan, and has been since he was freshly 2. I personally don't think it is dark, as the news is reporting, and find it acceptable for any HP fan, Adam fully understood what was going on. I highly recommend this film for anyone with an imagination.

"JAZZyie","8","1","1","22 November 2005"," Great but not Amazing
","I saw the film on the day of release. i was so excited and couldn't wait much longer so i was glad to get tickets (the last 2). But i was disappointed with the fact that there was no Mrs Weasly or Ludo Bagman although the way the film is panned out he isn't needed. but it is very rushed in the beginning the rest of the film is a bit mixed speed, slow in places but rushed in the next. I know that they had to fit a long book in to a watchable film but there are some things that they cut they shouldn't of like how Barty JR became Prof Moody it was never explained clearly why he was Moody and not really Barty JR. and they didn't need to do all the flying around the roof tops with the dragon (but it was good) i'm also upset that there was actual swearing not just the normal ""Bloody Hell"" i did enjoy it but it wasn't to the book totally like they promised so if u want it to the book you may be disappointed"
"ThefelineGod","9","1","1","22 November 2005"," Just calm down. It's good.
","Let's start off by saying it is not the book. No movie ever will be able to contain all of the glory and wonder of a book, particularly J.K. Rowling's wonderful literary gems. What is managed in the movie, and I would say more so in this than the previous three, is all of the essences of the story are present, even if a great deal of the text is cut.<br/><br/>This has by far the most perfect special effects that have been seen in the industry thus far. The dragon scene is much longer than in the book, granted, but I could have sat and watched only that for an hour. It was beautiful. The Dark Mark is awe-inspiring, and for once, when a person is made into a CGI creation, they actually still look like a person.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant, as the three kids have become marvelous young actors. Rupert Grint has finally learned to stay in a scene when he is not speaking, and Emma Watson has gained a mastery over high emotion. The additions of Miranda Richardson, Frances De La Tour, Brendan Gleeson, and David Tennant (The new Doctor Who) were fantastic. Mad-Eye Moody may not be what you expected, but he grows on you after his teaching scene. Rita Skeeter is exactly like the book portrays her, but unfortunately her character does not get the resolution of the book. I would say she is still a valuable addition, and I am glad they kept her in. Madame Maxime is perfectly gigantic, and was amazing to boot. As for Michael Gambon, it is not his fault that he is not Richard Harris, and if you are still expecting that you will not get it. His Dumbledore is different, and I would use the word edgy. The thing to take into account with his actions is indeed that the times are getting dark, and he has a great deal on his plate.<br/><br/>As for problems with discrepancies in the book, here is my one big spoiler: neither Winky, nor Dobby was in this movie. I know the reaction, ""How is the plot possible then?"" Simply trust me in saying that it works despite their absences. I was as upset as anyone about their lack of appearance, but the movie works very smoothly anyway.<br/><br/>You will see that a great deal has been cut, and for that I cannot bring myself to give it a prefect score, but I believe it is by far the best of the movies, and I look forward to seeing it again.<br/><br/>Also, if you have the opportunity, go see it in IMAX, it is unbelievable."
"arkeller77x","6","1","1","22 November 2005"," It's time for a Kill Bill, multiple volume approach to these movies.
","This might just be due to the fact that Goblet of Fire was the first Harry Potter book I actually read. After seeing the first three movies, I began to enjoy the storyline and background developments quite a bit. So when I happened to read Goblet by chance, I could not have been more excited for this movie to come out. Now, lacking the history of reading the three previous books, this might be an observation already accepted by those who have read them prior to watching the first three movies. But for me, this was quite literally one of the worst film adaptations I have ever seen in my life. This film carelessly left out some of the more interesting and key elements of the book. Not only that, but those elements it did leave in failed to convey the meaning, relevance and emotion of the book.<br/><br/>In an effort to save time, important character development was blatantly left out of this film. With it's breakneck pace moving through the elements of the book as if it were skipping chapters at a time. Not only did it limit the effectiveness of this film. But it already cripples the next book's (The Order of the Phoenix) ability to make a worthy adaptation.<br/><br/>Rowlings book contains so many plot elements and so much character development, that it they can simply not be brought to the big screen in one fell swoop. This movie and easily the adaptations to come would benefit greatly by taking some queues from Quentin Tranatino. You could have easily made two movies from Goblet of Fire alone. And the director would have been able to maintain the story's developmental structure.<br/><br/>As a movie, it's not bad. But to be honest, it really isn't that great either. As mentioned before it moves from one event to the next with such speed and lack of set-up it is like a scene to scene versions of a jump-cut. The inability to dazzle me with effects, while still being an effect laden film is equally disappointing. The mystique of the Beuxbaton girls was non-existent. The gloomy and dark presence of the Durmstrang students was noticeable for about one second as they first entered the great hall. Not to mention the casting for Viktor Krum was equally poor. On the whole, the acting (especially from the main three, Radcliffe, Grint & Watson) was sub-par. This book had the potential for an amazing film. Now, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has read the book."

","I am a very big harry potter fan and i must admit I'm not much into the movies, although I really enjoyed the 3rd one. I was really hoping to see something fantastic in this movie, because it had the story of the fourth book, which is in my opinion the ultimate one from the series. but I was disappointed to the maximum!!!! why?? because it's nothing like the 4th book!!!!!!!! for god's sake, even Hermione's dress was pink when it was blue in the book! they just took the major and general lines of the story, like harry, Hogwarts, the Triwizard Tournament, Durmastrang & Beauxbatons, 3 challenges, Cedric dead and Voldy comes back! and that's about it!!it goes much too quickly from one action, one bump in the road to another and for those who haven't read the books, it will be awfully hard to understand something! I didn't even notice when i was standing in front of the first task! it all happened too fast!things are totally different and they didn't follow the book AT ALL!!!! after stating so many times that they tried to be loyal to the book, i thought they really had been....well...i was wrong! i have 2 major discontents that bugged me through the movie!!1. Ludo Bagman doesn't appear at all....and he was a rather charming and important character in the book. 2. Michael Gambon does a poor, a very poor job....he didn't understand Dumbledore's character at all! Dumbledore is supposed to be calm, rational, not impulsive and yelling at students that Cedric is dead or to harry whether he put his name in the goblet of fire! and Dumbledore is surely not supposed to be this wacko genius who sits on the floor and talks to harry about very important stuff! god...if that was indeed Dumbledore in the book, i would've been happy when he died in the 6th one!!! But it's not!!!! Dumbledore is the guardian, the best wizard alive, the only one who can protect harry against Voldy and he shouldn't be yelling or spitting life theories on the floor!! i hate Michael Gambon for transforming the character into such a loser, literally, i wish they had a chosen another actor! so, as a conclusion, you should go to the cinema and see it, but don't have high expectations, like i did! it will only get you down ever worse!"

","Word is going around that there were many plot holes in the movie from the actual adaption of the book. Yes, it is true. But the movie is wonderfully made and this is the first Harry Potter movie which has emotions in it. It is dark, dangerous and sometimes keeps you at the edge of your seat. The scenes are really well shot and the appearance of Voldemort in the graveyard is one of the most spectacular scenes in the movie. The movie shows us that Harry and his friends have now matured. It brings out the best in the actors and actresses. The movie has it share of humor as well and Ron is hilarious. The relation between Ron, Hermione and Harry is very touching and the wail of Mr. Diggory rings in your ears several minutes after the scene is over. The movie in true words is Magical."

","This movie was incredible. Not only in the story line itself, but also with the effects and performances of the actors. The movie sucked me in from the very beginning. I jumped at some parts of the movie and almost cried at the ending because Daniel Radcliffe gave such a powerful performance. While the movie was not exactly like the book, I am not in the least bit disappointed. They did a magnificent job in presenting Voldemort. And everyone is making a huge deal out of the PG-13 rating. Younger audiences will probably have very little trouble dealing with the graphic images, especially the ones who have read the books. It had a good balance of suspense, character growth, and humor. While this is the darkest of the series so far, it was somewhat lightened by the constant humor (i.e. Mad Eye Moody and Professor Snape). This is the first movie to show real growth in the characters, a developing love story and a preview of the trouble yet to come forth.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it for anyone."
"JoshtheGiant","7","1","1","21 November 2005"," The Best Yet
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is not the best of the Harry Potter books, in fact its about in the middle, but in the case of the movie it is by far the best of the movies in fact it is almost a great movie and possibly better than great films such as On the Waterfront and Saving Private Ryan. The cutting out of lead characters from the original films seemed like a major mistake when I first read it, but ends up being one of the best things about the new Potter film. The lack of the dreaded Dursleys and of Mrs. Weasly only help put us in th mind of Harry Potter as he becomes more of a teenager and less of a child. The only character missing that would help is that of Sirius Black who is you hear narrate a letter and see a computer generated face but is barley in the movie. The acting and direction are both really great the standout performances are by Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody, and there's a major surprise in a great performance by Emma Watson as Hermione who has seemed slightly lost in all the other films and never really worked before. The visual effects are some of the best ever put on film, the only ones that could match it at all are those in The Return of the King, War of the Worlds, and Revenge of the Sith. This is one of the best films of the year, and the best of the gradually great series."
"jessosky","10","1","1","21 November 2005"," Awesome
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an excellent movie. I personally loved it! The acting was good and they did a great job on it. It mostly sticks with the Triwizard Tournament and doesn't show anything else. It leaves out a few things from the book but what can you say the movie is already 2 and a half hours long. I was disappointed because the third task wasn't as I expected, they mostly had every one running around and not battling anything. It was very sad when Cedric died, you felt bad for Harry. It is kinda dark and the third task is a tad bit scary. But the movie rocked!! I wanna see it again soon. The actor who plays Cedric Diggory is very hot, and so is Victor Krum. Hermoine looks so pretty at the ball. It is hard to remember that Harry and the others are only 14 years old because the actors look so old. They have grown up so handsome and pretty. If you loved the other movies, you gotta see this one! It is the the best! Even if you haven't read the book I strongly urge you to see the movie. You will not be disappointed!"
"franklstein","5","1","1","21 November 2005"," Good but not Magical
","The fourth big screen adventure of the hapless Boy Who Lived sees our hero inexplicably wound up in the Tri-wizard tournament, a sort of one-off magical sporting contest for thrill-seekers. Unfortunately, Harry is not one of these thrill seekers, preferring a quiet year to a breathtaking CGI fuelled adventure quest. Yet to what reason Harry has been placed in the tournament remains a mystery<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire is automatically noticed to be a darker movie, its opening sequence being a chilling dream about another threat to Harry's quirky life. In tone, GOF is a much darker movie than its predecessors, playing more to the book's murkier elements rather than its lighter aspects. And this is where GOF manages to do well. Four Weddings and a Funeral director Mike Newell does well to portray a sense of suspense. The film excels in is special effects. The producers have obviously spared no expense in giving the movie a visual dominance, with dragons, mermaids and yet more freckle reducing anti bodies for the leads (or so we think)<br/><br/>Sadly, however, there is little else to applaud about The Goblet of Fire. The film does seem to be the weakest in the series so far. In fact, one could talk until the cows come home about the problems with this movie. The directing is lazy, the cutting shoddy, and the (remaining) script atrocious. However, one must sympathise with the filmmakers. The 636 page story is such a bulky book that returning screenwriter Steve Kloves struggles to find which plot is the most prominent. The plot is about as messy as a dragon at a tea party, as there is an incredible amount of contrasting material. First, you have a nice little conversation and suddenly it's a mind blowing (but altogether uninspiring) set-piece. The real reason why the plot is untidy is that unlike in Chris Columbus' (first two) films where there were long bits of dialogue and plot development, interspersed by small (in length) set pieces, GOF has long sections of set pieces with small pieces of dialogue. This results in a messy plot which you simply don't care about. It seems that rather than caring about the magical mystery drama or the normal life of Hogwarts, the producers seem to only think of the ""crowdpleasing"" visuals. This leaves the film with little charm or heart to be found, a factor that made the previous movies so comforting. GOF also falls victim to the hype brigade's overhaul of the Harry's first sexual awakenings. Katie Leung's Cho Chang is featured in only a handful of scenes, and, even though it is quite a charming affair, the Christmas Yule Ball seems a wholly climatic event. Yet the film is by no means a disaster. A host of new characters do help, with Brendan Gleeson's hyperactive 'Mad-Eye' Moody, and more notably Ralph Fiennes suitably eerie Dark Lord. The acting has certainly improved (despite very little dialogue anyway) and the leads seem to carry off their lines with little problem. Fiennes seems to save the end from a dark verdict, with a truly exhilarating finale in contrast to the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire is good fun, and it is easy to be enthralled for most of the 160 minutes one lies there. But the filmmakers need to change tack before they consider how to approach the Order of the Phoenix."
"atkineve","7","1","1","21 November 2005"," Torn and Conflicted
","There were a lot of really great scenes in this movie, rather choppily stuck together, with much of the substance cut away, but a lot of good scenes.<br/><br/>I think a lot was lost when the powers that be decided to fit this book into a 2.5 hour movie. I understand a lot of sub plots must be discarded when making a film adaptation of a book, but I think this went too far. No Ludo Bagman, no Winky, no Rita Skeeter nastiness, no Barty Crouch sneaking his son out of Azkaban.<br/><br/>Also, Dumbledore's portrayal was HORRIBLE in this film...shaking Harry, filled with way too much energy, and having little humor or understanding with his students, as his character in the book does.<br/><br/>A lot was missing."

","didn't like it. I didn't hate it, but I was very disappointed in a lot of it. I thought the editing and pacing were atrocious. I didn't think Voldemort was scary. He was manic and almost goofy to me. A lot of the key scenes were completely over the top and hokey. I thought Dumbledore was literally going to start chewing the scenery. Some scenes went on WAY to long and others were to short in relation to their importance. The whole thing with Myrtle was just gross.<br/><br/>Now I think the acting (except for Fiennes, who I normally love) was fine and the effects were great. It seemed like to me they had the footage to make a better movie and just didn't. It lacked the gravitas and emotion 4 should have.<br/><br/>I am not a purist, I can handle changes..I love Azakaban which changed plenty of stuff and I don't miss Dobby or Winky...but the film just felt wrong to me. It felt sloppy and thrown together and cliché.<br/><br/>I laughed some and in places the film worked...overall I give it a C- and a grateful sigh that Mike Newell is not directing the next one.<br/><br/>Sorry, I know everyone else loved it. Sometimes I think my expectations are too high."

","First off, I really like the Harry Potter books, and I have enjoyed the first TWO movies (except for the relationships). I especially enjoyed the fourth book in the series, the Goblet of Fire. This review was made based on my viewing of the Goblet of Fire: Sounds/Voice Acting: 8 I enjoyed the sounds but the voice acting was somewhat...hilarious as more and more is being discovered. I noticed some spelling errors on the scriptwriters behalf, my most favorite being prof. Mcgonagall(sp?) about how the Yule Ball being on Christmas eve ""NIGHT"". Now that was pretty enjoyable. At times I could barely understand whats going on from the quiet voices and at others so loud...The only thing that made up for this was the main voice acting performance, in a class of their own.<br/><br/>Main Voice Acting: 10 Wow. not the game, but I really enjoyed the main voice acting, giving them a class of their own. While it could have done without some MAJOR drama, it was pretty fun and enjoyable to just be able to speak normally. The main characters were superb (just these three, no one else). I also noticed a more Harry/Hermoine intimacy...not that I'm complaining Book Relevancy: 0 O.K... This is what really gave me something to ramble about. I don't know what the director and scriptwriters were on but never, ever, even think about doing a less oriented plot than this. I've even seen movies that aren't even based on a movie with more relevancy to a book than this. First off, what happened to Dobby (he was ""eh?""), how Senior Crouch Died, the Quidditch cup (really anticipating), experiences with Draco, Snape, Hagrid, etc. BUT what REALLY got me off was Dumbledore. I don't even want to know WHAT the heck was going on. Dumbledore never truly was angry except for the Crouch, never MANHANDLED his students (Harry), or raised his voice and was not polite. I was truly disappointed as Dumbledore was amazing in the books. Don't even get me started...The only thing this has in common with the book truly is the name.<br/><br/>Special Effects: 9 Dragon, Water, Maze. Enough said.<br/><br/>Scenery: 8 Excellent as always, but not enough of it (Hogsmeade*cough*) New Characters: 7 Eh, Cho=errrr?, Parvati twins=huh?, Krum=heh, Fleur=meh, Moody=LOL.<br/><br/>Hype: 9 C'mon, who doesn't even think about Harry Potter when someone says great books? Final Score: 7 I wish it could have been better, but a solid movie about random stuff so loosely based on the book it's better for book fanatics to not watch it. Still, I enjoyed it, but for the book's sake, get the Dumbledore into shape or dump the one you have."
"bpark315","6","1","1","20 November 2005"," Does not live up to the book
","I am an avid Harry Potter fan, but I have to say that this movie did even come close to the book. I think it was in part due to bad directing. The beginning scenes zoom by and goes straight into the action. Anyways, this movie tries to stay very true to the book. Tries. Most of the important things and a few details are all in there, but it seems as though the director was racing to cram as much as he could into the movie, instead of focusing on giving it a sensible storyline. Each scene was given only cursory attention, even if they were extremely important. For example, lets take the Quidditch World Cup. We don't know where they're going until they actually arrive, and even then the name is only mentioned once. There is no quidditch action, it goes straight from introducing the team to showing the kids in their tent after the game. Even I was thrown off balance for a bit. Then, all of a sudden, there are these black KKK guys.<br/><br/>The entire movie goes on like this. It's just BOOM BOOM BOOM, one blast after another of isolated snapshots of the book. It's more of a slideshow than a movie, the ""snapshots"" seem unconnected in any logical way. I was able to follow the movie only because I had read the book well; if you haven't or read it a long time ago, it would be a very good idea to read it again before seeing this.<br/><br/>The special effects are nice though. The Quidditch stadium and the dragons are very nicely rendered, and are very immersive. Unfortunately, that the only thing I can think that stands out as REALLY good about this movie."
"jdt831-1","4","1","1","20 November 2005"," This movie was awful and needs to be redone
","All of you who voted to give this movie a good rating are fooling yourselves. You're giving the people who make these movies license to make another piece of garbage like it for the next 3 movies in this series. Too much was left out, and the movie was so choppy, going from event to event, you had no idea what was going on. I have no idea, beyond the return of Voldemort, what the point of this movie was. They put in all the spectacular scenes, and left out the story itself.<br/><br/>What has made Harry Potter books and movies so interesting is Harrys, Hermiones, and Rons ability to investigate, and deal with problems. They did none of this in this movie. They had plenty to do in that vein in the book. I don't understand the point of many of the scenes in the movie. The Quidditch World Cup scene was pointless. The Yule Ball scene was pointless.<br/><br/>Another commenter stated that there was a lot missing, but that the movie was almost 3 hours long already. GOF is 2.5 hours long. But I don't understand the point in making a movie if you're not going to do it right. If 3 hours of time would have made this movie better, instead of 2.5, then that's what they should have done. But with that said, I don't think an added 30 mins could have saved this one. But those in charge of making this movie, who won't get any more credit from me here, were determined to make a special effects masterpiece, and forget the plot, and subplots that make Harry Potter interesting to begin with.<br/><br/>A note to Warner Brothers: A little less special effects, and a Whole lot more of the story would have made you money in the long run. Harry Potter is interesting enough without spending the bulk of the finances on special effects.<br/><br/>If you've read Goblet of Fire, you'll be disappointed. If you have the money to blow on seeing the movie, go and see it. But don't give them one penny more than one admission price. They don't deserve it for this one."
"skytag","5","1","1","20 November 2005"," Disappointing
","First, let me confess that I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books, so my perspective on the movies is entirely based on the movies as they stand on their own. I've seen all the movies, though, and this was the first I felt was disappointing. Granted, I don't know to what extent the problems were in the book and to what extent they are problems in the film, but here are my thoughts:<br/><br/><ul><li>It felt disjointed, almost as if it had started out four hours long and then they just whacked out some scenes. More than once I found myself feeling like ""Okay, I guess we're done with that part"" and wondering what I'd missed or what the point of a scene was. For example, the entire part of the movie starting where Hermione wakes Harry up, up through the scene where the damage is assessed after the Quidditch tournament, didn't seem to contribute anything significant to the story. As much as anything it seemed to be about impressing us with the Quidditch stadium. Indeed, it was impressive, but all that and no Quidditch? And then we just left it behind.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It suffers from something I see all too often in TV shows about teenagers, and it goes something like this: ""Even though we've been close friends for years, I can't jump quickly enough to the conclusion that you did something so despicable that now I don't want to have anything to do with you. I'm not going to listen to anything you say and I hope you rot and get all you deserve you piece of slime."" In this case it was Ron's reaction to Harry being in the tournament. I don't think I've ever seen a real human being act so immature -- though I see it a lot in shows about teenagers -- and I find it really annoying. I guess I didn't have the right friends when I was growing up because the ones I had weren't like that.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Could Ron Weasley be any more annoying? I can only assume that's the way Rowling writes him, but boy is he a loser.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Once he materialized, Lord Voldemort just didn't seem that menacing. I expected more from an ""ultimate evil"" kind of guy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I was not impressed with Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore. I guess I was spoiled by Richard Harris' performances in the first two movies, but even so I thought Michael Gambon was better in the third movie than he was in this one.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Frankly, I don't think any of the kid actors are all that outstanding. Unfortunately, while they have some excellent talent for the adult parts, we saw very little of it in this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending was lame.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole movie seemed dark, and I'm not referring to the themes. It was as if they were using an underpowered bulb in the projector.</li></ul><br/><br/>After reading several reviews here, both positive and negative, here's what I've concluded: The people who think this is the best film of the series have read the book at least once (possibly many times) and don't need to rely on what's in the film to understand what's going on. Instead, they're just happy to see some of the book come to life on the screen. The people whose opinion is less than glowing almost always say something to the effect that important elements of the Harry Potter story were left out, and that would explain why there were several times I was left wondering about something. Those who have read the 5th book seem concerned that the next movie may have a tough time making sense to non-readers with so much left out of this one. Many comment on the lack of smooth transition between scenes at times, and I'd agree.<br/><br/>The effects were top-notch, of course, but frankly good special effects have become the norm nowadays. Even weekly TV shows have good special effects these days. With each passing year the CGI people can do more and do it better and cheaper than ever before. Ditto for the makeup departments. So while I enjoy special effects, it takes more than good effects to make a good movie.<br/><br/>While I don't expect a single film to show everything from a 700+ page book, I think a movie made from a book should still have a story that can stand on its own and I don't think this movie met that criteria."
"benholl","9","1","1","20 November 2005"," JK Rowling is a genius--the filming of this, her work, is not (read if you have read ALL of the current HP books)
","In reading this review, do not misunderstand: I loved the movie; but only as such: a movie. I did not love it as an adaptation. The whole of this movie was not a true adaptation; Great elements were left non-existent: The Weasley twins, Fred and George, and Mr. Weasley, arriving by Floo Network, and giving Dudley suspicious candy that has a nasty reaction (in Dudley and his parents point of view)on Dudley. In my opinion of the scene, it is hilarious, which adds to my disappointment; this was something that saddened me, to see that this was not in the film: I was anticipating this scene, among others, to be in the film, and found that they were not. The biggest mistake (and I cannot fathom how it could be overlooked), was the Tri-Wizard tournament winnings: They are, in the book, to be given to two particular members of the Weasley family (Fred and George) and this was not within the film; to someone who has not read the books, but has only seen the film, it would seem that this isn't a big deal, but it most certainly is: These winnings are what fund the twins' future endeavor, and should have been placed in the film. Why is it that something so short could not be placed in the film, like the Dursley's scene, yet we have an escaped dragon, and a lengthy battle, when this does not happen in the books, yet no simple scenes that really did exist in the books? I was OK with the idea that the Quidditch World Cup was short as is was--at least it was there at all-- but some things should not be omitted, and this should have been two movies. For once, I would like someone to step up, and say ""no more cuts for adaptation. Everything stays."" As a film, I love it.. please understand that; The movie is great, I enjoyed it. I am merely disappointed in yet another adaptation left somewhat dry."
"otcmedic","5","1","1","20 November 2005"," Screenplay adaptation really bad
","The screenplay for this movie really ruined it for me. There were major things missing and things in it that weren't even in the book. I re-read the book again right before going to see the movie - big mistake. Why didn't we see more of Ron's other brothers? Michael Gambon was way over the top, he plays Dumbledore like he hasn't read the books. Where was Winky and Dobby? What happened at the end with not revealing all the Deatheaters, like Crabbe and Goyle? These are just a few of the things left out that irked me. The last hour of the movie felt like a bunch of false endings, it didn't flow well at all. Honestly, I felt like this one was just churned out to make a buck. I hope this isn't indicative of how the rest are going to be done."
"jsmclainak","6","1","1","19 November 2005"," Dumbledore Train Wreck
","Yes, I liked the special effects. Yes, I liked the improvement in skill of the actors. However, the director needs to be slapped around for allowing the Dumbledore character to be completely misrepresented. He is supposed to be a calm, level, even-tempered ""rock"" for Harry in his times of trouble. This character needs meds. How very disappointing. I took my 12 and 13 year-old children to see the movie tonight and none of us were happy with the film. Of course, HP fans will need to see it. However, we all believe that it lacked depth, went WAY too fast through important background material, and neglected the sub-plots beyond forgiveness. In summary, we were all disappointed in the film."
"discoelephant64","4","1","1","19 November 2005"," Far to rushed, just wasn't on par with the book.
","I must say that, at the ripe old age of 12, buying my fresh, hardcover copy of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" with my allowance money at a local Chapters was a thrill in itself. reading it as fast as I could was another thrill on top of that. When the movies were in production Iwas ecstatic and simply couldn't wait for ""The Goblet of Fire"" as it was, and still remains my favorite of the 6. I must say, I was let down, in a very big way.<br/><br/>The movie opens with something straight out of the novel, but then, everything seems to be kicked into fast-forward, without even touching the remote. I couldn't believe it. The entire movie seems as if it happens over a period of 7 days, not 10 months. There was no substance, not subplots, and, most tragic of all, I didn't care about the characters one bit.<br/><br/>The past 3 movies have tried very hard, and succeeded for the most part, in developing the characters and having them grow from film to film. However even Ron and Hermione were degraded to almost cameo roles. The conflict between Ron and Harry lasts all of 5 minutes, and there was little to no friendly interaction between characters. The three tasks were all that were focused on at all, with the dragon taking up the most screen time, however being the most pointless part of the film.<br/><br/>I wish that director Mike Newell had taken warner Bros. advice and made two movies, shooting both simultaneously. I am aware at the amount of work this takes, but if he were to do this, and edit both at once as well, he would have achieved a superb adaptation. But this film was sadly lacking in everything that makes Harry Potter what it is. I didn't care what happened to the characters, if they lived or died. All I cared about was when it would finish. The acting was wooden, the script weak and to full of stupid humor.<br/><br/>Maybe someday, these films will be reinvented the way they ought to be. And maybe then I'll give a damn."
"alovell2002","6","1","1","19 November 2005"," A Letdown From The First Five Minutes
","My God what a buildup! From the very start I was on the edge of my seat anticipating the Quidditch World Cup. The Irish National team races in over our heroes heads and begin the show only to be interrupted mid-celebration by Krum and his team. The crowd goes wild as Krum circles, a larger than life version of him pumping his fists flashes across the enchanted stadium and then...the damn movie flashes forward to the kids in the tent...after the game! At this point the movie was dead in the water. No character development, a broad-brush approach to a beautifully written plot, a horrible performance from Gambon and disjointed editing of cut scenes ruined this potential blockbuster. Oh sure, it'll make tons because of the mindless mobs who will love it just because it's HP, but we as HP fans deserved better from Newell and his team. Two 2 1/2 hour films would have been sufficient. If you can't dedicate something like that from here on out, please stop making the books into films! I hate you Mike Newell...and WB."
"neil-488","3","1","1","19 November 2005"," Shot Glass of Fire
","If you read the book, prepared to be disappointed. The movie was 2-1/2 hours compared to the previous 3-1/2-4 hour Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban and the book was twice the size of any of these books. They left out more of the story than they put in. This was like buying a Porsche and not getting the body. There will be people that will like the movie, probably because they never read the book. They were slim on effects. They must have really had a tight budget to leave so much out. Some of the previous films were so detailed, they were like heavy Cream, but Goblet was like was like Skim Milk, white water. Maybe Warner's has decided that the Harry Potter films are no longer a good franchise to invest in. I wonder what J. K. Rowling really thought of this one. Probably only her close friends and family will know."

I definitely prefer Chris Columbus as director(movies 1 & 2) instead of Alfonso CuarÃ³n(movie 3) or Mike Newell(this movie). The second two directors tried to make them cool or whatever, but they are supposed to be in their robes the whole time at school. In this movie they skipped a lot of things like:(sorry, not in order) -Winkey -Villas -Dobby(not Neville) giving Harry the Gillyweed -Harry giving winnings to Fred and George for joke shop -The fact Neville's parents went crazy because of the Cruciatus curse -Weasleys getting stuck in the fireplace -The whole Quidditch game -Stuff in the maze(that was just lame, nothing but closing walls and killer vines) -Death Eaters don't do what they are supposed to -The ending was crap!<br/><br/>If I think of anything else, I'll post it too."

","I'd have to say, if you haven't read the book don't go and see it. It misses out so many crucial details that if you don't already know the story you will be completely lost and confused. New characters that are prominent in the book are given their own scene to be set up in honour of the original story but only appear for about 5 seconds in the rest of the film (Rita Skeeter as an example).<br/><br/>As in all the other Harry Potter films there are some incredibly cheesy lines that are cringe worthy and you feel really sorry for the actors who have to say them. The filmmakers should really have spent more time developing the characters of the actors who can actually act. Alan Rickman is sorely under-used, as is Robbie Coltrane and I don't think I even saw Julie Walters! <br/><br/>But after all that it is quite fun. Complete mindless tosh but it has some good lines. If you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan you may be disappointed because (unsurprisingly) there are many character and plot cuts, but if (like me) you think Potter is just a fun story, and not particularly a good book, then you'll have a laugh. Nothing too intellectually challenging or hard. But not a film you'd want to watch twice!"
"kaanryhn","8","1","1","19 November 2005"," surely a wonderful movie for readers of Harry but for others???
","I saw the movie last night and it deserves being watched. I really enjoy the film as a H.P. fan. However, this film is really hard to understand for people who haven't read the fourth book, so if you haven't read the book you most probably won't like this movie.. for readers it's just another fun and a new question: ""How will be the next film?"" On the other hand, Mike Newell couldn't improve the quality of the film as much as Alfonso Cuaron did. I think that the directors' understanding of the characters were quite different from the book; especially Dumbuldore was seemed to be were angry and excited unlike the book in which he was usually calm. My other disappointment about the film is the final of the film. The scenes in which Voldemort appears lacks being scary and exciting especially when compared with the scenes full of Dementors in the third film. In short surely a wonderful movie for readers but for others???"

","Knowing that it was Mike Newell who was going to direct the film i thought even before seeing it that i wouldn't like it. I was wrong. The film is very funny and remains , in that way, faithful to the book... The actors are brilliant, the kids keep getting better and better, Miranda Richardson ( Rita Skeeter ) is hilarious and Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) is perfect... the twins are extremely funny especially when Fred (or George, can't tell one from the other) asks Angelina to go with him at the ball... However, enormous mistakes are made. the beginning is very disappointing, the most important informations are not given (we don't know, for example, that the house is the house of Voldy's parents...). We only see Sirius once, no one seems to care about what happen to Barty Crouch ( the one with the mustache) after he is seen unconscious in the woods and after saying over and over that the weird sisters were played by Jarvis Cocker and two radiohead members you only get to see them once. fortunately, the songs they play are brilliant. Finally, the end sucks.... everyone is happy and doesn't seem to be troubled by what just happened at Hogwarts....Mike Newell saw the funny aspect of the book, the incredible humor of JK Rowling (which is already good) but he missed the darkness of the book. Columbus had made a massacre of the books because is only interest was to focus on the story.Alfonso Cuaron had seen the atmosphere and the poetry of the books and that is why his movie was closer to the Harry Potter spirit and remains to that day the best harry potter film... The only director who could have seen the real pain, the real darkness that is in the 4th potter book and that we find again in the 5th and 6th book, is Tim Burton. When I read the books, it was like reading Burton's universe, his dark humor, his characters. Only his visual genius could have made a perfect adaptation of Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the goblet of fire is not the story of a boy who feels like an outsider because he doesn't know how to ask girls to dance with him. He is a teenager who has to face death and the dark side that is in him. Lord Voldemort is not just some crazy psychopath, he is Harry's double (through all the books Rowling shows us the similarities between Harry and the dark lord). Just like catwoman is divided by her two personalities Burton had already expressed that duality, that's why it's a pity that no one offered him the chance to do it one more time."

First of all, many scenes were jumpy and I didn't know what was going on. Basically, if you haven't read the book, good luck in figuring out what happened in some parts. Even though I read the book I still had trouble following the story. Second, it seemed like the movie missed crucial parts of the book, and instead inserted pointless dialogue and unnecessary comments. Many scenes left me thinking, ""...What?!?"" Third, it seemed like the director was more focused on graphics rather than the plot itself. Again, there were many unnecessary things that the movie didn't need. I was also looking forward to quidditch and the tournament, and was VERY disappointed. In collusion, I did think this movie was okay for all the information that needed to be covered. Other things in the movie: The boys need to cut their hair. The style in this movie is much different (it is a different director) and I preferred the last director. Also Dumbledore, to me, came off as rather rude and rough, COMPLETELY different from what he should be. That is all."

It has great acting, great special effects, and a good plot (the best one in the book series). As for the pace of the movie, all I have to say is to be sure to be on time to the theater because this movie picks up right and the beginning and is a none stop roller-coaster ride. This movie mixes in humor very well for being the darkest one of the series, I often found myself laughing out loud at certain spots. Not to give anything away, but this movie is dark.

","First let me say that I am an avid reader and Harry Potter fan. Yes, I am one of those fools who stands in line at midnight for Rowlings books as well as the movies.<br/><br/>As such, I was certainly not expecting to see the more than 700 pages of Goblet of Fire on the screen. This movie, however, flowed much better than Azakaban and was certainly action packed. Even more though, I got a bit of comedy that I was not expecting to see.<br/><br/>If you're an avid reader you will certainly miss the Dursley's, the unusual behavior of the dustbins at Moody's house, the levitation of the campground family by the death eaters, the majority of the Quidditch World Cup, Doby, Winkie, and Hermione's obsession with the house elves enslavement just for starters. Much more will leave you saying, ""Well, what happened to..."". You will also note that a few things are there, but ""out of sequence"" and/or done by a different character than in the book.<br/><br/>The background of new characters is left completely out and indeed they are given very little screen time. I do believe they did this to focus on the three main characters. As a reader of the books I had the background and didn't notice anything untoward. I went to the movie with someone who has never read the books and he did have questions.<br/><br/>As far as all the new actors and actresses go - I can't possibly name them all, but here are a few. Brendan Gleeson did an excellent job as ""MadEye"" Moody and Miranda Richardson was a superb Rita Skeeter. Stanislav Ianevski was much too good looking for Vicktor Krum while Clemence Poesy was a perfect Fleur.<br/><br/>In all, this movie gets a thumbs up from me! Super!"

Though some scenes seemed rushed (I would have liked to have seen more of the Quidditch World Cup, really) and the subplots were gone (No SPEW...poor Hermione), the overall tone of the book is still present.<br/><br/>Though we can't forget the danger presented at the beginning of the film (in fact, if the music alone won't let you forget, the nonstop action and some of the characters' conversations will make sure you remember), there are still plenty of laughs (in fact, Moaning Myrtle's scene in the book has been expanded a bit in the film...providing plenty of amusement though poor Harry would probably say otherwise).<br/><br/>Some things, I think, could have been done better (Sirius' head in the fire just looked goofy and Voldemort's ""I can touch him now"" line...well, it can be misconstrued quite easily by fanfic authors writing slash), other bits that I had worried about surprised me by being well done. The dragon, for instance, was great - and the scenes involving Cedric Diggory's death were handled well.<br/><br/>Overall, 9 out of 10."
"SeminolePhenom","8","4","9","17 November 2005"," A darker but marvelous fourth chapter to the incredible saga...
","Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione(Emma Watson), and the Weaselys attend the Quidditch world cup over their summer break, but it is terrorized my a large amount of Death-Eaters shortly after the match, showing signs of Voldemort's loyalty.<br/><br/>After the Qudditch World Cup, they return to Hogwarts to find that Hogwarts is hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament, in which three schools compete for the Tri-Wizard cup. One student from each school will be chosen from the Goblet of Fire, but you must be 17 or older to enter. Mireacously, Harry finds himself the fourth champion selected and becomes hated by many because the widely spread belief of cheating on his part. As if he doesn't have enough problems with his friends, a nasty reporter, and vicious dreams involving Voldemort, Harry finds himself battling dragons, solving puzzles, and dealing with sea creatures in the name of ""Eternal Glory"".<br/><br/>Let me start my review by saying that The Goblet of Fire is a personal favorite for me, so I most certainly viewed this forth film with extremely high expectations.<br/><br/>Being the forth film to the saga, and third director used, ""Goblet of Fire"" shines brighter than any other of the Harry Potter films, or shall I say ""darker"". If you thought that the previous Harry Potter film (Prisoner of Azkaban) was dark, then you are in for a treat. This is by far one of the darkest family films I have ever seen, but it most certainly impressed me. Vicious, bloody battles are scattered throughout the Tri-Wizard tournament along with wonderful acting on the part of Daniel Radcliffe, who I am starting to find more talented with each movie. The brutality of this film was so much more than the previous three, that it might be hard for parents to enjoy as much with their kids. The film is definitely more clever and humorous at certain points, but can get extremely intense and dark. The one single aspect of the film that I can see fans having a problem with is the way the movie flowed and their choices of what scenes to use or not use. The story differed a little from the book and the movie seemed to move a little fast but then again, what choice did they have. The movie is still two and half hours long and they had to narrow down a thousand page book! Fans need to get over it and just enjoy the film for the film, not the book. Overall, The Goblet of Fire did not disappoint my extremely high expectations in any way whatsoever and the film set forth what should be an excellent next couple of movies.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film."

","I think SOME people who write reviews should remember that books rarely translate to movies well or in the way you expect. So unless you go to an adaptation with and open mind and with the view of seeing it for being a FILM and not ""oh that wasn't in the book"" or ""god they missed that bit out"" - then don't go.<br/><br/>Great film. Musch better than the other 3. The actors are really beginning to come out of themselves and thrive on the camera. Still some ""slightly"" woody acting bits but on the whole thumbs up. A really good night out for any harry potter fan or anyone who is interested in fantasy.

","This was definitely the best out of all films so far, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all gave a fantastic and improved performance. Mike Newell is a genius<br/><br/>The Weasley twins were hilarious, Ron being a sulky teenager was great, Hermiones love interest really good, and Harry's whole year at Hogwarts was for him quite awful in most places, the scene when Harry returned to Hogwarts with Cedrics body was really upsetting, even though I've read the book at least 10 times.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we don't actually see the Quidditch World Cup and there are several characters missing, such as the Dursleys, House Elves, Sirius Black and the Blast Ended Skrewts, but lets face it if we had everything from the book it would be about 4 1/2 hours long.<br/><br/>I've already seen the film twice and will definitely be going again soon."

","This one is undoubtedly The Best Harry Potter Movie. Director Mike Newell has done a great job in adding all the essential parts of the movie and crammed a 600 plus page novel into a 2 and a half hour movie. You really don't feel that anything is missing,cause you will be so much engrossed in the movie that you will not even realise what they left out. The chemistry between the main characters is brilliant, you can feel the ups and downs of the friendship between Harry and Ron, and also Ron and Hermioni. This is an ""edge of your seat"" movie.

"geo85-1","10","3","6","21 November 2005"," its all in the direction - excellent
","as a devoted and keen reader of this series, i have to admit that i was disappointed with the first 2 movies - the third, PoA was an immense improvement on Chris Columbus's vision and child-friendly representation.<br/><br/>PoA confronted and remedied issues regarding location, (Hagrid's hut, the Forrest, etc.), the dumbing down (or rather up), and the overall mixture of darkness with magic.<br/><br/>Mike Newell has adopted Cauron's approach, but given the franchise SO much more. EVERYTHING in GoF has been up'd a notch - the acting is nothing short of remarkable, everyone - including Michael Gambon - have embodies their character's personas so well, and in Gambon's case, truly made it his own. I have always been sceptic about Radcliffe as the boy who lived, but i have to say, my opinion of him after seeing this has done a complete 180 - he has developed his acting skills and interpretation of Harry so well, and credit must be given to the 16 year old for doing all of his own stunts - the dragon sequence is spectacular.<br/><br/>Newell has finally directed the film with a British sense of humour, something which has been missing from the previous three, and that is INTEGRAL to the whole HP series. His additions to the story, that of the extended first task, Nigel, a more eccentric Filch and the ****SPOILER***** the universal sense of bereavement in DD's speech (with the absence of the enchanted ceiling for once)following Cedric being murdered gives the film more without taking away anything in the books - it is really moving and sincere.<br/><br/>furthermore, the casting of Gleeson as Mad Eye is quality. this guy knows how to act - and encompasses all aspects of Moody and Crouch Junior. the yule ball scenes are amazing - the combination of eloquence and the weird sister's after-do works really well and gives a realistic view of the emotions experienced by teenagers at their first formal.<br/><br/>overall, this movie has exceeded my expectations - i feel this is mostly down to mike Newell's perception and direction of the book - cuts had to be made guys - this is a 700page book, but Newell has done so in a respectful manner in order to make the transition from paper to screen."
"shane-183","10","3","6","21 November 2005"," A true family thriller
","This movie is truly enjoyable. I have seen it twice (yes, I am a Potter fanatic, so I might be more than a little biased.) However, both time I seen this film the entirely audience had an excellent time. Parents were not bored, and enjoyed some humor and a truly interesting plot. Children had some jokes placed in the film for them, along with some amazing visuals for everyone. Two small children did cry during the appearance of Lord Voldemort, but this film is not to violent for most children over the age of 5. Fans of the series will be delighted by some small touches placed n it just for them, and people who are not fans of the series will still be given a cinematic treat."
"wryanmcse2","6","3","6","18 November 2005"," Fun romp, but sadly disappointing
","I love the Harry Potter series and was excited after reading all the positive reviews after the premier. Unfortunately this movie is a dud. It was so choppy in it's presentation of the book, and I can't fathom any reason for some of the ridiculous, time consuming, changes they made. The Dragon/Golden Egg contest of the TriWizard Tournament was just lunacy with the changes made. All the cool computer graphics and the mashed together scenes left very little room for getting to know the characters and develop them further (other than as action heroes). The best part of Prisoner of Azkaban was the character development and storyline. GoF is almost entirely short visual scenes, very little dialog and a fast paced action. The flow was definitely and problem and I hope they don't use director Newell again. They should also fire the screenwriter. The only upside is getting to see some of the scenes from the book acted out. If you are a HP fan then you can't help but enjoy the film, however it's disjointed-ness and odd changes from the book will leave you feeling cheated out of what should have been a much better picture. The ending was poorly done as well, the director/screenwriter just couldn't seem to capture the same mood that existed at the end of the book and instead decided to make changes that left you feeling like you hadn't heeded the warning label on your allergy medicine."
"ThePickleMan2","6","3","6","18 November 2005"," Lackluster
","Not a bad movie, but not a great one either. I realize going into this I shouldn't expect brilliant acting from the kids, Daniel Radcliffe in particular, so the moments of below par acting aren't what turned me off to this movie. The main problem was that the characters were changed. Dumbledore lost control, something I would never have pictured him doing in the 4th book. Cedric was made out to be more of an ass than he is in the book. The storyline about Weasley's Wizard Wheezes was CUT! Now it's possible to have this line come back in the next movies, but much harder because there were never any mention of Triwizar winnings, so Harry never gave the 1000 Galleons to the Weasley twins. I realize there are time constraints for a movie and they can't show everything in the book, but they wasted time by adding new and unimportant things. Instead of Harry simply facing the dragon like he does in the book, there's about five minutes of him struggling without his wand. When he finally gets his broomstick, the dragon breaks free, and they go racing around the rest of the castle. It shows off the new technology we have for making special effects, but it doesn't further the story. Also, there was no point to show the students have a dance lesson, except for the sole purpose of getting an audience laugh when Ron has to dance with McGonagall."
"jaime-59","10","3","6","16 November 2005"," Harry Potter...More than a ""Children's"" Book
","As a graduate student in education, I have found Harry Potter to be excellent pieces of literature to utilize in the study of different topics featured in social studies. Not only does Harry Potter provide teachers with suitable material to teach about discrimination (Civil Rights Movement), slavery (The Civil War), and genocide (Holocaust), but he also allows children to digest lofty concepts that would have traditionally been left to the college professors and adults.<br/><br/>Critics of Harry Potter need to understand that JK Rowling did not create the series with the intention of keeping to the children's literature circuit. It is obvious, when studying the Harry Potter series that she had more than a simple story in mind. With her background in languages, she has developed a hero that is Christ-like, and a story that is more biblical than Christian nay-sayers would like to admit. To ignore the popularity of Harry Potter based solely on the ticket sales and its position on the best seller's list would be doing this incredible epic a disservice.<br/><br/>I will forever defend Harry Potter (the books and the movies), because I have seen students who would never think of picking up a book, read during their lunch period while their friends socialized and gossiped...thanks to Harry Potter. Rowling has created a fantasy world worthy of Tolkien; her masterpieces must be recognized for the amazing educational value they hold for children and adults alike. To say they are ONLY for children defies what Rowling intended for her books to be...they are the books of our generation that will forever mark our society's history."
"gimmecheze","5","9","27","16 November 2005"," Books are far better!
","The movie was disappointing. It was very choppy and if you have never read the books, you would be EXTREMELY lost. The scenes were so short since they had to make it through so much book. There didn't seem to be much talking either. I wouldn't have minded having an intermission for a two-part film, and I don't think Harry Potter fans would oppose either. The music wasn't as captivating as the other movies, which is probably because John Williams didn't compose the music for this film like he has in the other ones. I do hope that he does for the next film. I wasn't a huge fan of the other movies, but they were better than this one. I think that if you are a hard-core book fan, you will probably be disappointed in the movie since it is missing so much. If you only see the movies, be prepared to be completely confused. Decide for yourself if you like it or not, but I was highly disappointed."
"cctsurf","1","13","44","18 November 2005"," Confusing and Choppy
","I love this series, but this movie confused me. I was really disappointed. Perhaps the world created in the previous movies was not to Mike Newell's (the director) liking, but entirely changing the world (except for the ricketty bridge) in this movie really detracted from the flow and interest. This change was the first of many that seemed unnecessary in this film, both from the previous movies and from the books. While the dragon scene was exhilarating, there was almost no connection in that scene to the book, which I thought was a better story. Also, the Clock tower, which was forefront in the previous movie, was changed--WHY? This movie was also very choppy, I understand it's a long book, and therefore difficult to compress into a movie, but I have been told by those who haven't read the books that they couldn't follow it at all. Would it have been that bad to add an extra half hour if it would have made it smoother? Come on here, the movie and books have almost a cult following. On the other hand, I was impressed by the use of facial expressions to portray the emotions which could not easily be displayed in a movie, but beyond that, the movie was horrible."
"poohlittle","3","7","21","20 November 2005"," Big disappointment
","I was rushed to see this movie, however, was overwhelm by disappointment within 5 minutes into the movie. Where should I start?? hm.. Let's see.. the movie started out w/ Harry at Weasley's and dream of Voldemort w/ Wormtail & Barty Crouch Jr. (??), the Quidditch World cup was only last about 5 minutes screen time up, no game play.. no veela.. no Winky... no woods.. all you see the the pre-game seen, intro of the player (mainly on Krum), then you see the death eaters firing up the camp site, then straight to the school to the gable of the fire where Dumbledore lost his cool (he pretty mush jumped on Harry & shook him to death!), no Hagrid teaching the care of magical animal class or the blast-end skewt! And the dragon seen was totally SO not in the book! There are main characters missing (Charles & Bill Weasley) and they had made Hermione Granger looked as-if she is boy crazy!! Oh, and Fleur Delacour was a blond! Wasn't she suppose to be part Veela? Where is the silver hair? And if you think you don't see enough of Hermione (about total of 10-15 minutes of screen time), then you will see a lot less of Ron! Or anyone else for that matter! Should I continue?? The whole story was chopped & twisted!! I understand that it is hard to do a whole movie w/i 3 hrs of time frame, however, I just think they can do a better job than this.<br/><br/>Man.... Can I have the original director back? This is the worst of all 4 movies!! I really like the first 2! The 3rd one was good, still follow the story line, for the most part...even though they had made Dumbledore seem like a crazy angry old nut w/ a little personal hygiene problem (have you seen the fingernails?) but this... is something else.... really...."
"luvturtled","6","4","10","18 November 2005"," Unsatisified but entertained
","As many fans of Harry Potter did, I flocked to the theatre tonight to see the newest in the Harry Potter collection. In attendance with me was another person well versed in the Harry Potter lore and someone who had never read the books. The un-read friend found the movie slow and floundering, as we, the well read, did. She found herself dozing and yearning for more of the Harry-Hermione-Ron interactions that this film lacked.<br/><br/>The well-read attendee and I felt that the movie was rushed. Fully realizing that a book that is as long as Goblet of Fire is cannot contain all of the fun and enjoyable plot points, many of the points that were included dragged the movie down. I would prefer to see a movie that stays true to the overall theme of the book rather than a movie that forces a story together and shouts ""I hope you like what we did, we sure tried to get everything."" <br/><br/>I left the theatre desiring to read the book again to regain the enjoyment I had and the anxiety I felt about the friendship and the tournament. Although there is no good place in the story to create a split, I would have preferred to have seen this movie split up into 2 films to get everything, rather than what Mike Newell and company forced together.<br/><br/>However, despite what I wrote, I did enjoy the film but do suggest that you be prepared for a long film and not be tired. I will try again at an earlier showing and hope to leave feeling better about the latest tribute to Harry Potter!"
"nomad107","5","9","30","20 November 2005"," Harry Potter 4 stinks.
","I saw this movie on its second day running, and I must say that there wasn't much laughing or oohing or ahhing anywhere in the theater except for a section near the front where everyone was dressed in black cloaks and carrying broomsticks.<br/><br/>This movie was a stinker. About half way through my wife turned to me and asked how long it had been showing (now, I'm 25 and she's 23, so when I say that we're married and didn't like the movie, don't assume that we're a could of geezers who wouldn't get it anyway). I checked, and it had been going for an hour and twenty minutes; then the damning question jumped into my mind: what's the point? The way the story was unfolding, it didn't look like we were in for the intriguing mysteries that had made the first three films in the series. This was just a typical high school teeny-bopper story, except the characters all happened to be witches and wizards.<br/><br/>The real story to the Harry Potter series is supposed to be about how Harry continues to learn about his past and his relationship to Lord Voldemort; it's a detective story with magic. I think that what went wrong with this movie is that the director lost his focus. This wasn't a detective movie with magic; it was a high school movie with magic. To put it another way: you could take the stories from the other Potter movies and adapt them to a ""real life"" movie about a boy solving a mystery, without any of the fantasy elements, and they could still be interesting movies. If you take the magic out of this one, all you have is Fear Factor mixed with your stereotypical junior high drama. I say give Mike Newell the ax and bring back Alfonso Cuaron!"
"seaview1","8","3","7","15 November 2005"," HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE keeps the flame burning
","The phenomenal success of J. K. Rowling's series of novels for children about a boy in a school of wizardry has been augmented by the enormous box office grosses of the film adaptations. Left with the daunting task of maintaining the standards and quality of the previous installments, Director Mike Newell has fashioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a marvelous, visual treat that matches the series' previous highs.<br/><br/>A new year at Hogwarts brings old faces and some new ones as the school for witchcraft and wizardry is primed for great change and a growing threat. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shaken by a recurring nightmare as the presence of Lord Voldemort looms ominously, and he summons Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) for advice. Soon a mysterious man, ""Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), arrives to help Harry against the dark forces. The school is preparing for a special gathering of two other schools to compete in a special Tri-Wizard Tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition in which only one older student from each respective school may enter via the Goblet of Fire. Harry becomes involved in the competition to the surprise of everyone including himself. As he and the other students find, the games are immensely formidable with dragons, underwater traps, and an endless maze of hedges. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are experiencing the joys and pain of adolescence as the wonders of high school crushes and the anxiety of the school dance wreak havoc. Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) catches the romantic bug. Mistrust and accusations complicate matters for Harry, and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) expresses his concerns about the future. Before long, Harry, Ron and Hermione bicker amongst themselves as their friendship is severely tested. When the tournament concludes, another set of tragic circumstances opens the way for new evil and betrayal. As the elder wizards (Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman) close ranks to protect the students especially Harry, the future remains uncertain at best.<br/><br/>Ironically, Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is the first British director of the series, and, while he had the difficult challenge of continuing the series, he has added some nice wrinkles and touches by delving deeper into the emotional conflicts of these students. In fact, the maturation and changes these teens must encounter richly add to the already exciting story. We root for these heroes and feel their discomfort and pain because we have in a sense grown up with them. As with any Harry Potter storyline, not all the characters are good and, conversely, not all the suspicious ones are bad. Several plot lines are carried over from the previous films and new ones are primed for future sequels. Screenwriter Steven Kloves, the keeper of the flame, has done a herculean job of distilling the essence of Rowling's novels into each film thus far.<br/><br/>As always, the trio of young actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, own these roles, and the thought of replacing any of them due to age concerns was unnecessary. All three look great as they are now a little older and wiser. Of course, Gambon, Smith, Rickman, and Coltrane are the old pros who are the constants at Hogwarts. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly suited for his villainous turn in the startling climax. Brendan Gleeson does a fine job as the menacing, yet benevolent 'Mad Eye' Moody who supposedly watches over Harry during the tournament. It also seems that the most recent Harry Potter film is becoming quite an international event as the cast of students is even more ethnically diverse than ever before.<br/><br/>As usual, the production values are outstanding with lavish sets and costumes imaginatively photographed by Roger Pratt. The special effects are quite impressive although nothing that you haven't already seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the Star Wars sextet. Just the generous details and little touches throughout the film like the animated paintings add to the overall care that still goes into these films. Make no mistake, this is a lengthy film, but the pacing is good as a large number of scenes are strung back to back to contain as much of the book as possible into roughly two and a half hours. It feels a bit episodic but never loses sight of the main story and the emotional state of the characters.<br/><br/>There are creepy images and a foreboding atmosphere through much of the film. This adaptation does contain more risqué scenes such as Harry's bathtub scene or the terrifying menace of Voldemort, in which the tone gets downright mean-spirited. The students are not so innocent anymore as they curse, and in one climactic scene come face to face with the pain of loss. A PG13 rating signals that the Potter adventures are growing up fast.<br/><br/>It does require that the audience have a background in the series of books or films to fully appreciate the significance of critical events, although the film can stand on its own as pure entertainment and a coming of age. In some ways Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a classic bridge episode similar to The Empire Strikes Back. Not only is it a strong entry in the series with the most open ended finale yet, it proves a good setup for some potentially exciting things to come. Harry's next adventure can't come soon enough!"
"bryandeth316","10","3","7","12 November 2005"," Definitely the strongest!
","I won tickets to the pre screening last week, and I went to see it today and...<br/><br/>I have to say that Goblet of Fire is without a doubt the strongest Harry Potter movie to date. It had all of the emotion from the book from the fear, to the anger, to the sadness....the acting was brilliant.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe I think did an amazing job once again as Harry. During the Yuleball, you believe how much he's yearning for Cho Chang and basically ignoring his date like crazy. Also at the end when Cedric dies and he uses the portkey to get back to Hogwarts, you totally believe that he's been through hell, and is almost out of his mind with grief trying to protect Cedric. I think he also plays off well being angry at your best friend, being afraid of being forced into a situation you don't WANT to be in, but doing what you can to survive it. Great job.<br/><br/>Rupert Gint once again in my opinion almost steals the show as Ron Weasley. From his awkward dance lessons with Professor McGonaggal, to his anger towards Hermione and Harry, he's just amazing. This guy is Definitely going to have a bright future in the film industry.<br/><br/>Emma Watson...I can't say enough about how great she was in this movie. Showing her care for Harry, and her budding feelings for Ron, while still being bossy old Hermione. It's just outstanding how well all three of them have grown as actors, and they bring their characters alive not just...being there if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman for the few moments he was in the movie definitely set the tone for Goblet of Fire with his chilling warning to Harry about the Tri-Wizard tournament and whomever put his name in the Goblet of fire.<br/><br/>The guy who played Cedric Diggory (sorry can't remember his name) was outstanding. He did an amazing job, and he pulled off the part so well that when he does die, you have to shed tears for him, because he's such a likable character.<br/><br/>Draco Malfoy, although with less screen time is just as hateable as ever...you just want to take this kid by the ears and bash your head into his nose...but that's what comes from playing a great villain.<br/><br/>It is also VERY touching hearing Harry have his first and only conversation (although brief because of his duel with Voldemort) with his parents. It really makes you see just how much he's had to put up, and how much he's had to handle in his only 13 years of life.<br/><br/>And Ralph Finnese (sp?) was just amazing as Voldemort...I swear...this guy is just a phenom! He'd Definitely better continue playing The Dark Lord up until the final movie! I could go on and on and on picking out individual performances and I would be sitting here putting out a post longer than the pages of Goblet of Fire. The performances were great....however....<br/><br/>There were some things that got left out that was upsetting. The Dursley's for one (can't have Harry Potter without them), Molly Weasley (you can't cut out Harry's only true Mother figure), Dobby (it's not Neville that gives Harry the weed that allows him to breath underwater, it's the house elf. Dobby shows up helping Harry in the book, why not in the movie?), and finally....why don't they show Harry giving Fred and George his earnings for winning the tournament? They don't even MENTION the money reward, which is kind of upsetting. How are they going to explain where Fred and George get their money for their shop? Big plot hole right there, they'd better fix that! All in all, I gave the movie on IMDb.com a 9/10 because of those few problems. They were minor, and only a geek for the books like myself would notice such things. So...enjoy it when it comes out."

","Wow, poor Harry just can't get a break and a decent year at Hogwarts? Well, I just completed the series that is on DVD at least, hoping to see the new Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix this weekend with my friends, looking forward to it. I'm glad I finally broke down and watched these movies, I knew I had to give in some time since these films are just going to keep coming, you know? Well, The Goblet of Fire is so far the darkest Harry Potter I've seen, but also the best. I loved the whole concept of how Harry can face evil magic, wizards, and dragons, but his scariest time yet: the truth about the birds and the bees. So far I have to say that Goblet of Fire is my favorite Harry Potter film.<br/><br/>Harry is now in his fourth year in Hogwarts and there is a huge contest that is going on for a grand prize, only thing is from each wizard school, only one is chosen to win the prize and you must be 17 or older to enter, but for some odd reason Harry is chosen to participate even though he is only 14. Facing extremely difficult obstacles, he pulls through and makes it in time for the big ball dance that Hogwarts is throwing and he and Ron must find a way to get a date. But there is more trouble when Lord Voldemort is finally about to rise and I don't think Harry is on his good side.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire was a brilliant movie and is probably my new favorite of the Harry Potter films. It had amazing effects and great acting as usual. It was different as well since the kids are now a little more grown up, so they are facing scary adventures, but it's very exciting to watch. I cannot wait for the Order of Phoenix and see where Harry Potter will take us next. Then I guess it's off to the books since I should probably see what everyone is talking about when they say how the books don't compare to the films.<br/><br/>8/10"

Kudos to the young leads- for they have grown comfortable with their roles and are quite adept at handling the greater complexity. The support cast is good- but I can't quite help repeating myself with reference to the genius of Ralph Fiennes' cameo: you almost end up believing that only he could have done it for beyond the look, there is his sinister voice and gait that leave ""a scar"" on your psyche.<br/><br/>And the confrontation towards the end is exhilarating. An awesome cinematic experience- it entertains immensely!"

The actors delivered their parts with so much improvement and though the movie constantly had dark elements in it, Mike Newell managed to create humor throughout the movie as well. Absolutely brilliant. Well done."
"ntfrenk","4","2","4","8 December 2005"," If only my vacuum cleaner sucked like this movie!
","First, let me say I understand that it is impossible to make any book into a movie without bending the storyline(s) and/or reducing subplots. This is especially true for books as complex as the Harry Potter series, and I think the director -or whoever makes those decisions- did a fairly good job stripping the ""Goblet of Fire"".<br/><br/>My complaints about this movie are not that the Dursley and Weasley family scenes were left out or that Crouch's son appeared in Harry's dream. I neither missed Winky, Dobby or S.P.E.W., nor the conversations between Snape and Karkaroff, nor Ludo Bagman or even Sirius (to name just a few). However, here are some of my peeves:<br/><br/>I disliked the movie because it: generally sacrificed character interaction and development for CGI action scenes; dragged things out to the point where they became boring (Harry getting chased by the dragon) or annoying (the prefects' bathroom scene); added completely unnecessary scenes (the performances by the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students or Neville's outburst at the lake); and made any interaction between the sexes look awkward, embarrassing, or ridiculous.<br/><br/>I disliked the movie because it portrayed Dumbledore as a raving lunatic; turned the miserable, mean squib Argus Filch into the plucky comic relief guy; and made Minerva McDonagall a dance instructor - to give just a few examples. <br/><br/>Last but not least I disliked the movie for its bad colors and lighting. Come on, people, it is not the absence of light that makes a movie ""dark"", it is the content!"
"dragonfli56","9","2","4","6 December 2005"," the best yet
","I have seen Goblet of Fire twice in the last week and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. It was energetic...there are very few 'down times' in the movie. It is remarkably accurate, both in detail and atmosphere. I was very impressed by the depth Daniel Radcliffe showed in this movie...he is definitely growing as an actor (which is very interesting as he only got into this business by accident...neither he nor his parents went looking for it). All in all a fantastic 2 and a bit hours of entertainment that leaves you wanting more....I can hardly wait for Order of the Phoenix...looking forward to Umbridge!!! Bron :) :)"
"iamsam103","8","2","4","6 December 2005"," Superb adaption of the book.
","Let me start off with stating that I am not a HP fan. I've read the books, and thought they were fairly entertaining, but nothing special, The first 2 films were adequate, but once again nothing special. I liked the 3rd film because it began to delve into a more sinister and darker tone...which I must say is the setting for this film.<br/><br/>Story: As most people know, Harry Potter is now back at school with friends and foes, but now had been anonymously selected to take part in a competition amongst three different schools. It's good to see that all the films have a sense of structure, starting off with harry going to school, investigation around the school and then ending with a finale and him leaving school. What I did like about this film, is how it took out Harry's Aunt and Uncle, which meant it gave extra critical time to the actual story development (which is a good thing considering the book is massively bigger compared to the other 3)<br/><br/>Acting: Acting wise, everyone is good, not brilliant but not under-average. It's good to see the children actors / actresses finally sink into their roles, whereas in the first 2 films (and sort of 3rd) they seemed rather hesitant at times. Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltraine and the brilliant Brendan Gleeson are all charming and bring unique qualities to their own characters.<br/><br/>Special Effects: Overall they were superb, the dragons, backdrops and even the little things (floating candles) were done superbly and really made u feel emerged in the fantasy world of HP.<br/><br/>Overall the film is excellent and well worth a watch. However, if your expecting a light-hearted and innocent trip through Hogwarts, be warned...things are a lot darker and sinister."
"jalapenoman","2","2","4","27 November 2005"," The weakest of all of the Harry Potter films
","Let's be honest here: the French actress who played Fleur could not act and walked through her part, the guy who played Krum snarled through his, Ron didn't due much more than just mope and whine, and Harry just had the same dumb smile.<br/><br/>The friendly feeling of school chums in the first few movies was gone. The intimate school set of the third film changed to a huge, forbidding and foreboding place for this one.<br/><br/>The direction was terrible. Even Chris Columbus did a better job (and that is saying a lot).<br/><br/>The only spark to this film was the acting of Emma Watson, who seems to have matured in the craft while her co-stars have stood still. If this were not a big budget blockbuster, she might get a supporting actress nomination just for her scene of telling off Ron on the steps after the dance.<br/><br/>The CGI was also pretty good here.<br/><br/>So, two good things in a film with dozens of bad ones. That does not make for a good movie. Hopefully, this director is not brought back for the next one."
"Dr-oh-no","1","2","4","27 November 2005"," Wow...This is...wow.
","Right after watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire I had to just laugh. Why? Possibly because the film I had just seen was more absurd than magical. Possibly because the acting was so bad. Perhaps it was because the story was generic garbage, or the climax was pathetic, or because it was the same boring plot line that the other Harry Potter books followed. Then again, the most likely reason I was laughing was to soften the blow that I had just wasted seven bucks on this unimaginative, uninteresting, and completely forgettable motion picture. It is not a masterpiece as you have been constantly told, nor is it a good movie or even a mediocre one. It is nothing.There is no heart or soul to this film. There is no substance to anything happening on screen. Don't waste your time on this movie, or the Harry Potter franchise. You'll save yourself some time, your brain, and seven bucks."
"wagner-mota","3","2","4","23 November 2005"," I Don't know which one was the worst!!!
","It's hard to choose which of the last two movies are the worst, the first was good and the second it's the best of the four. I would like to ask to Steven Kloves and Mike Newell: WHERE DID HE HIDED THE HOUSE ELF's??? AND WHERE IS RITA SKEETER, because that woman definitely its not her??? AND VICTOR KRUM??? A cat bites his tongue? AND one big question that i really couldn't figured, WHAT THE HELL THEY DID TO THE ""Barty Crouch Junior"" AFTER THEY ARRESTED HIM??? Oh! by the way, i guess the minister of magic had stolen the triwizard prize... Because they don't even mention it!!!

"steal_this_email_address","5","2","4","22 November 2005"," I loathe Newell
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a wonderful story, but it has been told by an incompetent moron. The direction in this movie--especially when compared to the first three--was incoherent and ignorant. It's as if Newell (the director) never even bothered to read the book or learn about the characters. None of the secondary characters are developed, and essential plot is removed to make way for childish little jokes and gimmicks. My biggest upset in this film was the way Dumbledore, a calm, collected, and brilliant man, came off as nervous and hostile. When I saw the scene with Dumbledore shaking Harry and yelling at him, I was disgusted. This is the only bad Harry Potter movie thus far. As a final thought, I think I should say this: I hate you, Newell."
"Penny_Pringles","10","2","4","21 November 2005"," The Potter films just keep getting better!
","After hearing that the massive Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire book was only going to be made into one film, i did not have high expectations of it.<br/><br/>However when i went to the midnight showing of the film on the 18th of Novemeber i was completely amazed at not only the film but the acting quality that shined through. Daniel Radcliffe gives his best and most convincing performance yet and i was deeply moved at his emotional scene when he returned Cedric's body back to Hogwarts. Rupert Grint was fantastic as a moody teenager dealing with jealousy and Emma Watson deserves ten out of ten for her performance of Hermione.<br/><br/>This film is definitely not one to miss! Ralph Finnes gives such a brilliantly dark entrance to Lord Voldemort returning to power and played the character as sinisterly as J.K. Rowling describes him in the book. And of course we can not forget the forever building romantic chemistry between Ron and Hermione. This is captured perfectly by Rupert and Emma who manages to give a humorous and somewhat emotional hormonal heated argument at the Yule Ball.<br/><br/>I promise you that this film does the book absolute justice!!! If you watch it, you won't regret it trust me!"
"RJGinCA","6","2","4","21 November 2005"," A Modest Disappointment
","This is easily the worst of the 4 Harry Potter films. Within that comment, I don't mean to imply that the movie is bad, as it is still among the more enjoyable 2-1/2 hours I've spent in the theater. However, the movie falls far below expectation, and is problematic in many ways.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is JK Rowling herself. It really isn't necessary to write a near 800-page book, geared primarily for children. A story about a young wizard doesn't have to compete with ""War and Peace"" to achieve the page-limit of greatness in literature. Thus, the problem facing Steve Kloves (screenwriter), and Mike Newell (Director)--taking a snippet from the book and making it into a full-length feature film.<br/><br/>What could have been an exciting story, became, what appeared to be, a single scene stretched to 2-1/2 hours. As a result, you get short shrift of many of the central characters, such as Hagrid and McGonagall, and you're left with serious problems concerning content and pacing. Most of the scenes didn't flow very well together, as if major chunks had been exorcised for the final cut, and the editing seemed so disjointed, I left the theater almost numb.<br/><br/>The cinematography was also substandard, as it looked way too dark and murky for way too long. I thought I was watching the movie through a Coke bottle. Add to that some rather insipid dialogue and stiff acting from most of the actors involved, and the overall feel of the movie comes across as rather amateurish and not quite ready for release. And yes, the CGI effects DO get in the way of the movie!<br/><br/>New characters are introduced such as Viktor Krum and Cho Chang with little to no fanfare or plot development, and the dishy Rita Skeeter was an unnecessary distraction that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What I'm seeing is a number of characters that are superfluous to the plot, and that didn't really go anywhere in terms of character development or moving the story forward at any intelligible pace. Getting back to Chang, I can't believe 3,000 people auditioned for that role??? You've got to be kidding--she was only in the movie for 2 minutes, at best! Ralph Fiennes gives a devilish performance as Lord Voldemort, which, although brief, is probably the saving grace of the picture. I really can't imagine this film having the ""repeat factor"" that so many other top-notch films possess. It will make the oodles and oodles of initial dollars, but after that, the film should drop off the radar rather quickly.<br/><br/>I attended the midnight screening of the film, and if the packed-house audience was any indication of what was to come, there was tumultuous applause when the movie began, and then deathly silence, with the few exception of a handful of under-the-breath grumbles as people exited the theater when the film ended.<br/><br/>Overall, Steve Kloves gave us our first shoddy Harry Potter script, and Mike Newell, who was paid 1/10th the amount Chris Columbus was paid for the first installment, directed a dull walk with all the aplomb of a deer-in-the-headlights first-time filmmaker. We're all better off re-visiting ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""....and, Warner Brothers needs to stop handing off this fantastic franchise of a movie to newbie and ""out-of-their-element"" directors. Where is Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg when you need them??"
"cute_butrandom","5","2","4","21 November 2005"," OK but not as great as the hype
","I have to say i was a little disappointed when i saw the film as critics and friends had been saying how well it kept to the book and managed to cut down the story to the essentials. I found that by cutting out all of those elements the film was reduced to a piece that felt forced along at too fast a pace not being able to linger on any important part of the story for fear of over-running its alloted time. By cutting out so much of the book the film lost some of the spirit that has made the books such a refreshing, ingenious and popular series. The fact that the actor they found to play Harry has about as much talent and charisma as a block of wood also doesn't help the film either. The only thing i can say for it is that it had fantastic visual effects and very appealing 'eye-candy' in the forms of Pattinson and Ianevski and that the closing 15 minutes did a little to redeem an otherwise unsatisfactory movie."
"Ellie-23","9","2","4","21 November 2005"," Excellent film, don't miss it, but please read the book too.
","I liked Goblet of fire better than Prisoner of Azkaban. Though it could have been longer and not skipped so much. The music was perfect and the scenery around the castle was enchanting. I will go to see it again this week because it was great. All in all the film is well done and believable. Mad Eye Moody is a little to funny looking to be frightening to an adult and Dumbledore seems less mellow than the book shows him to be. The dragon challenge is exciting but only showed Harry and his dragon. The Underwater rescue was the best of the three challenges in my opinion. The Yule Ball is fantastic, the young ladies were so sweet in their gowns and the young men were so typically uncomfortable. Rita Skeeter is very well done and the quick quotes quill was really neat. I did not like how tall they made Madame Maxime look, though her character was well done. I really missed Winkie and Dobby, after all they were important in the story. The maze lacked the Sphinx, the Scroots, the giant spider and the magic mist that turned Harry upside down but it was certainly scary enough to make up for it. The death of Cedric, the battle with Voldemort(he is really creepy looking)and the scene when Harry returns with Cedric's body are excellent. Cedric is almost a prince charming in many ways. At the end I though it sad that nothing was done with the sending of Snape, Hagrid and others to prepare for the Order of the Phoenix reorganizing in the next book."
"lmacvean","3","2","4","21 November 2005"," Disappointing
","After the fantastic adaptations of the previous books, Goblet of Fire was a huge disappointment. So many subplots and characters were left out that what remained had huge holes in it, ideas dangling, vital events chopped to nothing or a teaser at best: such as the Quidditch Cup and the DeathEaters march while torturing the Muggles above their heads, etc. It was unsatisfying and I wish they had stuck with the original plan of a 2-part movie to better capture the genius and style of Rowling's series. I missed seeing the tiff between Hagrid and Madame Maxime over his suggestion that she might be part-giant, and you couldn't really grasp the extent of Harry's isolation from everyone, including his closest friends, that year. As he is getting older and closer to fulfilling the prophecy, things are getting harder, darker, and more lonely, and being a teenager sucks. On the upside, the Horntail scrabbling across the minarets of Hogwarts after Harry and the scene in the graveyard with Voldemort were fantastic. The scenes of talking to Sirius in the fireplace and finding out the truth about Mad-Eye Moody really reminded me of the book and were effective."
"scifi_luv","9","2","4","21 November 2005"," Better than the Book!
","Wow, I loved the movie! It was so exciting and a real feat in terms of condensing things but making it still understandable to the audience. And I was thinking, yes! that was how Rowling should have done the book. The book contained a lot of flab-- it takes them how many pages to get to Hogwarts? As happens when a writer (director or anyone else) gets so successful they feel they don't have to listen to an editor. The Harry Potter and Cho thing was actually done much more believably in the movie. Lots of people told me the movie was really dark and scary but I actually think the last one was more disturbing with the Dementors. I actually found the filmed scene of the graveyard part not as disturbing as it was in the book. In the book Voldemort comes off as this gross bloody fetus thing and Wormtail hacking his arm off...I liked how it was down in a fairly non-freaky way in the movie. I still think Rowling kind of has trouble making the love stuff not come off cliché in the Potter books. I think Mike Newell did an excellent job with the actors. I've been keeping my eye on him since his early BBC stuff and he seems to strike the perfect balance in tone with the movie that I think works really well. Alan Rickman was absolute perfection as always of course! Loved the bathtub scene...heheh something for the girls at last and all the inuendo and humor. Definitely captured the humor of the books. (Too bad that element has been getting a little lost of late). The dark mark thing-- I always thought it would look more like a brand than a tattoo. The maze could have been cooler as well."
"journeyprowler","8","2","4","21 November 2005"," The best so far...
","I am happy to say that the Goblet of Fire truly made up for the disastrous Prizoner of Azkaban. Mike Newell brilliantly guided the cast into a realm that no other Potter movie has been. There was a new level of chemistry among the acting group, which made me love them all the more. <br/><br/>I will say that the limited involvement of Dumbledore was a wise move. Michael Gambon did a horrible job as Dumbledore. His acting was very contradictory to the typical demeanor of the Dumbledore we have all gotten to know and love. What I saw was not the temperate and amiable wizard Rowling created. Rather he was a bellowing man who normally would make Harry apprehensive to approach or trust with his concerns.<br/><br/>Overall, though, the movie was the best so far and I can only hope that the next will be even better."
"raerae1302","6","2","4","21 November 2005"," Too dark for me
","I thought the Goblet of Fire was great right until the end. I have been a huge Harry Potter fan since the beginning. But, watching this last one was more than I could handle. I enjoyed the action and adventure & appreciated all of the hard work that went into the movie. However, the end was one of the most demonic things I have ever witnessed. I wanted to take all of the kids out of the theater. I couldn't imagine letting my son sit there and watch this. There are images that I will never be able to get out of my head. After the movie I went straight home and threw away everything ""Harry Potter"" that I had. I just didn't want that in my house. I must say, they did an excellent job with Voldemort, he was the closest thing to the Devil I have ever seen."

","You know I really have to blame my ex girlfriend, co-worker, and friends for getting me into the whole Harry Potter thing. I'm really giving you guys a review from 2 perspectives. One: being if you *lighty* or never read the book and just see the movies when they come out. Two: Being the hard core Harry Potter fan who reads the books extensively and anticipates the movies to come out. I fortunately have had the pleasure of being on both sides of the barrel. Not being familiar with the series at all 5 yrs ago. I saw the first 2 movies and enjoyed them. Then went back and read all the books up to Half Blood Prince. I must say up until Goblet Of Fire...on the motion picture side the studios have done a great job staying true to the book. This one however strayed away from J.K. Rowlings classic so much it wasn't even enjoyable. Although I am aware of studio budgets and having to complete a film in under 3 hrs, key elements of the film were left out. Hagrids back story, Harry giving his winnings to Fred & George to set up the joke shop, No Doby leaving a scratch the surface plot on Barty Crouch story, and cameo's from Riter Skeeter...Sirius Black...and Draco Malfoy who played key characters in the book. The movies did have it's bright moments though. I enjoyed the humorous Professor Moody, Fred and George were equally comical, and the dark graveyard scene with the battle versus Lord Voltimort was the climax of the movie. However overall this movie was the worst rendition of the book. Which leads me to say: *If you read the book you'll hate it, If you just see the movies you'll like it*"
"kissmeimawriter","8","2","4","19 November 2005"," Far Better than 1, 2, and 3
","This was fantastic compared to the first three Harry Potter movies. Those I just hated (especially the third one; Cuaron did a terrible job), but this was amazing.<br/><br/>The movie took out quite a bit from the book, but they took out parts that didn't matter all that much, aside from S.P.E.W and the House Elves, as well as Harry in the maze (talking to the Sphinx and what-not). <br/><br/>The special effects were incredible. The dragon looked real, and so did that spider in Moody's classroom.<br/><br/>The acting has far improved since the first one, and the actors actually do look around fourteen. I'm a teen, and that's what someone between 14-16 looks like. The only actor I still dislike is Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, and that's probably because I was so partial to the old one, who sadly died. My favorite is definitely is the woman who plays McGonagall. <br/><br/>The only reason this movie bothered me was because they didn't do a good job at explaining the end. So much happens to set up the fourth book that they just took out of the movie.<br/><br/>Other than that, Mike Newell is the best director thus far."
"marcus_aure1ius","1","2","4","19 November 2005"," Second to PoA in All Respects
","I went into GoF with relatively high expectations after the commendable turnaround work of PoA. After 2+ hours, I left the movie theater feeling rather... empty (and questioning whether I really had just watched a movie at all). Although, I realize the challenges that the screenwriter and director must have faced in adapting such a lengthy book, the effort was glaringly unfocused. The main theme of the 4th book was the Triwizard Tournament, yet the movie gives almost no emphasis on the overarching event besides the spectacle itself. Character development was sacrificed for special effects, and much of the core interaction seemed contrived. My main criticism is that unlike the seamless flow of PoA, GoF essentially carried itself from scene to scene with cringe-worthy transitions if any. And while the acting of the Gryffindor Trio has improved somewhat, the overall effect still left much to be desired. If forced to make a comparison, I would say that GoF is still better than SS and CoS but a definite regression from PoA. Ultimately, it felt as if the movie wanted to do everything at once and ended up doing almost nothing quite well enough."
"takemeout","8","2","4","19 November 2005"," Decent, but misses a lot
","This is a very good movie, but it misses a lot of the story line. This is understandable, however, because the book is very long and if shot accurately to the book, the film would be 5 or 6 hours long. However, it is a big disadvantage because it is quite confusing. I only understood because I read the book, but for someone who had not read the book, this film could easily be very confusing. The directing is good and there is a good mix of thrills, more sinister bits, and comedy. Some of the bigger scenes are breathtaking, such as at the quidditch world cup. Sadly the actual game is completely cut, and this is very disappointing. The film does contain a lot of scarier moments, and does deserve its 12A certificate. However, the very end is quite disappointing."
"skelsey-1","7","2","4","19 November 2005"," gOF
","GOF left out the things about HP that make it great- that's the real problem- Hollywood always makes sacrifices but this seemed more like a theme ride than a thoughtful, dark representation of the book. It did seem rushed from one action sequence to the next and all of the details that make the world of HP come alive for a reader were missing from the film- mostly. It isn't possible to duplicate a book in a film but this didn't even try- it used SFX instead of plot and character dev- shame. It is ironic that CC stayed really faithful to the text of the first 2 books but was lambasted for being too boring- but the books and characters have changed from the beginning - each director has tried but there was clearly no respect for the source material."

","Good acting on the part of the original cast. Rupert Grint has mastered the part of Ron. However, I don't feel that the director and screenwriter were true to the book. There are details in the movie which are much different from the book. The scene where the dark mark appears is much different from the book. Too many scenes from the book are left out of the movie. Transition from scene to scene was not smooth. Too many scenes take place without adequate information leading up to them. Those who have not read the book will be confused. Having read the book and listened to the audio-book read by Jim Dale, the movie was a tremendous disappointment."

I concede that the content that was there did the book justice, but so many of the sub-plots that made the book interesting were non-existent.<br/><br/>If this film was done in two parts, i would no doubt have given it a 9 or 10.

The movie is absolutely amazing! Steven Kloves did such a great job adapting the book to the film. As of now the Goblet of Fire is by far the best Potter film released: the acting was very well done by the main trio and as well as the adult cast (Snape was particularly humorous) and the way the Mike Newell brought his experiences to the movie was amazing.

"magichatqueen","3","2","4","19 November 2005"," ""Bloody hell!"" What a waste of time and talent
","The trailers for this film looked so good that I felt very let down by the finished product. It's awful. There is no getting around it. It is very much style and CGI over substance here. The new characters weren't fleshed out at all, overacting marred many of the scenes, and I feel sorry for the director of Order and the Phoenix, because they'll have some job getting the ""Harry's an unstable liar"" storyline in. I can't believe they didn't show what happened to Barty Crouch Jr, as it is CRUCIAL for what happens in Book 5. There were SO MANY things wrong with this film: 1. Dumbledore. Why is the cool, calm and kindly Headmaster with a sense of humour completely freaking out over Harry's selection and pinning him to a wall? This isn't the character we know and love in the books.<br/><br/>2. It doesn't say much for the screenwriter if the only way he can convey anger/bitterness/surprise is using swear words. I found Ron's telling Hary to p*** off unnecessary and a bit disturbing, and the constant ""bloody hell"" is turning poor Ron into comic relief, which is an insult to his character.<br/><br/>3. What is the point in casting brilliant actors like Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Gary Oldman if you only give them, what, 5 minutes screen time each? Rickman's Snape was CRIMINALLY underused in this film. He stole each of the scenes he took an active part in, but unfortunately, he has been relegated to standing around for a lot of the time. These actors are wasted on this film.<br/><br/>4. Emma Watson's Hermione grows more irritating with each film, largely due to the actress' penchant for overacting. She comes across as bossy and petty in this film. I really hated it where she was criticising the twins for taking Ageing Potion, she kept heaving dramatic sighs and acting like she was so superior, almost reverting back to the way she was before the troll incident in Philosopher's Stone. Like Dumbledore, Hermione's film incarnation is very different from the Hermione in the books.<br/><br/>5.The other champions had no character, no depth, and to be honest, might as well not have been there at all. They were there to look pretty. Viktor Krum had 2 LINES. You get none of Fleur's arrogant, patronising nature, and Cedric was not given the chance to be shown as a decent, fair and honourable boy. Shoddy work from Kloves again. The guy needs to be replaced, I think.<br/><br/>The 3 good points about this film, and I've awarded a star for each, were Snape, as I've said above, Mad-Eye Moody, who was a delight to watch, particularly in the ferret scene - the funniest bit of the movie -and the fantastically evil Ralph Fiennes. He IS Voldemort. One thing that does bug me throughout the films is that no-one seems to get the shivers at hearing Lord Voldemort's name. Oh well, yet another glaring difference from the books. I tried hard to like this film but I just couldn't. The sad thing is that it may be a load of crap, but it'll still rake in the money."
"vanzee66","5","2","4","18 November 2005"," the characters have been ruined
","With the exception of the Wesley's, Rita S, and Moaning Mertyl, the characters were all totally off. Hermione was the biggest example. Somehow shes gone from being the brilliant, nerdy, courageous friend who repeatedly saves Harry's ass, to a sexy crybaby who had almost nothing to do with the story. Dumbledore is now an overbearing, shouting, authoritarian instead of the thoughtful, soft-spoken genius he is in the books. Moody, while not bad, was very different. Instead of being a grizzled old veteran, hes now almost comic relief with his crazy demeanor.<br/><br/>The high points of the movie were the artistry of scenes, the special effects, and the action of the triwizard tournament (which was dead on). The BEST part of the movie, and its main redeeming quality, was the Graveyard scene. IT IS PERFECT! I couldn't have asked for anything more with that scene.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was the HP equivalent of the new star wars movies. If you love special effects, action scenes, and cool scenery, (ie: a moron who is dazzled such things) you love this movie. If you're a true Potter fan who wants something close to the book, you'll be disappointed. Still... it was fun to watch all things considered; just don't expect a ""true to the book"" movie."
"Aberlass","7","2","4","18 November 2005"," Hackneyed Pantomime and The Graceless, ostentatious Foray!
","'The Goblet of Fire' is the most traditionally exciting (a maze, dragons, mermaids, flying horses) of all the Harry Potter books, so expectations for this film are greater than for the other films. I expected to see Screen magic. Once Mike Newell had decided which plots to omit completely he should have made up for loss of comedy (Dursleys, House Elves), proved to be a success in the other films, but he didn't. The result is reminiscent of Director Chris Columbus's handling of the 1st film, 'The Philosopher's Stone', which was almost impossible to follow unless having read the book first. Of the three Directors to make the Harry Potter films, it was the Director whose first language was not English, who made the most complete and professional film - what does this mean?<br/><br/>The Worst Bits: Newell has not understood the heart/pulse of 'The Goblet of Fire' and treats it as a Pantomime of Goodies and Baddies! What? It is a Theme that is utterly annoying and destroys credibility: the constant, unrelenting flicking of tongues (like a snake), which signify the Baddies. This is too immature a device for a film of this calibre and it's shocking the actors did not know better, nor the Editor! But it's the music that kills the audience's relationship with the film. Patrick Doyle's replacement music for the much over-used John Williams is irritating, intrusive and antiquated; all wrong for the images it is meant to support. The combination of annoying music, bits of stories, lacklustre makeup, boring costumes and minimal comedy is an odd mess. Moreover, there are Veela (alluring Beauxbatton Sirens) in this film and only once was this utilised, mainly there are lots of provocative images of boys (poor Harry in the bath)! You'd never guess that Newell went to an all-boys school (sarcasm)! It's like a bad 'Tom Brown's School Days' Opera Video! It is time a female Director took charge of the franchise to stop the films becoming a Tim Burton issues retrospective; after all, a woman created Harry Potter! Is Nora Ephron available?<br/><br/>The Best Bits: The special effects were better than in previous films, but isolated, unexplained (my audience laughed when the Durmstrang boat submerged ""Look, it's sunk!"" someone shouted). The Quiddich World Cup and the Yule Ball looked wonderful, so it was sad that nothing was shown, not even the outfits (apart from Hermione's)! The only redeeming aspect of this film (which makes it worth watching) is the acting; in particular: - Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Frances de la Tour and Oliver & James Phelps. These six actors carry the whole film in a way that they never have in the previous Potter films, because this time they under-acted, using emotion as a tool of radiance. Plus, Rickman gives the impression of knowing what will happen to Snape in book seven (he didn't flick his tongue)! Newell will go down in history as The One who spoiled the Final Book for everyone!<br/><br/>My Rating: Film/Movie 7/10, Special Effects 9/10, Acting 9/10, Makeup & Costume 4/10, Music 2/10, Directing 5/10, Editing 3/10, Screenplay 7/10, Cinematography 6/10.<br/><br/>Certification: UK Law states that scenes of children being stabbed, with blood evident must make this a 12A. Everything else in the film children will probably have seen before. This film is nowhere near as horrific as 12A 'The Brothers Grimm' (parents removed their little children when they saw how sick this film is). The main reason that 'Goblet of Fire' is unsuitable for under 12yrs old is because they will be bored (in my Cinema, little ones running about playing, not watching film)! <br/><br/>Why See This Film: Because you love Harry Potter or always watch fantasy films or because you like to see Special Effects on the Big Screen. Preferably read the book, so you can follow the story (bits in film not explained by end, but are in the book), and then don't compare the film to the book! If you want a rewarding Harry Potter film, then see 'Prisoner of Azkaban'."

","this movie was way better than all of the other ones. and for those of you loyal enough to know that the third movie was the next thing up from rubbish will be happy to know that this one knows how to be loyal to the book and still be different. it's just right, I knew Mike Newell would do it!! there wasn't anything that I could say ""they should have done this"" to. I love the content of the film, the acting in the film and the directing of the film. I would go back and see it a thousand times. people were cheering with joy after the movie was finished. this movie touched every emotion, as it should have. I left the movie theater and started screaming because it left me feeling so satisfied. there are parts that are a bit scary, but overall I give this movie the highest rating and my props to Mike Newell."
"d1494","10","2","4","18 November 2005"," The Goblet of Fire burns brightly as the best of the series to date
","This long awaited entry in the Harry Potter saga is the first really fully realized film which stands on its own merits of terrific story telling,the fine acting of an ensemble of some of the best veteran actors on screen today and the continuing transformation of Harry, Ron and Hermione into young adults is charmingly portrayed and never cloying. The CGI effects serve the film beautifully but never take over. The direction and pace of this film is perfectly done.To my mind Mike Newell solves a problem that Peter Jackson never quite solved with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which were always headlong, breathless races against time. 'Goblet'never feels rushed and 150 minutes is the perfect length for this film. The climax is very satisfying because it is not a big bang; by allowing the three co-stars a human moment of recognition of their own changes to be the last word in the film rather than a pyrotechnical climax, Newelllets us see who these people are becoming and sets the stage perfectly for the next entry, The Half-blood Prince. This is a must see for fans and non-fans alike, I give it a 10!"
"vlarsen25","5","2","4","18 November 2005"," Great movie, but very untrue to the book
","I'm anxious to hear additional comments from viewers/fans who have read the book. (Did any of the professional movie critics out there read it??) Every major event in the book was drastically altered to become something completely different (or not included at all) in the movie. Yes, the acting was great, storyline was very entertaining, but it was not the book J.K. Rowling wrote 5 years ago. The past 3 movies have done a respectable job (though seem to stray from the original story with each progression). If the 5th movie deviates as much as or more than the Goblet of Fire did, I may have to stop watching! A distressing prospect, since I'm a huge fan. I was expecting true-to-book form, and left the theater very disappointed."
"christy-s","6","2","4","18 November 2005"," Too rushed, missed the relationship element
","I only give this movie a 6 out of 10 because it has to do with the Harry Potter series which I am dedicated to. I really felt that the movie missed the balance between the heartfelt comforting scenes contrasted with the darker elements. The film was quite dark and harried throughout, any fun and happy scenes were drained out of it. It felt very edited at times kind of like the most recent disappointing Star Wars trilogy. Like that trilogy it lacked in genuine character development that was evident in the first three HP movies as well as in the books. HPGOF was my favorite HP book but this movie is by far my least favorite of the films. With all of that said, there are some nice elements and decent acting in general. I quite enjoyed the dragon scene in the triwizard tournament, it was really scary and exciting, as was the end of the movie. I just wish they had taken more time to build emotion rather than just going from one point to another. Even with Cedrick's death I wasn't really that moved, where as in the book it was quite startling. The film really needed to be made into two movies and SLOWEEEEDDD DOWWWNNN to do justice to the book. The other complaint I will say is the new Dumbledore really doesn't capture the character the way the original actor from Movie 1 and 2 did. The new Dumbledore is very aggressive and almost violent at times. From reading the books, I always thought Dumbledore had quite a bit more self control - he was wise and balanced not so hectic. All in all, the movie was entertaining despite my criticisms, certainly better than most of the crap that is released to theaters these days. Here's hoping the next film is better."
"mudogxxx","8","2","4","18 November 2005"," My Review
","OK. Well, I could bore everyone will the usual ""Oh, the setting was magnificent... blah blah blah"" HOWEVER! ( Did you notice that Snape particularly likes this little saying?) First and foremost I must comment on the characterization of Dumbeldore.<br/><br/>First of all, and I suppose this could be classified as a teeny little spoiler, was it ever implied that it would be in Dumbledore's nature to grab Harry around the neck and basically throttle him in a fit of anger? No way, never. I could go on for pages and pages concerning Dumbledore's good natured character, but I'm sure all of you who have read the books will know that. I was severely disappointed with that aspect of the film, which should have been handled more appropriately considering Dumbledore is a rather important character.<br/><br/>One other thing that I was disappointed about was the final task of the tournament. Where was the spider and other creepy crawlies? It seemed the only thing that the maze was capable of was swallowing the champions up! A little more action would have been nice.<br/><br/>As for casting, I feel that Rita Skeeta was excellently done, as the same with Voldemort. Viktor Krum was a little too good-looking for how he had been described in the book, but nevertheless effective.<br/><br/>Since it was rather unavoidable that the story be changed a little, I guess, despite rather noticeable differences, they handed it quite well. I do give credit on that account as well as many others, and overall it was a brilliant film.<br/><br/>The humour was well done as well. I wasn't expecting it to be so funny, but it was tastefully done. I particularly enjoyed Snape hitting the boys on the head... and Ron's muttered ""Piss off..."" (I apologise if that is considered an obscenity, although it is a quote.) That sent me into hysterics! Overall one of my favourites, but then again I say that about each of them..."
"Wolfpack Productions","8","2","4","15 November 2005"," A Fanastic continuation of the series
","I thought Sorcerer's Stone was a faithful adaptation of the first book. I thought Chamber of Secrets was better, even though it is probably my least favorite of the books. And I thought Prisoner of Azkaban was outstanding and the best movie so far. I was worried that with the constant changing of directors, the movies wouldn't feel connected, but my fears have been for nothing, since Alfonso CuarÃ³n brought the vision I had hoped the first two movies would have, and Mike Newell continues down that path with Goblet of Fire. While the first two movies had more of a clean and friendly look, the last two movies have turned darker and more mystical, which makes sense considering the story lines are getting darker and more serious. In Goblet of Fire everyone is hitting that age where girls (and boys) become more important and feelings stir inside that you don't understand. One of the problems (in a good way) with having read the books numerous times, is that I know when things aren't there, and when things are changed. The first difference comes almost immediately when a character is shown in the first sequence, who is only mentioned in the book. I do however understand why he was shown, since there isn't a narrative to keep him in the minds of the readers. He needs to be shown so that you can recall him later on when he pops up again. I'll admit at first I was worried that this was a precursor to how the rest of the movie would be, but for the most part, the script was faithful to the book. Screenwriter Steve Kloves (who has written the first four films, but is taking a break from the fifth movie before coming back for the sixth) knows the story so well that he can easily shift from Dobby saying something to Neville saying something, and have it not only make sense, but still be acceptable to us die hard fans. The major points of the book were in place, save for the Quidditch World Cup, which was compressed into a few minutes. We see the aftermath of the World Cup, we see all three Tri-Wizard tournament challenges and we see the Yule Ball. If you ask any of the Harry Potter faithful, I think we'd all say that those are the biggest set pieces. At the same time, the story line of Mad-Eye Moody is well done, as well as the continuing romance-to-be of Ron and Hermione. So from a book-to-movie point of view, I thought the script was well written and still faithful to the book.<br/><br/>There is no question Goblet of Fire is a darker and more intense movie than any of the past three. Prisoner of Azkaban took the series darker, both story-wise and visually. Goblet of Fire continues that trend and takes it a step further, with some of the fiercest moments in the films so far. The first of the Tri-Wizard challenges involved Harry having to get a golden egg out from the protection of a dragon. The fight was loud and violent and was amazingly done. It was almost poetic the way it was filmed. That was followed by the underwater sequence which was again, beautifully filmed and very forceful in the way it was shown. (Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the movie ends). Then there was the final challenge, the maze, and the scenes in the graveyard where one of the major characters is killed off. Even though I knew it was coming, it was still a shock. There was no build up to it, it just happened. That is quickly followed by the rebirth of Voldemort, which involves a bone from his dead father, the hand of a servant (Wormtail) and the blood of his enemy (Harry). The sequence is disturbing and likely the reason the film got a PG-13 rating. The entire movie is much more aggressive in nature than the previous three films. Make no mistake, this movie is an adventure film from the start.<br/><br/>One of the other things I liked about this movie more than the past three, was the use of the 'secondary' characters. The movie boasts such a strong lineup of actors that it's a shame when they don't have much to do. But in this movie, there was a lot for them. Dumbledore was arguably in the movie more than anyone besides Harry. His character has gone from a calm background presence, to a strong and forceful protector (which again, will be shown more in the future). Snape was used much more this time out and I love that because I think Alan Rickman as Severus Snape is the best casting of an actor for a role I've ever seen. And talk about the rest of the cast. Beyond the returning Rickman, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, you have the added star power of Brendan Gleeson (as Mad-Eye Moody), Miranda Richardson (as reporter Rita Skeeter) and of course Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort. Fiennes is an inspired choice for the darkest creature this side of Darth Vader. He is almost unrecognizable behind the makeup, yet his essence still pours through and his take on Voldemort is a mixture of slight whimsy and immense power and hate. All of the adult characters are tremendous actors and that helps bring the level of the film up. That is not to say the younger actors aren't good. In fact, they've each improved as the series has gone on. The one thing I've noticed is they now have the ability to hit comedic marks and not make the lines sound forced. Yes, they do look a bit old to be playing 14 year olds, but since we've grown with them over the past few years, I can't imagine anyone else playing the roles."
"potionsmaster89","8","2","4","16 November 2005"," The first Potter-film to reach the quality of the book!
","When I went into the cinema to watch ""Goblet"" I was a bit scared. Everything they wrote in the German newspapers was not at all positive. And I couldn't really imagine Mike Newell directing a Potter-movie. But from the first seconds of the film to the last letter of the credits it was just unbelievably breath-taking. Newell created a completely new Harry Potter. The first two movies were very typical fantasy-adventures. The third one was just dark and sad. But ""Goblet"" is a perfect mixture of humour, teenage-conflicts, but also action and thrilling scenes. I was also delighted to see that the acting-skills of the trio improved dramatically. They took the step from child to adult. Same did the entire movie. ""Goblet"" is no fairy tale any more and deserves the rating PG13. The last thing that remains is the soundtrack. I was shocked at first when I heard, that John Williams wouldn't write this one. But once again I was positively surprised. The important themes of the previous 3 films remained, but there are many new elements. And they are just.... good! The only negative fact to mention is that some scenes are rather short. That's why I rate this film with 9.5 out of 10 points. I am delighted to say that a Potter-film finally reached the level of the books!"
"asocialis","9","0","0","17 May 2020"," mature and developing, but not good intro and feeling
","I am ama amazed that this sequel could be put into existence in the first place, because compared to book here we had to finally see real Voldemort, the scariest creature in this whole series. And unfortunately that part looked somehow too quick and not convincing and real enough. Not serious enough like in the book, and too quick happening. Also this sequel lacks good intro which previous sequels had better. Instead too mature, like it requires some previous experience to get adapter to this sequel, experience we could not get in previous sequel. Too random events, too complicated and less explained stuff. Worse than previous 3 sequels because it is not simple enough."
"Lumenka","4","0","0","12 May 2020"," Mike Newell wasn't a good choice.
","This movie suffers because of some questionable choices. Thankfully, some of Newell's crazy ideas didn't make it into the film. His idea was to burn down the Forbidden Forrest during the First Task. Even though this stupid idea didn't make it into the film, the final version of the First Task was a disaster. They stated that Dragon Tamers were there to ensure safety of the Champions, yet they still thought it would be a great idea to let the dragon leave the arena to create an ""edge-of-our-seats"" experience. I couldn't help but cringe. And over the period of filming, Newell was complaining how he had to read the thickest book in the entire series, how it was hard to get through and so on. If you want to make a good adaptation, don't let people who don't have a deep connection with the series direct the movie! It's absolutely ridiculous.
Next, I had problems with how they portrayed Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. In the films, it looks like Beauxbatons is school only for witches, while Durmstrang is a boy school. This doesn't make any sense and I had a lot of questions which brought me out of the movie. ""Does this mean that French wizards have to go study to another country? Or is there another wizarding school in France specifically for wizards?""
The Second Task was easily the best, but there were still some problems. I loved how they filmed this underwater. The entire Task was great, but after they had gone to the surface, I couldn't help but ask: ""So, the audience was just sitting there for the entire hour?"" Same goes for the Third Task. But this isn't only the filmmakers' fault, JK Rowling forgot about that part too.
The books are liked by so many because they are magical mysteries. So, naturally, I didn't like the fact that they took this element out of the story. In the books, there were subtle clues that someone was impersonating Moody, while in the film, we knew this information by the halfway point.
Now onto the Third Task. I was hoping to see the obstacles. Sphinx, Blast-Ended Screwts and many others. However, I was let down more than I thought possible. The only obstacle were hedges. Yes, that's right, hedges. That's not scary nor challenging! The Third Task was supposed to test the Champions in various ways to make sure the best one won. But here, it seemed very random and luck-based whether you found the Cup or not.
Other than that, I had other complaints but this review is way too long for that. But I couldn't leave without mentioning the infamous line: ""Harry! Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?"" Dumbledore asked CALMLY."

","The Harry Potter movie where they all had long hair and everyone had awkward love scenes.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.<br/><br/>Given the source material and worldbuilding, this movie could have been much better. We are introduced to many new things in this movie like the quidditch world cup, a cool tournament, and Voldemort. Yet this film focuses too much on flash instead of substance.<br/><br/>There are some undeniably cool scenes, but they make no sense once revisited upon second thought. How are the death eaters able to attack a WORLD tournament so easily, especially when EVERYONE is armed with a potentially lethal weapon? How come we haven't been introduced to other schools before and how come we never hear from them again? Also, why TF should anyone care about Cedric? He has never been introduced to the series before.<br/><br/>I appreciate that this film is the first of the series to receive a PG-13 rating and has darker themes than previous movies. Yet, the love stops there. It felt more like a self-service for fanboys/girls and nothing more. This film by itself cannot be a good standalone movie.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the awkward ""love"" scenes that this film tries to incorporate in it.

"jamesnicholls-58600","10","0","0","18 April 2020"," Best Harry Potter Film
","This film is in my top 5 movies of all time and the rating is EASILY a 10/10 in my opinion. This movie is consistently great throughout, never has a dull scene. I would say it has about the same amount of twists as Prisoner of Azkaban, it is just as surprising as the 3rd movie. But what makes the Goblet of Fire truly special was that it had roughly the same level of action in it as Deathly Hallows Part II and it was more surprising than Deathly Hallows Part II and on par with Prisoner of Azkaban in that category. So already Goblet of Fire is the better movie on the first watch but watching a genuinely great movie is almost always nearly as good as watching it for the first time for me.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows Part II is the most dramatic Harry Potter movie, it is the most emotional. But Goblet of Fire is equal to Deathly Hallows Part II in this category too. Goblet of Fire has plenty of emotional scenes like the graveyard scene, the attack at the quidditch world cup, Ron falling out with Harry, the Yule Ball and Harry and Ron trying to find dates. The thing that made Goblet of Fire so unique was the amount of teenage angst there was in the movie. Ron and Harry were so awkward with girls and trying to get a date and I loved this aspect of the movie, I could relate a lot to Harry and Ron struggling to find girls as teenage boys. We just don't quite get to see this in any of the other HP movies so in this regard it's an improvement. I suppose you could say Goblet of Fire had the best romance by far in a HP movie.<br/><br/>The graveyard duel was particularly emotional and it was pleasing to see Harry's Dad finally have the chance to more properly take on Voldemort as he didn't have the chance before as he didn't have his wand with him. Overall I recommend this film to everyone, the music was very good and whilst some people may criticise Michael Gambon's acting in this movie, I thought Dumbledore's shouting at Harry after his name was found in the goblet a very sensible thing a smart man like Dumbledore would do in order to find out the truth from a teenage boy.<br/><br/>Plot Complexity is a 20/20. Quality of Characters is Easily a 10/10. Emotion (Not including laughs) is easily a 10/10. Consistent quality of scenes is easily a 10/10. Scare Factor is 4/10. Laugh Factor is 6.5/10 - Ron's dress robes were hilarious. Sex Factor is 3/10."

"hooma814","7","0","0","29 February 2020"," Great action and humour! But not much overall story development.
","This movie was all about Harry, Ron and Hermione. They got all the screen time. Which was good and funny at times, with Ron and Hermione having some awkward interactions. However this was at the expense of telling the overall story of good vs evil. Both in the book and in the movie the dark magic just comes in too late for me. This needs to be present in a much clearer way. Harry has the odd moment of his scar burning and his reocurring dream.<br/><br/>But the movie seems to waste a lot of time being interested in the dynamics of the main trio. Snape gets hardly any time, Moody gets one scene teaching, Dumbledore is here and there. The champions of the tornament have literally one line each. Karkaroff has no part in it. It really is just Harry, Ron and Hermione, which is enjoyable, but limits the movie from being great!<br/><br/>A shame to see Dobby and Hermione's scene with her wanting to help house elf's cut, alongside Harry falling on the trick step and nearly getting caught by Snape, until Moody comes along. The movie did Harry's scene with the dragon way better though, its pretty much a non-event in the book. Although they rush many parts of Harry's training and development, alongside his being coached by Sirius and just assume that Harry now knows how to do these new charms and spells from reading it with Hermione. But, the movie is already 2 1/2 hours long so something has to give right? (I'd say less of the trio and more development of the overall arc of good vs evil).<br/><br/>Ron was great at the Yule Ball, the costume design was hilarious!<br/><br/>Overall, its enjoyable, but not great."

Our trio start by visiting the Quidditch World Cup which is invaded by the evil ""Death Eaters"" who reduce everything to ashes in their search for ""Harry"". Shortly afterwards, the ""Tri-Wizard Cup"" comes to Hogwarts - a good excuse to introduce some new characters amongst them Frances de la Tour as the enormous ""Madame Maxime"" and Roger Lloyd-Pack as ""Barty Crouch"" as each school chooses their champion to take part in the potentially lethal games. ""Hogwarts"" chooses ""Cedric Diggory"" (Robert Pattinson) but the goblet also chooses our ""Harry"" and so four go into the competition. As this description, so far, probably indicates - there is an hell of a lot going on here and not surprisingly the adaptation to the screenplay starts to leave out detail and characterisation. To do the story justice, it ought to have been two films - we spend way too long establishing and when we get to the climax, it all seems a bit too rushed. Mike Newell simply has to squeeze too many, important, interweaving themes into 2Â½ hours and it doesn't quite work. It is still a great fantasy adventure building well on the now well-established characters and putting more meat on the bones of the ""Harry Potter"" character."

"renegadeviking-271-528568","8","0","0","31 December 2019"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
","When the first Harry Potter film came out, I was still in high school. The day I saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire at the cinema was towards the end of my first term at university, a few months full of new experiences and learning to be independent. My friends and I took a drive down to the nearest multiplex to see The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe - and when that film was over, we spontaneously decided to stick around and see Goblet of Fire in the afternoon. At the end of the day, I considered The Chronicles of Narnia to be the better film, as Goblet of Fire - once again under a new director, Mike Newell - had felt quite clumsily adapted. Watching it again now, the flaws I recognised on the first viewing are still evident, but I do appreciate the whole thing a little more.<br/><br/>Given how much bigger Goblet of Fire is than the previous book, adapting it into a 2 hour 37 minute film was always going to be a challenge, and a lot of material has to be cut. There's no Dursleys, no Winky, no S.P.E.W., no Bertha Jorkins and no Ludo Bagman. These are all non-essentials to this story so their absence is understandable, but other cuts are more disappointing. The film needs to go to the Quidditch World Cup to set up both Portkeys and Viktor Krum, but it feels jarring to cut straight from the beginning of the World Cup final to its aftermath, without so much as a montage of highlights. Sirius Black only gets one scene: much of the exposition he provides in the book is moved elsewhere, but this way we get little reinforcement of his relationship with Harry. There's no mention of Hagrid being half-giant, and while we see him building a relationship with Madame Maxime, there's no resolution to that.<br/><br/>In my re-read of the book, I mentioned how much I liked the mystery element; the film retains this, and actually does a good job of condensing it and keeping it coherent. It's easier for the audience to make connections: there are repeated references to Crouch Jr and his appearance in Harry's dreams, as well as hints that somebody in Hogwarts is illicitly brewing Polyjuice Potion. Professor Moody is seen drinking from his hip flask enough times for it to be suspicious; when the real Moody yells from inside his trunk, the impostor tells Harry ""I won't tell you what's in there; you wouldn't believe me if I did,""; and in the absence of Dobby, he successfully directs Neville to help Harry with the second task - his original, failed intention in the book. However, the brief scene where Karkaroff is seen with the Goblet - presumably inserted as a red herring - is confusing, as no actual explanation for his behaviour is given and there's little focus on the idea that Karkaroff might have put Harry's name into the Goblet.<br/><br/>Some of the other changes and reductions work: new scenes are created for stray elements (e.g. Ron receiving his dress robes) and the 'Potter Stinks' badges convey the student body's attitude towards Harry being champion effectively without too much emphasis on it. Many parts, however, feel clumsy and potentially bewildering. The Death Eater attack at the World Cup is apparently organised by Voldemort and Crouch Jr as a deliberate threatening gesture: this is better in some ways than the Death Eaters just having a drunken gambol, but then wouldn't the Ministry make a bigger deal out of the attack, and wouldn't Lucius Malfoy and co be less surprised when Voldemort returns? Turning the first task into a drawn-out chase scene between Harry and the Horntail makes sense from a film-making perspective, but not within the film itself: upon its unplanned escape, the dragon could easily kill not only Harry, but all the students watching, and none of the adults present do anything to intervene. There is some awkward editing: the foreign students suddenly arriving at Hogwarts before any explanation is given, Harry and co randomly wandering through the forest with Hagrid in order to stumble upon Mr Crouch's dead body (Mr Crouch being held prisoner by Voldemort and subsequently escaping to try and warn Dumbledore is another book subplot that gets left out), and Harry then going to Dumbledore's office for no apparent reason other than to see the Pensieve. There is no explanation of how and when Crouch Jr escaped from Azkaban, and as he is not seen getting a Dementor's Kiss, non-book readers might be left wondering why he doesn't show up among the Death Eaters in later films.<br/><br/>There are some nice moments of character exploration, which are often original creations for the film. On the Hogwarts Express, for example, Ron doesn't have enough money to pay for all the sweets he wants, and quietly refuses Harry's offer to cover the cost: this helps to foreshadow Ron's resentment of Harry later on. The conflict between Harry and Ron is handled pretty well, with an additional element of Ron learning about the dragons in advance and warning Harry indirectly: this both gives Harry another reason to get annoyed at Ron for not giving him a direct warning, and shows that Ron did still want to be friends before they officially make up. There's also a scene between the teachers after Harry's name comes out of the Goblet, which gives a proper idea of their mindset in letting events unfold. As in Prisoner of Azkaban, the students behave like real teenagers - such as egging on Fred and George when they start fighting - and casual, real-sounding chatter among the background characters creates a more immersive atmosphere.<br/><br/>The more grim and adult style is also quite similar to Prisoner of Azkaban - the opening on a graveyard with skull and Grim Reaper imagery warns us not to expect an overload of whimsy. However, like the book, the film does a good job of blending its darker scenes with more comedic ones like the Yule Ball. The underwater visual effects for the second task are very good, and the maze in the third task is very eerie, though the idea of it influencing the champions' minds (rather than containing monsters and magical obstacles) isn't really used to full effect. The Death Eaters' robes, with their Ku Klux Klan-inspired pointed headpieces, look more silly than scary, and I'm glad that they're redesigned in the later films.<br/><br/>Finally appearing in his full-bodied form, our villain Lord Voldemort is portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, who I don't think gets enough credit for this role. He gets the dangerous and arrogant attitude right, particularly as he toys with Harry during the duel, though tutting over Cedric's body is one of a few unexpected peculiarities we see from him in the films. His appearance is great too: when I watch him, I'm definitely seeing him as Voldemort and not as an actor. Brendan Gleeson is also very good as Mad-Eye Moody, both as the straightforward, slightly threatening Auror, and when revealing the true mannerisms of Barty Crouch Jr: I liked how the mask occasionally broke when Moody looked at Harry or Crouch Sr. (I didn't agree with the whirring noises of his magic eye, though.)<br/><br/>As a Doctor Who fan, it's a pleasure to see David Tennant playing Crouch Jr in his true form: while he doesn't get much screen-time, what we do see of the tongue-flicking fanatic is pretty memorable. Robert Pattinson, back in the quieter days before he was swarmed by rabid teenage girls begging him to bite them everywhere he went, gets the noble and decent attitude of Cedric Diggory right, and definitely makes the audience care about him enough to lament his death. Speaking of which, the scene where Harry returns to Hogwarts with Cedric's body is brilliantly handled in terms of acting and staging, and is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the whole film series. The applause and triumphant fanfare as Harry reappears stands in horrible contrast with what's just happened; we see the audience slowly realising one by one what they're actually looking at; and then we get Amos Diggory howling over his son's body with real, agonising grief and pain. It's not easy to watch.<br/><br/>One performance I definitely didn't like, however, was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. (To be fair, the problems lie with the director and screenwriter, not just the actor.) In Prisoner of Azkaban, Gambon was fine with the limited material he had. But in this one, he turns Dumbledore into a far less pleasant character than in the books: yelling ""SILENCE!"" to his students, sending Hermione out of the champions' tent with little courtesy, being snappish with McGonagall, and becoming almost aggressive as he questions Harry about his name ending up in the Goblet. This is not the Dumbledore I know and love, and it's only with his conversation with Harry at the end that he seems more like his typical self. Meanwhile, not much can be said about the actors playing Fleur, Krum, Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as they get relatively little to work with.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire crams so much content into its length that it's certainly not boring, and it manages to retain most of the original story's essential components, but there's still a disjointed flow to the whole thing. While it's rough around the edges, it gets the job done."

","Harry Potter is the fourth movie of the Harry Potter franchise and this time Harry Potter must survive three dangerous tasks after his name gets put in the Triward Tournament. For what its worth this movie isn't actually that bad when I watched it, but there are some improvements that it could've made. Harry Potter and his friends are now teenagers then they were in the previous three films so now that they're older that means the danger and destruction has increased as we see Voldemort making his comeback and sending a message. However, I couldn't help but notice that they focused on that a lot as if I was watching some 80s or 90s high school movie. And we do get that, but it takes a really long time to get there. I feel like the writers for were split into two teams. One team creating the action and tension building and the other for creating humor, however the humor falls flat to the point where it falls flat. I know that this is supposed to be a kids movie and that you have to add some humor to the franchise so it's not one hundred percent dark and gritty, but come on at least don't try so hard. I felt that they didn't focus enough on the Triwizrd Tournament as it did deliver the danger, but they could've at least cranked it up just a little bit. I remember the book describing the Triwizard Tournament and adding details here and there that we didn't see in the movie. Overall, I will say that it is entertaining to watch and I don't hate or think it's the best one in the franchise, but it could've been better."

","The phenomenal success of J. K. Rowling's series of novels for children about a boy in a school of wizardry has been augmented by the enormous box office grosses of the film adaptations. Left with the daunting task of maintaining the standards and quality of the previous instalments, Director Mike Newell has fashioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a marvellous, visual treat that matches the series' previous highs.<br/><br/>A new year at Hogwarts brings old faces and some new ones as the school for witchcraft and wizardry is primed for great change and a growing threat. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shaken by a recurring nightmare as the presence of Lord Voldemort looms ominously, and he summons Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) for advice. Soon a mysterious man, ""Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), arrives to help Harry against the dark forces. The school is preparing for a special gathering of two other schools to compete in a special Tri-Wizard Tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition in which only one older student from each respective school may enter via the Goblet of Fire. Harry becomes involved in the competition to the surprise of everyone including himself. As he and the other students find, the games are immensely formidable with dragons, underwater traps, and an endless maze of hedges. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are experiencing the joys and pain of adolescence as the wonders of high school crushes and the anxiety of the school dance wreak havoc. Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) catches the romantic bug. Mistrust and accusations complicate matters for Harry, and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) expresses his concerns about the future. Before long, Harry, Ron and Hermione bicker amongst themselves as their friendship is severely tested. When the tournament concludes, another set of tragic circumstances opens the way for new evil and betrayal. As the elder wizards (Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman) close ranks to protect the students especially Harry, the future remains uncertain at best.<br/><br/>Ironically, Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is the first British director of the series, and, while he had the difficult challenge of continuing the series, he has added some nice wrinkles and touches by delving deeper into the emotional conflicts of these students. In fact, the maturation and changes these teens must encounter richly add to the already exciting story. We root for these heroes and feel their discomfort and pain because we have in a sense grown up with them. As with any Harry Potter storyline, not all the characters are good and, conversely, not all the suspicious ones are bad. Several plot lines are carried over from the previous films and new ones are primed for future sequels. Screenwriter Steven Kloves, the keeper of the flame, has done a herculean job of distilling the essence of Rowling's novels into each film thus far.<br/><br/>As always, the trio of young actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, own these roles, and the thought of replacing any of them due to age concerns was unnecessary. All three look great as they are now a little older and wiser. Of course, Gambon, Smith, Rickman, and Coltrane are the old pros who are the constants at Hogwarts. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly suited for his villainous turn in the startling climax. Brendan Gleeson does a fantastic job as the menacing, yet benevolent 'Mad Eye' Moody who supposedly watches over Harry during the tournament. It also seems that this Harry Potter film is becoming quite an international event as the cast of students is even more ethnically diverse than ever before.<br/><br/>As usual, the production values are outstanding with lavish sets and costumes imaginatively photographed by Roger Pratt. The special effects are quite impressive although nothing that you haven't already seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the Star Wars. Just the generous details and little touches throughout the film like the animated paintings add to the overall care that still goes into these films. Make no mistake, this is a lengthy film, but the pacing is good as a large number of scenes are strung back to back to contain as much of the book as possible into roughly two and a half hours. It feels a bit episodic but never loses sight of the main story and the emotional state of the characters.<br/><br/>There are creepy images and a foreboding atmosphere through much of the film. This adaptation does contain more risquÃ© scenes such as Harry's bathtub scene or the terrifying menace of Voldemort, in which the tone gets downright mean-spirited. The students are not so innocent anymore as they curse, and in one climactic scene come face to face with the pain of loss. A PG13 rating signals that the Potter adventures are growing up fast.<br/><br/>It does require that the audience have a background in the series of books or films to fully appreciate the significance of critical events, although the film can stand on its own as pure entertainment and a coming of age. In some ways Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a classic bridge episode similar to The Empire Strikes Back. Not only is it a strong entry in the series with the most open ended finale in the series, It proves a great setup for the exciting things to come later."

This is Mike Newell's only outing as an HP director and the editors for the movies change quite a bit, so that is hard to say but I would have to argue for some of both. Anyone not very familiar with the books will probably get lost at various points of this movie simply because so much has been cut. I would say a minimum of two reads of the book are required to keep pace with the movie gaps. A few points that maybe adding 20 min on the movie and fleshing out a few areas would have helped with (this was a big book with a lot happening): some brief explanation of the Quidditch World Cup before dropping us in it and maybe at least a few flying passes of the game, fix the messed up arrivals of the two visiting schools (very chopped up), include the weighing of the wands with the important information about Fleur's heritage, there's also the plot change in how Harry gets gillyweed which I've never really understood why they changed it from the book, next there is the sudden arrival at the start of the third task with no introduction to the maze before to offer any transition. Then there are whole facets like SPEW that are cut that I guess I understand don't add anything to the main story, but purists find it hard to see them gone. One small thing that was added that I love as an all time favorite bit of acting from all the HP movies was the small scene with an annoyed Snape in the study hall when the trio are discussing dates to the ball. Genius acting by Alan Rickman. Overall conclusion is I really wish I could see an extended cut."

While there is plenty of action and humor, the substance, the character development is missing oftentimes. I couldn't really get into any of the characters from the other invited schools. These new characters are so stereotypical and bland as to be poor dressing for the movie and their exploits are practically ignored. Even Harry doesn't seem to be all there either - with so much that he has been through, he doesn't seem to have grown up or matured all that much as would be expected. Hermoine's character doesn't seem to have a lot to do, except date and show that she's growing up. Even at the end, when something terrible happens to an important character, it's difficult to really have much sympathy. This convoluted and sometimes confusing new edition is difficult to follow at times and not all the dots seem to connect up. Overall, the movie was interesting, the effects nice, yet the fun intensity seems missing. And literally most of the magic seems to have been left out, Harry seems to operate as if he has forgotten much of what he has learned from previous books. This dazzling, gorgeously gigantic display sputters some when the dense content of the movie is presented to a much more highly anticipating audience. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","Tournament time for Harry, Ron and Hermione, as their beloved Hogwart's Academy plays host to a high-stakes wizarding competition and an influx of students from two international schools. It also represents childhood's end, in a way, as mortal stakes are raised and the trio begin to take an interest in members of the opposite sex.<br/><br/>The series has grown considerably darker this time around, and in more than just a thematic sense. All around the school, formerly bustling with life, the colors feel drained and lights extinguished. It's a chilly, drab-looking film, apart from a few splashy moments during the action scenes, lacking the bits of good-natured whimsy that had typified the franchise to this point. Many, many threads from the novel are completely omitted, which makes sense as it's a seven-hundred page tome and would not have easily fit into a feature-length window, but those remaining points lack a sense of cohesion. Rather than speckled segments of a greater whole, they play like mix-and-match dashes of half-told sidetracks; a shifting, unfocused narrative that nearly serves as a jumbo-sized montage.<br/><br/>The broader saga takes some important steps this time around, with Voldemort finally making an in-the-flesh appearance and Harry working his way through some particularly sticky situations. We add a few important supporting players, too, although that seems to come at the expense of the core trio. Ron and Hermione are relegated to second (or third) fiddles, and the film sorely misses that sense of camaraderie as their mutual society approaches an existential crisis.<br/><br/>A tricky episode to rate, one which could have been excellent with a bit more focus and room to breathe, but also may have been nearly unwatchable at the proper length. We're finally moving somewhere consequential, at any rate."

","I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured many thrills, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy, but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and didn't play a great role in the film. This movie also managed to balance the gritty, darker tone and the comedic aspect incredibly well and left me completely enthralled throughout the duration. The acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. The younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. The reason i find this film so good compared to others in the series is once again the plot. It manages to capture the magic so well, as well as making it different from others. The action is done incredibly well and the final scenes are a masterpiece. I was on the edge of my seat throughout and believe the cinematography will hold up for many years to come."

","The fourth book in the HARRY POTTER series is by far the best, offering up a ton of adventure, excitement, danger, death, and heartfelt emotion and easily surpassing the previous three entries because of its darker, more epic feel. Sadly, GOBLET OF FIRE the movie is a real disappointment, a film that goes through the motions without offering any real heart to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is proficient; the camera angles are off beat and more in line with an art-house movie, the direction is strong and steady, and the special effects surpass themselves on frequent occasions. But Rowling's complex-yet-simple plot line is changed beyond recognition, with key incidents missed out, passed over, or changed completely. I did understand some of the changes made by the film-makers but when it got to the third and final task, I couldn't believe my eyes.<br/><br/>Gone is the danger and magical creatures offered by Rowling; instead there are some moving hedges and blowing leaves. HUH??? What a disappointment! Things get worse with a horribly miscast Ralph Fiennes camping it up as Voldemort; his make-up is certainly good, but his voice is just rubbish, far too suave and upper-class when it should be guttural and evil-sounding instead. The film's pacing is breakneck but restless with it; it seems like Newell is always in a hurry to move on to the next scene yet it drags sometimes too.<br/><br/>The central pair of Radcliffe and Grint are excellent in their roles and have really grown into them, whilst Watson overacts and is a real disappointment. One good addition is Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody, the actor has a ball and can do no wrong in this reviewer's opinion. All the other cast members are fine but they only get skimmed-over roles. All in all a quite big disappointment, recommended for those who haven't read the book beforehand."
"MissSimonetta","6","0","0","6 June 2014"," Rushed and ridiculous
","I am not a big fan of the HP film adaptations. My problem is not so much that they cut a lot of material from the books or that they change things, it's that they fall into two categories: either they're slow-moving and preoccupied with every little detail from the books to the point of tedium (the first two films) or they go through the story so fast that those who have not read the books have no clue what is what and what is going on. Goblet of Fire falls into the latter category. It rushes over so much of the book, explains big concepts at mach speed, and refuses to spend time on character moments to help us connect to the heroes better.<br/><br/>It's also totally over-the-top, almost impossible to take seriously. I know many who adore Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, but for me, he goes so overboard that he comes across as goofy. In the books, Voldemort is mostly soft-spoken, quietly menacing. Here, he has all the subtlety of a mustachioed villain out of second-rate Victorian melodrama. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore has silly moments too, like when he near throttles Harry, screaming, ""Didjya put your name in the Goblet of Fire!!?"" So out of character... Then the chase with the dragon was ridiculous, obviously there to show off the CG effects, which have not dated that well. And don't get me started on the scene where the Durmstrang students start doing acrobatics in the Great Hall. The fellow doing the effects on that gem of a scene must have had a field day with the blur tool, which just makes it cheesier.<br/><br/>At least Daniel Radcliffe's acting improved in this film; even his weakest moments are not as laughable as the ""HE WAS THEIR FRIEND"" bit in The Prisoner of Azkaban. The music was melancholy and dark, as it should be. GoF is the turning point of the series, where the HP stories become less child-friendly and more of a Young Adult series dealing with social oppression, death, and loss.<br/><br/>Overall, this is not a strong movie, even on its own terms. It's too rushed and silly to be comprehensible or taken seriously."
"thesar-2","2","0","0","3 March 2013"," The Harry Games
","Mercifully, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire fixed the error made in the previous feature: they remembered to include an exciting, action packed and door-opening finale. Sadly, they just had to sacrifice the first two-thirds to get to that good conclusion.<br/><br/>So frustrated, I am. I've listened to the fans, to my social circle and to my social media friends. And I've been warned that these movies are made for fans and you MUST HAVE READ THE BOOKS to follow the movies. Hogwash! This is a separate medium and should be treated as such. It should have the elements of the book, but understand there could – and is – a new audience out there.<br/><br/>I'm losing this battle and fast. Even more random scenes cloud this enormously rough entry in the series. In fact the movie is so far all over the place, with ideas, characters, scenes, names, legends, games, grudges it all seems like: YES, YOU NEED TO READ THE BOOK TO CONTINUE.<br/><br/>Well, since I won't read them, after I finished book one, I might be in more trouble as the series progresses. Sadly, I feel my ratings will decrease because I do not feel the writers/directors are going to do the right thing. No lost soul should enter a Christian Church for the first time and be greeted with ""So, why are you lost? Have you not read what Christ has done for you? Buffoon! Get out and come back when you read the Bible cover to cover. I don't have time for you.""<br/><br/>At any rate, with a surprisingly new opening – i.e. gone are the abusive adopted parents and the vicious warning Harry ignores of his pending death – that involves a kind of game, I guess, that will make someone – wait for it – victorious. Obviously, Harry will be involved, by his own doing or not, though the way the game's played out is less foretold. Including, the three-part game that apparently is spread aimlessly thorough the year. ??<br/><br/>That's the basic synopsis of a film that wanders from here to there, that holds one door open while reaching for the next, that fast forwards teen adolescent, love lost, gained, anger, betrayal, redemption, secrets, etc, etc, etc, and so on and so forth. I get the fact that these are excellent elements to make a good story, but you don't have to use half a dictionary to make one sentence. Pick a direction, a path and have the conviction to stick to it. <br/><br/>Here are some additional thoughts I had while trying to wade through this mess: <br/><br/><ul><li>I'm actually finding myself caring less and less for these side characters. YES, its Harry's story and journey, but his annoying counterparts could meet their doom by series end and I wouldn't bat an eye.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ron's bipolar and it's getting increasingly tedious. He's acting hurt, upset, okay, angry, jealous, etc, etc and all the while he's sporting a 1970's Leif Garrett hairdo that's more distracting – and awful – than anything else.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The first three movies, aside from a few key elements, are essentially the same film and should've served as the first hour of ONE movie that these people stretched to four. This chapter, Goblet of Fire, could've filled out the final hour of Harry Potter Part One.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>ARG Robert Pattinson. In their defense, he wasn't the UnAlive Creature Bella will lust over in the Twilight series yet, but here's evidence he's been injected with Botox since, at least, age nineteen.</li></ul><br/><br/>Since roughly 75% of this film's fluff doesn't matter – or at least, they've given me, to date, no reason it should, I would suggest people watch #2 while skipping the first and third movies and just be told that things get darker in part four. And not more clearer, as the dark comment indicates.<br/><br/>(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)"

","I really miss director Chris Columbus. This version of the Harry Potter books was a tremendous disappointment. The house elves, important to the story, were left out of the movie altogether. The development of the other Triwizard Champions was severely limited. While I cried over the death of Cedric in the book, the movie version was hardly emotional at all, since Cedric was portrayed as a minor character, and not adequately explained. Same thing with Fleur and Viktor. They were both very minor in this adaptation. We did not get to know them or care about them, at all.<br/><br/>The story, although admittedly dark, did not have to be almost totally shot in the dark. It was hard to see, and rather annoying. Also, the fate of Neville's parents was parenthetical, and easy to miss. And where was Ludo Bagman, who was also an important part of this chapter?<br/><br/>Thumbs way down on this one.

It's just too bad that Newell's execution at dramatic points is not as good as Cuaron's. The acting is as good as ever with everyone in fine form especially Fiennes in a powerful part. Rowling's charming storytelling is still alive and well, but the characters have grown in this chapter. This causes more teenage hormones to come out, which plays against the dark, ominous fantasy.

The only way I can see how it can fit everything in the novel in one movie is to make it two parts like they did with ""Deathly Hallows"". And even than it probably wouldn't be enough probably. But maybe it should have been around 3 hours in order to fit as much of the stuff in the novel into the movie. Daniel Radcliffe didn't grow up so well, the younger version of Harry Potter was just simply more likable. Emma Watson on the other hand is growing up nicely and starting to get more likable. I still can't get used to Michael Gambon playing Albus Dumbledore. He just lacked the charisma and the certain aura the previous actor that passed away was able pull off the person you just have to respect presence. But most of all lacked the connection between the other characters. Not a fan of the books of this franchise, but I gotta admit this movie is missing a lot of creative and clever parts from the novel.

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire helps to further Hollywood stereotypes to promote Westernized images of heroes and villains. The competitors from the other schools are all portrayed as having the stereotypes of their ethnicities, while the Hogwarts competitors are varied, deeper characters, and generally are just more of what we would see as people than their shallow, continental counterparts.<br/><br/>The fact that the heroes are all well-developed, relatable characters shows that the movie is definitely a Western-made movie aimed at Western audiences. Although the characters and actors are British, the Hollywood production adds its own, distinctly-American overtones to the movie, making it clear who the audience is supposed to root for whether or not they've read the book.<br/><br/>That shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of the movie, however. American movies are made for American audiences, regardless of who's in them, and if there ever was an American crowd-pleaser, it'd be Top Gun.

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an American made film with no American actors or actresses. All of the actors and actresses in the film from the UK are what most American kids, teenagers and adults can relate to, culture-wise. There were a lot of foreign characters introduced in this film, and it is interesting to see how they were portrayed. First of all, because there are no American actors or actresses, the British actors were played more like Americans. For example, in this movie they dressed differently from the book (hardly ever any robes, Gryffindor attire) rather they dressed in hip modern day clothing. Also, rather than the occasional ""bloody hell"" here and there, the dialog is very western; much slower than a traditional British film. It was interesting to see that the foreign characters such as Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour were dressed and behaved very stereotypically. These stereotypes are part of the book, but the movie really exaggerated the difference between countries. Krum dressed very ruggedly while Fleur represented kind of an ideal feminine woman. Although both of these characters had some sort of love interest from students at Hogwarts, they were still foreign and they were still the enemy. Does this say anything about the way we perceive foreigners in America? Can we draw conclusions such as this, that in America we push our traditions and values upon others and if they do not accept they are the enemy? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of my favorite movies, a box office hit and a best-selling novel but there are still social and cultural issues to be addressed."

","This remains my least favorite translation of Harry Potter to the big screen. The book was basically hacked to pieces and re-written into a stock action-adventure movie. So much of the wonderful detail and substance of the book were abandoned. The original idea to make this into a two-part movie was spot-on. That would be the only way to tell the story effectively.<br/><br/>The focal point of this tale is Mad-Eye Moody. In the book, that character comes across as very frightening, both physically and mentally. He is a dangerous man who has lived through some horrific events. But in the movie, Brendan Gleeson comes across as comic relief. He seems wacky, but not threatening. And that eye patch is absurd. One of the most frightening aspects of Moody in the book is the spinning eye in his head. That becomes significant in later books. But it the movie the patch Gleeson wears looks like a comical toy. There's also never a real sense of him being a mentor to Harry. In the book, it's obvious that Harry is looking up to him as a father figure.<br/><br/>There are other little things that bothered me. Hermione's SPEW movement is completely written out, a movement that has important ramifications later in the series. Rita Skeeter should seem more sinister. She seems, like so many characters in this film, a caricature. What's with Barty Crouch Jr. and his wiggling tongue? The mer-people looked absurdly CGI, and didn't possess the sort of mournful quality they had in the book.<br/><br/>I liked the very beginning of the film and the confrontation with Voldemort at the end.

I'm aware that they have to cut details and stuff out of the books but this movie is basically All Action and No Story.<br/><br/>It starts out fine, I love how they did the whole Quidditch world cup but I am a little mad we didn't get to see the game. That would have been 10 minutes extra tops and it wouldn't have been to much to ask. Also the whole thing with Winky here can be cut as they did since it's not vital to the story but it still adds some. Think the wizards mistreat the elfs in the books? Look what the muggles did in the movies.<br/><br/>After the Choosing of the four Champions in the Triwizard Tournament things start to go downhill. We get thrown into event after event in the tournament and we get very little story in between the events. The Director clearly went for the action in this movie. It has some memorable scenes but to this day I still don't get why they cut Dobby out. Dobby is vital to the 7th book and film since he pretty much saves Harrys life and goes down doing it. This scene in the 7th book was the only time I found myself crying. The other Death scenes in that book went by way to fast and in the heat of the battle (i cried afterwards though). People watching the movies and not reading the books are probably OK with this but I am not and I never will be. Granted the 6th movie was the best one yet, except for the scene at the burrow and the end when the castle should have been in chaos with a massive battle taking place. They do an alright job altogether with this one but it's not good enough for me."

","Unlike its gorgeous predecessor ""Goblet of Fire"" is quite an ugly movie, with a very dull, plastic look to it. Surprising, considering it was shot by ""Twelve Monkeys"" and ""Brazil"" cinematographer Roger Pratt, who seemed to have been in his ""102 Dalmatians"" mode while shooting this. Mike Newell does an okay job directing the film I guess, he gets the tone right and the film is not boring at a gargantuan 157 minutes. The screenplay by Steve Kloves is again a rushed narrative jumping through as many of the big setpieces as possible. I suppose it must have been hard to adapt this lengthy book (which is my favorite or second favorite of the series), but Kloves didn't do a very good job of it as far as I'm concerned. It's basically setpiece-humorous coming of age aside-setpiece on repeat. The performances vary in quality but most of them are good-very good. With a prettier aesthetic I may have been able to forgive some of the flaws, but the film still entertains, staying at the level of the previous installment albeit with very different strengths and weaknesses. The overwhelmingly positive critical reviews at the time aren't hard to understand, it was the most human and emotional of the Potter films at the time and I recall the set-pieces dazzling on a theater screen, but it's just okay on second viewing at home, failing to capitalize on the huge jump in quality in both the source material and films from the second to the third installment and continue in that vein, instead leveling out."

","There have been some films that have done the books justice. Top of my head, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption were turned into great films. And while Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire isn't a complete waste of a movie, as an avid fan of the books, I have to say I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The film begins with Harry having a nightmare which I wont go into detail about here, as it is a key scene in the movie. Harry and Hermione are staying with the Weasleys, as they are going to watch the final of the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. It is at the final where the first significant part of the movie takes place, with those attending the match attacked by death eaters and Voldermorts symbol, 'The Dark Mark', appearing in the sky.<br/><br/>So, with the wizard world in a state of panic over the appearance of the symbol, Harry, Hermione and Ron return to Hogwarts for their third year. Upon their arrival they are met with the announcement that Hogwarts has been chosen to host the Triwizards Tournament, and that pupils form two other schools, Drumstang and Beuxbaton, will also be taking part.<br/><br/>The tournament involves three dangerous tasks, and despite not entering the competition, Harry is chosen as one of the competitors. All three tasks test Harry to the limit, not least the final task, which leads to a shocking conclusion.<br/><br/>A good film overall, but a lot was left out from the book which I felt would have made the film even better."

","Personally, I choose not to recommend this film for anyone who is a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter series. OK, Richard Harris is dead. Condolences. But Michael Gambon did a terrible job as Dumbledore in this film than in the third. Seriously, someone bring in a better cameo. The film was rather rushed. They didn't really follow the storyline completely and made this a disappointment to J.K. Rowling's adaptation. Why are they making Ron shaggy all of a sudden? The classic use of the school, the characters, the lighting, and such has been lost as compared to what was used in the first two films. I was surprised to see that Brendan Gleeson was chosen to play Mad-Eye Moody, but the bad thing about this character was that they had to use a holder for his eye instead of just using special effects and enlarging his actual eye. The Yule Ball was OK. The introductions to the other two schools were OK. The dragon-fighting sequence was the only best point in the film. They made it more extensive, which was good. One character that I thought they were going to bring back was Dobby the House-Elf, because he was re-introduced in the book. The maze sequence was bad, mainly because the players were only attacked with lively leaves than the monsters that they encounter in the book. Most of the plot was missing, the acting was terrible, some of the action sequences were bad, and I was disappointed to see that no special features were added to the DVD edition. I didn't like this movie (or the third, or the fifth, and I am sure that I'm not going to like the sixth or seventh). Not entirely a proper recommendation for all you fans out there, but I guess you'll enjoy whatever suits you. I really don't know.<br/><br/>2/10"

","Harry Potter seems that he cannot be defeated in anything. And this movie proves such an ideal. Potter/Radcliffe is entered into a tournament for wizards of a certain age. However, Radcliffe is not of that age, but is allowed to do it anyway.<br/><br/>You get to see Radcliffe having to battle through the ""Triwizard Tournament"". Its a decathlon-type of match spaced out over several days. And Potter, despite being at a disadvantage, is able to score special points here and there and able to go to the final round. That comes of no surprise. After all, its Radcliffe. He can always win.<br/><br/>Voldemort, the main antagonist of the film series, is for the first time seen with a full body to fight against Radcliffe. And while the battle is 1-on-1, Radcliffe doesn't seem a match for him. Thus you, as the viewer, are not surprised Radcliffe wins the tournament.<br/><br/>Its another OK film to watch in the Harry Potter series.

","After the very good ""Prizoner of Azkaban"" HP attempts to keep to it's title, but unfortunately they placed their priorities wrong. I watched this film before I read the book, I didn't like it then and I don't like it now that I've read the book. Unlike the story suggests from the dark third one, ""Goblet"" focuses more on flimsy teen relations, and less on the evil that is growing around the school. At the end of the film, the most evil villain in the series is reincarnated, except through the tangled web of teens fighting, teens crying, teens going out, teens being stupid, this ending is diminished, at this point you say to yourself, ""who's this Voldemort guy who's being reincarnated?"" Then you have to remind yourself: ""Oh yeah! he's the evil creepo who's attempting to murder the main character and take over the world!, yeah I remember him!""..... urgh. The movies plot is mostly taken over by two of the main characters squabbling over going out and such, and if it's not taken over by that, it's consumes by Harry's conflicting emotions over his school crush Cho Chang. OK, if you're a female teen who likes chick fliks you might like this, but if you're an actually fan of HP it's next to impossible to take this one seriously. Well, there you have it. Goblet of Fire, you either like it or you don't, there isn't much of a middle ground to this situation. Oh well, at least they get it right in the next installment....."

","In my honest opinion, if you're an only-HP-movie fan and see this movie before reading the book(s), you wouldn't understand it. It sums up everything from the book pretty shabbily, and you won't be able to understand what's happening where. I have read the books, and had no difficulty understanding the movie, but I was highly disappointed by this.<br/><br/>First of all, the director. Mike Newell disappointed me. It seemed as though everything was hurried and rushed on the sets. I'm glad they found Yates for the fifth one, and even happier that he'll be staying for the sixth and both the seventh films.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson showed the best performance, IMO. While others were also pretty good, I was most disappointed with Daniel Radcliffe, and now, after a whole year passed after the FIFTH movie, I've come to the conclusion that his acting skills have gone DOWN since the fourth movie. He was actually pretty good in the first three movies, but I have no idea whatsoever about what's happened so suddenly. And second to Daniel would be Michael Gambon. Gambon is actually pretty good, but he will never beat the level Richard Harris went to. Harris was the real Dumbledore, not Gambon. While Gambon does a good job, Harris definitely did a better one.<br/><br/>And lastly, the script. What on EARTH made Kloves make Dumbledore grab Harry and shake him? That isn't Dumbledore, it's some randomly inserted alien clone. Dumbledore would never do that. And besides that, what the HELL was with the Harry/Hermioneness? The whole book was practically filled with Ron/Hermione moments (only second to Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows), and the movie was simply Harry/Hermione. It seemed that the row between Ron and Hermione (which was supposed to be the main R/Hr bit) was simply put there because it was in the book. Being an avid Ron/Hermione supporter, I have my rights to say that the Harry/Hermioneness was completely uncalled for.<br/><br/>I shouldn't be rating this 4 on 10, but 3 on 10, but I added an extra point because it was part of my favorite book franchise."

There is a nice subplot involving Harry And Ron finding young love for the first time and there is the Danger of the Triwizard Tournment in Which Harry has been entered without his consent.

I am not a major harry potter fan and I do see the good points about the film such as the brilliant cg effects and good acting of some of the stars.

","Watching the new installment of the series, The Order of the Phoenix, reminded me, what a huge disappointment this movie was. Yes it was a very expensive movie. Yes, special effects were impressive. But no, it does not catch anything of the books atmosphere and no it is not very entertaining (well, apart from very impressive special effects).<br/><br/>One problem in my opinion is actually that Steve Kloves and Mike Newell are not very successful in shortening the book into a 2 1/2 hour movie. The movie just presents certain highlights of the book, bu leaves big holes in the storyline. But one of the greatest things about J. K. Rowlings book is that about everything in them is logically connected to everything else, and in this aspect the movie totally fails.<br/><br/>The second problem is that the director Mike Newell shows no talent for timing a movie right (at least not this one), and therefore no tension is created. Although the special effects are great, just about every action sequence just feels stretched and overlong and I feel, that I would have been happy to see more of the story and a little less computer animated monsters on screen (the old less is more problem).<br/><br/>The third problem is actually that the performance of the cast is actually very unbelievable (with the honorable exception of Ralph Fiennes). It is probably not their fault, they give memorable performances in the movies successor Order of the Phoenix, but it seems that Mike Newell was not very interested in directing actors but very interested in directing animated creatures.<br/><br/>Overall this was a huge disappointment for me, I give it five out of ten for the effects, without them it would be even less."
"stewienator","Null","0","0","10 July 2007"," Review 3: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
","One thing that I really enjoy about the Harry Potter series is the fact that even though the movies are set up in a fantasy like world, the characters develop a sense of growing up. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the characters develop teenage habits and start become attracted to other people. Much like real people in our world. So even though the series is fantasy like, the audience still gets characters that they can relate to. The characters developing into adulthood is not only thing that develops in this movie. As suggested by it's ""PG-13"" rating, the movie is more dark, frightening, scary, and violent. I mean, maybe Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire isn't the worst ""PG-13"", but some smaller viewers might not be able to handle or understand the developments in this new entry. The movie opens with Harry having a bad dream in which an old man is murdered by a figure that is completely unrecognizable (his body is blocked by a chair anyway). Harry, Ron, and Hermione then continue a new year at Hogwarts were the Tri Wizard Tournaments are being held. The Tri Wizard Tournaments is were champion students from every magical school compete for the Tri Wizard cup. Only if a student is seventeen and is chosen from the Goblet of Fire, can they compete in the tournament. Oddly Harry is chosen from it and is made fun of by all the schools (and his) for cheating the Goblet of Fire. Even though Harry doesn't want to, he now must compete with the contestants Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour, and Viktor Krum in dangerous events including dragons, a maze that closes from the end up, and weird fish like creatures (not so dangerous actually). However, as the Tri Wizard competition progresses, odd events happen that link in the end to Lord Voldemort's full return. For me, it wasn't the graphics or the plot or directing that made me so happy about this film. Like I said, the thing that made me most happy was that characters were so easy to relate to because they developed into what real teenagers would be like. Even look closely at the characters. Harry develops an attraction for a girl, Hermione develops into a beautiful young girl (attrating Viktor Krum), and Ron spawns a form of jealousy over Hermione. Maybe this may not be one of the most important key elements in the film, but I think it was pretty important. Overall: A- <br/><br/>-Ben Russell"

","I might be more enthusiastic about this movie if I had not seen the previous ones first. Indeed it might have come across as the best yet if viewed in isolation. However, the fact is that most people watching this movie have already seen its predecessors. The cinematic magic of Hogwarts has been extensively explored by three other movies, so another long sequence of Harry flying around the castle pursued by a dragon quickly palls. Also, as a previous reviewer noted, the movie skips over some areas so fast that you need to have read the book to know what is going on (the romance between Krum and Hermione, for example) while lingering over special effects that add little to the story.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the acting of the young protagonists has greatly improved over the movies series, and the darker scenery of Voldemort's abode was well realised."

They completely changed the scene with the dragon. Since when did Harry have a mad scrabble across the castle roof trying to escape the Horntail? They ruined the maze as well. Hedges that grow evil roots and smash together? Please. I wasn't too happy wit the portrayal of Mad-Eye Mody, either. He didn't make me think of the portrayal of Moody in the books. He wasn't battle scarred or missing half a nose. And a metal shoe for a foot replacement? Where is the famous clawed wooden foot I have come to recognize? Where are the skrewts?

Another example is the maze. Compared to the books, it was horribly boring. There is a sphinx, the world turns upside down and there are many other obstacles that get left out of the film. The Beauxbatons students were all wrong! There are boys who come with the girls to the school. Also, you almost never see them go to class and they showed only minutes of the Quidditch World Cup and did not show Winky (Barty's Crouch's house elf) with Harry's wand Another thing they left out was Hermione's founding of the Organization ""SPEW"".

Where are the sphinx, blast ended-skewerts (sp?)??? After viewing this movie once more I've discovered a few things that now I wish were included, just for the sake of continuity with the next book/movie in the series (the movie is fine without these sub-story lines/scenes): Rita Skeeter's other stories (e.g. her Harry Potter is crazy story) and the Rita Skeeter is an anamaigus story line, and the whole Snape and Sirius setting aside their differences (in the short term) and going off to do their respective jobs for Dumbledor, and Harry giving his winnings to the Twns so they could open a joke shop (as well as the blackmailing storyline that went along with that)."

","Here's the run-down: --SUMMARY-- Harry Potter is a 14 year old Wizard who goes to a school for Wizardry called Howgwarts. By now, he has been attending Hogwarts for 4 years. This year, the school will play host to the Triwizard tournament, and two other schools one from France and the other from Bulgaria, will be competing against the school's<br/><br/>contestants. You have to be in your seventh year at Hogwarts in order to compete. By filling out your name on a piece of paper, and dropping it into the Giblet of fire, your name may or may not be selected when the contestants are chosen. Only 1 from each school. Things seem all well and dandy until Harry Potter's name pops out of the Goblet... even though a Hogwarts student has already been selected. the problem? You can't even get close to the Goblet unless you are in your seventh year. Could this be a plot by Harry Potter's Arch-nemesis, Lord Voldemort? --END SUMMARY-- ... Where do I begin? Ooh! I know. This movie... sucks. Great plot, right? the Novel was amazing. Mike Newell failed horribly at making this movie... simply put. I honestly think he missed half the damn story... and what he missed he just replaced with things that never happened. What happened to S.P.E.W.? What happened to the dursley's? Why are they NEVER wearing their robes, only preppy clothes? Tell me why they spent more time on the scene where Daniel Radcliffe takes a bath then on the actual plot? The movie was not only short, but also missed several important events. Where was Dobby? What about Mr. Crouches house elf? Where was Sirius? Why did they not go to his cave and see Buckbeak??<br/><br/>What about the part where The Weasley Twins expand Dudley's tongue? Where was that? Why didn't they show ANY of the classes except Defense against the Dark Arts? This movie is WAY WAY too Hollywood and makes the Novel seem like utter crap. They spent more time on set design and makeup and clothes than they did the actual script. It's 1994. Not 2006. Also, Hermione was in tears half the movie. Anyone notice that? Constantly flipping out. the movie also missed a lot of plot development points, such as the relationship between Harry and Cho. Only for the people who don't want to read the novel... or only for the true hardcore HP fans who would only get it just to have the entire set of movies.

It is, in my opinion, the worst of the series while the book is the most complex and interesting if you consider only the four first books(since on the whole, the books in this series have the tendency of not only becoming gloomier, but also better and better, both as far as plot is concerned, but also characters, situations, everything.)The result however is dreadful, like some apprentice just chopped off the juiciest moments and packed the left ones pell-mell. I am sorry to see that the author allowed this to happen to her book. Also, I have to notice that not one of the directors and writers has introduced Peeves as a character, and this discrimination is revolting in as much as it has deprived us of many savoury moments. If directors/writers have reduced this wonderful book to such a lamely result, I do not even want to think what they'll make of books V and VI who are even more complex. For the moment I feel that maybe giving up Chris Columbus was the worst decision ever."

","When I first saw Goblet of Fire in the theaters, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and quite possibly favored this film of all the Harry Potter films. Which is only fitting as Goblet of Fire is also my favorite book of all books. However, upon second viewing, I was decidedly less impressed.<br/><br/>While others may have had gripes about a certain young actor, I had no problems with the main three: Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint. I thought they did a fine job and have truly grown as actors. I also felt that the Steve Kloves script was able to fit most of the essential parts of the story into the film, though there were some plot threads that seemed to have been dropped or lost along the way. I understand that with the amount of material needed to cram into a children's movie, there is hardly any room for lag, but unfortunately, Mike Newell's breezy direction barely gives the right moments time to breathe, and the pacing feels a fairly unbalanced.<br/><br/>I very much like the darker, more 'grown-up' Potter. I think this shift in the series is a welcome change, as many of the Harry Potter fans are adults. The action is more intense, and the scary scenes are delightfully scarier. And yet despite this new, older feel, many of the moments are played to the lowest crowd. Many of the gags are childish, and it doesn't help that the veteran actors like Gambon, Rickman, and even Fiennes play their characters without the gravity they possess in the books.<br/><br/>And that may be my biggest gripe of the film: the characters aren't quite right this time around. With such a dense script , fast pace, and multitude of child actors, it's up to the adults to nail their characters, and provide the necessary grounding for the film. But unfortunately, not everyone hits all the right notes, and we're left with something a bit more shallow than we've hoped."

","As I am a Harry Potter fan myself, the movie's opening last year was what I looked forward to. I had heard so much how the book's plot had to shrink in order to fit into the movie but then given the time constraints, there is no way out.<br/><br/>The serious Potter fans will be complaining that so many things are left out but then, there's no choice at all. For an average fan like me, it's alright. The three tasks just get tougher and difficult as it goes along in the movie. The Yule Ball scene was another highlight too.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the graveyard scene when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) met Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) in the graveyard. After Cedric (Robert Pattison) was murdered by the Dark Lord's servant, I almost noticed my eyes was beginning to swell. Innocent people are always the first victims.<br/><br/>Ever since the whole Harry Potter movie series began, I had already pictured who is who in the books as to who they are in the movies. It's the same for this fourth instalment as well. I can really picture how the Dark Lord (aka Lord Voldermort) looks like (it's scary!), Cedric looks like given the description given in the book as him being handsome and all that. It had never failed me on that.<br/><br/>Also - Growing pains, teenage hormones...so who says the people in the magical world will not face it too? It does as well and it can be comical at times watching it unfold in the movie. As me in the late teens at the moment, I so know how it's like.<br/><br/>For any Harry Potter fans out there, especially the average ones like me, you will like it."

"charchuk","6","0","0","13 May 2006"," Excellent both as a film and as a book adaptation
","I just watched it again, for the first time since I saw it in theatres, and it holds up very well. I'm able to forgive liberties with the plot because I realize that this is a movie, and if I wanted the entire plot, I could just read the book again. What makes movies successful adaptations of books is if they capture the mood and the themes of them, not the story word for word necessarily. Too many people disliked the film simply because it left too much out. If they put everything in, the film would be 5 hours long and would have cost $500 million. So I'm able to put up with stuff cut out.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a fantastic film. The story is very well done for a Potter film, they're able to cut most of the useless stuff and combine some redundancies to make a great plot. I didn't feel like anything was really missing. The Quidditch World Cup would have been nice to see, but I understand why they cut it - for time and money issues - and it didn't have any effect on the story (still, they didn't have any qualms about extending the dragon scene). The pacing at the beginning is a bit off - more of an introduction would have been welcome - and the ended seems rushed, but the entire middle, from when they get to Hogwarts to the graveyard scene, is done very well. The performances are great, I didn't notice a single weak actor of the lot. Gleeson in particular stands out, he really nailed Moody. Fiennes tends to chew scenery a bit, but I suppose that's capturing Voldemort well. All of the returnees do well in very small parts. I would have liked to see more of Malfoy Sr. and Sirius in particular, but oh well. The kids are very good, it's great to see them mature from the painful first film. The teen angst stuff is a bit unwelcome, but I guess it reflects the environment.<br/><br/>Technically, this film is sound. Cinematography, editing, production design, music, all are top-notch. It's too bad John Williams wasn't able to return to score this film, his music for Azkaban was one of the best and most original I've ever heard. The conductor this time around seems to be just going through the motions, he doesn't add much that Williams hasn't already done. Still, Williams' score is so fantastic that it doesn't matter. The editing could have been a bit smoother at times, but for the most part, it's very well done. Cinematography and production design are excellent, as with all the films. I preferred Azkaban's dark, Gothic tones more, but Goblet still manages to be dark in its own way. The visual effects are fantastic, as expected. The dragon is superbly done. The entire chase scene with it is very thrilling, and one of the best in the film. The ""magic in the background"" isn't used as excellently as in the third film, but it still pops up every now and then. And the ending is very emotional and touching.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the second best Potter film and third best of the year, after Batman Begins and Revenge of the Sith, so far. I liked Azkaban more because I like the book better - much more mysterious and intriguing plot - and I thought Cuaron brought a Gothic feel to the series that was both unique and needed. But this is still a great film. It's amazing how much better the last two films are over the first two. Columbus really doesn't know how to make an original film. All in all, an excellently made film and very good adaptation of the source material. After seeing it a second time, my grade remains an A."

","OK so I started reading the HP books after the 2nd movie was released. And personally I think the first 2 were although not complete still pretty accurate for a movie and keeping the feel of the characters. But in my opinion everything went downhill when they changed directors after the second movie and Richard Harris passed away. <br/><br/>The *Magic* is truly gone from the 4th if not already on 3rd movie. Most actors are pretty good but most characters are way to old for the character playing them. And they didn't even tried to make them look younger. Also school robes are apparently not enforced anymore cause about 75% if not 100% of the time they're all wearing expensive brand jeans,tight sweaters now. Major plot holes like how Crouch and Crouch junior are related remains a mystery throughout the whole movie and instead of in the book being on trial himself he's being snitched by Karkaroff. The most illogical event followed , instead of staying calm on his seat and throwing it on lies and no proof ""cause there really wasn't any at that time"" like every sensible human-being would do he suddenly starts to act like some deadly psycho killer with some very weird ""habits"" before being hurled off. One thing also noticed is that this movie is much more chaotic than the others because of the suddenly scene changes leaving us all oblivious what the hell just happened and because of Dumbledore... <br/><br/>Cause simply, Micheal Gambon is actually the worst cast in the whole movie. Instead of being sensible, calm and wise like Dumbledore ""even on the verge of his own death"" he looks more like a drunk violent stepfather that hasn't got a clue what's going on. Like in the books illuminating calmth into others this guy tries to tackles Harry or how you call it ""mandhandling his own student ""not to mention favorite student"" and shakes him all through the room yelling at him. <br/><br/>How the hell can he ever confront Umbridge and threatening her that she can't manhandle students on Hogwarts when she shakes Cho's best friend and shouts at her. But the directors will probably alter it anyways so you might be seeing some tag-team action in the 6th movie. Or just even better just not include it all. Like they do with so many important aspects of the story. His bad acting is probably the reason he has shown he doesn't want to read the books and just...acts himself.<br/><br/>I was honestly stunned how they completely leave out key-players for the future movies and the most crucial moments. The Graphics are getting better every movie but I almost regret I've seen 3 and 4. One of the best things about HP was that the complete book was intertwined, facts that weren't important from the older books come back later and you can say ""hey so that's why it was there""..."

","To see this movie makes us begin of less the previous delivery done by Alfonso Cuarón. Without being chauvinists, we might say that of work actoral there is little or nothing hereabouts. Harry only does grimaces and gets angry (without very much success) Hermione overacts and Ron spends his time showing his grunge look. It is not possible to say, nevertheless, that it is a mediocre production: the special effects, the production of wardrobe, everything is impeccable. Nevertheless, how effective can it be all that if it the principal part (the acting work) is depressing? Apparently, the fact of turning Harry Potter's rear into a gentle exemption(franchise), is beginning to lose the essence of the novels. A magic, dark world and often slightly ceremonious ... I quite dress from the point of view of a child who is growing with the spectator. We hope they does not forget, to the producers, the matter this. On the other hand, Cuarón has not disdained to return to work for the Warner, if they propose it, clearly. We really pray for it."

","The director of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' taking over the Harry Potter series? One would expect some of the humor and good-feeling atmosphere of his previous movies to find somehow place in the teen-Gothic series based on Rowlings nooks. What is happening is quite the contrary and to a somehow a disappointing result.<br/><br/>The good things to be said about this fourth installment in the series are about the effects, masterly integrated into the movie, serving well the overall atmosphere and color. I should rather say lack of color, because the world of 'Gobblet of Fire' is much darker and less exuberant than the one in the previous series. The principal characters matured, and the world is much less a universe of childhood masterly taken over by good and bad witches, but starts to look like the threatening world of adults where the destiny of any child is to arrive. Acting is good, the original casting proves itself and the three main actors do not disappoint, but age is doing its work, and we are already in pain believing that the heroes are only 14. Interesting to see how this will be solved in the next series, re-casting may become inevitable.<br/><br/>The main problem of 'Gobblet' is the story itself, which fails to interest and lacks continuity. It may be that if we say the previous film one week ago we would remember better what the villains are about and how menacing they really are. It's however two or three years later now, and the result is that we do not really remember why the bad guys are bad, what is Harry's family story, the mature seem too much like a parody, and the terrible things that are supposed to happen on screen look cartoonish and fail to involve the viewer. In the balance between the teenagers angst and the dragons-witch stories it is the teen story that paradoxically looks more interesting, but then, that much money put in a teenage growing story seems to be an excessive expense."
"daryl_purdie","5","0","0","6 April 2006"," Well made film - shame about the lack of a story.
","Think of James Bond as a TV series, so every movie has familiar characters but a whole new story. The trouble with Harry Potter is that its more like a mini series, with only 1 story (watch out for the bad guy whose name must not be spoken). This isn't enough to sustain me for 4 films. I blame J K Rowling and her impotent editors for the lack of plot, because in actual fact the movie makers have done a pretty good job.<br/><br/>So about the movie, its well made and shot. With hormones starting to bubble and great set pieces around each of the tasks. Good acting and film-craft in general make this an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.<br/><br/>Trouble is the 'finale' where Voldermort is finally revealed is disappointing. The battle between him & Harry was quite an anti-climax. I was expecting an epic.<br/><br/>To conclude - Definitely the worst in the series so far but still worth watching if you are a Harry Potter 'completist'."

","First of all, a pat on the back is due to everyone involved in making this movie because there is no doubt that it would have been a huge task and it was quite well done. In this movie the students of Hogwarts have discovered the joys of puberty and the complete embarrassment and grief that it can bring you. Young Harry is faced with the looming Tri Wizard tournament and the dangers it could and most likely will bring. Harry Potter fans will notice a few main characters missing and the story slightly altered, but it's all for the good of the cinema..right? <br/><br/>That being said, there were some things that bothered me about Goblet of Fire. Emma Watson (Hermione) was very dramatic this time around and most of the time it was very unnecessary. Rather than conveying an emotion, most of the time she just came across as a sulky pubescent teen. Also the film has a very disjointed feel to it. Scenes felt unfinished and short and the transitions between scenes just felt too choppy.<br/><br/>Okay enough with the criticisms, I did enjoy the movie apart from what's mentioned above, and the director made sure that it was action packed as possible. I have to say I was pretty tense during the first task even though I knew what was going to happen. A massive amount of credit is due toThe movie looks beautiful and the cinematography is breath taking. All in all, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a well scripted, finely acted (mostly) and beautiful looking movie.

Also many important characters such as Draco Malfoy, Winky the house elf, Barty Crouch and Barty Crouch Jr, Cedric Diggory, Cho Chang, Viktor Krum, Rita Skeeter, Snape and many more (i may go over my 1000 word limit if i keep going!) are either non-existent or the full importance of their characters is not revealed due to lack of screen time.<br/><br/>Furthermore the depiction of Dumbledore in this film is awful (it was far more on target in the previous films) - he shouts and barges into the students - something not even indicated in the book and much of his important explanational dialogues in the book (well, OK, nearly all of it!)is missed out in the film - which will make the next film exceptionally confusing especially if the viewer has not read the books.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed in the way the first scene (of harry's dream) and the graveyard scene as they too were very rushed.<br/><br/>In all the film was far too rushed - the original idea of making it two parts would have been far better received and only then could the film have been true to the book.

When I saw the movie, I disappointed to see that I had read about 5 minutes of the book! They left out many characters and details, along with the absence of the opening scene with Dudley, Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Petunia. There is also a chapter about Dobby and other house-elves, which was also absent in the movie. With Michael Gambon playing as Dumbledore, Dumbledore seems more dark and ""mean"" if you will with his style of speaking. The music orchestration was also dry since John Williams wasn't the composer for it. The main Harry Potter theme is no where to be heard in this film. The only music by JW to be heard in the movie is Hedwig's Theme, who is seen in the movie for a good minute.<br/><br/>The lighting for this movie was way to dark in the movie theater. It was hard at times to figure out what was going on because of this. Luckily, with my television, I could adjust the brightness of the screen.

Several questions come to mind watching these young and intrepid kids trying their best to be their characters: What's gonna happen to these young stars after it's all over? Is Daniel Radcliffe disappointed that at this point he has no chance of learning how to act with ever shortening takes in which to deliver his lines? Will Rupert Grint ever be taken seriously after doing seven movies in a row about being a hero's buffoonish sidekick? What about that young man playing Draco Malfoy?

","First off let me say I'm probably reviewing this from a rather one sided point of view having read the books. The movie all together isn't bad for children but it has a severe lack of plot. It seems the director and producers decided to shove as much time and money as possible into visual effects and completely leave out the subplots and side stories that really help to build the characters. I was severely disappointed when I heard they were originally going to make this book into two movies. So many characters and important events have been left out. Most importantly, there is no set up for the rift between hogwart's and the ministry of magic, which nearly the entire point of the next in the series. At first I was worried as to how they will be fixing this in the next film but I suppose they wont have to if the goal is to rely on special effect and not good acting or writing. Hats off to Columbus, I hope he is headed back to the series. The only reason I don't give this a lower reason is because it IS intended for children, but as Harry grows, so do his readers, and the film industry needs to understand that by the end of this series they will need to tend to a much more mature audience. 4 out of 10"

I saw the first 2 movies before I started to read the books, I highly recommend reading the books and as usual, the books are better than the movies. Enjoy both on their own merits, they are bound to become classics that will endure the decades much the same as The Wizard of Oz! I would recommend these movies and books for most age groups, though not the very young (under 10) as they are a bit intense and get more so as the books go on, the battle between the dark or evil and the light or good has always been a serious one that gets quite gritty as it goes on... this series is no example."

","This film is presented well and is filled with spectacular special effects. One person posted a comment that she was disappointed about the bathtub scene when Moaining Myrtle joined Harry in the tub. While that was NOT in the book one must remember that movies are BASED UPON a story or novel and that while the premise of the story stays the same, a director has a certain amount of liberty that he/she can take to make the story more appealing on a visual level.<br/><br/>If one is not thrilled that a film does not follow the book to the letter, then it is best to read the book and create your own image of the scene in your mind.<br/><br/>To me, this movie is the best so far as for visual effects but I think of the series, to date, the Prisoner if Azkaban was the best all around film adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>All the performers are excellent, Radcliff, Grint, and Watson put 100% forth and the adult cast are always superior especially Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonnagle) Enjoy these films and don't nit-pick the details. After all how well could YOU do if asked to direct the next film?"

","I really liked this movie. The soundtrack was awesome, the acting was much improved, and the direction was also exceptional. <br/><br/>There was a lot of Harry/Hermione shipping that shouldn't have been there. I think it was just that Dan and Emma have more chemistry together than Rupert and Emma have. (SPOILER: Ron and Hermione get together!) (I would like to say DUH but that would be rude. So I won't.)<br/><br/>Another thing they left out was any implication of Fred and George wanting to open up a joke shop, or Harry getting any prize money to give to them. I don't see how they are going to incorporate that into the other films.<br/><br/>The Rita Skeeter sub-plot was also left out, but I think they can get something about that into one of the coming films.<br/><br/>But, otherwise, the movie was very good, the new actors are very good looking (OMG CEDRIC I LOVE YOU!), and it was very well fit in to 2 hours and some minutes."

","Those of us Potter book fans who were upset with the things left out of Prisoner of Azkaban had better face the fact - they are not gonna fit everything in these films! Cut out the Dursleys, Herimone's (slightly annoying) house-elf liberation plans, and a few basically unimportant characters, and there's where hardcore ""purist"" Potterites went crazy.<br/><br/>The beginning is choppy, but really, it had to be to fit in the more important later parts. Voldemort is making evil plots in the background, as his supporters build up and begin to terrorize the wizarding world once again at the Quidditch World Cup. The wizarding world is on the brink of a real war as the book goes on, and the thing I liked about it is that the tenseness of Harry's whole situation is lightened up by comedy (much better quality than the other films) & light romance/ teenage awkwardness. <br/><br/>Characters who were always put into the background in the films were brought out- Fred and George are no longer just a pop-in/pop-out joke. Neville is more developed and brought out. Ginny has a lot more lines, and makes more appearances as her character becomes more important (as well as Neville's). <br/><br/>New schools join Hogwarts in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and Harry's name mysteriously comes out of the Goblet of Fire (an impartial judge for the tournament), even when he didn't put it in there. Harry is being accused by friends and fellows because he is three years younger than he is supposed to be. He goes through the three dangerous tasks of the tournament, and befriends the popular and handsome Cedric Diggory of Hufflepuff. You really see the difference between Harry and Cedric in this film, and that Harry can be just like every other teenage male. This film is no longer child's play. It reaches PG-13, as it should be. Voldemort returns, a loss is suffered, and Harry narrowly escapes death himself but is left shaken.<br/><br/>The friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione deepens as their world faces death for the first time, and the look on Harry's face shows it all in the end. Radcliffe makes a spectacular performance, and since in the next book Harry suffers from survivor's guilt, it will be great to see him act out that part of Harry. And as the last chapter of the book is called, the end of this Potter film is only ""The Beginning"" of dark and difficult times. <br/><br/>I left the theater very satisfied and extremely happy at how the book was portrayed on screen. If you didn't understand some parts, read the book/get the audio book/ask a friend who's read the book! It's an addicting read & a turning point in the series. The DVD should be awesome, especially the special features. Hope this review helps! :)"
"yaelk92","4","0","0","12 March 2006"," Harry's name is selected out of the Goblet of Fire. Harry will find danger in every step.
","In this part of the Potter movies, directed by Mike Newell, there is a lot of danger and destruction, and Harry is introduced to newer, more dangerous things. Mike Newell was clearly trying to settle his camera upon one main thing: teenage love. <br/><br/>True, Harry is growing up, and his emotions are every which way, but why was so much of the movie taken up by the Yule Ball? It seems this movie was meant only for teenagers. Hogwarts is portrayed much differently when there are bare-backed teenagers dancing to a made-up rock band. The acting in the film is slowly improving. As for Michael Gambon: Fine an actor as he may be, the casting director who chose him went the opposite way of where they should have. Harris's Dumbledore shared the qualities of the book's Dumbledore: kind, compassionate, almost superhuman, and cares for Harry the most, foreseeing the danger that is to come in his future years, and what he must do. However, Gambon's Dumbledore has no warmth; in fact, he pushes Harry many times in the movie, and speaks in angry tones. In this film you see Dumbledore more as an angry old man rather than the book's Dumbledore (anyone who is a big fan of the books knows exactly what I'm talking about). (and besides, who really wears their beard in a ponytail?)<br/><br/>Rupert's acting is superior to the threesome; Daniel still seems to have a little trouble with his emotional blows. Being forced on a gravestone while a man you loathe cuts deep into your skin would require more of a short grunt and closed eyes. <br/><br/>However, the second task was done remarkably well; I think Newell captured the eeriness of the Black Lake perfectly. The audience is tense during this part, waiting for something scary to happen while Harry swims slowly through the water. <br/><br/>The first task is a little forced, but I can live with it. The third task....what happened?! Harry didn't seem so scared in the books, and in the books there were Blast-Ended Skrewts and animals, not some stupid wind. What was the deal with that?!<br/><br/>All in all,this movie did NOT live up to the book's standards. If you have not read the book and you watch this movie, you will be utterly lost EVEN WITHIN THE FIRST OR SECOND SCENE! <br/><br/>The humor was a little forced, too. <br/><br/>I would advise not watching it if you're a die-hard Potter fan."
"frg-1","7","0","0","12 March 2006"," Good and bad points
","Goblet of fire was better technically than the last Harry Potter movie,even Oscar-worthy is some respects, but important story segments were omitted for the sake of length. I think filmmakers should take 140 minutes if it takes that long to tell the story. I don't understand the reluctance of the Harry Potter character to tell his friends and teachers important details of his experiences that are vital to their safety. It doesn't ring true of an honest kid with nothing to hide. In fact, his reticence doesn't make sense in any context of the story, and stands out. My third comment is that the Hogwarts landscape keeps changing. Why? The choppiness, changing topography and unexplainable lack of dialog from the protagonist aside, it was a good film."
"mbucky","4","0","0","11 March 2006"," Very disappointed
","I was so looking forward to this film, even though my gut and my disinterest in the trailer told me that I would not like it. I have not read the books, so that is a caveat before I can continue this review. I love books, but after watching the first film version, which I loved immensely, I decided I would have to wait to clear my mind of the environment and characters the films had cemented in my imagination. The Prisoner of Azkaban was extraordinary and proved, especially after the waning quality of the franchise was exhibited in the Chamber of Secrets, that a wonderful director was necessary to make these films work. <br/><br/>However, Mike Newell turned this story into a flashy, dull, ostentatious spectacle. Maybe it was the fact that I viewed it at home, but it is my belief that a film cannot only ride on its ability to exploit big screen advantages. The acting was also as deplorable as the directing. The young stars, who seemed so innocent and devoid of conceit, exhibited oodles of ridiculous over-acting. <br/><br/>For anyone who has not seen this in theaters: beware! At home this film is nothing more than a big budgeted groaner. I may stand alone, although not entirely because my boyfriend hated it more than I disliked it, but I believe that this film marks a sad turn for this series."
"leighann_50","7","0","0","11 March 2006"," Good but a lot was left out
","I think it was a good movie, but A LOT was left out. I think some of the most important parts were left out and changed. They didn't even have extras. I think they need to put the Dursleys back in. I don't mean to complain, but it just wasn't what I expected. Hopefully they'll stick with the same director for more than one movie like the first two. It makes it so weird to have different directors. I don't know... I mean, again, it was a good movie, but it just lacked some material. I know they are limmited to what they can do on the set, but still, they could have put a few more things in there. I think I'll stop now before I make anyone angry...I don't mean to offend anyone if I do so. If anyone agrees or disagrees, message me. I'd love to know how anyone else feels about it."
"JimD73","6","0","0","11 March 2006"," Goblet a choppy step back for the series
","I've always been pretty middle-of-the-road when it comes to the Harry Potter movies. I do love the books, which have always been top-of-the-line fantasy. The movies, on the other hand, have straddled mediocrity. The first two felt quite empty, but the third brought the series up a notch with a great new atmosphere and a much darker tone. We could only hope the fourth would continue with this train of thought.<br/><br/>The fourth year of Harry Potter's life as a wizard begins with him automatically at Ron Weasly's house, ready to go the Quidditch World Cup (no introduction with the Dursleys this time). Afterwards, Harry (Radcliffe), Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) are back on a train for the fourth year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Things aren't all the same this year, as Hogwarts is hosting the Triwizard Cup, an interschool competition of the best of wizarding students. After a representative has been chosen for each of the three schools, the goblet of fire gives out one last name, that of Harry Potter, who is now forced to compete in this extremely dangerous competition.<br/><br/>Despite popular opinion, the fourth book was my least favourite of the six currently out there. Why you ask? Because it was overly long with countless points that really didn't affect the plot one way or another. The whole Triwizard cup could have been done without had some tweaking took place. When 90% of a book is completely inconsequential, this does carry on to the movie, as much of that 90% is required to be shown again.<br/><br/>Another prospected problem for the film is that the book was much longer than the other three. This means that the movie cut out a lot of stuff, such as Hermione's war with journalist Rita Skeeter (Richardson) and the elf rights lobby, that might irk fans of the book. Even with all of this cut out (mostly for the better), the movie still feels like it is trying to condense everything too much. A lot of scenes feel like they were cut short, and a lot of characters have a minuscule part compared to the book. The most obvious instance is concerning the rival champs, Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour, who probably say a combined total of twenty words. This will annoy anyone familiar with the book, but truly confuse anyone who didn't read the books as they are given no time to absorb the information being given to them.<br/><br/>While the Triwizard cup may have been unnecessary in my eyes, it does provide for some great visuals in the movie. The opening event where Harry must face a dragon looks great, even if it isn't entirely logical. The final event is also handled quite well. The touch of magic in the world that has been present throughout is still intact, such as the moving images in the paintings and such. The visuals are great all around.<br/><br/>One thing that stands out about this part of the series is that it starts what I like to call the phase where Harry discovers himself. A big part of the tournament in the Yule Ball, which forces Harry and Ron to get themselves dates. The movie handles the process with all the male insecurities they can fit into the short amount of time allotted, and actually works out quite well as a breather from all the Triwizard talk. The Ball itself isn't quite as I expected, seeming more like a high school prom (complete with an absolutely horrid band) than an actual ball, but regardless, this was one part they got right.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is what many fans of the book have been waiting for, and it doesn't disappointÂ…much. Note that this paragraph is probably a spoiler for those who have gone bookless. Voldemort is represented quite well by Ralph Fiennes, though he seems like more of a creature than a human as I had thought of him. He also seems way too energetic at the end. Regardless, it brings the darkness that I loved in the third one back to the movie. Also, I loved the little hint towards the KKK reflected in the robes of the Death Eaters.<br/><br/>The acting of the three leads is much more mature than it was in the first couple movies. Radcliffe is full of insecurities as a child who truly does not want to be in his own position. Grint also has improved, being the immature Ron Weasley we all know from the books. The biggest change is Emma Watson, who has matured greatly into quite a good young actress. She doesn't try to appear any more mature than any other teenager, but her anger scenes are done exceptionally well, considering how mediocre the three of them were back in Sorceror's Stone.<br/><br/>As for the adults, the only one worthy of special mention is Brendan Gleeson, who is absolutely perfect as Mad Eye Moody, the new defence against the dark arts teacher. His quirks are all excellent to watch, yet you can always see some kind of deeper meaning in whatever insanity he performs. He provides some great levity along with some very good non-humorous moments. The other mentionable actor is Michael Gambon, who picked up the role of Dumbledore from the late Richard Harris after The Chamber of Secrets. While I did prefer Harris, Gambon has filled his shoes quite well, and aside from the voice it is difficult to tell the difference.<br/><br/>Despite all the problems, Goblet is still better than the first two entries, even if not by much. I am confident the problem lay with adapting the book rather than the minds behind the film. This really doesn't help expectations for the next two, which are even longer. Even if the problems are understandable, that doesn't stop Goblet from being a choppy film that will disappoint fans of the book and confuse fans of the films."
"PatrynXX","7","0","0","11 March 2006"," Not bad, but some glaring plot holes made it less than perfect.
","I assume they left the plot holes in purposely so I gotta go read the book.<br/><br/>The first one I actually thought was a skip on the DVD. After the ball and Ms Granger is having a tearful argument with Ron about he ruined everything. Did I miss something? Clearly time flew as Ms Granger had been wondering where Harry had been. She just left him and ron sitting around depressed at a table. THat was like just a glaring plot hole. The other.. well after all that I assume Harry won the goblet of fire.<br/><br/>After all that though clearly our three friends are kids anymore. I just hope these three at least remain till the 7 movies are up. (which is probably the reason Peter Jackson did what he did with LOTR. However Harry Potter's world needs some aging. But if Melissa Joan Hart can pull off being a teen into her mid to late 20's, these three oughta make it easy. Definitely bring back the director though. He did a much better job than the other one in movie 3. <br/><br/>The movie pretty much has that emotion thing down... although I admit freely that Ron really looks bad in that dress of his. I had to hit the FF on the remote. (similar situation happens in movie 2 with the cake over the guests. :P <br/><br/>I am disappointed with WB home video from the way they released the DVD. The Standard DVD looks like the first 3 except it's only got one disc. I really had to hunt down the double disc special edition. I let them know my disappointment. It was a stretch when they switched the nice cardboard/plastic custom DVD case to the plastic one's everyone else uses, but hey if LOTR special editions came in the plastic type, they'd never be as cool. Now they've shredded the second disc.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10<br/><br/>and kill that rat!!! (cause he's certainly up to no good)"
"StarCollector118","6","0","0","11 March 2006"," Largely disappointing...
","You may ask yourself why, considering the title of this comment, I chose to rate this movie 8 out of 10. Yes, I consider it disappointing for the most part, for reasons I will go into further detail below; however, it had one large redeeming quality which prevents me from completely hating it.<br/><br/>The first time I saw ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" or any of the other movies in the series for that matter, I had never read any of the books. I felt that it was finally time to jump on the book bandwagon, since I was blown away by this film upon first viewing. My initial reaction was that this was the best film of the series to date, with stunning special effects, great story and astounding conclusion. Now my opinion is very different.<br/><br/>For my second viewing, I chose to read the book immediately before viewing the film, so the material was still fresh in my mind. I was amazed at how much of J.K. Rowling's material was removed or changed for this film. The scenes at the World Quidditch Cup were so trimmed that you almost have to wonder how someone who hasn't read the book can follow the action without getting horribly lost. I realize all adaptation films require trimming in order to fit within the time alloted, but the changing of the storyline (i.e. changing from Dobby giving Harry the gillyweed in the book to Neville giving him the gillyweed in the movie) was highly disappointing, not to mention offensive to those who are dedicated to the book series.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the music in this installment is horrendous. You may be asking yourself, ""Isn't that a bit too harsh?"" My answer is no, and I'll tell you why. First and foremost, it is far too weak to be consistent with what is happening on the screen. It is also reminiscent of another film, which I can't put my finger on, to the point that I wonder if the music was slightly plagiarized. There is also a weepy song that plays during the credits, entitled ""Magic Works"" and sung by the band portraying ""The Weird Sisters""--which, incidentally, has been changed to an all male group for the film--that wouldn't fit anywhere in the movie, and certainly does not belong on the credits. The only original music by John Williams that remains, the main theme and Hedwig's Theme, is sadly not used enough but is instead replaced with the new music by Patrick Doyle that just doesn't measure up.<br/><br/>Finally for the redeeming quality. The climax of this film remains intact and in accordance with the book, nearly verbatim, beginning with the scene in which Harry and Cedric are transported out of the maze and to the graveyard and, ultimately, into Voldemort's clutches. Of course, there are cuts to this portion as well--the most disappointing being the images of Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall glowering out of the Foe Glass--but they are not as pronounced as with the rest of the movie. It is for the climax alone that I recommend this film, for it really does save the film from being complete rubbish.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book first, it will probably make the movie better for you...so I'd advise watching before reading, simply to make the experience more enjoyable."

","I am not a frantic Potter-ophile but have read and greatly enjoyed all the books. I've enjoyed all the films as well but felt there was sometimes a lack of tension in the films...until The Goblet of Fire. I rate this so high because the film carries almost all of the important elements necessary to propel the story but even more shows what life is really like as a student of Hogwarts. The tension and elements are all fun but I particularly enjoyed the kids and how they've matured and seem to be working more in sync with each other. Also, most of the adults are given at least one good scene to show their stuff and I thought Maggie Smith was particularly hilarious. Why Brendan Gleeson didn't cop an Supporting Actor nom is beyond me. He ate up the screen. The script is tight and multiple viewings helps tie key elements together as well as what is forthcoming in future films. Those who feel every book chapter must transfer to the screen or the film is a failure should take note that including every little nuance makes for a long and tortuous experience. Now that the kids are ""aging"" I can't wait to see how they handle...hmmm....hmmm... Miss Umbridge."

The director originally wanted to do this movie in 2 separate segments, he should have stuck to that plan. I understand that movies can never hold the amount or be as explicit as the books, I however as an avid reader was extremely disappointed in this movie.

These books are truly amazing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite the gee-wiz(ard) effects, the movie is sorely lacking in almost all the elements that made the book impossible to set down. (I remember when it was released. I read it in almost one sitting). There is all the action, of course, but none of the drama. Where is Harry's frustration? It's as if the story were so big and unwieldy to convert to film, that all the major elements were only ""paid homage"" to. For instance, Cedric and Cho Chang. What happened to them? We see her crying at the end of the movie, but after a couple of hours, there wasn't enough story to make me care! <br/><br/>OK. To be fair: as a movie, it does work. It is highly entertaining, action packed and because of the previous movies, they don't have to work too hard to get us to care for the main characters. It's a good film, but compared to the great work it sprang from, it falls far short."

The sequels are running out of steam. Some of the characters are OK but the main ones are starting to be ridiculous in their performances. <br/><br/>I would hope that they end the series soon because Harry potter is getting older and I don't think he can pull off the character very well anymore. <br/><br/>Also the length of the movie was far too long.

There wasn't very great transitions in between the tasks and characters weren't very well described and were given no background information. I mean don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but it just flat out didn't live up to the book. I loved the special effects with the dragons and the mermaids though, also the scene with Voltemort in the graveyard was pretty decent. I was just disappointed on how many details were left out about many key creatures and characters that come on later on in the series and what make the book so magical and entertaining, such as the sirens, as they never mentioned. The maze was very poorly done I would say too, all it was was a harmless maze with a bunch of attacking bushes and branches. Where were the creatures like the blasted-ended srewts and the boggart? The most disappointing thing I would have to say though was the conclusion. in the book it set up a great cliff-hanger, the movie didn't.

They had the ability to be great films, but fell a little short, most likely due to the fact that they were aimed primarily at a younger crowd i think. Prisoner Of Azkaban took the necessary step to greater involve a more mature audience, and reaped the benefits for it. The film really helped to flesh out the many of the characters, especially the three kids. <br/><br/>So coming into The Goblet of Fire, I had very high expectations. I am very pleased to say, that despite any knowledge of the books, that the film really does deliver.The plot makes some very dark twists, and the scenes in the graveyard are particularly menacing. I especially enjoyed the appearance of Lord Voldemort, which is presented with all the gravitas and suspense you would expect. <br/><br/>The casting is, as always, fantastic. I have always loved Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Gary Oldman, and while their characters are minor in the whole scheme of things, their presence on screen is amazing. The kids are getting a little less annoying as they seem to be growing into themselves quite well. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great fantasy film that I would recommend to anybody who loves fantasy.

"skallisjr","7","0","0","9 March 2006"," Disappointing Adaptation
","In the Harry Potter series, ""Goblet of Fire"" was perhaps the pivotal book, leading to the more grownup aspects of the later stories. The film perhaps couldn't do that, but it didn't even try.<br/><br/>The film starts at the International Quiddich Match, but the whole game was sidestepped, including the introduction of the Veelas, who were supposed to be stupefyingly beautiful ladies. In the book, Fleur was supposed to have a Veela in her ancestry, but that whole aspect was sidestepped in the film, leading to minor complications two books down.<br/><br/>But in the film, the match wasn't even finished, so its whole purpose was to introduce an idea that was utilized later in the film.<br/><br/>Then, the school year begins, and Harry finds himself an unexpected contender in the Twiwizard Tournament, a dangerous contest where the players -- ordinarily limited to one student per school -- vie for the cup/trophy that will, in one sense, transform their lives. There were two visiting schools, each of which had an entry into the tournament, and Hogwarts, which had its champion, and inexplicably, also Harry.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow. The contenders have to face three trials, and for two of them deviate significantly from the book. Harry has to face a dragon, and in the book he uses extremely skillful flying on his broom to snatch the egg. In the film, he uses more luck than skill to outlast the dragon, with most of the action well outside the contending area, and some offscreen.<br/><br/>Likewise with the underwater sequence. In the book, Harry (and Dumbledore) can communicate with the mer-people; in the film, little of that.<br/><br/>The film has some entertaining sequences, but with the truncation of the story elements from the book, a lot is lost. Some of what's left becomes rather confusing if you're trying to follow the book series' grand scheme."
"grahamsj3","7","0","0","8 March 2006"," Decent condensation
",".....and, short of making a 6-hour film, a condensation is what this film is. The script must have been absolutely rotten to write. What to leave in? What to leave out? JK Rowling's books are so full of totally imaginative magical things and creatures. But they left in enough magical moments to make the film work. The film is executed beautifully. Some of the art department's work, particularly the Yule Ball set, is stunning. Wardrobe also did a fantastic job on all the finery for the ball. The young main characters, now seasoned actors, are coming along in their acting abilities. The adult actors, as usual, are terrific. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape scares me every time I see him! The direction is first-rate. Overall, a very enjoyable film. I'm not going to complain about what was left out. When you try to make a 2-1/2 hour film from a 700 page book, some things just gotta go. I did want to see what a blast-ended skrewt looked like, though! Very little of real import was left out of the film vs the book. I believe that anyone who follows just the films should be able to keep up. Left in, and so importantly so, is the young wizards growing up. Their relationships are now taking on more adult-like characteristics. They are (in some cases, rather reluctantly) discovering the opposite sex. They're moodier than before. They're, well, they're Teenagers! I did think that the special effects in this film left me feeling that they should have been much better, and that's my major complaint about the film. The mood of this film, while having a lot of lighter moments, turns very, very dark toward the end. Death is now reality for the students of Hogwarts. Readers of the books can just fill in the blanks and embellish the film with all the little goodies that there just wasn't time for. I'm looking forward to the Order of the Phoenix!

","I enjoyed the movie, but think it was rather rushed. The base cast did their usual good job portraying their respective characters. The catch here is that maybe the director tried to put too much into a film this length. The original idea to release the movie in 2 parts (Ala. Kill Bill) might have been better. The film as released left a lot of holes in the story as written. While I agree some of the sub plots were not missed a few others were needed to answer questions for some first or second time Potter movie viewers. All in all it was a good movie, but shrinking later stories to fit time should be watched very closely.<br/><br/>I'm waiting and hoping that Order of the Phoenix stays closer to the book."
"freegrl00","4","0","0","8 March 2006"," Not the best Harry Potter movie
","Having read the book, I knew that the script for this movie would need to be pretty condensed for time. Still, I must say, I was disappointed by some of the scripting and direction decisions. Forgetting the omission of some key plot elements (i.e., house elves, Weasley's wizardly wheezes, expanded role of Sirius Black in Harry's life) that are integral to the next installment in the series, I was surprised by some of the additional plot elements added to tie up loose ends and explain missing elements (i.e., the quidditch world cup game, the introduction of Barty Crouch, Jr at the beginning of the movie??, the expansion of Neville's character to make up for the absence of others).<br/><br/>Some of the condensed/new story elements were pretty good...the expansion of Neville's character comes to mind. The special effects for the first and second tasks (except for the underwater hostages) were well done, and the graveyard sequence with Voldemort was sufficiently creepy.<br/><br/>The editing is almost too tight. For the first 90 minutes of the film, you jump from scene to scene without any transition. This makes it feel like you are being shown clips of a longer story (I actually checked the remote to my DVD player to make sure I wasn't playing the disc in preview mode :-( )<br/><br/>My main beef though is the portrayal of Dumbledore in this film, which others have mentioned. It is extremely inconsistent with the character that was developed in the books and in the last 3 movies.<br/><br/>As a book fan, I may not be the most objective movie reviewer. But if I had only seen the movies, it have been would be very hard to follow this one if I wasn't familiar with the book."

","HARRY POTTER returns in HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, the fourth installment in the franchise and , I must say, this movie is a visual delight. I did, however, enjoy HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN slightly better than this one.<br/><br/>It seems this time around somebody, not Harry, has entered his name in the drawing for the TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT and, wouldn't you know it, his name gets picked. Harry must then find ways to survive the three challenges he must endure. One of these challenges involves Harry saving Ron from underneath the water before time is up. This scene involves Harry getting bombarded by ugly, little squid like creatures and is awe inspiring. And more happens. Harry is having a certain dream over and over again. Lord Voldemort wants to return and he does.<br/><br/>Like I said, I did enjoy the 3rd installment slightly better. But, none-the-less, this is a good movie. So, sit back, relax and enjoy."

I'm 46 years old now and have seen GOF 3 times in the theater and I just bought the DVD and watched it after American Idol. The young actors in this series are absolutely superb. I can't say enough about this series except to say that Ms. Rowling is a bona-fide genius. The story lines and the action rival the Star Wars franchise. I love the books but I don't read the book until I see the movie because of the effects the movies have on my heart and my mind. Just to close, Dan, Rupert and Emma take a bow.

","Really enjoyed the action and the special effects. It's a bit scary, tense at times which makes it great for adults to watch. It's a long movie. It's very good visually when Voldemolt comes back, his face is done well. I like the part about Harry and the big lake when he turned into a frog. and jumped up out of the water to finish part of the wizard tournament. Although it is long it is very engrossing and goes really quickly, the story just grabs you. The twists are good, there are events that happen that are unforeseen and for those of you who have read the book, it's quite different from the way the book is written. John Williams is very good with the music, but I don't think the fourth soundtrack is as good as the others. The first movie soundtrack is really good, and so the fifth."

","I've never bothered to read the book and I guess that might be why I didn't get a single part of the movie. The movie was way too fast paced for the viewer to catch up. Hardly any characterization in this movie, and the magical touch to the first 3 films was just lost in this one. Every time I started to understand something, something else happens. I was also quite dissatisfied with this dumbledore, no longer so wise and powerful-looking as he was, acting quite annoying actually. No more dursleys, no more train to hogwarts, like how they started off with in the last 3 movies, probably wasn't in the book, but just creates that gap that viewers need to connect to the characters. Not enough classroom scenes. Too many new characters introduced in this fast paced film. Neville Longbottom has gotten way too skinny to be the troublesome pesk he was. the film was so fast, cho chang just didn't fit into the movie, harry's crush on her was too sudden, leaving the viewer confused at parts. (Not to mention she's not as pretty as she was in the book.) Overall film too choppy and fast paced, and not enough connection with the viewer, or with the last 3 films.<br/><br/>5/10 for a hp movie"

","The movie, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was absolute wonderful. Full of action, humor, and emotions. It keeps you up to date and moves you along very quickly through the book. If you want to fill in the blanks, you have to read the book. The movie has Beaux Batons and Durmstrang appear suddenly without warning, and though Dumbledore explains later, the book prepares you for their arrival. The movie was well written but for the die-hard Harry Potter fans I think we can agree that it could have been longer. Even 20 minutes would have slowed down the beginning a bit and explain more. But even if you don't read the books, the movie is a MUST SEE for all. And if you have an IMAX theater near you, the dragon scenes are awesome on the big screen!"
"some-yo_guy","8","0","0","5 March 2006"," A good movie from a great book
","The first thing I have to consider when reviewing this movie, is whether or not to view it as a movie by it's self, or as an adaptation of the greatest children's book ever. I feel that it is impossible to consider the movie without comparing directly or indirectly to the book. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is by far the best movie of the series. Though in comparing it to the book is falls just a little short. There is so much that is good about this movie, I am reluctant to say that it is anything but perfect.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a chilling dream sequence, during which a muggle grounds keeper is struck dead with advera kadvera curse when he accidentally walks in on a meeting between he-who-must-not-be-named and the rat guy from the third movie. This is one of the most chilling scenes in a fantasy movie ever.<br/><br/>From there Harry is awoken by Hermione, now a striking young beauty, and is rushed to the Quittich World Cup. I have to admit, I was disappointed by QWC scene. The book takes 175 pages to describe and detail what the movie rushes through in 15 minutes. I can't really complain however, as the 175 page prologue was a bit long in the first place.<br/><br/>After the disappointing QWC, there is a fantastic scene where students from two wizard schools arrive at Hogwarts for no apparent reason. The school of French beauties arrives by a giant carriage drawn my flying horses. The Eastern European team arrives by a giant submersible boat, coming out of the depths of the big Lake. Such amazing scenes, not described in the book, I really liked the artistic liberties taken with this movie.<br/><br/>There is another captivating scene where the French school with beautiful girls come in like a professional dance team, swirling and dancing to fantastical music, overtly flirting with the Hogwarts guys as they come to the front of the great hall. Then comes the guys from eastern Europe, marching in like the Russian army only with rhythm and magic flame throwers.<br/><br/>The comes the big announcement: The Tri Wizard Tournament. A nasty little tradition where three wizards from rival schools participate in a series of wizard challenge. There is minimum age of 17 to enter the tournament, but of course this movie wouldn't be titled Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire if Harry didn't mysteriously get entered into the tournament.<br/><br/>What follows in the movie, is a visually stunning, if somewhat accelerated account of the tournament. Though I absolutely loved the tasks where Harry has to fight a dragon for a golden egg, and then fight mer-people to save his friend, the last task where they enter a maze to find the Tri Wizard Cup, was disappointing. This is where any artistic liberties, and time saving cuts from the book become pure and simple butchery. There really is no excuse for cutting the sphinxes from the maze. This was the best scene from any of the Harry Potter books, and to cut it, is really a shame. Now I realize that they needed to cut certain aspects of the book, but did the REALLY need to cut that? I think not.<br/><br/>So in the end: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a above average movie, from a great book. With stunning visuals and a palatable plot, I would absolutely recommend this to anybody."
"xredgarnetx","6","0","0","4 March 2006"," One wonders
","One has to wonder for whom this film was made. Certainly not for fans of the book, who were disappointed to see how badly it was adapted. As for the rest of us, well, since we don't tend to be HARRY POTTER fans in the first place, this choppily edited, disjointed, CGI-heavy kiddie adventure tends to leave a very unsatisfying taste in the mouth. I honestly am not sure who would want to see this. Whatever money it makes, it presumably makes off of those who read the book, and few others. And those who read the book are not likely to recommend it to others, nor be repeat viewers. I predict the studio is going to experience a dramatic downturn in the box office take on the final three movies. (An easy prediction, actually, as I am a former film reviewer.) Also, the leads are becoming less appealing as they grow older. And it doesn't help that the replacement (Michael Gambon) for Dumbledore, the school chancellor (Richard Harris, who died right after the second film was shot), is an absolute dud."

"limau","8","0","0","2 March 2006"," An entertaining film
","Considering that the director had to remove a huge chunk of the back story in the book in order to fit all the important elements into the film, this film works surprisingly well. Some of the deletions, for example, the long-winded story of the missing witch, are probably an improvement, while others, such as scenes with Dobby and SPEW, are understandably not included. The story of Crouch and his son is greatly truncated but nevertheless well-done - particularly the scene where Barty Crouch suddenly realised who Moody actually is.<br/><br/>It is a fine entertaining film, as long as you don't expect great performances from the three teenagers. Some of the supporting cast, however, are wonderful, in particular Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson), and of course, Snape (Alan Rickman). Michael Gambon, however, is disappointing - Dumbledore simply isn't someone so excitable. Ralph Fiennes works well as Voldemort and I look forward to seeing him in the same role in future films.<br/><br/>This movie is an improvement on the first three. The three tasks are well-done and spectacular, in particular the Dragon chase and the underwater scene. The maze scene pales somewhat in comparison, but works fine within the film. The last scene is especially memorable, with the sinking ship and flying carriage, a touch of poetry that compares well with the best of Terry Gilliam such as the dream sequence in Brazil, the waltzing commuters in The Fisher King and dance with Venus in Baron Munchausen. <br/><br/>An enjoyable film for the whole family."
"sterrekooi","7","0","0","2 March 2006"," Disappointing, but nice.
","I was really curious to see this movie. I had been waiting for it for months, I had seen all the trailers, I had looked up every thing of information about it...And then the day came I got to see it. It was the 1st of December 2005. I went to the cinema with a couple of friends, expecting very much...well, I've got to say that I liked it very much, but it was also quite disappointing. The whole film, especially the beginning, went so fast, you could really see they had to hurry a bit with making it...it was really, as actress Emma Watson said, going like 'tsjaktsjaktsjaktsjak', the scenes didn't really fit together, they were all standing apart, if you know what I mean. But this got better in the second part of the film. I liked the second part better. The Yule Ball scene was awesome (it was really my favourite): I was really impressed by the beauty of the set, though I already had seen it in the trailers...Emma Watson, whom plays Hermione Granger, could be given the prize of 'Most Beautiful Girl of Hogwarts' Yule Ball', she really looked stunning in her beautiful pink dress. What can I say about Emma Watson: I am such a huge fan of her, so it's normal I'm prizing her, but she really HAD such acted in an outstanding way. I liked the line 'Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you' very much, it's such funny and nice. What I want to say about the three young lead-actors in general (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma) is that they've really grown up. Daniel is sixteen years old, Rupert is seventeen and Emma is fifteen. Remember the time they were only eleven! Such wonderful how a kid can grow up...they've also grown in their way of acting. Such very nice. As I said, I liked the second part of the movie better as the first part. The Task-scenes were quite spectacular, I thought the Dragon looked quite real (I know, dragons don't excist, but I mean real in the way of a real creature). It was quite exciting, and so were the other two Task-scenes. The maze-scene was very nice...well-acted, and scary...the graveyard scene was even more exciting and scary...and in a way quite moving, I don't know why...I thought Robert Pattinson, whom plays Cedric Diggory, acted like he was death really well, it was such scary! One of the last scenes, where whole Hogwarts is sitting in the Great Hall, and where Dumbledore is speaking about Cedric, was moving too. Then something about the director, Mike Newell. A month after I'd seen Goblet of Fire I saw 'Four Weddings and A Funeral', also directed by him. I thought this film was wonderful. I won't say it's better as Goblet of Fire (I can't help it, I'm a fan, though GOF was disappointing), but I will say that Four Weddings was just directed better. So we don't know: maybe Mike Newell's a better director for comedies. Overall, I thought this movie was very nice, moving, scary, funny...but also disappointing."

","I liked this movie, but I thought it missed some important things. For one thing, I think they ought to have said who killed Barty Crouch - they never did. They never said much about Karkaroff's dark mark, or do much with Hermoine and Krum. THose were a few of the major things. And I think they ought to have had Harry's godfather, Sirus, in the movie more. Otherwise, it's a great movie. It told all about the Triwizard tournament, the three tasks, and Daniel Radcliffe did a great job acting, I think. I especially like the part in the graveyard, with Wormtail and Harry. I think that the special effects were great too. The first Triwizard task is, I think, the best. It's quite thrilling to see Harry flying and trying to dodge fiery blasts."

","This is definitely the best Harry Potter Movie made. I hope the same director is doing the next one because he has done a great job. The movie starts kinda rushed. its like the first 5 chapters of the book done in 5 minutes.. but I guess thats alright, it slows down once they get to hogwarts. They had to skip a lot of course being such a long book, but you kinda of get the feeling its missing something. You don't really get enough of the characters just talking or being with each other, so you don't care about them all that much. This movie seems a lot easier to understand then the last one, for people who haven't read the books I mean. The special affects were really good and the humor they added is funny. The score is really good I might get the soundtrack. overall i'd say this is the best harry potter movie made yet."
"Jed_Smith","7","0","0","1 March 2006"," Something darker this way comes
","I've generally not been too thrilled with the Harry Potter franchise as I simply cannot connect with the story, but, at the behest of my other half I sat through it and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>While out of the storyline myself I found that this installment in the series was much more entertaining than the previous Harry Potter movies due to its sinister, dark nature. Being a sinister, dark person myself I find it easier to connect with such movies. The previous Harry Potter films felt childish, silly, and fun, while this one definitely grips you in several key spots.<br/><br/>At points sometimes grim, it might scare the younger among us, which is quite a large turn for the Harry Potter franchise -- which, generally, has been kid-friendly. That being said, a fine piece of work, and they're even starting to slip a little sexual tension in among the characters, which I knew was bound to happen sooner or later.<br/><br/>Another point: from watching the first couple of films I accrued a small image of Albus Dumbledore, and Richard Harris portrayed the character quite well. I felt his private, more lighthearted side and fondness for Harry came across very well on screen. With that in mind, the performance of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is a radical shift. His character feels a lot darker -- which follows in step with the movie, I suppose. However, at times he felt like a completely different character, and actually somewhat disconnected.<br/><br/>That said, nobody particularly stands out, but nobody falls short, either. An overall decent performance (personally I'd like to see more Snape; I'm a big fan of Alan Rickman).<br/><br/>A fine entertainer for the not easily-scared in your family."

The young actors have improved beyond belief - clearly they are taking their opportunity seriously. The special effects are just amazing. It is not possible to choose a particular scene which is better than the rest since they are all just terrific. I did like the dragons, though, and Harry's chase with the Hungarian Horntale was spectacular. The entrance of the Beauxbatons and Darmstrang pupils was just brilliant as was the Quiddich World Cup. Of course, with a book this long and a three hour slot, some bits had to go but, unlike Prisoner of Askaban which literally 'lost the plot', Mike Newell managed the virtually impossible task of keeping the story on course. In short, its hard to pick a particularly outstanding bit as it was all outstanding. From beginning to end it bowled along at a breakneck speed and I exited the cinema three hours later wondering where the time had gone. Lets hope they get Mike back for the finale!"

","Well, first of all, I really loved this movie. I don't know if it's because I really love Harry Potter, or if it was because it really was fabulous, or both. The acting I thought really improved. In PoA it seemed more of a laid back type movie. In the book series, it's really the first one that has a real basis of the over all plot, and is a little darker than the fist two. This is not saying that the other two were just sort of there, but you have to admit that the point of the first one was basically to introduce, and the second one was, hmmm, I don't know. But not to stray too far from the point, I thought that some of the scenes in Goblet of Fire could have been a little longer. For example, the graveyard and Quidditch world cup scenes. In the book the cup takes like, four freaking chapters. In the movie it's gone in like a blink of the eye. Same with the graveyard. Lord of the Rings is three hours long, why can't Harry Potter be that way? I know it doesn't matter if you put stuff like S.P.E.W. in or not, but it would seem better to maybe finish a scene properly. But hey, I'm no director.<br/><br/>The Dumbledore in this film (can't think of his name at the moment) is a little harsher than you would expect Dumbledore to act. He should be the calm one, laid back, but still give you the feeling that he knows everything, but doesn't have to tell you. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) was certainly better in this film than the last. And, I think he needs a haircut, ha ha. The guys at my school have shags, but for some people it just doesn't work. The other characters like Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George were pretty awesome. Fred and George are always my heroes, but maybe that's just because I'm a teenager. Hermione and Ron were pretty good, showing a different side to them than the other films."

","What a coincidence that the same time I was starting to lose interest in the Harry Potter books, the movies start to take the same nose dive off of their Quiddich Broom. The movie makers have created some amazing scenes, such as the Dragon chase scene, but the rest of the movie, as well as the plot, seems so tied together with what they can create they do not bnother to think whether or not they should create it. I must admit that I have only fallen asleep in one other movie in my life besides this one, but this one had me snoozing long before it was finished. I think JK Rowling needs to focus more on the quality of her books rather than the quantity of pages. That way I will only have to sit through 1 hour of her crap next time and not the full three hours she attempted to keep my eyes open."
"Robert_duder","10","0","0","24 February 2006"," Just incredible...taking this series to new heights
","Whether my opinion or not the Harry Potter franchise will certainly go down as one of the greatest series of films in history. I do believe that the series rivals Star Wars, or any other great film franchise in history. That being said I wasn't an enormous fan of the first two films which I haven't seen in some time but I remember not being overtly impressed. I can say that the films offer absolute breathtaking visuals and special effects unprecedented in a ""kid's film."" No one has ever ventured to make such a gutsy, mature fantasy adventure film series aimed at kids and teens and they score every time. Nonetheless I ventured to see the newest installment and was absolutely blown away!! Granted I did see it on the IMAX theater but I don't think that had much to do with it. The story was so much more mature, aimed at an entirely different and diverse demographic. The story was much more simplistic, easy to follow, the characters were fun and intense, and the entire film was breathtakingly perfect!! <br/><br/>By now Daniel Radcliffe should have the role of Harry Potter down to a finesse so that no other person could EVER be Harry Potter and I think he does that perfectly. He's the hesitant hero, the boy wonder that is humble, honest, torn apart by a mysterious past, soft spoken and a little awkward. He is the perfect adolescent hero. He seemed to really come into character into this one and performs the role flawlessly. I'm not sure as an actor he could do much else but for this role...it was made for him. Emma Watson also returns as the rather intense Hermione Granger. She is really the opposite sex of Harry Potter but the same idea. She is for the girls to follow. She's a little awkward, she's starting to grow up, date, learn new things...she's also quite good in her role although I think she has talent left untapped beyond Harry Potter. As long as the film makers steer clear of sexualizing her just because she's getting older than it'll be fine. Rupert Grint returns as the shy, and clumsy Ron Weasley. Together the three of them make a good team and good friends and each have a different side of adolescence set out which is good. They all have very distinctive characters and they all do a great job in their roles. They really have them down pat after four films. Most of the Hogwart's teaching staff all return as well Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and David Bradley. To really get into any depth about their characters or performances is kind of pointless. They are all great actors, most of them having been around for many years and they all fit into their roles in each installment and in this one as well perfectly. They are great!! <br/><br/>What truly sets Goblet of Fire apart from the others is the story. It's brilliant, non stop action and we finally lay eyes on a physical form of the evil Lord Voldemort, Harry's nemesis played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes. New director Mike Newell I must give the most credit too, taking the helm from Chris Columbus, and Alfonso Cuarón. Newell's approach is completely different and the film is far more mature and intense and takes the story so much further than ever before. I would even hesitate to bring young children to the film because it is that dark. But it does make it far more interesting for older children, teens and adults...widens the demographic right out and makes me edge of my seat for the next installment. The special effects are absolutely brilliant, they aren't shoddy CGI but rather brilliantly created from Hogwarts to each magic step of the Wizard's contest. I can honestly say that sometimes the acting was a little bit campy, some reactions and overly emotional moments. And the ending was a little bit cut and dry for the film that it was. Nothing was really wrapped up in the end...it would have been better to have left it hanging for the next installment but that's not the Harry Potter way and it's still the best of the series and an absolutely amazing adventure!! 10/10"

This movie was based on the 4th book of the series, where there are 3 Triwizard champions all from different schools. That is, until the Goblet of Fire spits out a 4th name, which is none other than Harry Potter! But who did it? Surly Harry couldn't have...you must be 17 or older to enter...was it an older student? A teacher? I know. I've Seen The Movie In Theatres 46 times. But I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who haven't. With an excellent plot, you must have excellent actors/actresses. With Harry Potter you get both. I feel so sorry for those Children whose parents do not approve. But I have something to help you out: The POPE himself, said that he recommends Harry Potter!

They cut the game quite short, but you at least get to see Victor Krum, an amazing player. But the camp is distrupted by Death Eaters, Vodomorts followers, so they have to get to school soon after the attack. But at least it has everything for the Tasks. When Harry Potter enters his fourth year, two other schools compete in the Triwizard Tournament, three difficult tasks, one student from each school in it. But, someone put his name in the cup of people entering, even though he was an under-age wizard. Now he has to compete in the three deadly tasks, with only his friends for hope.<br/><br/>This one is hilarious compared to the other three, and it shows the people and places in a new way."

","I believe that the director left too much out of this movie. The story line, of course if you are a good Harry Potter fan, is excellent, but so many good things were left out. He could have added more little facts and details instead of leaving it to the bare minimum. Take Doby for instance: He was a semi-important person in this movie and they left him out completely. I'm not trying to say it was a bad movie or anything. I think it was a very good movie, just not what it should have been. I hope they will use a different director on these next movies. The first director was the best in my opinion. If time was such a concern for this new director, than he shouldn't have taken on the task of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."

And not trying to sound to harsh cause i read the comment on the other page, But in movie two, Lord Voldemort looks completely diff. oh and another thing the game was no good ether.

","An awful adaption of Rowlings stunning masterpiece. Everything is far too unlike the book. I completely understand the crew's predicament. Trying to condense a 400 page novel into a movie is a difficult task, but they still could have made the movie a bit more like the book. Plot holes are like unavoidable craters in this film. Certain aspects of the film will only be understood by readers of the book's as they have previous knowledge. Movie-goers won't have a clue what is going on. The attempt to change Rowling's character's attributes crashed and burned and book fans will be able to distinctively see subjects and objects that are missing from the movie. I do though give credit to the crew for the effects and direction of cast but really should have focused more on the ""true"" detail of the movie through the book instead of adding extra nit-bits which were not needed in the movie."
"Mrs_Reilly0317","8","0","0","16 February 2006"," Funny, yet still slightly disappointing....
","I anxiously awaited the release of GoF (as it is more commonly known to the Book Fans), biting my nails hoping against all hope that it wouldn't turn out to be ANYTHING like the fiasco called Prisoner of Azkaban. Imagine my pleasant surprise when the movie started and the first reaction I get to have is laughter. Sure, the Dursley's weren't in this one, which was mildly disappointing. I was REALLY hoping to see Mr. Weasley blast the fireplace apart, or to see the bully Dudley rolling around on the floor with a four foot long tongue. For the most part I laughed, but there were a few moments when I wanted to go through the screen and literally strangle certain characters; like Dumbledore when he nearly knocked Harry to the floor after the names came out of the Goblet. Or when they kept mispronouncing ""Accio!"" (Sidenote folks): it's not pronounced Ack-E-O, it's Ah-C-O. Yes, I know, they cannot do everything by-the-book. But at least pronounce the words correctly. And please, please, I beg of the directors and producers....AND Jo Rowling too...tell Gambon to ease up some. Dumbledore is NOT a violent man and that is exactly how he is playing him. One part that had me in absolute stitches was in the scene where Harry (Dan Radcliffe) is in the Prefect's Bath trying to figure out his clue for the second task and out pops one of my favorite recurring characters, Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson). The way she cuddled up to Harry while he was in that Olympic sized bathtub had me gasping for breath! BRAVO Shirley! The part of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) was slightly more...what's the word I'm looking for....energetic then I expected. But he played the part so well, in my opinion, that it was a non-issue. There were many ""small"" things that were left out of the movie, that some of our more passionate book fans were angry about, but as for myself, being an avid fan of the books, I have to say this one is a definite must-see for the people who are fans of the movies alone."

","I am a huge Potter fan. I saw this movie at the midnight showing. Well worth the wait and money. Acting was great, and awesome cinematography. I felt the tension throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>Although I must say, having read Goblet of Fire several times, the movie does not stay as true to the book as I could have hoped. When Cedric died was brilliant. I thought that the director would have added a whole argument/fight scene between Cedric and Voldemort, but he stayed true to the cruel, quick death. And I must say, Daniel, Rupert, and Emma have all matured to be very well experienced Potter actors. Awesome!"
"sullibrandon","8","0","0","13 February 2006"," Another Good Harry Potter movie
","The movie was very well filmed. It showed amazingly well the problems of adolescence, and I can't tell you how many times people in the theatre were ""aaawwing"" and ""oooing"" when Cho couldn't go to the Yule Ball with Harry, or Ron gave Harry a look that rivaled with that of a Basilisk. The special effects were not especially spectacular, but they were very very cool. And the movie, although very dark and being the first in the series to be rated PG-13, was very humorous throughout, right up until the point where Harry, Cedric, Krum, and Fleur entered the final task by going into the hedge maze. The scene where Voldemort comes back was incredibly well done, and so was the scene where Harry and Voldemort's wands connect and the ghosts of Voldemort's kills come forth from his wand. I thought it could have used a little more dramatism. When Harry brings back Cedric with the Triwizard Cup Portkey, and he yells at everyone that ""Voldemort's back!!"" amidst cries of anguish over Cedric's death, the movie seemed to lack a little bit of the importance about how HORRIBLE Voldemort coming back was.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie was everything they cut out. Now, obviously, some things don't really need to be in the movie, and aren't that important. The scene that they cut out that annoyed me the most, however, was the Quidditch Cup. They showed the very beginning of it, and then once the Snitch was released by Cornelius Fudge, the movie cut straight to the Weasleys celebrating over the Irish's victory. This means that, for the first time in the franchise, there is no actual Quidditch playing in the movie. Undoutedly the biggest disappointment in the movie. They also cut out the entire subplot about Hermione's quest to free the house elves that make the food for Hogwarts. In the movie Harry only makes one trip into the Pensieve, whereas in the book he makes several. Also, in the book when Harry wins his million Galleons from winning the Triwizard tournament and gives it to Fred and George to open their joke shop......well, that's not in the movie. Hopefully they will mention it in number five.<br/><br/>If I went exclusively by how much they cut, I would give this movie a 4. However, it is a movie, and as a movie, it must be judged not by how much it cut from the book, but by its worth as a movie. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a spectacular movie in its own right, however, as a fan of the books, I must dock it little bit for being as unfaithful as it was to the book. Another reason I docked it points was because for someone who hasn't read the books, the movie might be a little confusing. The entire scene where Harry finds out Mad-Eye Moody is actually Barty Crouch is glossed over in a few minutes, entirely skipping the intricacy that the book shows us quite clearly. In the book we are slammed with the realization that Mad-Eye is Barty, probably one of the best endings to the Harry Potter books because of its sheer Sherlock Holmes/Sixth Sense type feel. In the movie it could be potentially confusing to someone who hasn't read the books. Another problem I have with the movie is that it is even shorter than the first movie, which doesn't really make sense, as the book is four times as long as the first one. Why are the filmmakers afraid to make a longer movie? The children fans of the series have proved that they can sit through a very long movie - why doesn't Hollywood trust them (and us) to sit through a three hour movie? We did it with Lord of the Rings, and many young kids went to see that too.<br/><br/>For any fans of the books, it is well worth the price of admission. Though be forewarned, you will be slightly disappointed by the amount they have cut off, if not completely disappointed. Goblet of Fire, in relation to the book, is a very good movie. Taken by itself, it is a very very excellent movie."
"adriankoh-1","7","0","0","13 February 2006"," Handsome on the eye, but missing much of the detail
","Devoted fans of J K Rowling's series, especially those erstwhile readers who absorb the tiniest of details and can quote from the book unseen, may be disappointed by the film.<br/><br/>True, the film delivers the essentials of Ms Rowling's story in spectacular style, but a lot of the nuances and sub-plots are lost in the great sweep of action.<br/><br/>The problem is that the book is just too long to be condensed into a two or three hour movie. Rowling wrote over 700 pages of narrative, packed with intricate detail, and so obviously some things had to go. This will be the same problem for the next two books and I'm sure the last one.<br/><br/>The good points: wonderful cast, old friends and new faces, amazing sets, incredible effects - lots more magic in evidence! - fabulous costumes, and a wonderful Voldemort as played by Ralph Fiennes. All in all a fantastic visualisation of the world created by J K Rowling.<br/><br/>The not-so-good points: creaky acting from the principals (sorry, Daniel - but he is improving); a sense of rushing through everything, which resulted in insufficient characterisation and the loss of many of the less important aspects of the central plot which had nevertheless added to the charm of the book.<br/><br/>I personally missed the boarding school feel of the earlier films. There were hardly any lessons featured and the staff (always a great joy for me) were essentially employed for a series of brief cameos. School had been taken over by this all-important tournament, for which sizeable contingents from other schools appeared to have deposited themselves at Hogwarts for the whole year! There are of course holes in the story that J K Rowling wrote in the first place: anyone will be able to list down pages of 'what ifs' and 'why didn't he's. (Why didn't Harry simply refuse to compete in the contest if he felt his life would be in danger?) Credulity is often overstretched, but the world created is so fascinating that we forgive and accept even as we turn the pages. On screen, though, these weaknesses are a whole lot more obvious.<br/><br/>And what about those viewers who come to the film without having read the book? There is a basic plot that can be followed, and the pictures on screen are pretty, but a lot may be incomprehensible; mainly because of the pace, but also because the Director does not bother to 'explain' from scratch. There is a clear assumption that the viewer 'knows something' about Harry Potter's world, and will adapt easily to port keys, disapparation and the latest batch of unforgivable curses. But for the uninitiated, there is scarcely a reference to the circumstances of Harry's scar, let alone its role in the plot. The viewer will simply have to pick it up later from somewhere else.<br/><br/>Yes, the camp site scenes are messy and lack clarity, and yes, the plot details are sometimes inadequately conveyed, and yes, characterisation and motivation is sometimes poor. But the atmosphere, the menace, the magical other-worldly feel - all these have been captured magnificently; in summary, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts: a good looking film with quality effects, peppered with interesting character cameos and an intriguing (even if illogical) set of challenges; and for this and the tribute it pays Ms Rowling, the film deserves an average to high product rating."

","I thought the movie was good, but not as an adaption of the book. Too much was left out. I understand the frustration of turning an 800 page book into a 2 1/2 hour movie, but felt that much of the storyline that flows into the next book/movie was omitted. The biggest issue for me was the change in Dumbledore's character. I think Michael Gambon is a great actor and I do like him as Dumbledore (although I miss Richard Harris). I understand that Mr. Gambon is acted the part as written, but felt the character is far removed from the one in the books. If you haven't read the books, you will like the movie; if you have read the books, try not to think about them and enjoy it for what it is: an action movie sort of based on a book."

It really kept you on the edge of your seat, never a dull moment...ever. I thought that acting was the best it ever has and that the actors themselves had made the film much easier to watch as a whole.

Not my goal to say this movie is bad but it is surely not unforgettable.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm too old, but nor the story, nor the characters inspire me. Harry is a bit dumb, not very focused on his schoolwork & has only his courage to admire. In that way, he's not such a good role model for young people. In addition, this 4th chapter has the usual scheme of the previous three and i feel a bit alienated of having to get back to school again.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the visual is stunning and it's a stroke of magic to have imagine such a coherent and intriguing universe.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie is more interesting than the book because the pictures deserves best visual things (a castle, a dragon) and in the same time less interesting because words are what make alive a character....<br/><br/>(Having seen the Yates' period, Newell was good in injecting a lot of humor and funny things and above all was better at directing the cast: for one time, Harry and his peers seems alive with their lines!)"
"The Mogul","8","0","0","6 February 2006"," A Real Entertainer: Perhaps the Best of the Series Thus Far
","In the wake of the two mediocre films that opened this franchise, the Prisoner of Azkaban, and now this one, have proved highly entertaining.<br/><br/>From the moment Hermione wakes Harry and Ron, we sense that these three have matured as actors; moments later a darkly atmospheric shot, which flies before them up a damp hill en route to who knows where, portends an exciting ride to come.<br/><br/>The fast-paced opening sequence is a real thrill, and the film's energy and atmosphere don't drop thereafter. Exciting mobile camera work is a factor, so are some fine effects: Lord Voldemort's dark mark is particularly cool, as is the shrivelled embryo of his body.<br/><br/>New characters are well cast; David Tennant's devilish Barty Crouch, Jr. leaves a real impression in his few moments on the screen, and Brendan Gleeson's performance as Mad-Eye Moody is show stopping. Some old hands also turn in excellent performances, Alan Rickman was always a casting coup as Professor Snape, and Shirley Henderson (Moaning Myrtle) is simply brilliant in her bathroom cameo.<br/><br/>That scene is a comic highlight, but there are quite a few chuckles to be had elsewhere. Most of these are at the expense of the lead trio's romantic fumblings; this adolescent love stuff is really well handled, both by the screenplay and by the lead actors.<br/><br/>There are plenty of IMDb comments bemoaning omissions in the adaptation from the novel: I for one wouldn't have minded seeing Hagrid's 'harmless' blast-ended screwts. However, does one really want to watch precisely what they have already read? The film stays true to the novel's spirit and that's the important thing. The film in no way offended my memories; it all felt very fresh and exciting.<br/><br/>I am prepared to make only two concessions to the purists, not because these flaws break faith with the book, but because they break faith with this and the other films.<br/><br/>Firstly, I agree that Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is a miscalculation. He comes across as dark and blustery rather than wise or avuncular; this doesn't follow from the previous films, and makes Harry's easy relationship with him more than a little unlikely.<br/><br/>The second galling mistake is the descent of the ball into an indie rock concert. However brief this moment is, and however great a performer Jarvis Cocker may be, it should not have happened; this is a horrible Hollywood cliché! It mightn't have been such a low point if the chosen tune wasn't so dreary.<br/><br/>Aside from these lapses in judgement, I really enjoyed The Goblet of Fire. Exciting, amusing, but with suitably dark corners, this is perhaps the best of the Potters thus far."

It does make me wonder what'll be forgotten in the 'Order Of The Phoenix' movie.<br/><br/>The cast have just improved so much since the beginning of filming the first film - they're much better actors, and you can feel a lot more empathy with the characters.<br/><br/>I don't agree with sexual references used in the film.

","I was blown out of my seat with this one. So many emotions were mixed into this film to make an excellent 4th HP movie. All the disappointments I had with the third movie were cancelled out with this one. Where to start! Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) has grown up so much since the 1st movie, and so has his acting. He is able to bring out his emotions on screen, especially at the end where sorrow is at it's highest. Rupert Grint (Ron) does his usual excellent comedy role and absolutely nails the jealous side of Ron as friction creates between him and Harry. Emma Watson (Hermione) does a great job, acting mainly as Harry's support in difficult times. Romance appears to be in the air with Harry falling for Cho Chang, Ron drooling over Fleur Delacour, and Hermione and Viktor Krum enjoying each others company. New characters include 'Mad-Eye' Moody,new DADA teacher, which is portrayed perfectly by Brendan Gleeson, Rita Skeeter,a reporter, who is reduced to causing a stir rather than complete havoc like that of the book, Igor Karknoff, head of Durmstrang, who seems to have a hidden agenda and Madam Maxime, head of Beauxbatons, who also is falling in love. Snape and Sirius appear briefly in the film. But it's not all fun and games for Harry and friends as the Tri- wizard tournament begins to be used as a killing attempt and Harry falls into grave danger.Who to trust when evil returns is a mystery.

However, there's still room for improvement. the character of dumbledore was altered for the worse. Gambon's a fine actor, but harris was better. this dumbledore was somewhat meaner and briefly manhandled harry after his name emerged from the goblet, which we know he would never do, as he told umbridge in book 5 when she caught harry running from his D.A. session and used Marietta for info. the dragon scene, good though it was, went rather overboard. some of the death eaters (lestranges)should have been introduced, they should have had some of the qudditch world cup game at least(i mean, that's the whole original reason they're at that field), most of the newspaper satire and S.p.e.w. were edited out, which do add somewhat to the story and give it more moral, which is a good reason why the book is so great. The graveyard scene, though good, needed the most work, because wormtail, who is a real coward and a whiner, hardly flinches when he cuts off his hand, and the scene was really rushed, as it left some gaps in the information that was necessary in the books, and voldemort is supposed to draw it out and savor his joy at being in his body again. although it missed numerous things, it's still very good."

","It was very good, it was brilliant, but it was a little undeveloped and a little rushed. Well, it is a very long book, so they had to pile a lot in. I understand. They did'nt want to make two films, but I would'nt have minded though. They could have done it, but they did'nt. Plus they did'nt let all new characters developed completely. So that's what I mean by ""undeveloped"" and ""rushed"".<br/><br/>But what I mean by ""very good"" and ""brilliant"" is that it really ""was"" a good film--you know it, too. I liked it because it was finally ""The Goblet Of Fire"". Finally this book was turned into a film, finally. The book was my favorite (okay, I did'nt read it, my brother told me ""everything"" about it when ""he"" read it). Yes, yes it was rushed and all but I really really liked it. So that what The Goblet Of Fire looks like as a film, hah. I wonder if J.K. Rowling would have liked it, well you don't know what you don't know. Even though the new characters of this film were'nt exactly developed, the actors and actresses did a very good job, every one of them.<br/><br/>So do I recommend this film for you? Yes, yes I do. Because if you see one ""Harry Potter"", you'll have to see them all. And plus this one is probably the most important of all of them so far. Yep, yes it is. So you ought to see it, people, even though it is a little ""undeveloped"" and ""rushed"". It is still a brilliant film."

","I have seen all the Potter movies,but in my opinion the story isn't continuing but repeating itself, of course it is a great cash cow but the hype that is created is better for the business then for the film fan. Probably it is good enough for kids. The fantasy worlds of this movie are sinister and dark, somehow like the puberty the cast is undergoing. The movie is trying to grow up with its marketing goal group and trades its wondering of the magic into the fear of darkness and dying. The story hicks in my opinion, some parts are overexposed but don't add anything to the story,some inspiring things stay unrevealed and are walked over. At the end of the movie you are directly invited to go to the next movie I must say, i have never read a book from Harry Potter, so i cannot say if it is accurate or different. A lot of people seem to be content by this package. Watch and see it for yourself."

","Harry Potter has always been my favorite books. But the movies are awful. The Chamber of Secrets and the Sorccers Stone those movies were OK not bad Chris Columbus did a fine job. But Alfonso Cuaron what was he drunk when he made that movie it sucked completely how stupid he screwed up everything it was stupid and confusing Harry got his broom at Christmas not at the end of the movie. And there were no shrunken heads either and the actors what happened to Tom the inn keeper it was very stupid in my opinion. The Goblet of Fire as not what I expected there were no house elves no Dursleys, not a lot of Severus Snape whom which is my favorite character and whom I love it was bad i guess Voldemort was good though Ralph Finness he played good.

"celticdafttimbhoy","10","0","0","21 January 2006"," Definatey the best film yet
","Basically, this is by far the best Harry Potter film yet in terms of action, acting ability and emotional detail.<br/><br/>First of all action, the first task scene with the dragon is fantastic, very well shot and realised. I loved the underwater scene as well, in which Daniel Radcliffe spent a hell of a lot of time underwater I can't remember exactly how long for, but again it's well shot and has you on the edge of your seat. The maze scene is a dark and menacing and you know that, even if you haven't read the book, something is lurking waiting for them.<br/><br/>In my opinion the best thing about this film is the way in which all the young actors go about handling their parts. Daniel Radcliffe has improved vastly since his first appearance in the leading role as a more angry confused young man trying to get to grips with all that is happening around him especially as he has to deal with death head on (although obviously he had to do that when his parents died but you can't help but think that he might have been too young to understand it fully at that time). Rupert Grint I'm pleased to say is so much better in this film as well. Don't get me wrong I didn't dislike him but I was hoping to see a broader side to his acting ability which was exactly what we got with a more moody jealous slightly immature Ron. Emma Watson too just seems to keep getting better and looking gorgeous in the Yule Ball scene as well. As for the others they all do well without exception. The adults in the cast are as reliable and solid as ever. Brendon Gleeson deserves a special mention for the fantastic portrayal of a eccentric Mad Eye Moody.<br/><br/>The Yule Ball scene is fantastic and well chorographed with all the extras dancing in perfect time. <br/><br/>In short this is a great film, and I already can't wait till the next one. Roll on Order of the Phoneix.<br/><br/>TJN"

","I loved this movie!!I was however a little disappointed that certain important things had been left out, like Winky for example and the Dursleys, BUT you can't compare the movie to the book, because you will be disappointed!! obviously they cant put everything in and I think no matter what they do people are never going to be happy with the result!! So not comparing the book to the movie I thought it was great, really good special effects, people always play a part way younger than they actually are so I think Daniel, Rupert, and Emma did a good job at convincing the public they were 14 year old!! and I can't wait for the next one!

"WannaKnow","10","0","0","18 January 2006"," Better than ever
","Great film. I knew it was going to be great because the book is great. Even they left behind some things of the book, the movie is still excellent, with all the story, characters, and special effects. And even people say that in any story, the book is better than the film, I think this film is as good as the book. Let me explain you the story.<br/><br/>Ron invites Harry to his home but Harry doesn't know why. In his house, he has a dream about Lord Voldemort and Peter Pettigrew, who is called ""Wormtail"" by Voldemort. Harry wakes up of this nightmare when, in it, Voldemort kills an old man.<br/><br/>But life continues, and Ron and his parents and brothers take Harry to the Quidditch Cup, and Harry, with Ron, his parents and brothers, and Hermione (who is also with them), sees a Quidditch match. In there Harry is told about a great Quidditch player (who is playing there), Viktor Krum. After the match, they return to their camping house. In there, they hear sounds and screams. They think that those are made by people celebrating, but in fact they're not celebrating, they are escaping. When they go outside the camping house, they see Death Eaters, followers of Voldemort. Harry tries to escape put he falls to the ground and passes out. When he wakes up, everyone's gone, and Harry sees someone making a spell to the sky. In the sky, a horrible sign appears. Harry learns that the sign in the sky is the sign of Voldemort.<br/><br/>In the school, Dumbledore says that a tournament will take place there, but only for students older than Harry's age. That means Harry can't be in the tournament. Not only Howarts is in the tournament, but two other magic schools. Even the tournament will be in Hogwarts, two other schools will be in the tournament. Only one student per school can be in the tournament. The Tri Wizard Tournament, called like that because only one student per school is chosen, and there are three schools playing.<br/><br/>They only get selected by putting their names in the Goblet Of Fire, a magic goblet. It selects one student per school, and that student is the one who will be in the tournament.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, they have a new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, the ex-auror ""Mad Eye"" Moody (""Mad Eye"" because he has a magic eye). Moody knows about Harry's scar, and he tells that Harry is the only person that have survived to the killer spell that Voldemort did to him when he was a child. The spell is Avada Kedabra.<br/><br/>The day arrives for the Goblet of Fire to tell which students will participate in the Tournament. Form Howgarts, it selects Cedric Diggory. Harry knows him, but he's older than him. From the other schools the Goblet of Fire selects Fleur Delaceur, and Viktor Krum (the Quidditch player). The selection is over. Dumbledore announces that the three wizards are selected, but, for no reason, the Golbet of Fire selects one more student, when it shouldn't: Harry Potter."
"nasser_alshawwa1988","9","0","0","17 January 2006"," A Great Achievement
","This review will be divided into two parts: the first part is a review of the movie as a standalone film (not based on a book) and the second part will refer to the book. So here we go:<br/><br/>Before watching this film, I was concerned. I thought (and I am sure others agree) that the second movie (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) was the best of the three Harry Potter movies, with a balanced mix of loyalty to the book, a great story, great acting and a set of visual effects that set some standards. I was worried that this would go down, like the third movie (Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban) as a rushed and seemingly unfinished adventure film. After watching Harry Potter's fourth adventure, all I can say is that it is a no contest. It is, fortunately, the best Harry Potter film to date, and that is saying something.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Harry Potter's fourth adventure. First of all, it must be said that there are three things that the movie does almost perfectly (note that ""almost"" does not mean that I found them lacking in some respect, but this word is mentioned because of the argument that nothing is ""absolutely perfect""). The first of these, and the most obvious as well, is the sheer scope of the film. I say it without any hesitation that the quality of the audio and visual effects can rival any of Peter Jackson's best films (I mean, of course, the Lord of the Rings trilogy) in that manner. It even gives all the Matrix films some good competition in the same aspect. Every single audio and visual effect was nothing short of stunning; from the Quidditch stadium to the lake in the Second Task, nothing failed to impress.<br/><br/>The second thing that the movie ""perfects"" is the mood. I found it difficult not to feel for the characters in their different situations. I went through so many emotions during the film; suspense, happiness, sadness and other different emotions. It was really strange. There were so many different situations, but you never feel that they are randomly placed just for variety, but they rather all fit in together to make up the content of the film. Each part of the plot, whether it is the somebody's death (one particular bit near the end of the movie is really surprisingly sad) or the rejoicing of a character, has its place. I also must say that Ron Weasly was extremely well-played by Rupert Grint. The best role I've seen played in a film. Ever.<br/><br/>The third thing that the movie does very well is the story. One of the people that came with me told me that the ending was expected: Harry Potter will win the tournament. Well, this part is true, but the Triwizard Tournament is not the main event. The main story is Voldemort gradually returning to power, and the events of this are supported by the Triwizard Tournament. I mean to say that the main story is ""cleverly disguised"" by the Triwizard Tournament, which appears to be the main event in the film, and the Tournament ""pushes"" the events of the gradual return of Voldemort to power. So, this is an impressive element in the film.<br/><br/>It is true that the prologue is rather brief and the events may seem lacking in a few parts, but that can be easily overlooked because of the many high-quality aspects in the film.<br/><br/>Now for the second part of my review. It is obvious that those who read the book are put at an advantage here. There were many events that were unfortunately excluded. The Quidditch World Cup Final match would have been nice to see. The Sphinx in the Third Task; where was that? I thought that the Third Task was ruined in the film. The maze isn't that big. Also, for a maze this big, you would expect more traps than bushes that close in on you! You might understand that some parts may have been deleted since this is a film, and not everything from the book may be included, but then you see that there is some sort of biting licorice? Where did that come from? Also, the battle with the Horntail is unnecessarily long. Harry and the dragon did not go around the school in the manner portrayed in the film. It was a simple process of ascending really high and then swooping down to grab the golden egg, which I am sure that the movie makers (seeing the other effects in the film) are able to make more exciting than it sounds. If the movie was made one half of an hour longer, many more things could have been added, such as Harry's stay in the Burrow at the beginning of the story, or even some more of the lessons.<br/><br/>Another thing must be pointed out: not all of the characters were portrayed in the movie in the same way in which they were portrayed in the book. Fleur, who is supposed to be snobbish, is rather a naive girl in the film. Mad-Eye Moddy seems to be clumsier and more of an occasional joker in the film, while he is portrayed, in the book, an impressive character. Cedric was portrayed,in the book, as a collected character, not one who spreads shrewd smiles around.<br/><br/>Still, the movie gets the main plot and the story right, and that is mainly what really matters. And while the movie was amazing, I admit it could have been more. Still, it is an impressive accomplishment.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 Watch It!<br/><br/>Assalamu 3alaikum"

","This time i was surprised with the result that WB gave me. And again, i say that i don't care how much was cut out of the original book. I am taking this as a film, not as an adaptation. Yes, this one definitely is darker and more adult, bet are they going to say that before every HP movie? Of course, but with time it will stop working, and HP will be making barely 300 000 000 dollars, because this film was already PG-13, which is pretty silly, because HP is already a kids classic, and now it is stolen by an attempt to attract more people to the theaters. I would call that a brutal attempt to make extra $$$. But, dammit, it works! Now, i will tell you why this film could disappointing for those, who also take this as a film - first of all, the acting. It's not really terrible, but it's not convincing. And how D. Radkliff got to one of the top spots of the IMDb ""Best And Worst Polls of 2005"" as best actor, is beyond my understanding. It is just impossible for 16 year old to play a 14 year old! YOU CANNOT FAKE PUBIRTY!!! Radkliff should have understood it. The same goes to the other actors. And now we come to the special effects. Same old, same old, one year CGI, which will seem really crappy after a few years or so. And again, this is just an entertainment movie, that definitely overrated and taken far too seriously."
"harryzgurl519","10","0","0","16 January 2006"," the best movie of all time!!!!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is easily my favorite film of all time. The special FX, the acting, the musicalmost everything was superb. I only had a major problem with Michael Gambon, who plays Dumbledore. His interpretation of Dumbledore is appalling; he is just a headmaster, and almost violent (like when Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire), he's not the Dumbledore that Richard Harris was. If I had my way, Gambon would be sacked immediately. He actually said in an interview that he hasn't read the books, and he has no interest; he just reads the script and does what he's told; there's no interpretation. Basically, he's just in it for the money; people like that shouldn't acting, because acting is interpreting something to make it your own performance. But enough about Gambon; the rest of the movie was terrific. Patrick Doyle wrote one of the best musical scores I've ever heard. Mike Newell took Steve Kloves's screenplay and worked wonders with it; he is the first actually accomplished director this series has seen, and it shows. The FX were wonderful, good enough to rival those in King Kong. The acting was superb, ten times better than in Prisoner of Azkaban. Rupet Grint and Emma Watson were great, even better than in the first three films. Brendan Gleeson was perfect as the eccentric Mad-Eye Moody; David Tenant was excellent as Barty Crouch Jr. Alan Rickman, as Snape, was great, as always. Jason Issacs was excellent, as he always is, as Lucius Malfoy. Katie Leung was great as Cho; Miranda Richardson was hilarious as Rita Skeeter; and sadly, we see very, very little of Gary Oldman, who was great in Prisoner of Azkaban. But my favorite performances were by Timothy Spall, as Wormtail (perfect choice!), Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory (he was charming, and handsome, and it was heart breaking to see him die near the end of the film!). Daniel Radcliffe, who actually had himself cry to film the heartbreaking scene when Cedric's body is brought back to Hogwarts, was superb. His acting has improved so much over the years; he was absolutely amazing. But, as much as I loved Daniel Radcliffe's performance, the performance that stole the movie, and, in my opinion, the greatest performance by any actor, of all time, was Ralph Fiennes as the evil Lord Voldemort. The makeup and digital effects combined with Fiennes's sinister performance made the graveyard scene absolutely terrifying for me to sit through; he was better here than even in Schindler's List! If any actor deserves an Oscar for best actor, it would have to be Ralph Fiennes (unfortunately, the snobs at Hollywood fail to acknowledge true magic like the entity that is Ralph Fiennes these days). Forget about Brokeback Mountain; Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best movie of the year."

I did find the movie to be a little rushed and I'm sure if i had not read the book previously, i would be a little confused at some parts. Nonetheless, i enjoyed it thoroughly. The special effects were amazing, especially during the three tasks. The dragon scene was remarkably done. The overall theme has definitely changed and that appears obvious during the first scene of the movie.

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the darkest, most tragic Harry Potter movie yet, and it makes it all the more enjoyable. In this film, Harry finally meets Lord Voldemort face to face. I must say I was very pleased with this entry in the Harry Potter series. It was done just right. When Alfonso Cauron took over for Chris Colombus with the third film, he screwed up the style, but now Mike Newell brings the style back to its roots.<br/><br/>As you would expect, a huge amount of the book has been cut out, but Mike Newell did a great job deciding what needed to stay, and what could go. He still makes a great film out of what he has. I was a bit disappointed that the Dursley's were cut out, but it's only a minor flaw.<br/><br/>The performances, as always, are great. Brenden Gleeson is great as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and Ralph Fiennes' three minute role as Lord Voldemort is well worth the wait. This is the perfect example of what a Harry Potter film should be.<br/><br/>8/10"
"johnnydeppsfan","10","0","0","13 January 2006"," Great film in general, Pretty good adaptation
","I thought this was a great movie. I may be biased, however, since Mike Newell is one of my favorite directors. If you had never known, read, saw, or heard anything about Harry Potter before in your life and went to see this movie, you would think it was just a great movie with humor, suspense, action, some romance, and tested friendships. I mean, if you figured out all that Voldemort stuff, ya' know?<br/><br/>This adaptation focused mainly on the Tri-Wizard tournament, which is the main focus of the book, but still could've included a crucial sub-plot (which was cut for time) about Hermione and the house elves. Anyone whose read the books knows who and what i'm referring to, and no that was not a spoiler at all.<br/><br/>The character development in this movie focused mainly on Harry, of course, and Ron. They showed Hermione's physical transformation from the other films, but not her personality. Overall, the movie was great and included so much chemistry between the characters and a lot of comedy to my surprise. I laughed at this movie more than some comedies from this year. if you are willing to go to the movie for length reasons, it is a great one to go see, or wait for the DVD soon. Have a great time!"

","It goes without saying that the movie's details will be minimal compared to the book, unless the movie were to be 6 hours long. But why the screenwriter, and especially the director chose to eliminate so much of Rita Skeeter, Sirius Black and the whole of the Privet Drive sequences in favour of calculated and unsuccessful pseudo-ominous close-ups meant to instill fear (they did NOT), a huge dragon-flying sequence in the Triward tournament, and way too much footage of the dance (BORING) is a question I beg to ask them. And what is with Dumbledore?!?!! First, he looked totally manic and not at all in character. A man of his power and intelligence would not be running around in a tail-spin like a frantic house-frau in a very ill-fitting blue dress! What were they thinking?!

","It would be impossible to film the whole of the book in one movie. It would end up being a trilogy, however people have still been moaning that there was heaps missed out. All I can say is thank goodness the Quidditch world cup was glossed over. There is only so much Quidditch one can take. I actually found the last movie left more important stuff out. I had to explain to my husband a few details last time but this time he said he got the gist of it but found that not a lot happened (Which is true I suppose).<br/><br/>The CGI was great, there we lots of laughs and some scary moments (mainly I felt scared when Harry was up on the roof, damn I hate heights). It was also sad and for little kids it would be pretty terrifying. Voldemort looked pretty much how I had imagined him which was cool. All round well worth the watch. :)"
"groovichick232","8","0","0","12 January 2006"," Finally, A Harry Potter film that does the book justice!
","Ever since the age of 11, I have been a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter books (Im registered on probably 20 fansites and read the books 30 times. each) and went seeing the first film with an open mind. I thought it was quite impressive with strong performances from Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson, (Hermionie) even when they had to say such squirmingly awful things ('holy cricket!') but there two things that really annoyed me- Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and the script.<br/><br/>To be honest, I feel quit sorry for Daniel. Harry is quite an ordinary character and it would be extremely difficult to play him without looking overly fake, or just plain wooden. And with the combination of the piece of garbage (i.e. the overly-americanised script that was once J.K Rowling's work of art- no offence Americans, but its a British book!) he gave a poor performance.<br/><br/>It got worse with the 2nd and 3rd films. The scripts became even more cheesy and the acting became even more awkward (again, partly wasn't Radcliffe, and at times, Grint's fault as their voices were breaking, which made them sound even more robot-like) and I am sure fans of the books screamed in horror at how much the books had been warped. The films might have well been called 'Daniel Radcliffe, some other British kids and these pretty visuals that I am going to use in attempt to hypnotise you into liking this film'.<br/><br/>But, in November 2005 our prayers were answered as we were given a decent Harry Potter Film! Now, a strong point in all the films has been special effects and this film is no exception. The dragons were exactly how I imagined them and the lake scene sent a shiver down my spine- it was so haunting. My favourite scene was the yule ball- The way they transformed the Great Hall was magical! The thing that really stood out in this film was how fast paced it was. Usually the film spends a good 10 minutes at the Dursleys' house but in the Goblet of fire, you feel afraid to blink in case you miss something! It wasn't until the 1st task that the film started to slow down. It was a refreshing change to the films.<br/><br/>Ceratin acting performances have always been good but I felt everyone in this film gave a great performance. The person who really stood out was-who would have guessed?- Daniel Radcliffe. I noticed -but maybe this was the script, which by the way I felt had greatly improved- he was much less wooden, and he managed to portray emotion on his face, and he gradually got better at this as the film went on. His best acting performance-I think- to date was after returning with Cedric-now dead- from the graveyard and started crying. And thats when I started crying, partly because its an emotional scene, partly because the very attractive Cedric had died, but mostly because Radcliffe gave such a heartfelt, honest performance. I felt like standing up and clapping in the cinema. I can now say: THANK GOD! THAT BOY HAS LEARNT HOW TO ACT! You'll be happy to know I went home and danced around my J.K.Rowling shrine and thanked the gods for the best Harry Potter film so far! Well....I would have done....if I had a shrine."

","I know that to put the whole book into the movie would mean that it would go on for hours and hours but I was quite disappointed at how much they cut out.

I don't know why but i think that Durmstrang academy was a co-ed school in the book. The maze in the tri-wizard tournament was well done but it wasn't how I imagined it.

"aznfilmbuff","8","0","0","10 January 2006"," A Disappointing Movie
","I've seen GoF about 4 times now. If there is one word to describe this movie, it would be DISAPPOINTING. Don't get me wrong, judged on its own merits, this GoF is a good, though not memorable, movie. However, to judge this movie means to take it in its proper context as a Harry Potter film in the Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>This is the first HP movie of the four that I think FAILED to live up to the hype and general spirit of the books. Even the first two movies, for all its pandering to a childish audience and pedestrian emotional depth, was able to convey the essential innocence, wonder and curiosity that dominates Harry's experiences in the first two books. Each successive time I saw GoF I hoped my disappointment would wane only to be disappointed again. Others have expounded on where the movie went right. So where did the movie go wrong? First, GoF was missing the richness of the magical world. GoF is shot in a realistic style, eliminating nuances such as the moving pictures and the ghosts. However, of the books, Goblet serves as the ultimate showcase for the magical world. Both the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament set this segment of the series in a grandiosely fervent environment equivalent to that of the World Cup, the Olympics, and the Super Bowl. Because the film is shot to make everything seem ordinary, the audience misses the pageantry of the magical world at its best.<br/><br/>Second, the movie is very, very choppy. The transitions from scene to scene and in many cases even the dialogue between characters seem rushed. Examples include the end of the film when Dumbledore says the ""what is right vs what is easy"" line in response to Harry's description of priori incantatem and when Harry consoles Hermoine's solemn ""things are going to be different"" line with a sarcastically simple ""yes"". There is the abrupt end to Harry in Winter and the uselessness of Ginny's ""don't be so mean"" right before the Second Task. Lines and scenes just don't fit together.<br/><br/>Third, certain relationships and character traits in the film are not developed well. Among the missing - 1) upon meeting the Diggorys, the conversation regarding Quidditch from the previous year would have better shown Cedric's humility, 2) Hermoine helping Harry with Accio before the First Task would have shown how much more magical learning he requires in comparison to the other Champions (and after all Hermoine is Harry's other best friend not Neville), 3) Draco's sharp wit isn't evident in his insults and he's portrayed as comic relief."

The book itself is the biggest up to now - introducing a lot of knowledge about the wizarding world.<br/><br/>The film (there was enough stuff to do 2) reduced the book to action sense after another. Harry Potter flying for minutes (was it to sell a console game ?!) as we have never seen before - OK there are quidditch matches in every film - but [...]<br/><br/>They could instead have shown a bit more about the houseelfs (S.P.E.W, winky & Dobby), the Bulgarian mascot, the silencing of Rita Skeeter, the death eaters terrorizing they world, paid more attention to detail (moody's trunk is different and what use is a locked item, if any graduated wizard simply can open it? ).<br/><br/>So as a conclusion i would have loved more story and more detail about the world of Harry Potter (muggle or magic alike)."
"garboventures","4","0","0","10 January 2006"," Disappointing and lacks Cuaron's magical vision
","I had high hopes for this latest instalment of the Harry Potter series, most especially after the superlative production of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with Alfonso Cuaron at the helm. Cuaron's film was a genuine cinematic treat, often visually stunning, darkly atmospheric, strongly-acted, emotionally satisfying with a realistic central theme charting Harry's personal growth and his evolving sense of identity. Emma Watson was excellent here as Hermione, and her scenes with Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), most particularly during the brilliantly directed Time Turner sequence were a stand-out. There were multiple visual clues, gags, motifs, clever filmic transitions to delight during this film, ensuring a multi-layer narrative - more than mere popcorn action and trite adherence to the book. <br/><br/>As for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - everything I can say about Cuaron's film cannot now be said. Indeed, it is an almost complete reversal. The film is not as impressive visually - indeed, it borders on dull and plodding. The brooding darkness first instigated by Cuaron is still apparent, but has been dimmed to an oddly greenish, medieval hue which pervades throughout. Cuaron's palette was more blues and greys and silvers, to often startling effect. Newell's dank colours stifle and subdue the film. There is abundant use of silver at the Yule Ball, but even this episode lacked vitality I felt, which is a big shame as Newell was most surefooted when tackling material which pertained to the teenage angsty relationships - basically human interest stuff was handled pretty well, and often to mildly comic effect. As a result, Rupert Grint as Ron, and Matthew Lewis as Neville, came off best in this production. I have not been impressed with Grint in particular in former films, but here he put in a strong performance - I guess Newell was more secure and at ease in handling Grint's major material.<br/><br/>The same could not be said for Emma Watson, who was shrill and annoying - much more so even than her character Hermione who can herself be hugely irritating in the book (albeit lovable). Gambon's hysterical Dumbledore was quite dreadfully overplayed - in Cuaron's version Gambon just about managed to maintain an even keel - here, Newell allowed him to melodramatically fall overboard. In truth, precious few performances had much to recommend themselves. Maggie Smith was competent as always, ditto Rickman's Snape (although horridly underwritten). Barty Crouch Snr and Jnr were much less effective (this saddens me as fan of David Tennent). Gleason's Mad Eye Moody was a wasted opportunity, and his eye decoration was simply ludicrous and not in the least bit disturbing.<br/><br/>The narrative flow was episodic and clunky. The early stages of the film actually dragged: The World Cup debacle resulted in a completely disproportionate and unwarranted apocalyptic landscape, the introduction to the TriWizard tournament was wrecked by egregious over-acting from Dumbledore. Events mildly picked up during parts of the tournament itself, and the dragon sequence was particularly impressive. The bathroom scene with Moaning Myrtle was well-done (again, back into safe semi-comic Newell territory) and although much was lost from the original which would have boosted the suspense factor considerably, the maze had its moments. The final graveyard sequence, however, was OTT rubbish, almost completely devoid of suspense and emotion. I had looked forward to the recreation of Voldemort, but this was one hell of a letdown. Fiennes deserved better.<br/><br/>I did wonder though if Newell had been slightly handicapped by the book too in this respect - the evocation of Voldemort was always going to be tricky to handle. Perhaps Cuaron was lucky in not having to handle this aspect of Harry Potter at all - events, fears were grounded in reality - and frankly the Dementor's kiss, and indeed, the ghastly spectral Dementors themselves, feasting on our fears and phobias, are probably the most frightening inventions in the entire series to date. Voldemort is a bit too much of a cartoon figure - the personification of evil is probably better left unstated, left to the imagination, the subjective. As a mind-possessing force in the next instalment (The Order of the Phoenix), Voldemort is more sinister, more terrible. Perhaps then we will get a better film."

","By Keki Tognetti<br/><br/>""Remarkable, breathtaking, fabulous, two thumps up, best one yet."" These are just a few phrases expressed by millions of Harry Potter moviegoers nation wide. I come to find myself on the same boat and completely agreeing with them. On a personal note, I would like to disclose that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is super-calo-frago-listic-espi-ali-docious (meaning it's too brilliant for words to express).<br/><br/>J.K Rowling's fictional characters return this time as fourth year students in Hogwarts School of witch craft and wizardry demonstrating maturity, intelligence, bravery, true friendship, and the affects of teen puberty and raging hormones. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is marvelously directed by Mike Newell, and joined by cast members Daniel Radcliffe who plays the leading role as Harry Potter the boy who lived, Rupert Grint playing Harry's faithful best friend Ron, and Emma Watson the expertise magic-using witch.<br/><br/>The long awaited film graced fans everywhere on Friday, Nov. 18; the waiting lines to get into the movie extended throughout the theatre and out onto the pavement streets, no complaints made by fans though, as they were in an ecstatic mood fixing their cloaks and drawing their thunderbolt scars precisely at the right spot on their forehead. <br/><br/>To no one's surprise the movie made an estimated $101.4 million in its first three days. The film came through with an appealing darker mood that switched the lighthearted tale of a young wizard boy to the angst of young love and defying death challenges. Harry's once again put to the test by his enemies, he comes face to face with Voldemort, while at the same time he is taunted and put through life threatening challenges. <br/><br/>This is truly the best installment in the Harry Potter movie series."

The overall mood simply appeals people age over 20, and nothing to do with ""darker"" tone, but the quality of cinematography and direction. Unfortunately the special effect is ""Tim Burtonish"" rather spoils this film's ambitions to be more grown up.<br/><br/>The lead star, Daniel Radcliffe, improves on every installment while his co-star, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint provided some limited, but good performance. The movie itself may spook kids under 10 years old, but not enough to put scare on grown ups, Voldemort is simply only scary by its looks not emotionally.<br/><br/>This movie ans very entertaining and still remain consistent with overall quality, but the filmmaker could have been a little farther and take advantage of PG-13 even more.

","Yeah... this movie ought to have been two parts. When I heard they were originally planning to do it as two movies, I celebrated and danced about my pile of Potter paraphernalia in an orgy of movie bliss. When I found out later that they had decided to cut it down to one film, I sighed and lamented all the cool sub-plots that would undoubtedly be left out of said movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for us movie goers and Pot-heads, this film seemed to contain naught but sub-plots. It delivered powerfully and accurately the tension between Harry and Ron, and the budding relationship between Ron and Hermy. The special effects were excellent, and offered superb imagery to some of the less focused upon aspects of the book (say the second task?). But as I said, this focus on the subtler points of the book leaves behind a very important element: the overall plot of the book. The writer took some incredible liberties with the story (introducing Barty Crouch in the first scene? That was a... surprise.) So much so that watching the movie only vaguely reminded me of reading the book. I remember in reading the book feeling a profound attachment to ""Mad Eye"", as an incredibly sympathetic and supportive character. In the movie he came out just sort of creepy. In the book, Sirius had an important part. He was barely involved in this film. What happened to the whole Hermione capturing Rita Skeeter? What about Fudge parting ways with Dumbledore? For that matter what about everything that actually happened in the third task? Krum being Imperiused and using the Cruciatus curse on Cedric and Fleur? All the elements of the fourth book that set up important parts of the fifth book... The alienation between Dumbledore and the Ministry, the death of Sirius, who is supposed to be Harry's substitute father figure? I just don't understand how this will quite fit in the grand scheme of things. <br/><br/>But gaping plot holes aside, I still think the movie was stilted and uneven. It seemed to flow at times, and other times it seemed slow and dragging. It was difficult to watch and left me feeling unfulfilled. I would have been much happier with a stripped down, accurate version of the plot, or better still with two separate movies, where the sub-plots and undercurrents the writer seemed so enamored with could have been brought to full fruition, while preserving the integrity of the main story line. As it was, the product that was delivered was disappointingly garden variety. Six out of ten, at best."

","I have now seen each of the Harry Potter films once, and never read the books. I have no desire to ever read the books, and if I ever see the movies again it will only be because some woman makes me (or if I have kids, but presumably they will have new movies by then). I say this as a way to explain my review, because my opinion will be different from a fan of the books.<br/><br/>The best film in the series so far is the third one. And judging the fifth one by the director, I do not think we're going to see any change on that status for a few years. But this is the fourth film (the second worst behind part two) so let us discuss this one.<br/><br/>This is the story of Harry Potter and the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry and three other wizards (including a hot French chick and a Bulgarian built like a brick scat-house) must face three dangerous missions. The subplot is that Harry, Ron and Hermione are now entering puberty and adolescence and want to start dating people. Only Harry has no self-confidence and Ron comes off being more scared of women than anything else. Hermione easily finds a date, and the bewitching hour is soon upon us.<br/><br/>The best part of this film was the introduction of Ralph Fiennes, who decided to play the role of Lord Voldemort rather than film ""Maid in Manhattan 2: Back in the Bronx"". Fiennes is a truly gifted actor, and he will bring some needed talent to the future pictures (with all due respect to the great Alan Rickman). I also enjoyed the special effects -- the creators of this film used them as much as possible without overdoing it. They assisted the plot rather than the plot assisting the effects. Too many films make this mistake, and I am glad this was not one of them.<br/><br/>So why do I rank this the second worst of the first four? Because if I were to chart the climaxes of this film on a chart, it would look like a heart monitor of someone with a normal heartbeat: every so often a brief problem would arise and a quick solution was found. Nothing ever is given time to build up. And the end is worst of all -- rather than taking what should be the key moment to hype up the story, it just fades off into a happy cowboy-in-the-sunset scene. I was left completely unfulfilled and felt like the vast majority of this movie was filler between the third and fifth films, because almost none of the things in this movie will matter for the remainder of the series. But maybe you like to be unfulfilled, maybe you are a movie masochist.<br/><br/>The fifth one comes across as even more of a bridge, though, making this one seem better in hindsight. And the inclusion of Robert Pattinson is sure to please a particular group of people, even if his role is not as major as it should have been (though at this point, who knew)."

For example I was really looking forward to seeing the sphinx who riddled Harry but instead Harry and Cedric simply ran through and grabbed the cup. I'm really disappointed with the new Dumbledore as he lacks the wise and respectful approach that the old Dumbledore had (excuse me i cant remember actors names)I didn't think Malfoy was shown enough or Snape and the idea of quidditch seems to have slowly gone out of the window.

","I was a bit disappointed by the fourth installment of the Harry Potter series. As an avid reader of the books, there were quite a few things missing from the movie, and they got under my skin.<br/><br/>For instance, in the movie, Harry is given Gillyweed by Neville. As all book readers know, Dobby the House-Elf gave Harry the gillyweed right before the task. Moody (in the book) later comments that Neville should've mentioned it because he gave him a book on Herbology at the beginning of the year.<br/><br/>One very memorable moments in the book, is sort of dismissed in the film. From my understanding of the text, Harry and Cedric walk a certain distance until they get to the grave. In the movie, they simply arrive there, and Voldemort and Wormtail are out of sight. Cedric's death was also highly disappointing. There was no drama or emotion, just ""PLOP"", he's dead, let's move on.<br/><br/>I felt the film didn't need a PG-13 rating, as there was nothing overly scary or emotional.<br/><br/>I hope the next movie doesn't blow as much as GOF did."

","Honestly, I do not see where the praise for this movie comes from. I found the acting decent, the direction sloppy, the effects adequate, and the screenplay horrendous. It more or less fell into every trap the film version of ""Azkaban"" did.<br/><br/>I do not request that everything from the books make it into the movie. It is impractical and much of it would slow down the pacing the director was obviously looking for. But there were many important events in the movie that are simply never explained. This movie has plot holes through which you could fly a dragon. And watching the attempts in the sequels to patch up the stuff they have messed up in this and ""Azkaban"" would be interesting, if I cared to ever watch any more movies in the series. Some other facts are either skimmed over or given dumbed down explanations that save time now, but will be costly in the even longer stories to come.<br/><br/>While interpretation of books will always be debatable, I could not help but find certain characters to be off the mark. Nobody major, just characters like Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, and Ralph Fienne's Dark Lord. Gambon did some things in the movie that Dumbledore from the books would never do. And the Dark Lord seemed like a hyperactive child instead of the calculating dignified character I expected not only from the books, but the first movie as well. Christian Coulson in ""Chamber of Secrets"" came off as more mature than Fienne's performance, and he was portraying a teenager.<br/><br/>It was not all bad, however. The portrayal of the young characters' teen angst is fairly well captured, especially at the Yule Ball which comes off with style and aplomb. It appeared that this was the director's prized scene as it is about the only one that has any heart to it.<br/><br/>I can see the entertainment value for the under-8 crowd who do not care about plot and characterization, but like seeing those flashy special effects with which the movie hits you over the head. But as someone with high standards like, ""wanting their movie to make sense"", and ""wanting the movie to stay true to the important points of the source material"", I can only say that I want my $6 back."

","I must say that I think this movie is definitely better than the worst HP movie (Chamber of Secrets), but overall still flops.<br/><br/>*** POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD *** I think this may be the best adapted HP movie, in that it doesn't feel haphazardly thrown together, like the last two seemed at times. The adaptation is actually done well, making the 750+ page novel into a workable 2.5 hour film, good enough for non-readers. But lets be honest, how many people who see the HP movies aren't familiar with the books? Some stupid changes from the book are: 1) The utterly pointless changing of the seats Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys have for the Quidditch World Cup. I fail to see any reason for this change, but I guess it's nitpicking. 2) The complete rewrite of the role in the plot played by Barty Crouch Jr. I understand the need to trim from the intricate plot, but this was a poor decision IMO. 3) The undercutting of the famous ""veritiserum"" chapter. Nothing explained, nothing settled. Also, Dunmbledore acting EXTREMELY out of character, not to mention the fact that the film doesn't even try to set up the struggle between Dumbledore and the Ministry which is a central theme in Order of the Phoenix. 4) This is just a personal irk, but the whole tongue flicking from Crouch Jr was extremely stupid and campy.<br/><br/>However, I feel the biggest flaw this film has is RAMPANT and FLAGRANT miscasting and poor performances. The number of poor casting decisions are numerous: Madam MAxime, Karkarov, Moody and Crouch Sr, all are poor casting decisions, because they neither act nor look like how Rowling describes them. Crouch Sr is almost a parody of Stan LAurel, a far cry from the character Rowling created.<br/><br/>Poor performances include the list above. Moody is the least worst of the bunch, but he still is fat and bald, two things Rowling's Moody was not. Also, the horrific performance of Wormtail continues to be offensive, as he is neither sniveling, or groveling enough, far too eager to help Violdemort, not at all seeming as though he is afraid of his actions results. IN the scene where Voldemort is reborn, the gusto with which Wormtail performs the dark ceremony is so far out of character, it's stomach-churning.<br/><br/>However, the absolute worst performance in the film is the travesty perpetrated by Michael Gambon. I was skeptical of his replacing the late Richard HArris (who seemed like Rowling created Dumbledore with him in mind) in PoA, but he didn't offend too much in that film. However, the performance here of a rattled, screaming, confused Dumbledore, ready to throw Crouch Jr to the Dementors is so far removed form the actual character that I could not stand it. Gambon is an amazing actor, but he is NOT the actor for this role. His performance is so offensive, I found myself wanting to scream during the film.<br/><br/>That said, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson do amazing jobs. And Dame Maggie Smith as always, is amazing.<br/><br/>Another problem I have with this film is the pace feels very frenzied, particularly when it comes to Voldemort. While I feel Ralph Fiennes in general did a fine job in his performance, he was nowhere near as cold or as bored as Rowling describes Voldemort. And the opening sequence, is beyond frenetic and if you blink, you'll miss it. Also, where were all the Death Eaters? I seem like I'm complaining a lot, but I did like this film overall, but it only barely manages to overcome it's flaws."

","I was amazed, seeing the film. Result: It was horrible. I know the book and in my opinion the filmers failed to bring it on the screen. That sounds hard, but they looked only for (very good) special effects and not on the story. Please: Next time read the book and then making a film. Of course it was difficcult to reduce the story to filmlength, but a lot of little things, you can easily read in the book, were ignored or turned into something else. For people haven't read the book it isn't better. The film is hurrying up to get all in and you have no chance to check what's the story. Sorry that wasn't a good work. I hope the filmers will do better with the next book. Of course it's more difficult, because this book has more story than the goblet. Please read it first!!!"
"lakemagenta84","5","0","0","2 January 2006"," disjointed, worst so far.
","Lets face it, the movies are catering for the non-readers so lets get rate the movie and not the book.<br/><br/>of course Dumbledore had to start being mean to Harry in this movie because Dumbeldore treats harry badly in The Order of the Pheonix so they had to start introducing that attitude now.<br/><br/>I do believe however that this movie has caused big problems for the next director, How will the next director deal with Rita Skeeters role as an animagnous being blackmailed by Hermione? as Rita was never exposed at the end. This means that Luna Lovegrove will be of little importance.<br/><br/>Harry does not start off at the Durseys like he does in the book so non-readers might get a bit confused in the next movie when he's back there. How will the next director deal with that? Hagrid does not expose himself as half giant so will the next movie have Hagrids giant brother in it? I think that the character development was a bit poor. Moody, of course lacked in cleverness. Krum is made out to be a bit of a sport thug and Fleur looses all of her charm.<br/><br/>All these poor representations of the characters could have easily been avoided.<br/><br/>the Story is well; i think a bit disjointed, it's hard to fit such a long complicated story into two and a half hours but i do believe they made some wrong decisions about what to leave out and what to put in. The crush that harry has on Cho is really subtle in the book, and yet they made it into a big deal. and yet the left out things that are vital for our non-reading friends like hagrid being half giant, the durseys and Reeta Skeeter as an animagnous. these would only take two seconds to put in but they ditched them to make room for insignificant things like an extra long ball scene or dragon scene.<br/><br/>Did the director even read the other books?? because he misjudged the importance of some of the overflowing story lines which, are not so important now but turn into important things which will just have to pop out of nowhere.<br/><br/>by the way did anyone find the first scenes in the stadium really cheap?"

I enjoyed every moment of it and would love to see it again in about a year or two.<br/><br/>As for others, if you like the adventure-ish genre, or if you are into fantasy films altogether, I suggest you pay that little extra money to pay a visit to the cinema to catch this one, because it's gonna be worth it.<br/><br/>For those that loathe the genre, well, doh, steer away from it.

","""Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire"" is more of the same, ie it bears no difference at all with all previous Harry Potters. But was it an original recipe in the first place ? Hell, no. This is basically ""Wizard of Oz"" adapted for the age of Playstation, ""Labyrinth"" on steroids, ""Neverending Story"" on a high budget and produced by Steven Spielberg etc etc. In fact there's only one quasi-progression and that is a large dose of generic melodrama, as our young heroes approach teenhood and discover love. Cue dramatic strings. A meaningless and uneventful remake of Wizards & Warriors crossed with ""Gone with the Wind"" that deserves to go by unnoticed. Save your money."
"inuyasha_313","6","0","0","5 January 2006"," I expected better
","First off I would like to say that I did enjoy the movie, the action scenes were great and the triwizard contest was done well. Of the four movies to date it was the worst one i've seen though. I was watching this movie with my husband and was disappointed to note that it was missing far too much, my husband, who has never read the books, commented that the action scenes seemed to come out of nowhere, I agree. The movie needed more of the plot added, it needed to show Harry relationship with Moody, it needed to show the long hours Harry and Hermione spent studying all the hexes and curses. If I had never read the book i would have been at a loss as to what the plot was about and in truth I am dreading the fifth movie. So much happens in the fourth book with Harry and his friends that is a factor in the next book and I fear the next movie will end also in the tragic fate of the fourth. I fear that the omission of a large chunk of the plot(everything not pertaining to the triwizard) will confuse those who have never read the books.<br/><br/>The action scenes I give a 8\10 but because I need and expect more from a movie(especially one of this caliber as I found the books to be some of the best I have read) then just action my overall vote is 5 maybe 6 out of 10. I understand that time may have been an issue for the directors of the film but really all they had to do was show Harry hard at work figuring out his clues and practicing his new spells in flash scenes. You know the ones where there is music in the background and you just see shots of the actors doing stuff but there is no talking."
"simalyn_2000","8","0","0","5 January 2006"," I saw the movie and I have to say it was pretty good
","I actually saw the movie the weekend it was released. There were a few disappointments, but overall, the movie was excellent. I loved the special effects and the movie really followed the book. But, like I said, there were a few parts of the movie (or lack of parts) that I didn't like. I would have loved to see the first few chapters of the book followed directly. There is nothing I would have loved more than to see the ton-tongue taffy incident with Dudley. I was, actually looking forward to that part, but it wasn't even there. I really loved Dobby from The Chamber of Secrets, and I wish they would have included him in the movie, but the way they explained the gillyweed was pretty good. I also wish they would have followed the storyline with Serius more. He really didn't have a major part in the book, but he is still a major part of Harry's life. He is very important to him and he was barely mentioned. Some of the other parts that I didn't like were some of the changes. You can tell this was a different director because the Gryffindor common room, the Great Hall and the library were all smaller. Well that is enough the movie. Although there were a few parts missing, it was still an excellent movie. My kids really enjoyed it, and so did I. Last thought: Wow is Hermione getting to be a real cutie. She will be a knockout when she gets older"
"waterfite2004","7","0","0","5 January 2006"," as good as it gets?
","when i went to see the harry potter film, i was expecting something quite like the rest of them. Flimsy acting and emotions, interesting special effects and an altered plot from the books. but all throughout the movie, i must say that i was quite astounded.<br/><br/>ACTING: the first film, was horrific. the children were young, inexperienced and just not cut out for the challenging levels in the plot. but as they got older, the plots grew harder and they never really met the standards. Rupert Grint, in my opinion, was always the most talented. Emma Watson, next and Daniel Radcliffe, i thought, had no talent. But in this film, i thought that they met my expectations, for the first time since the very first film. of course, the other characters, not being given quiet a big chunk of the script, never really mattered to me, but i will proudly say that i think they did outstandingly. but the one thing that really agrivated me was that emma watson's lips seemed to be connected to her eyebrows and every time she spoke, her eyebrows got quiet a workout...she also seemed to think that teen girls are always pmsing, or at least she was, because she never said anything without making sound like a death sentence. although she has improved for the first film, she still has a lot more room to grow. <br/><br/>DIRECTING: the director always has such an impact on the film and the way that the film is seen by the public. Chric Columbus, in my opinion, wasn't harry potter material. he's has his talents, but not when working with these kids. Alfonso Curon brought out something in them that lit up the screen, or was it just the absence of those ghastly uniforms?? Mike Newell also brought something to the screen. three, totally transformed teenagers, who have finally learned to act. he also put together a puzzle of amazing special effects, wonderful music and a well done alteration of the fourth harry potter book.<br/><br/>PLOT: as most movies are, this movie is changed from the book. the third movie, also having some faults, left out some very important details, such as who wrote the marauders map and so on. this movie had almost all the important elements, except for the Rita Skeeter part. that Rita was writing horrid stories about people that harry cared about, and then Hermione found out that she was an animagus. also, Gary Oldman being one of my favorite actors, didn't have much of a role, and that was probably the biggest disappointment yet.<br/><br/>all in all, i think that this movie is the best of them all....so far..."
"98nurdinm-1","7","0","0","5 January 2006"," The Goblet of Fire burns, but not as hot as I'd like...
","The fourth Harry Potter film, ""The Goblet of Fire"", was probably hoping to breath a sigh of relief this year. After all, no Tolkein to compete with, so all the fantasy buffs must surly come to this movie, right? Well, things have changed, as Hermione (Emma Watson) points out. CGI is no longer new, it can be seen in virtually every movie. So a film director, when choosing CGI, must decide whether or not to put more emphasis on it, to compete with the special effects of Tolkien's Secret Son Peter Jackson and his film ""King Kong"" or to put emphasis on the story, and compete with the allegorical story lines of Tolein wanna-be ""The Lion,The Witch and The Wardrobe."" Here, Mike Newell, the third director for the franchise, has opted to try for both. Unfortunately, this does not work all of the time. There are a number of problems with this method.<br/><br/>Firstly, the original source. God bless JK Rowling for bringing books back to kids and all, but I feel sorry for the poor scriptwriter of this film. The book is so large and so full of essential plot devices that to truly do it justice you would probably have to make an eight hour long film. (Don't get any ideas, Jackson). <br/><br/>Secondly, when the CGI really starts to work, it quickly becomes overlong and boring. Gone are the realistic touches from ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", probably the best so far of the series, and in goes effect after effect after effect. The dragon scene is a prime example, extended merely to try and add a bit of exciting CGI into the film - here we see the ""King Kong"" competition.<br/><br/>The cast try their best. From the welcome surprise of finding Eric Sykes and Jarvis Cocker making brief appearances, to the regular cast of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, we truly have the best of British. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is a somewhat darker character than previous, but then this is a darker movie. Only Gary Oldman disappoints - well, HE doesn't, but his limited screen appearance does. As for Ralph Feinnes, I reckon Nicole Kidman nicked his nose for ""The Hours""...<br/><br/>Of the kids, it's wonderful to see the Fred and George roles expanded so to add much needed comic relief into this darkest of Potter movies. The usual three - Radcliffe, Grint and Watson - do their usual roles -hero, comic sidekick, brainy sidekick - as well as usual, though I'm still not a great fan of Harry Potter himself, Radcliffe.<br/><br/>I think the main problem with this movie is the script. Because of the amount of stuff in the book, they've tried to get it all in, spoiling what could have been fascinating character development, as was done in the third film. We see no Quidditch action, Miranda Richardson's Reeter Skeeter is wasted, and even David Tennant's superb Barty Crouch Jr doesn't seem to have the same kind of twisted evil that the character in the book does.<br/><br/>The fourth film shows a change, not just in our three heroes and the development of the story, but also in the films themselves. I fear that, as the next two books are the same length as the fourth one, and indeed the last one will probably be as well, the films are going to stay on this level forever - full of delights, but with a sense of been crammed into a box.<br/><br/>7/10"

","This movie is the best Harry Potter movie yet. As I watched this film and had already watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban I could see how truly awful the first and second movies were. The best decision the producers have made was to pull Chris Colombus out of the directors chair, it has become less for children and more for all ages. I was extremely disappointed when I saw Harry Potter and the Philosipher Stone because the setting was all wrong, Hogwarts was all the sudden on a field but not in the mountains.<br/><br/>The third movie was very artistic and dark, while this movie was very funny and I loved the tension that was between Krum and Hermione and I think one of the most memorable lines in that movie that will stick with me forever was when they were getting ready to battle the dragons and Krum says to Rita Skeeter ""This tent is for champions and friends"". One of my favorite scenes was when people were putting their names in the goblet and Fred and George come with the age potions and it backfires. I found this movie being faithful to the book though they cut out a lot of scenes but that was very understandable, that was why I was so happy to see my favorite part of the book in the movie and that was when Fred asked Angelina to the Yule Ball.<br/><br/>Talking about the Yule Ball, it was gorgeous it was nothing like I expected it was actually better. The Band was funny, Ron and Harry were sitting by their table with their incredibly annoyed dates, while Hermione was in the clouds of happiness.<br/><br/>The movies are a little rushed I'll admit but I think it is only better that like the third and fourth remained faithful to the books instead of trying it to make sense to the audience who haven't read the books. If the movies would not be as faithful or even as rushed they would be more Hollywood and more of a blockbuster and therefor they would ruin the movies and the spectacular stories."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an amazing book. However there are a lot of things going on at once. This is why I believe that the movie was not as good as the book. (Of course we almost always think that) The movie left out some key points that were in the book. Making everything kind of unraveled. For example,at the end of the movie there is the all famous duel of Harry Potter vs. Lord Voldemort. At the very end of the duel the wands connect and the golden cage comes around Voldemort and Harry. Well one thing leads to another and then Harry gets back to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>After you find out who was responsible for putting Harry's name is the goblet of fire, everything just stays unraveled.<br/><br/>In the book you are suppose to find out why Voldemorts and Harrys wands connect, in this one you just hear Dumbledoor say "" Prior Incantartum"" That doesn't wrap up anything.<br/><br/>It's like what the hell is ""Prior Incantartum"". If you read the book it was a good movie, if you haven't the movie would be terribly confusing! All in all I would say this is the weakest of all the Harry Potter movies."

I don't think they should have been concerned about a time limit because Harry Potter fans would have watched it no matter how long. Just how King Kong is 3 hours long but still fans went and saw it. I was very disappointed to find out that they didn't show the Quidditch World Cup. And also in a couple of scenes they really messed up the plot. I do not see how they are going to continue some of the important aspects of the other books into the next movie with the plot being played around with the way it was. They showed the dragons very well. The certain competitions were also well created."

But no World Quidditch game (Except the opening and the party after wards, celebrating a victory) thats just pathetic. The Special effects are some of the best i've ever seen. But other than the dragon sequence, they are not used to there full potential. The maze sequence should of been intense but comes out seeming lame, Run away from the attacking plants? lame. While in the book there were fantastic creatures harry had to face in the maze, none were found in the movie version.As said before, this movie is average at best. WB seems to not have been able to find a balance between these movies being entertaining as well as sticking close to the material. Movies one and two were close to the material but boring, movies three and four were entertaining but no where near the original books. Plus they REALLY NEED A NEW DUMBLEDORE. I know that Michael Gambon is one of the greats but he does not make his representation of harry's fatherly figure very, well, fatherly. there is basically no difference between Dumbledores representation, and Snapes. So they need a better Dumbledore."

I mean, the action was great and all, but the movie skipped out on some really important parts. If I had watched it without reading the books first, maybe I would thought that it was awesome, but I did and I pretty disappointed. The movie was great with the visualizations of the book. It just made everything a bit clearer in my head about how the scenes would like. The underwater part was especially spectacular. The acting was pretty mediocre, I mean seriously! Couldn't they have made the scene where Voldemort yells Avada Kedavra at Cedric and he dies, a bit more dramatic? The moment the spell hit him, he just fell. He could have at least said something, like yell at least before the spell. But he didn't. They totally skipped out the part about Harry giving Fred and George the thousand Galleons! I don't even think they even mentioned the thousand Galleons. Sure, I know the book was more than 700 pages and of course, the director couldn't possibly fit all that in a 2 and a half hour movie but the joke shop and the inferences about the money continues throughout the 6th book. If you just introduced that in the next movie, people are sure gonna like ""Huh?"". Another thing, the Quidditch World Cup lasted like about 15 minutes of the film! That was a whole entire chapter of Harry Potter. Where was Winky in all of this?! She played a pretty big part in it and yet they deleted her from the whole entire movie! What is up with that? This was what really threw me off. And Malfoy, they only gave him almost 2 scenes and that was it! Also with Cho Chang! She is supposed Harry's love interest and plays a major major part in the books. But they only gave her 3 lines and that was it. Can you believe it? Three lines. Three measly lines. That was just wrong justice. Overall, wasn't as good."

Most of best scenes from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire book were left out. The thought that they tried to rush it all out in the very beginning and some characters didn't quite receive a lot of time for their scene is simply dreadful. At first, I thought there's a lot of people lined up and usually that means a good thing. Then I thought maybe its just because it was the first weekend the movie was let out it won't be so bad after all. But, my high hopes shattered as soon as I went to see the movie and saw that not even Cedric's death scene was good enough. I may not be a Cedric fan but I believe he should've received a bit more time.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie wasn't all that bad. There were a bit of scenes or moments which I enjoyed which weren't all that bad. I believe the Hermoine scenes were really great! Fantastic at that!

"royale_w_cheez44","9","0","0","2 January 2006"," A fantastic film that stands out as the best ""Potter"" yet
","Let me start off by saying this: my review is NOT about how well Mike Newell left in every minute detail from the book, or how much the screen writers had to leave out. This review is on how the big screen adaptation captures the spirit of the novel while coming alive in its own way on film. That being said, ""The Goblet of Fire"" pulls off a feat I thought was impossible and it compresses the hefty book into a two and a half hour movie. It's brilliant.<br/><br/>The first two Potter films were very good, but had some problems with playing it a bit too safe and maybe even cramming too much material into the film. ""Azkaban"" was a breath of fresh air and was a fantastic new look and mood to the series. As good as ""Azkaban"" was, ""Goblet"" is even better. The action is absolutely stunning, the actors are getting skin deep into their characters, and story more engaging.<br/><br/>One of the things I loved most about ""Goblet"" was its totally real portrayal of the kids. No longer pre-teens, the kids are experiencing all the woes of the teenage years, and it works out great. It's especially fun to see them embarrass themselves in front of their crushes, or awkwardly handle themselves to the girls they'd like to ask to the Yule Ball. And FINALLY, Fred and George Weasly have major roles in the movie. Jeez, it's about time! Like I said, the young actors due this spot on. Rupert Grint is better than ever. Daniel Radcliffe is very funny and develops his character well. A complaint with him though is he isn't that convincing when he needs to get really emotional. Sorry, Harry! Emma Watson, although looking beautiful, over does it a bit too much. Her performance in ""Azkaban"" was very natural, but in ""Goblet"" she is much too over the top and moody. It's a minor complaint. The adults are all perfectly cast, with Ralph Fiennes being a scary yet subtle Voldemort. There couldn't have been a better choice for him. Brendan Gleeson was also fantastic and eccentric as Mad Eye Moody.<br/><br/>The action is better than any Potter film before. The dragon is the best on screen dragon I've ever seen, and the underwater challenge is beautifully shot. Not much Quidditch in the film, but an amazing modern stadium at the World Cup does the job enough. The mood in this is even darker than the last, especially the last 20 minutes, which, by the way, are CLASSIC.<br/><br/>So, in the end, if you Arden't one of the five people who haven't seen ""Goblet"", it's a funny, thrilling, dark, and excellent addition the newly revived fantasy genre. I have one more thing to say, though: David Yates has some BIG shoes to fill when he directs the next Potter film."
"Berg007","6","0","0","2 January 2006"," Mediocre
","While mildly entertaining (even with the dark side of the story), I found this to be the worst of the first four Potter Movies. Now I haven't read the book, but the opening 10 minutes was totally unnecessary. With that extra time they could have shown all of the dragon tasks. Hated how the movie felt like a few days rather than an entire school year, like the other movies did. Wish Hagrid and Hermionie would have had a larger role too. Liked the flirtation and frustration Hermionie showed towards Ron.<br/><br/>Check out my other movie ratings and reviews at http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=9408734."

","I read the first book when I was 11 and have since then been what you might call a Harry Potter fanatic. I loved the true human nature present in the stories and the scope the 'magic' gave the imagination. I made the stories my own.<br/><br/>Thus I was very nervous when I went to see the first film! It wasn't too bad. The special effects were good and it did have a certain charm, but the major fault for me was the wooden acting of the star of the show: Harry Potter. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley was obviously a natural actor, but Daniel Radcliffe failed to win me over.<br/><br/>I have continued to watch the films, partly out of curiosity and partly because, despite the weak lead, the supporting cast and visual effect really are amazing. But, in the last film (Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Askaban) there were moments when I forgot it was a teen actor pretending to be the hero in one of my favourite stories of all time and finally saw some real acting from the child star.<br/><br/>I felt a flicker of hope and was very anxious to see the latest film, hoping for great things. I was not disappointed! Though by no means is it as good as the book it does at last come within sight of it's goal and as a popular book made into a film it is an excellent specimen.<br/><br/>For those who have not read the books, it is a really good teenage fantasy, mixing magical tricks and real life. And for those who, like myself have fallen in love with the books, as long you know it's not going to be exactly like the book and respect the different media and the directors personal vision of the story, it is very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to all. It is a chance to forget real life, troublesome and mundane, and enter a wonderful world where broomsticks really can fly!!<br/><br/>p.s. Fred and George were fab!!!"

They had all of their best qualities,and jokes. You could really see Fred and George in Oliver and James Phelps. They were finally able to play the roles they won. Even though they were so light hearted and funny, they still showed their mature sides at the end of the movie, and I applaud them for that.<br/><br/>So if you want to see an awesome movie packed full of adventure, humor, and even a little bit of romance, then you need to see this movie!!

","This movie was amazing! The 4th book was a bit better, but this was the best movie yet, in the series. There were moments of happiness, where everyone laughed at something Ron said. However, there were also sad moments, when my eyes started to tear a little bit. This was the darkest movie yet, especially since Harry faces the most darkest dangers yet. Anyway, it was an excellent movie, you won't regret seeing it, no matter what your age! Currently, there are a few major movies out, such as King Kong and the Chronicles of Narnia. I saw King Kong, it was also very well done. (An amazing movie!) I am about to start reading the Chronicles of Narnia, so I figure I should read the books before I see the movie. I have heard that it is very good though. Though, if these movies came out at a different time, I'm sure Goblet of Fire would be higher up on the popularity list.

","I agree with the statement that Dumbledore was way off, but everything else in the movie complied with the book with the exception of leaving out a few characters, such a Dobby, Winky, and Percy Weasley. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire follows the plot line of the book much better than the other three movies, meaning the scenes weren't just slapped together. Even though the Dumbledore was portrayed rather poorly, the rest of the actors did wonderful jobs by keeping the personalities of the characters within reason. I personally enjoyed Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire more than Prinsoner of Azkaban, Chamber of Secrets and Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best out of all four Harry Potter movies."

We expect some kind of reaction between Harry and Hermione to come. Harry is very slow with this subject and Hermione seems to be the one to bring it out of him.<br/><br/>You don't see much of this side in the books or the movies. They hide it when they are near the age for these feelings to kick in and for them to become more mature in this subject. <br/><br/>As you can tell, the actors have changed a substantial amount since the first movie.

","I had heard from many fans that this was the best of the series so far. After seeing it, I have to agree with them. It is definitely the best movie so far in the Potter series. The action scenes are well choreographed and the computer-generated imaging doesn't take away from the story or the effect. Radcliffe is starting to mature as an actor, though he still has some room to improve. Unfortunately there are a few points from keeping the film from being 'great'. Michael Gambon simply doesn't embody the spirit of Albus Dumbledore the way Richard Harris did. Emma Watson is a bit melodramatic in this film...it appears more like she's acting in a school play than an international blockbuster film. Lastly, (and this was very difficult to put my finger on for quite some time) since the movie was scored by Patrick Doyle (and not John Williams) it just isn't as strong. This movie is definitely a must-see for genre fans and movie fans in general. If the Potter franchise can work with Gambon and Watson and improve the musical score...the next installment 'Order of the Phoenix' might achieve the greatness that 'Goblet of Fire' just missed."

Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also did a fabulous job as Ron and Hermione. The chemistry between the three of them was completely realistic. The rest of the cast are equally talented. The writers cut out a lot from the book for time reasons, but as a whole the movie flowed pretty well. It definitely was nowhere as good as the book, but what is?

"kiddb23","5","0","0","1 January 2006"," Special Effects Rule This One...
","To clarify, I'm a big fan of Harry Potter and I'm hoping I won't be bashed for this, but in comparison to the movie I vastly prefer the book. I dropped cash like it was no object to watch the advanced screening and walked out feeling strongly disappointed in the film.<br/><br/>Where do I begin? First of all, the film's projected plot had no fluidity. It's like the director flipped through the book, picked out the scenes he liked, and said, ""All right, this is what I think we'll do."" For example--we have a shot of Karkaroff closing the doors to the Hall, where the Goblet is placed. For those who have read the book it's like, ""Oh, sure, get everybody to think he's the culprit."" And sure enough, amongst those who haven't read the book there are some who think so. But by the movie's end, when it's clear Mad-Eye the fake did it, the same people ask, ""So what's with Karkaroff and the door then? I mean, what was he doing there?"" Harry stumbles across Barty Crouch Sr.'s dead body and we're deprived of the essence of ""The Madness of Mr. Crouch"" chapter. We jump from scene to scene so abruptly that it looks like a random-pick thing. Not only do we miss scenes that we've been looking forward to (who got to see what was so great about the World Cup?), but onto the second point, for those who have not read the books, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was utterly confusing. ""How,"" my cousin who accompanied me asks, ""did Barty Crouch Jr. get loose in the first place?"" Also, have you noticed that, apart from after the 2nd task, all Fleur Delacour seems capable of doing is screaming in distress? What happened to the arrogant, self-assured, haughty ice-queen we've all got plastered onto our minds? The surly, scowling Krum, for that matter? Write down the things these characters have said throughout the film and I wonder if you'd be impressed with their script. All in the interest of focusing on the major character development of course (Ron is still adorable), but even that had some flaws. For one thing, why is it that Hermione seems so angry throughout the film? Count the instances she's smiling. Seriously. The only character development I appreciated was Neville's.<br/><br/>The only reason the film isn't a 1 on my scale is because of the special effects. I really did like the dragon scene--some would find it was blown out of proportion and demonstrated Harry's skill at fleeing than actually flying and powers of strategy (I didn't see him baiting the dragon at any point, did you?)--but the special effects were excellent. The Yule Ball was something to look at, as were the modes of transportation of the other schools.<br/><br/>I truly feel Alfonso Cuaron should have been persuaded to do the fourth film--so far the third film is by far the best. <br/><br/>In any case, to those who want to understand Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I recommend you borrow or buy the book rather than buy a ticket or DVD."
"shecrab","6","0","0","31 December 2005"," Reliably Potter, but flawed all the same
","Of all the Harry Potter films so far, this is the one with the worst problem: it is truly /the/ most poorly edited film I've ever seen. Usually, one pays little attention to editing in a good film. In a film where the plot is not well-known, the editing isn't as noticeable; this is never going to be the case with most well-known adaptations of fantasy stories like the Potter series. Familiarity with the plot points make the scene transitions seem more, not less, important. That's where this film loses me.<br/><br/>The bad editing makes these transitions choppy and unrealistic; this becomes really obvious toward the end of the film, and almost unbearable during the climactic emotional ""ball"" scene. I could have cried as the film jumped from scene to scene, and completely lost continuity in some places. What a shame. The acting is, from the vignettes I /was/ able to enjoy, superb--especially that of Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) who gave such an emotional wallop to the romantic tension that it really hurt to watch.<br/><br/>The length of this book probably had a lot to do with the jumpy transitions. There was an awful lot of material to cover, to be certain; however, rather than handling the excess as the first two books did, by alluding to it, this film attempts to *include* it, albeit in a really grossly truncated form, and ends up with a whole lot of bits and pieces that don't hang together! I was appalled at the opening--the horribly shortened and completely unexplainable World Quidditch Cup scenes. They teased the viewer with incredible special effects, then abruptly abandoned them in less than 10 minutes of film--and didn't look back! I was left wondering who pulled the rug out from under me. And that was only the beginning. The rest of the film followed suit, ruining what might have been a wonderful viewing experience. Even the actors looked confused. I wonder when this film is released on DVD how long the ""deleted scenes"" section will be--it /ought/ to be at least 45 minutes! Aside from this major (and truly ruinous) flaw, the film is reliably a Harry Potter film. The characters act as they ought, the special effects are fantastic (and why shouldn't they be?) and the way is paved for the next film, and the next. **sigh** Where is Alphonse Cuaron when you need him?"
"jenny187_420","4","0","0","31 December 2005"," I did not like it
","IT sucked there are important parts in the book that was not in the movie but are mentioned again in later books and need to be in there so if you haven't read the books and have seen the movie you need to read the book. there is nothing about Rita Skeeter being an animagus and no house elves and the tasks are all messed up the movie is mainly just tasks and like nothing else. Sirus is hardly in it. In my opinion it just sucked. The beginning of the movie where they are at the Quidditch match there aren't any veela or leprechauns and no Ludo Bagman and no leprechaun gold no goblins and they didn't go to the top box with the Malfoys and they didn't go to Hagrids after the last task and talk about what Hagrid was going to do over the summer and there wasn't anything about Kakaroff leaving or about Krum and his classmates having to steer and nothing about Hagrid being a giant I think they should have made two movies and released them at separate times like they were going to do originally."
"Beatriceblake","7","0","0","31 December 2005"," Good for the most part
","For the most part this was really enjoyable. Despite what some people have said about two movies the movie loses nothing because SPEW, Bagman and Dobby aren't included. More Sirius would have been nice however. Also this is the first well- paced movie in the franchise. Something is always happening and they have cut out the irritating scenery shots from the earlier movies. There are thankfully no gratuitous shots of Harry and Hedwig. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all play their parts well to the extent that Watson's over- enunciating didn't make me want to throttle her and I actually feel something when Harry is in the graveyard.<br/><br/>My major complaint is the way Michael Gambon portrays Dumbledore. He is atrocious. Instead of a wise, calm old wizard who clearly cares about Harry Gambon's Dumbledore is confused and bad- tempered, going so far as to attempt to strangle Harry when his name has come out of the goblet. Dumbledore is my favourite character from the book and he is unrecognisable in this movie. If Gambon continues to portray Dumbledore in this way the audience will be cheering when he dies in the Half Blood Prince. Recast. Recast. Recast."

","Every Harry Potter movie gets a little better than the last, and this one is no different. This is the best Potter film of them all; it takes the book's darker storyline and translates it well to the big screen. No, it doesn't do a perfect job, to do the book justice the movie would have to be 16 hours long, but it does a pretty good job in hitting all of the major events so that I didn't feel disappointed.<br/><br/>One of the advantages of cramming the whole book into 157 minutes is that it becomes action-packed. One big scene ends only to the open of another right on it's tail. It does seem a little rushed and cut, but the mistake is a forgivable one. The special effects are the best, especially the World Cup and all three tasks. The only actor of note is Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody. Totally amazing and completely dynamic. All things said, it is very short and won't please the hardcore fans of the books, but it is still a very good film that deserves attention."

I spent so many hours dreaming of what it all looked like, rereading again and again. When I first heard they were going to make films, I was elated. They were extremely close to what I had imagined, down to the last knut.<br/><br/>Then I saw this movie. It was everything exactly as it should be, the Dragons.......they were so real. The flying sequences with Daniel Radclife <3, were spectacular, and the graveyard, oh, the graveyard.......everything that I had ever imagined was brought to life by Newell's spectacular directing. I will simply die if he doesn't direct the rest of the series. He was much better than CuarÃ³n, who added to many things that weren't in the book, and not enough that were. Of course, Newell had to leave a few things out, but nothing key, I haven't a clue what your all whining about.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is growing up, that is clear. He had to, we all knew it. He has to dance with a *girl*, heaven forbid, I can't wait until the next movie where he actually has to kiss Cho Chang. Hey but If you thought it was to mature or gruesome, thats your problem, it was rated Pg-13 after all, it had to be if it was going to be accurate.<br/><br/>Like I said, I loved this movie, on a scale of one to ten, I give it eleven.

Emma has her best performance to date in my opinion. She does a good job in the role of Hermione after some great improvements in, for lack of a better word, ""style"" than that of previous films. Gambon also does an incredible job in this film. Unfortunately for him though, he is playing the wrong character. He is supposed to be playing Albus Dumbledore, a wise, strong and courageous wizard who is not afraid of anything. Gambon plays a wizard that looks afraid and is losing strength. What was Director Mike Newell thinking. Dumbledore is not afraid, and since when has he manhandled students like Harry, or anyone for that matter before.<br/><br/>Verdict - Acting - Great...but because of Dumbledore's character, I'm shooting it down Acting - OK<br/><br/>Finally, the overall movie. This movie has incredible action, the best scene is definitely the Horntail (dragon), but the story...WHAT STORY!!! the story got chopped to bits. I understand that you cant fit the entire book into 2 and a half hours, but Mike (Newell) you had the chance to make it two movies, and you cut it down to one..And don't say you expect it to be too much like the book..That's what the FREAKING story comes from..THE BOOK..FIGURE IT OUT PEOPLE..anyway for that you lost about 5 stars.<br/><br/>Verdict - The Movie - Brutal<br/><br/>I just can't justify paying 9-10 bucks to go and watch a chopped up pile of horse manure.

","How very sad to have lost our dear Dumbledore. It was sad enough to have lost Richard Harris, but now I fear Michael Gambon has lost the spirit of Dumbledore, when one was hoping he would make the role his--a difficult and ambitious task, indeed. Does the fault lie with Gambon or with the director of the film. Regardless, let us hope they salvage the true nature of Dumbledore in future installments. Throughout the books, Dumbledore remains unflappable, a constant, always calm and rational; these qualities also make him safe, and even almost ""god-like."" What happened in the fourth movie? Dumbledore physically grabs and shakes Harry just after his name is spit out of the goblet of fire. This is not the Dumbledore of the novels.

First: I thought then that was the best movie ever and second: how do you put more than 500 pages in 2 1/2 hour? I didn't see the third movie in theater because it was in the middle of my exams. But this time, I couldn't wait until the DVD came out. So I asks some friends and at the 28th December, we went. When the trailers before the movie started I had this weird shiver all over my body. It was horrible, I thought I was going to explode. Even when the movie started I was still nervous, my Coke had to support some serious claps. The tension, the waiting, it was worth is all. I mean this movie was great. Romance, action, friendship, humor, it was all there and they managed to build the tension in that strange way until you actually couldn't take it anymore. I've seen a lot of horrors and thrillers in my life, but the only movies i've ever turned my head were 'House Of Wax' and 'Final Destination'. So when I came out of the building I couldn't believe it: me, I 15-year old girl, turned her head while watching 'Harry Potter'? At the end, it was deadly quiet, no one did make a sound and everyone had tears in their eyes. I've never experienced a silence that was so filled with tension. My best friend was even eating her popcorn bag (that was really funny).<br/><br/>The last thing I want to talk about is the cast. That was so great: Cédric was just as I expected,so was Victor. (They were both really Hot) Harry was so hot (especially that one scene)Hermione was just beautiful in that dress and Ron didn't look bad either. I mean, how did the producers knew four years ago that they all would grew up and be so incredibly SEXY. Really.Best movie I've ever seen... I give him a 10."

","This would have been a fantastic film for me had I not read the book first and had not see Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter 1 & 2. Michael Gambon is a fabulous actor but plays Dumbledore overly dramatically. In the books Albus Dumbledore is portrayed as a calm but strong willed person showing no sign of panic at any time, but in Harry Potter 4 he seemed to lose it on more than one occasion. Many wonderful vital parts of the book where missing(Including a character or two)such as the explanation as to how Barty Crouch Junior escaped from Azkaban and what happened to him after he was exposed as the fake Madeye Moody. I realize the book was a hell of a size to fit into a movie but I'd have sat through hours more film to get the full story. We also saw no disbelief or worry on Lord Voldemort's face when he and Harry duelled in the graveyard as the wands clashed. I'd hoped that that scene would have been in full. The special effects make the movie what it is; a blockbuster of a film but I'd recommend reading the book to fill in the blanks."
"jdkraus","8","0","0","24 December 2005"," Visually stunning, but a choppy storyline...
","The fourth book of the Harry Potter series is my favorite of all the books. The story for me was gripping, exciting, and the whole climax of the tale of Potter. The film however had somewhat of a different aspect.<br/><br/>First off, I'll say the film's visuals were stunning, the sets, costumes, music score, and acting was top notch, especially with Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, who was the best cast member of this entire film, even though he was only in it for ten minutes. Depsite all of this, the storyline was very weak and choppy. Technically, the director threw scene after scene into the viewers' face, making the story rather hard to make sense of and of course leaving plenty of plot holes like the last film! So, the story, cutting over sixty pages out, starts off with Harry already at the Weasleys' house. The Weasley family and Harry, with Hermione happening to be there, head out to the Quidditch cup, a major sporting event in the Wizard world. The first fifteen minutes fly by with not much of an explanation, and it cuts out the biggest action sequence in the whole darn book! Then, after the match being over with no game being shown, a gang of Voldemort's followers attack the location of the Quidditch cup.<br/><br/>The story continues on with rumors of the dark lord rising, with his spies within the wizard world both in the ministry and in the school of Hogwarts. As this goes on, two new schools arrive, for it was the year of the Trizward Tournament. There are supposed to be three contestants, with one from each school, but a fourth is chosen, inevitably...Harry Potter. The film thickens, and finally becomes juicy and entertaining with the game of life and death.<br/><br/>Little does Harry know that a close friend of his is a secret vassal of the dark lord! So, I loved everything of this film, except for the storyline, which is critical to any film or book. So, I generously and deepest in my heart give this film a **** out of ****** Truly, this is better than the other films. Not perfect, but adequate."

","My first reaction to this movie was: amazing! The actors acted very well (except Michael Gambon, I'll come back on that later), the visual effects were great and it was just a strong, catchy movie. But it was, as a big fan of the Potter books, horrible to see how the book was suppressed. The main scenes, like the hearing and th return of Voldemort, are made shorter to add more humour to the movie. I wanted to see more scenes as the hearing, and less jokes, that had made the movie much better.<br/><br/>Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) was in this movie still worser than in PoA, he's screaming all the time, and not anymore a friendly and powerful wizard. I hated that. I give a 8 to this movie, it stays a great movie, but the filming of the book isn't well. I hope my comment was useful to you."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","24 December 2005"," Goblet of Fire  4th in the series and the first one that had me looking forward with enthusiasm for the next one
","I enjoyed the first Harry Potter for its novelty but found it quite forgettable, and slept through a good part of the second one. The Prisoner of Azkaban, number three, began to get more of my attention, with its clever introduction of the element of the time paradox, plus the realistic blurring of the line between good and evil, in both Sirius Black and Professor Lupin. It's no longer for little kids.<br/><br/>If you walk into the cinema and watch the opening of Goblet of Fire without knowing what it is, you would have thought that it's a movie in the line of ""Constantine"" and never have guessed that it's a Harry Potter. Yes, it's that dark.<br/><br/>Structurally, GoF is simpler even than the previous three Harry Potters, with one single theme  the 3-school ""international"" wizard competition with Horwart against two visiting schools that represent quite obviously Yin and Yang, if you're into that sort of thing. The three trials are quite formulaic, which is not to say that they are banal, thanks to the excellent special effect and art work.<br/><br/>Sandwiched between the excitement at the starting and ending third of the movie is the ball, which lightly touches on the romantic inclinations that come inevitably with puberty. It is a pleasure, I must admit, to see our three principals in a new light, starting their bittersweet journey of coming of age, fringed by an ensemble of supporting teenage characters.<br/><br/>Darkly ominous is the final emergence in solid physical shape of Voldemort, a part given to Ralph Fiennes, who is competent, if not brilliant, in this role. We should also remember that this is only an introductory appearance, with three more installments for this evil character to grow.<br/><br/>In every installment, the movie makers try to bring in some new big names. Last time we had Emma Thompson, who was a one-movie deal, and Gary Oldman, who appears again in GoF (or whose face appears, to be exact) for just a few minutes. The regulars are all there but the spotlight is definitely and absolutely on seasoned veteran Brendan Gleeson, who steals everybody's show playing the eccentric new professor ""Madeye"" Moody.<br/><br/>Katie Leung, who plays the girl Harry Potter has a crush on, was purported selected from over a thousand applicants. In view that she has insignificant screen time and about four lines to speak, one would wonder why they went through the trouble. It shouldn't be difficult to get someone from an academy of performing arts, even if it has to be an Asian student at least as pretty as Leung. Either it is an advertising gimmick or they have more plans for the character of CHANG Cho in future installment. Yes, I know. All I have to do is to read the next two books. Guess I will."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire We return once again to our maturing hero, Harry Potter(Radcliffe), who isn't wasting his summer away spending time with the Durselys. Instead, the film kicks off to a mysterious, more matured start with a dark set-up that turns out to be a dream. Upon waking up, we see Harry at the Weaslys, spending time with his friends, Ron(Grint) and Hermione(Watson). Just 14 minutes in, we're back on the train for another year at Hogwarts. This year, Hogwarts is playing host to a legendary event, the TriWizard Tournament. Three magical schools come together and one student is selected from each school to take part in the tournament, in which they will have to complete three dangerous tasks. But Harry finds himself an under aged selection, yet he's forced to compete.<br/><br/>This 'Goblet' is a model of spellbinding, enthralling storytelling that doesn't lose itself along the way. Feuled by endless invention, vibrant special effects and strong performances from our trio makes up to be the most complex of the Potter films. What sets 'Goblet' apart from the others is this: It's the first of the Potter films to set the turning point for the Potter films. It's darker, scarier, funner, more poignant than it's predecessors. It gets under these characters skin, and attempts the ""epic"" scope and emotion of the lord of the Rings films, the only Potter to even attempt to reach such heights.<br/><br/>Fianl Verdict: While the potter films probably will never be taken seriously enough, Goblet of Fire stands as one of 2005's best movies.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire: 4 from 4"

I'm sure everyone agree's with me. It's got a lot more funny bits. Fred and George are hilarious. The characters have all grown up a lot since the last movie.

","The very, VERY best movie made of the Harry Potter books. My favourite book was No.3, but I didn't think the movie of that one was nearly as good. However this one has exceeded all my expectations. Although I enjoyed the book, I did think it could have done with some decent editing as there was a lot in it which didn't really add to the story. The movie has pared the book down to the actual storyline and as such it's made SUCH an improvement. And although it is quite long, you don't notice the time passing because there are always things happening. The CGI and special effects are absolutely wonderful. It left me quite in awe (a bit like LotR) at the type of things that they can do these days in movies. I laughed, I cried, I loved! If you haven't seen this movie yet, go - NOW! Oh, and it's a must see on the BIG screen."
"acebogirlie","8","0","0","22 December 2005"," Funny, upsetting, and dark- with plenty of teenage angst!
","I am an avid reader of the Harry Potter series, and the fourth one, in particular, is one of my favorites. After reading several fan reviews in outrage, angrily declaring that it was too different than the book, I was surprised. I, for one, absolutely loved the fourth movie in the Harry Potter series: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>The movie begins perfectly, setting the tone with dark colors and lighting and an eerie version of ""Hedwig's Theme"". From that moment on, you know that this movie will be very dark- but amazing at the same time. The opening scene made many people in the theatre flinch, especially near the end- the infamous flash of green light.<br/><br/>The adaptation of the book is spectacular- I'm not going to rehash the plot in one review- but trimming a 700- page book into a two and a half hour movie? Not an easy task. The movie runs quickly and it doesn't seem like two and a half hours sitting in one chair. We jump from scene to scene very quickly. Perhaps it's a little too fast, but do you really want to feel like you're sitting there, watching the minutes go by slowly? Yes, there's a lot of funny stuff from the book cut out. We don't get to see of Hermione's crazed S.P.E.W frenzy, and we don't get to hear Viktor Krum(Stanislav Ianevski) say, ""Herm-own-ninny."" However, the audience does get to view a LOT of teenage angst in this movie that especially I- being fifteen- can relate to. Us girls ooh and ahh at the males like Cedric Diggory(Robert Pattinson) (Forgive me, I did whisper, ""Oh, my God. He is so hot."") and the guys drool at Fleur(Clémence Poésy) and Cho(Katie Leung). (They whispered the same thing as I did, only with a 'she'. We're teenagers- we're allowed!) Empathy comes with Ron and Harry's fight after Harry is chosen unexpectedly in the tournament. At the Yule Ball, all of the girls pitied poor Hermione, feeling like a lost Cinderella at the end of the scene. This scene, I must add, is done wonderfully. I never expected this to be in the Harry Potter movies, such a relaxed and fun dance scene reminiscent of many a homecoming and prom night. Ron and Hermione's fight is hysterical, if it didn't make us ANXIOUS for those two to get together already! (Just cross your fingers, readers- their time will come!) The new characters are interesting, Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody in particular.<br/><br/>The action scenes are also breathtaking. The first task is an amazing effort at pulling off a CGI dragon, and it succeeds for sure. You don't think, ""Okay. This is where the CGI comes in"" you think, ""Oh my god, that's a DRAGON!"" The mermaids in the second task are scary and surprising, and made more than one person jump. The third task is another scene attacked by fans. There are no sphinxes or Blast Ended Skrewts here, but the maze is clearly psychologically damaging and scary enough on its own. (Fans of the book probably begin to get a little upset here, anyway, knowing what's to come- this is the point where I started crying.) The Death Eater scene didn't really scare me- it angered and upset me. I know many who WERE scared, and I do think the scene was pulled off very well. Voldemort is creepy and brings hate to all who view him. The scene afterwards, however, was extended purely for the sake of drama, and it's a hard scene to watch. (Daniel Radcliffe can finally cry now, by the way.) Cedric's death and his father's reaction had me sobbing- and no, not just because Robert Pattinson's such a handsome young lad! Many were crying, and I do think that it was a scene where you should feel upset.<br/><br/>The scenes after this point are most likely my only complaint. I did not like the revelation of Barty Crouch(David Tennant) as Polyjuice Moody scene- mainly because of Michael Gambon(Dumbledore). I'm not one of the rallying ""MICHAEL GAMBON SUCKS- RICHARD HARRIS LIVES FOREVER!"" fans. However, Dumbledore was a bit aggressive in this scene, as well as previous scenes he was in. The scene was overall weak, with too much shouting that didn't really have a purpose.<br/><br/>Cedric's funeral is touching and sad. Harry's 'annual talk with Dumbledore' is cut short and could have been a little longer. (It's okay- we'll see enough of Dumbledore in movie six.) The movie ends with our trio, bringing the point home that friendship is what holds this series together.<br/><br/>The acting is very good in this movie, with a few exceptions- I already mentioned Gambon, and I wasn't crazy about Crouch Senior(Roger Lloyd-Pack), either. However, the trio has matured significantly. Emma Watson is the lovable busy-bee know it all and Rupert Grint is endearing as Ron, as usual. (He's my favorite of the trio.) Daniel Radcliffe as Harry is definitely a teenager, but it shows a little bit of how wise Harry is beyond his years. Funny, compassionate, and not afraid to cry, he's a hero many can identify with. Perhaps the cast looks a little older than they should be- but they all believably act like adolescent teenagers. (Ianevski and Pattinson in particular both look to be in their late teens to early twenties, which I believe are their ages, but Ianevski pulls off an awkward yet intense Krum and Pattinson acts as a popular teenager very well.) The staff is hysterical and wonderful to see, as always. Alan Rickman as Snape is a blessing and gift of a character, and Maggie Smith as McGonagall gets her own funny moment to shine. Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is dependable and a figure of Hogwarts, and even he gets a little romance! Overall, the movie is fantastic. With a few minor complaints, I loved it. Can't they hurry up and get movie five out already?"

","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the latest installment in the popular series based on the books by J.K. Rowling. The fourth movie is directed by Mike Newell, and has most of the regular cast returning. Some newcomers include Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. This movie boasts all the amazing visuals and thrilling excitement of the previous three movies. Some fans of the books may be unhappy with what was left out of this film. (Editing a 700+ page book into a two and a half hour movie couldn't have been easy!) While quite a bit from the book was left out, what was left in the movie will not disappoint. Gleeson makes the most of his debut, and becomes a standout character. And the appearance of Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort will be a landmark for this movie franchise. It all makes us anxious for the next installment of the Harry Potter series."

","After the brilliantly dark Prisoner of Azkaban directed by Alfonso Cuaron, my expectations for the fourth Harry Potter movie Goblet of Fire were very high. All directors bring in to the soup their own spices, and I was excited to see Mike Newell's (director of ""Four weddings and a Funeral"") handiwork with the world's most famous boy wizard. And my high expectations were pretty much met.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire is a story of Harry Potter's fourth year in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft. This year is different: Hogwarts is playing host to Tri-Wizard Tournament and students from other witchcraft schools, who have come to participate in the tournament. Only one participant is chosen by the Goblet of Fire from each school to be the champion from that school, but for some strange reason Harry is chosen as the other Hogwarts champion along with Cedric Diggory. This is where the story begins, taking students through the year and through strange and even sad and scary matters, ending in the end of the school year.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire is even darker than its predecessor. This is not a children's movie anymore. The author, J.K. Rowling has mentioned that all her books (and that way also the movies made of the books) are meant for the same age group that Harry himself represents. Harry and his friends are 14 in the movie, and director Mike Newell has not started to clean up and polish things or the rough story for very young audience. This is why I definitely don't recommend the movie for the youngest of the family, because it may cause nightmares to the more sensitive.<br/><br/>For more adult audience Goblet of Fire is the fireworks of fantasy, wonderful, amazing story. The world of magic has been spiced up with (British) humour (Draco Malfoy's ferret screen, Harry meeting Myrtle in the bath, everything the Weasley twins do...). However, in general the colour of the scenery is dark, with the fear of Lord Voldemort's return over everything. The fear, which materialises in a very dramatic way in the last meters of the movie.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire is a thick book and a lot of the story has been left away from the movie. Nothing very important is changed though, and the movie works very well as such. In the beginning everything goes almost ""fast-forward"" speed and in this spot I would have hoped for a few minutes more for clarifying the backgrounds of things. After the breathtaking beginning the movie smooths down to tell the actual story, the story of Harry's participation to the Tri-Wizard Tournament and his journey to meet He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, as well as his struggle with the teenage problems with for example girls.<br/><br/>For a viewer who has never read any Harry Potter books or seen any of the films, Goblet of Fire won't necessarily open as such. In the movie there is no time for anything extra and all extra explanations of things have been cut off. To be able to fully enjoy the movie, it requires the viewer to watch the previous ones or read the books.<br/><br/>But it definitely leaves the viewer to wait for more!"

I thought that this movie wouldn't be any good because lately the director of each movie has varied...but all directors stuck to the books, well most of it anyway, As a big fan of the book i was slightly disappointed by all the stuff that was missing although all the vital stuff seemed to be there, if you only want to watch an exact interpretation of the wondrous books then this isn't it, it tells the story just a well as J.K Rowling wrote it but in less detail.<br/><br/>All The Favourite Characters are in the movie including some new ones, Draco Malfoy who is one of the favorite bad boys in the film has a limited part but does make appearances! And....Harry finally asks out a girl! It has finally happened even though it turns out to be a doomed relationship we all have to start somewhere! Overall i give this movie an 8, it was done really well and the teenage actors have grown up and are finally ready to play more advanced roles, it is a great movie and i recommend it for all Harry Potter fans!!!"

","I've read lots of the reviews here and I'm in the middle. Yes, it was long-awaited and it was a great book, and it's Harry Potter, so it's defacto great. And it sure has taken in a lot of money, so people are obviously liking it - and I did too. But if you know the book and the books (and therefore movies) that come after it - it was way too short, and left out so much, and added some very silly things and wasted time on others. I like one reviewer's idea that it should have been released as two movies a few months apart. I also agree with the comment that whoever adapted this one has no feel for the characters and the deeper story at all.<br/><br/>The previous reviewers have itemized the many things that were left out. The first big disappointment is - no World Cup match to watch at all? Still, I held out hope while noticing every omission -- until the final task and the graveyard scene. No Sphinx? No down-is-up section of the maze? No giant spiders? And then, the graveyard. Movie Voldemort makes nowhere near the horrible, visceral impact of the one described in the book. And I think the book took at least 40 hair-raising pages to take us through from the murder of Cedric, the revival of Voldemort, the cracking appearance of Deatheaters, Voldemort torturing and playing with Harry, the brother wands forming a barrier as the two combatants are moved away from the Deatheaters, the Phoenix song, the Priori Incantatum appearances, and Harry's wild, needs-all-his-Quidditch-skills-to-make-it and ultimately successful dash -- amid curses firing all around him breaking headstones and narrowly missing him -- to get Cedric's body and escape.<br/><br/>I wonder what J.K. Rohlwing thinks of this - what another reviewer here called - very long trailer."

There was simply too much there to cram into 157 minutes and while some may be convinced that you can strip away non essential plot lines, conversations and events, what you inevitably get is a frame without substance and feeling of frustration. Certainly the action scenes are very well done. Daniel Radcliffe handles a very difficult role with a maturity belying his age and Emma Watson is superb in the few scenes in which she is stretched. So why am i not raving about how brilliant this movie is? The truth is, that in making this movie the director has given us something to enjoy, but i can't help but feel sad for the pages we have lost."
"zachary-dillard-0525","10","0","0","20 December 2005"," Goblet of Fire good, but a lot left out
","Goblet of Fire was a good movie, but I felt that it could have been really brilliant. After reading the book I thought that the Quidditch World Cup, along with a few other scenes were pivotal. In the movie the Quidditch World Cup goes by way too fast. I think that the movie would have been way better if they had shown the actual match. It would have been hands down the best scene of all the Harry Potter movies. Also I was deeply upset with Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes is a brilliant actor,but they needed to make him look horrific and they failed miserably. In the novel he is said to have scarlet colored eyes, and they are said to be catlike. In the movie they are blue. These little detail slips took their toll in my opinion. Another thing that chapped my ass was the beginning. The scene with the graveyard and Voldemort killing the muggle caretaker was brilliant, but it completely left out Harry being at his uncles house like the novel. It starts with him at the Weasleys home, awoken by Hermione from a bad dream. That greatly hurt the story in my opinion since they left out maybe 25 vital minutes of the actual story. I understand they had to cut time since the movie was already 21/2 hours, but they coulda taken some time from the Yule Ball to aid this. That scene was way overdone. Overall this was probably my 3rd favorite behind Prisoner of Azkaban and Sorcerors Stone. IT could have been brilliant too...sigh"

From the moment it started i was in, totally hooked, enthralled in this masterpiece. I loved every second of it, and also loved how the director had shaped the film, it was as if i was forgetting that it was just 'the fourth one', and accepting it as a very smart, tricky little mystery/thriller/comedy.

","The time is upon us. No, not the holiday season.. It's the fourth film in the highly anticipated Harry Potter series. For those who are interested, the first was simple children's fare, the second was better, and the third was the best. The fourth is quite enjoyable in many respects, but feels too long to be thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in his fourth year at Hogwarts. It is also time for the TriWizard Tournament, in which a select trio of young wizards and witches perform deadly feats to be the winner for their magic school. Even though Harry Potter is too young to enter the tournament, his name somehow ends up in the Goblet of Fire, and he is chosen to be a competitor. There is more to this mystery, and he will soon learn that a lot is at stake.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter films are definitely different from most run of the mill fantasies. For one thing, in most fantasy films, the acting is atrocious. With the Harry Potter series, the acting, especially by the three main protagonists, gets better and better. It seems as they get older, the three actors greatly exhibit their teenage angst with the characters. The returning cast is great of course. Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Minerva McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) and Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy), all play their roles with entertaining fervor. Even though they all played much better parts in the past, they seem to be enjoying their roles, and overall are great to watch. Brendan Gleeson is the most impressive, as Professor ""Mad Eye"" Moody, who specializes in teaching the dark arts. His performance is so full of energy and passion that it is just absolute fun watching him perform as this nutty character. Ralph Fiennes, despite his short role as Lord Voldemort, is quite terrifying. His voice eerily fits this villainous character. He's bound to scare the children.<br/><br/>This film is a great example of visual cinema at its best. The beautiful Gothic sets evoke a dark, mystical feeling that helps add to this fairy tale story. The cinematography by Roger Pratt captures a very ominous and creepy settings gives the viewer the feeling that they are a part of this world of mystery and magic. The special effects are also well done. They seem are when necessary and come off well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie's strong parts are hampered by an editing job that seems to have gone unnoticed. The movie feels too long. Had it been cut down by a mere twenty to thirty minutes, it may have turned out a lot better. Some scenes just go on for longer than they should. There is no need for Harry Potter's dream to be repeated as much as it is. There are also scenes that seemed unnecessary to the story.<br/><br/>One example is when McGonagall is teaching the boys of Hogwarts how to dance. She chooses Ron as her partner, much to his embarrassment. This is an unnecessary scene that could've been put on the cutting room floor to help keep the story moving along. Another such scene is when Professor Moody turns Draco Malfoy into a ferret after he attempts to perform a spell on Harry Potter while Harry's back is turned. It is a funny scene, but in the end, does it further the story at all? Barely. The most it shows is how powerful Professor Moody is, but we all already know that by the middle of the movie. The film is two hours and thirty minutes long, yet feels like four hours and fifty minutes.<br/><br/>This movie is very enjoyable, despite its shortcomings. It's got action and thrills that will please parents as well as children. While the story is not as intriguing as the third, it's still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B"

","It seems to me that each new Harry Potter film is greeted with the same enthusiasm and expectation. Will the films become better? Will the three central performances improve? However, the films seem to produce disappointment. But with the third instalment, things began to pick up under the charming direction of Alfonso Cuaron and now in the fourth instalment things are continuing down the same route.<br/><br/>This instalment shows a wonderful improvement in the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Much of the credit for this must go to the script which provides the threesomes characters with events and themes which they will be experiencing at the moment, therefore making it easier for them to act. Furthermore, the supporting cast has strengthened. Michael Gambon is excellent in what is a pivotal performance for Dumbledore. Brendan Gleeson delivers a brilliant character performance as ""Mad-Eye"" Moody whilst Ralph Fiennes is fantastic and memorable as Voldemort.<br/><br/>Technically the film is dazzling. The visual effects are outstanding and fit in the beautifully shot world of Hogwarts. The music, which lost the care of the experienced and versatile John Williams for the most part, was brilliant even though it lost some of the continuity that was gained by this film.<br/><br/>Mike Newell has made a superb effort at taking the helm of such a mammoth series. His British touch in the direction has actually given the film an air of the British public school that helps to inject a bizarre and obscure form of humour, which adds to genuinely witty script, provided by Steve Kloves who will not be adapting the next film but will be back for the Half-Blood Prince. It is a little too long, but it can be excused for this as there is so much material in the books to be squeezed in to the short time space provided.<br/><br/>A very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and a film that shows much promise for the future, Goblet of Fire is entertaining, well-made and emotive."

","Watch the degradation of the Harry Potter series into a reality type show -- there's entirely too much touchy-feely emphasis; the whole thread of the plot is disrupted. Add the heavy use of extreme close-ups -- Good Lord, I remember Mad Magazine making fun of that, way, way back!! After seeing another (4th?) closeup of Voldemort, I started wondering about the biologic sense of his face -- ""How can he exercise with those nostrils?"". (Okay, I was a biology major, plus I see all the the ""nose tape"" openers on the NFL players) So maybe Voldemort doesn't need air -- but the point was he was brought back to the biologically living!!<br/><br/>More than once choppy transitions have the watcher going ""Hunh? -- though usually one can pick the thread up in the next few minutes. Not very smooth. One should not have had to read the book to follow and enjoy the movie; it should stand on it's own merits.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is typical of an ""epic"" -- alternately blasting and then too quiet to understand the dialog. (Think """"Bored"" of the Rings"""") There were a lot of ""Whaddid they say?"" in the theater. I hope it was the acoustics. <br/><br/>I actually wonder if this episode will be better on the little screen -- I certainly wouldn't see it again."

","The latest installment in the Harry Potter series was disappointing. While I realize that they can't possibly include everything that was in the books, I do think that they left out some details that make the characters who they are. If you haven't read the books, I can't see why you would care what the characters were doing -- the details that they left out were the ones that make the people well rounded, and explain their motivations. Hermione is just pettish and spoiled if you don't know that she is smart and frustrated by the boys' ""laziness"" and Ron seems off balance if you don't know that he has a crush on Hermione and is jealous of Krum. And why did they leave Dobby out of the Quidditch scene and the 2nd challenge? He was already introduced as a character... Just stuff like that was disappointing to me.<br/><br/>This was just a let down in general - and I was completely prepared to love the movie, but they seem to be going downhill.<br/><br/>That said - I would recommend seeing it if you enjoyed the other movies -- but don't expect it to follow the book or have all of the suspense and detail that has made the books so enjoyable."

","I'll throw up my hands and confess I HAVE NEVER, EVER READ A HARRY POTTER. This placed me at an immediate disadvantage when watching this movie (though I have watched all the previous instalments with a cool, but interested eye). Nevertheless, along I went, and found myself thrilled, chilled and, er, spilled for the duration. Although the oddly speeded-up pace of the opening (the Quidditch World Cup hardly gets five minutes more than sufficient to impress an audience with awe-inspiring CG) jarred me a little, once the film had settled down and found its pace I was spellbound. The darkness is really closing in at Hogwarts, and finally a Potter movie has stopped patronising and started actually trying to be a film for adults as well as tots (who will be snivelling at the sight of the hideous, evil Voldemort, made even more sinister by Ralph Fiennes' superb turn).<br/><br/>Twee child-friendly magic-for-laughs such as inflating a bothersome relative has been largely dispensed with, and a strong element of horror and fear crept needlingly into the formerly cosy warmth of Hogwarts. Now the youngsters are growing up, finding love, finding out why life can be cruel, and having to confront the darker side of witchcraft and wizardry. The direction is generally strong and assertive, and the spirit of the previous films lingers with the addition of a lot more spice and excitement.<br/><br/>Not that this film is perfect by any means. Aside from continuity errors and a choppy edit for the first 20 minutes, many wonderful characters have been swept aside by the need to cram so much into such a short space of time. Snape has faded, Draco Malfoy all but disappeared and even Hagrid doesn't get much of a look in. I am reliably informed by my Potter mad friends that much key plot has been axed for the sake of time. So what does get the focus? <br/><br/>Unfortunately as this saga unfurls, more and more time is being spent following Harry in his struggles with the past and present. This is the most emotionally charged chapter in the Potter movies thus far, and Harry's journey would be difficult for any young actor to pull off. A stronger actor than Radcliffe would, however, be better able to handle the challenge of acting with CG and SFX, and would be unfazed by the (sometimes Oscar-winning) pros around him (particularly after three movies playing the same character). Radcliffe, however, shows here more starkly than in any previous Potter, that his range is disappointingly limited. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are trying hard, and often succeeding, at convincingly playing the confused teenage friends, but Daniel Radcliffe's characterisation of the teen wizard is still painfully self-conscious. Potter is growing up, and Radcliffe is in serious danger of being outgrown by his own character.<br/><br/>Radcliffe aside (and he's young, and has much potential), the cast is wonderful, stellar and delivering buckets of charisma on every level, and finally a British helmer has risen to take the reins of what is, after all, a quintessentially British tale. I hope that the Potters will continue to gather momentum, and this has certainly been the best so far."

","The latest installment of the Harry Potter story is, by far, the worst to date. After sitting through a butt-numbing movie, my only comment was 'what the hell ?' It barely stayed true to the book and cut out so much from the original storyline that it was barely recognisable as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I would have rather paid more and seen the entire book in 2 or three movies then the shameful excuse that they put up on our screens. Most of the movie, my friend and i were whispering to each other, trying to figure out which part of the story we were watching. all in all, the worst Harry Potter to date, and i seriously hope that the directors/studio or whoever decides to make Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince into several movies and not one terrible piece of motion pictionary.This movie only escapes getting a one because of the excellent graphics and the time that the people in computers must have spent touching up the pubescent actors skin."

","Mike Newell; being the first British film director, brought a distinctive British tolerance to the humor between students, and teachers, that the other directors failed to provide. The jump to leap approach for the film kept the laughs, anger, and ploy of Voldemort savvy for book fans and just, fans, while snappier pickup of the plot line put everyone on edge for a satisfactorialy horrifying battle, proving Goblet of Fire to be a true turning point in the actors careers and the films direction- For the book fans, it is understood that alterations to the order and detail of a story can be aggravating, but hey, they worked in nearly two and half hours!"

","Sigh. I had high hopes of seeing another interesting and entertaining Harry Potter movie, however, as my summary suggests, this movie did not provide the return on my movie $$ investment.<br/><br/>First the not-so-good points in no particular order: (a) It seems that throughout the movie Hermione Granger can't speak to others in a normal voice tone. She *basically* yells or barks her works to her fellow actors. Almost as if she's a bit frantic about things she should not be frantic about.<br/><br/>(b) Mr. Ron Weasley could *almost* have stayed home and done some chores around his home... as his contribution throughout the movie is extremely weak. His basic themes are be dull and annoying, show disdain and be uninterested in *most* girls, pre-pubescent attraction to the few select *hot* chicks. I would bet that Ron has enrolled in the ""Angelina Jolie"" just stand there and look at something school for actors... because Ron' character does an awful lot of boring showmanship.<br/><br/>(c) The wonderful all against one, one against all... pack of friends till we die... camaraderie that the previous Harry Potter movies displayed is sorely lacking in this movie.<br/><br/>(d) Character development is very weak. It's ashame the Director made the choices he did... it would have been more enjoyable had he left some of the boring teenage whining out and put in some quality movie storyline and flow.<br/><br/>Okay... enough of my whining. The few good points: (e) The parts of the movie that did contain action were VERY good and kept my interest.<br/><br/>(f) It was nice to see 'you-know-who' show up with his villainous friends... just as we have been suspecting! Okay, enough for now.<br/><br/>Bottomline, if I knew then what I know now... I would have waited for the DVD.<br/><br/>Happy Holidays!!!"

If you've actually read the book I can understand your feelings of betrayal, and if you haven't I would say read the book; imagination is a powerful tool. There were so many parts of the book that were glossed over or ignored that would have actually added to the enjoyment of the film, that I am at a loss to understand why the producer felt these omissions to be necessary, I can only presume that the producers and production staff would rather satisfy the requirements of the cinema owners than the wishes of the viewers.

","I thought it was the best of all the movies so far. Probably because it can only get meatier now that they've reached the growing up, coming of age point. With the kids now teens and getting to do all that bumbling stuff over women that some of us can relate so much too.<br/><br/>I was glad to see my favourite HP character, the very familiar feeling and wonderfully named Ron Weasley getting more to work with and I'd actually agree holey with those whom may have felt that he started off from that first movie, at bit unsteady but with an excellent early gift for timing for one as young as he was. As the movies have gone on, he's really played on his strenghs and this movie has arguably gotten the best performance out of him yet. Same goes to the actors behind Harry and Hermione. I think Emma 'Hermione' Watson was always the strongest of the three right from the start but as time has gone on or be it catching up with them, the other two gradually developed more and more of a match to her. They had to raise their game a bit with this one and rose to the occasion.<br/><br/>It's also been a wonderful help, that the trio has always been surrounded by such a rock solid supporting cast and the bar was raised with them this time too, seeing some great new faces in tow. The eye guy, Mad Eye nearly stole the show, a brilliantly funny creation to marvel at. And yes, nice seeing the immortal Triggar of Only Fools & Horses, but actually you'll find he's been in many things, he's always been a great character actor so every time I see him, I rarely have to worry about whether I'll be half expecting an ""ello Dave."" The 'cracker' that is Hagrid had some lovely little moments too, loved his reply to Harry asking if he'd combed his hair, ""As a matter of fact I have. You might want to try doing the same thing once and awhile."" The great Alan Rickman ruled again as well with that ever so delicious delivery of his lines, the constant interrupting of Harry and Rons talk at lunch was comic gold.<br/><br/>The Villain front also made huge waves. It was excellent to finally see what Voldey looked like and I wasn't disappointed. He looked perfectly suitably creepy, as is fitting to a dark lord of that reputation after such extended build up. It was a great surprise to see how well cast he was, cause we all know how badly wrong those kind of shall we say theatrical heavy villains can go in the hands of lesser or legitably crazy in a bad way, actors. I supposed there was never reason to worry too much when in the capable hands of Ralph Fiennes. Just as impressive were his cronies. The rat like Wormtail in the form of the always reliable Timopthy Spaul and David Tennant with that incredible psychotic grin which made him such a visually good fit for the role of a certain iconic mad doctor were utterly freaky and suitably skin crawl inducing. The father of the bullying Malfoy has a wonderful Lex Luthorish slickness and sliminess to him. Speaking of his son however, he's never showed much of a presence to me, I've seen a long line of convincing bully characters in movies and I can't exactly put him up there with the greats, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>The ending was great with good meaning driving it forward. They managed well to get that sudden change in tone to come so naturally. I also thought that final scene was a very nice touch. The ""things our never gonna be the same"" and the ""don't we ever get a quite year at Hogworts."" It seemed a nice little way of balancing between being not too light and not too low a point to leave on. The first ones ending was the worst, far too sugar coated for my taste, although to be fair, it's naturally hard to work around it in the world of movies, considering the kiddie label that the series is branded with and ever valiantly fights to rise above. It sort of feels as though its evolved from the family films gendure. Like most of everything else, they've kinda gotten better with each new movie. They do seem to have now finally struck just the right balance.<br/><br/>Anyway brilliant movie, best of the rest."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","0","18 December 2005"," May the fourth go with you
","On the fourth cinematic outing for Harry and his chums, we have a third director (Mike Newell) and a darker, scarier approach (which attracts the first non-PG certificate). All the familiar characters are back at Hoggwarts, but - with the exception of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) - the established adults are given only minor roles, surrendering the floor to Alastor 'Mad Eye' Moody (played with verve by Brendan Gleeson). At the heart of this adventure is the Triwizard Tournament involving an airborne dragon chase, an undersea rescue, and a devouring maze which provide plenty of challenges for Harry and excitement for young viewers, although an non-reader of the books (like me) can be confused at times.<br/><br/>As always, there are wonderful characters and creatures and splendid sets and special effects. What really makes this latest movie stand out from the other three is how the Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown up into teenagers with mood swings and a fascination with the strange creatures known as the opposite sex. Harry is more confident flying a broomstick and battling dragons than propositioning the bewitching Cho Chang (Katie Leung), while blossoming Hermione cannot understand why Ron fails to see her as anything other than a schoolfriend. This awakening is well-handled and will engage the legions of young Potter fans, making them enthusiastic for episode five."
"caranncosfor1950","5","0","0","17 December 2005"," Ending not up to standard.
","While I realize the impossibility of including the entire book, the ending of the movie left much to be desired. It seemed as if once Harry took the port-key back to Hogwarts it went completely downhill. Much detail from the book was not explained or eliminated. Unless one had read the book, some of the movie's ending was unclear and confusing. Not showing the ministry's elimination of Barty Crouch, Jr., their subsequent denial that Voldemort had returned, and the enmity developing between the Minister of Magic and Dumbledore leaves a great deal to the viewer's imagination. Not showing Dumbledore's steps taken to reinstate the Order means that the next movie will have a lot of explaining to do before it can initiate the plot for that book. The groundwork for The Order of the Phoenix was not formulated and begs the question as to whether the movie will be a complete hatchet job of the book. The previous movies did a much better job of converting the books to the silver screen."

I'm going to have a great time anyway, but it's not going to be just the same as the book."" <br/><br/>They took things out. They added other things.

(People who have seen ""Chamber of Secrets"" will know of whom I speak.)<br/><br/>This is perhaps demonstrated in the scenes which deal with Harry's anxiety over asking a girl to the Yule Ball.

The funny part of the movie is when Harry is trying to ask a girl out to the Yule Ball, and we see how hard it is for him, since Ron says that Harry can slay dragons but he can't ask a girl out. I wouldn't recommend the movie for young kids because it does get scary in some parts, with the dragons and in the end of the book.

","The fourth installment in the Harry Potter series sent me on a thrill ride of emotions. The director did a wonderful job of balancing the humor amidst the horror of the events that took place in the film. It left me anxiously awaiting the next film too come.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie held fast to the most important story lines in the book. The first 15 minutes were a bit choppy, but it's hard to compress eleven chapters of material into that short amount of time, so I'll forgive the loss of bits and pieces of storyline that were left out in the beginning. Once the film got into the tournament, most of the major story elements were left in place, and the film progressed fairly smoothly. The end was a bit choppy again, and I felt some points that were left out and/or glossed over should have been left in, so those who have not read the books would understand why the Ministry of Magic would choose to hide the fact that Lord Voldemort had returned. The entire premise of the next book in the series is based upon this disbelief, and how Harry is made to suffer for telling the truth. It will be interesting to see how this problem is addressed in the next film.<br/><br/>As far as the characters go, I was pleased to see Fred and George, and their antics, take a seat front and center. They were by far my favorites. All the actors seem to be more and more comfortable with their roles, and the acting is improving with each film. Again, it will be interesting too see how much they have grown and matured when the next film installment is made. I just hope we don't loose any of the major cast members before the series is completed. (I still picture Richard Harris as Dumbledore, even though Michael Gambon is doing an excellent job in the last two films) All in all, I would say this is the best of the four films thus far. I am eagerly awaiting Order of the Phoenix."

The Plot:<br/><br/>With Harrys 4th year at Hogwarts starting,he and his friends Ron and Hermine go to see the Quidditch World Cup.Part way into the game,some strange things happen,that leads to the world cup suddenly ending.During the night,Harry keeps having the same nightmare,of people from his past(and the past in the films series)getting ready to kill him!.When he gets to the school,he finds out that there is an event taking place called The Triwizard Tourament.Where to win the Triwizard Cup you have to beat 3 very tough challenges.The event is for people older then Harry.But when The Goblet Of Fire revels which 3 people can go into the event.It brings out another name:Harry Potter!!Hary does not know how his name got in there,and starts to think someone at the school wants to kill him.While he is trying to get ready for the 3 challenges(one being that you have to get a clue for the next mission by getting past a dragon!,the other is that you have to get your friend back by going under water,and fighting killer mermaids!,and the last one is you have to get to the end of a Magic Maze?,that takes him to a very dark place).While this is happening he has to to think about something harder.-He has to ask a girl to go with him to the school dance! View On The Film:<br/><br/>First i have to say that as the series is going on,that the 3 leads are massively improving with each film.The FXs have also massively improved,and really blend into the film,and still letting the actors and the story take the main stage.The Screenplay:The Screenplay is by the man who has written the last 3 films:Steve Kloves,Kloves makes sure to build the characters and keep on a strong road with the story.He makes sure that the story is darker then the last films.While the relationship with Harry and Snap (played by Alan Rickman) is not pushed as much as it is in the other films,he makes sure to keep it going so when it gets to its finish in the books,it will work well in the film.Another very different thing that makes this film stand out in the series,is that,after something terrible happens to someone near the end of the film.One of the character's makes a speech that has a very strong 9/11 and 7/7,political/social feel,which i think makes the film more interesting for adults, Director:Mike Newll is probably the best director to have worked on the series up to now.He makes sure the the films is darker and has a very much more ""grown up""look and feel.

It really portrayed the dark, sinister elements of the story well, and also the changing maturity of the 3 main characters, Harry, Ron and Hermione. There is also more humour in this film than in the others, which does well to keep it from becoming perhaps too serious. There is really little fault I could find with the film, the only problem is if you haven t read the book it may be slightly confusing where parts of the story which have been missed out.

The movie tried a LOTR move by cutting out everything but the main ""Harry"" moments. I could deal with that, but in the end where Harry asks about the wands, Dumbledore just says ""Well, those things happen."" No explanation, nothing. At least in the first movies there was a point where the audience could figure out what happened. This movie is clueless and pointless, leaving more questions than answers. I was shocked that the script even included the mention of the Longbottoms' demise so folks could understand a little of Neville's reaction in the Dark Arts class.<br/><br/>It was a long book. The movie seemed to hire an amateur butcher to cut the film so it would fit in a certain run time. Next time, bring a bit more Rita Skeeter and the grand chewing out of Fudge (To set up for the next movie at least!).<br/><br/>I gave it a 3 out of 10. If I keep going, I'll be forced to lower it even more. The effects were good and I liked giving Neville more to do...but that's about it."

","Judging from other reviews, both professional and every day Joe, I must be the only one who did not like this movie or how the series is progressing. I realize that they cannot put everything from the book into the movie. /Goblet of Fire/ was an immense book and to condense it to 2 and a half hours is a major feat. That being said, this movie did not flow. It felt like the story was on fast forward all the time. The movie lacks the grace of the books. It also misses the history of the characters. Facts about Harry's parents are left out entirely in all the movies. These facts make the character of Harry Potter such a wonder and powerful. Being the ""Boy who Lived"" comes with history. THe movies ignore it just for bigger and louder special effects. I went to see Goblet in the hope that the new director might try to make amends but no. I doubt I will see any of the other movies as they come out. I will delight in the books and be first in line for the next one. I know that JKR tends to have a rather boring ""explanation"" section at the end of each of her books which does not translate, but there are ways to incorporate this info into the movie. That is just my two cents."

","I hated the first 3 movies and am one of the harshest critics of the Harry Potter Movies yet I came to the see it expecting disappointment. Instead I adored it. Although they missed out the Veila, the Dursleys (the only book in which I can bear them), most of the Barty Senior/Junior History and the Quiddich Cup I loved it. The Dark Mark was more dark and scary than i imagined (which was probably a good idea since I imagined it bright green and purple) as was the Death Eaters attack (way more scary) and I thought the Death Eaters masks were great, although most of my peers didn't get it because they didn't know anything about the KKK (hope that's right). <br/><br/>Although it was rushed some parts just weren't important enough, but I would have liked to have seen more of Victor Krum's personality and the leprechaun gold argument. I have always hated Daniel Radcliffe, loathed him, but after this movie I was gob-smacked. He can act! I dunno if it was the director, or he had grown up or something but it is obvious, THE BOY CAN ACT! Ron was also wicked, but I don't get why Hermione cried after the Ball. Voldemort was very good also and I liked the fact he looked human. <br/><br/>But the BEST part was when Harry came back from the graveyard after Cedric had died. and no-one had realised he was dead and they all began cheering and Harry was crying hysterically, I began crying. And mind you i have never before cried at a movie. Never. Not even at Titanic, Romeo and Juliet or Bambi. I cried for so long. It was the most moving piece of cinematic material this year."

","Having been an avid Harry Potter reader since I first picked up the books, I have to say that this movie was a disappointment. I realize that the movies are rarely accurate in comparison to the books, but my comments are less about accuracy and more about content and consistency. I'm not familiar with the director, but I found that the constant jumps from scene to scene were difficult to follow, and the characters were not as fully developed as in previous pictures. This director seems to have focused almost entirely on special effects; and while the effects where dazzling, they weren't enough to carry the story. I was also disappointed that once again the managers of the film chose to follow the ""time rule"" that is commonly used in the film industry today. The ""time rule"" allows for films to be no shorter than 60 minutes, and no longer than 3 hours. In the past, films have been allowed more time (Gone With the Wind was 3hrs. 42min.; Schindler's List was 3hrs. 15min.). Given the fact that the book was twice the (until then) usual length, the movie should have been allowed more time to flesh out the story and characters. I currently wait anxiously for the final book in the series, and only cautiously for the next film."
"elvis_impersonator678","8","0","0","15 December 2005"," Finally, a decent Potter film.
","Having been disappointed with the previous disjointed Potter films that seemed to hurtle through each storyline at such breakneck speed, Goblet of Fire is a real breath of relief. GoF seems to be where the franchise really finds it's feet and displays a confidence that finally allows the screen adaptation to step out aside of the rigidities of book adaptation; and all for the better.<br/><br/>Having read Rowling's fantastic Goblet of Fire in the run up to the film's release I entered the cinema with a fresh knowledge of the story as written. I could list the ways in which it differs to book, of which there are many, however, I feel this would be missing the point. As the film states, it is based on Rowling's novel. The books and the films are to me, two separate entities.<br/><br/>As a film, there is a real feeling of joy that has not been apparent in the previous films; the cast all exude a confidence in their roles and a camaraderie between each other that is wonderfully evident and of course, symptomatic of working together for so long. What a bonus that many of the actors seem to me to be the embodiment of the characters in the books, i.e. the Weasley twins, Neville, Ron, Malfoy, Filch, almost all of the teaching staff.<br/><br/>At last, here is the film that finally shows them off and allows them the chance to do so. This film deals with the themes of the book such as adolescence, isolation and romance more explicitly than the storyline itself, hence this is why many of the characters behave differently in the film and why many don't appear altogether. What has been compromised in content has been more than made up in the freedom from such detailing to the sheer enjoyment of Harry's world.<br/><br/>There have been complaints about the difference of behaviour in the characters than in the book but I believe this is necessary for the film because the characters simply can't be so complex in the short space of time available to achieve such a fluid story. Because of this I think some of the characters' behaviour on film suggests more revealingly what is yet to come...Enjoy."

","I loved the other Harry Potter movies, I really did but this one just left me disappointed. I went in with high hopes but they fizzled pretty soon due to the lack of character development, plot development and Dumbledore's atrocious accent (swinging from British to Texan all in the same sentence!!!)<br/><br/>The truth is, the movie seems more like a plot summary than an actual story. There is simply no depth to it.<br/><br/>There were wayyy too many (important!!!) details were left out and some scenes that were very important to understanding character development and motivation were glossed over or left out completely!!! Although I know most of us have read the books, I'm pretty sure that the ones who haven't? Well, they are probably *royally* confused.<br/><br/>if you saw the other ones and you enjoy the books, it makes sense to see this I guess (for the sake of continuity), but don't get your hopes up.

"WUMPUS-","6","0","0","14 December 2005"," Alright adaption - poor film
","Initially I was not going to see Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire because of my growing disillusionment with the franchise and the belief that it was undeserving of the massive economic success it enjoyed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately several weeks past and, feeling 'socially' obligated to see it, reluctantly attended a session with a couple of friends.<br/><br/>My first main problem with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the length - it was simply too long to maintain the audience's attention. The dialogue wasn't bad, but more often than not, Danniel Radcliffe seemed to be grunting, rather than acting. Many people have grown accustomed to the actors, saying ""they've grown into their roles"". I personally, still despise Ron and Harry. Hermione's lines are so short, or infrequent, that it is quite difficult to guage the depth of her portrayal.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire automatically assumes that you have already read the book and plunges into twists and plot idiosyncracies which would be difficult to understand if one hasn't.<br/><br/>Altogther, GoF simply isn't a good book to translate into a film - the plot is too extended, there are too many characters and no happy ending. In addition, there is no buildup of tension: the book and film just cruise along developing story until the final confrontation with Voldemort.<br/><br/>6/10 - Mainly because I'm feeling generous"
"harbeau","5","0","0","7 December 2005"," Harry at his very worst...
","I was, surprisingly, disappointed at the latest installment of this series.<br/><br/>We all want to see Harry as the hero. But in this latest, he does...very little that is heroic. In fact, he seems more like a bumbling fool that gets by mostly on luck than any real talent on his part. He is slipped most of his 'insights' from someone else. He mostly runs away from any hostile encounters. His only act that seems 'Harryish' was during an underwater scene. (I'll refrain from details to avoid spoilers). By the end of the movie, I had much more affinity and appreciation towards Hermione than Harry.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I'm sure that this was the way the writer wrote it, or at the very least the way the director portrayed it. I hope it leads somewhere. The cinematography was good, the characters were well-portrayed. The acting was what we have come to expect from this series.<br/><br/>A good flick to take your kids to on a Sunday matinée, but that's about it."

I liked the way Sirius was portrayed in the Fire, I liked the way that they showed Cedric Dying, I like they scene at the end, and I like the Gillyweed thing in the second task.<br/><br/>But they didn't go down to Hogsmeade, at all, PERIOD. They were supposed to have a meeting with Sirius there. Paff. They didn't show the Quidditch match at the very beginning (which was the reason the bloody Morsemorde event happened), not to mention the Weasley's ""Floo Powder Incident"" with them falling out the Chimney. Plus there was not one mention of the Weasley's in the sky-box, which introduces Barty Crouch, his son (supposedly), and their house~elf. The dark mark was supposed to have been conjured by Harry's wand. It wasn't, of course.<br/><br/>There was no mention of house~elves in the entire movie, which left me disappointed. I'm not entirely sure if SPEW was in this book or not, but if it was, the argument between Ron and Hermoine is classic!

","My congratulations go to Mike Newell. Despite the length and detail of the book, Mike maintained a good degree of loyalty to the story. Granted, there were a few skips and jumps, and the speed at which the events move were clear from the outset. I read all the books a number of times, and then saw each movie just after release. My expectation was not too high, because the kind of detail contained in the books would take much more than a single movie to exploit. This was evident in The Prisoner of Azkaban, and therefore it was often difficult to keep up with the plot.<br/><br/>In GOF, I found myself laughing and crying in equal measure, and found it to be thoroughly entertaining. The one lasting memory of this movie, is that of a 'class' product. The effects were not overdone, the acting was as good as any of the movies so far, and it certainly paves the way for the continuing story created with such spellbinding effect by Joanne Rowling. My best tip for the growing army of Harry Potter fans, is to treat the books, and the movies, as separate entities. If you allow yourself to judge one against the other, you will be left wanting.<br/><br/>All round, an extremely good movie, and well worth seeing."

"shroudoftheimmortal","8","0","0","13 December 2005"," The best of the bunch by far.
","I've never read any of the Harry Potter books. In fact, I hadn't even heard of the series until the fourth book, The Goblet of Fire, was published. My first trip in to the world of wizards, muggles, and Hogwart's was through the film adaptation of The Sorcerer's Stone, the first book/film in the series. I had no expectations going in. The previews looked no more than cute, and when the film premiered on HBO I tuned in, and for two hours I lived in Harry's world. It's not always a pleasant one for little Harry, who was only 10/11 at the time, but I enjoyed the trip.<br/><br/>The Chamber of Secrets and The Prisoner of Azkaban are the second and third books respectively in the Harry Potter series, and therefore the second and third film adaptations. I watched these when they premiered on HBO as well, but wasn't as impressed with either as I was with the first theatrical installment. It seemed that Rowling, or perhaps the folks at Warner BrothersI still haven't read any of the booksseemed to have found a ""formula"" in the first tale and stuck with it, but to a less satisfying end each time, not to say that stories as quirky as these could be condensed in to a formula. Don't get me wrong, I liked all three, but none matched the novelty of the first film for me.<br/><br/>Well, another year another Harry Potter film, and as with each installment Harry is one year older, 14 this time. And this one garnered a PG-13 rating. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the first Harry Potter book I heard of, and since I liked what they had done with the first three, and since this one is ""darker,"" ""more mature,"" I thought I'd pony up for the price of admission and see it in the theaters, a trip that was well worth it.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire usurps The Sorcerer's Stone as my favorite, and in my opinion is the best of the Harry Potter films to date. Yes, it lives up to its PG-13 rating; this one will scare the kids. But it is still a Harry Potter film. A new teacher arrives at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. We are suspicious of him. Professor Snape still lurks in the shadows. We are still suspicious of him. News paper headlines still read themselves to you, ghosts still roam the halls, and quidditch is still played (but kept to a minimum, thank you). But the kids are growing up. Dare I say that sexual tension is a theme? It is.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with a detailed rundown of the plot, but this year there is a ""Tri-Wizard Competition"" in which three schools compete. Hogwart's hosts the event, and one student from three schools is to be entered in to the competition, one student over 17. Mind you that Harry is only 14. But someone drops his name in to the Goblet of Firethis person isn't identified until the end of the movie, but we all know who it is from the starta magical goblet that selects the students to take part in the tourney, and the movies namesake. Of course, Harry's name is selected.<br/><br/>There are three death defying challenges that Harry meets with his usual reluctance and courage. But something's not right at Hogwart's, again. Not only is Harry having nightmares involving Wormtail (from The Prisoner of Azkaban), Voldemort (the murderer of Harry's parents, and the heretofore unseen in all his glory arch nemesis of Harry), and a mystery man. There is something amiss indeed.<br/><br/>This 2½ hour flick is worth is for the truly suspenseful conclusion alone, but you get more than just build up to that conclusion. The characters start to come alive in ways they haven't in the other movies. Yes, they're growing up and discovering the opposite sexes, but that's not all. The actors seem to be growing in to their roles. I can't wait for the next installment. Harry Potter just may be able to live up to all the hype before all is said and done."

","Like it or not, the primary audience for the Harry Potter films are fans of the Harry Potter books. And if you are one of the 80%+ of the box office who saw Goblet of Fire after having read the book, you were possibly very disappointed. The Harry Potter fans seem to be split 60-40 in favor of this film missing critical scenes and I wholly agree.<br/><br/>The film is exciting and fun and full of energy just like the previous three. It is also paced well and when it was over I was surprised to find it was 2.5 hours long. The problem in my opinion, is that they should have made it longer than that.<br/><br/>For starters, if people will sit through 3 hours of Tolkein's often difficult-to-follow storyline, they will surely sit that long for an easy, better-paced storyline like those in the Harry Potter films. Despite what is often said about Ms. Rowling controlling the script, the studio pays for the film and obviously trumped her, cutting critical scenes from the book including all but one involving Sirius Black (portrayed by Gary Oldman). The absence of Sirius is nothing short of a tragedy as his relationship with Harry is crucial to on-going story lines of the next two books/films. He is also obviously the most talented thespian in the cast - why cut his scenes?<br/><br/>They also cut the opening scenes with the Harry's aunt, uncle & cousin which are always a hoot. They cut an unnecessary subplot involving the house elves (I did not miss this, though it could be argued this has value down the line). They re-worked the whole story of Barty Crouch (for the worse, I would argue). And they unforgivably cut the absolutely critical ending in which Snape and Sirius actually shake hands and agree to fight Voldemort together - on Dumbledore's orders. This also happens to be the first time Molly Weasley is let in on the fact that Sirius is a good guy. In my opinion, the film should have ended on a tight shot of the shaking hands, music up and fade to black - a perfect ending, much more in line with the way the novel ends.<br/><br/>As I said, I enjoyed this film, but not as much as I would have with another 30 minutes in which they could have shown the above scenes as well as more of the Tri-Wizard Tournament (Harry's own performances against the dragon and the maze make up most of the tourney coverage - I would liked to have seen some of the other folks against their dragons) and more of Gary Oldman. The notion he was 'unavailable for filming' and that is why only his oddly-graphically-enhanced face appears for less than a minute in the entire film is ludicrous. The film took eight months to shoot and he lives in England, for cripes sake!<br/><br/>I give it a B- wishing it could be an A."

","I'm probably one of the few people on this planet that's not bothered to read the telephone books posing as fantasy novels. So I've gone into each of the Potter movies expecting little other than to be entertained for a few hours, without any knowledge of the plot nor the surprises - expect it would be impossible not to know who's going to die in the next movie... but I digress.<br/><br/>I've not felt compelled to comment on the previous movies as I found them all thoroughly enjoyable, both on a story level and on an eye-candy level. Not totally mind blowing - but just good movies that was worth a chunk of my cinema budget.<br/><br/>This movie was definitely strong on the eye candy... totally delicious effects artwork. The dragons took my breath away, and some of the magic effects were stunning. But plot wise, I found it boring, contrived, and very ""slapped together"". The plot was so straight forward and predictable that I was scratching my head wondering where the playful plots had gone. The not-so-subtle introduction of attraction to the opposite gender I felt was tacky and unimaginative, the tension between Harry and Ron was bordering on laughable. The almost complete lack of subplots too made this movie far too shallow for my liking.<br/><br/>I felt the acting was flat too - which is odd given the far better performances in the previous movies, when the actors were younger and less experienced. I'm no movie expert, but I'd be pointing my cuss wand at the director and possibly their acting coaches for that.<br/><br/>Still... I felt the chunk of my movie budget was fairly applied - definitely worth seeing this on the big screen, albeit as disappointed in the result as I was. I hope the next movie is better done."

","First of all I have to admit - that I have never read a Harry Potter novel. However, I have seen all the movies and there was no one which I completely disliked. However, I felt that they where very different from each other and I have my favorites. These are definitely HP1 and the new HP4!! HP1 was full of magic and cute ideas, perfectly brought into scene by director Chris Columbus.<br/><br/>HP2 was -- nice, but there was nothing in this film, that appeared to me especially noteworthy. HP3 was a good movie, but to my taste much to dark and scary for the envisaged audience.<br/><br/>HP4 makes these flaws completely forgotten! It features a highly dramatic plot with state-of-the-art visual effects. Well, nothing new for a HP movie. But the very special thing about this ""Potter"" is that the main characters become more complicate because they become older! The feelings and problems of growing-up are well portrayed and the cast does a really good job (as in every HP), especially Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley). Throughout the movie you are not sure what is harder for our young sorcerers - chatting with the other gender or encountering the evil forces. Director Mike Newell is able to create a very sensible and enjoyable picture of these conflicts - never forgetting that a Harry Potter has first to fight against monsters and dark powers and secondly has to resolve emotional problems...<br/><br/>This movie is just very well balanced. What I have missed were some of the funny gimmicks and characters which are so common for Hogwarts in earlier movies, like the ghosts, Dobby and other things. Things become highly dramatic rapidly and there is no space for extra-jokes in the densely packed plot. This is a little pity but understandable - the movie lasts for more than 3 hours! <br/><br/>At last I would like to point out the excellent music score! It is the first HP with a soundtrack not composed by senior maestro John Williams. Well one can say, that successor Patrick Doyle made a really great job, and I decided to buy the soundtrack CD before the last line of the end titles vanished from the screen."

","My thoughts on GoF I just went to see GoF yesterday and can I just say that this may be the best HP movie yet, tying (sp?) with PoA.<br/><br/>Note: If you haven't seen GoF yet....stop reading here because I think I am giving away what I think are the best parts of the movie.<br/><br/>My favorite parts of the movie: too numerous to mention, but here are a few highlights: The beginning with the snake, Nagini (great name for a baby IMO), which moves right along into the appearance of the Holy Trinity---er, um, Trio. Man, is Rupert Grint getting fit all of a sudden?<br/><br/>Plus that short Quidditch sequence reminded of a cross between the Super Bowl, The X Games, and World Cup Soccer, all in one. Now if they had a brawl, that would have been awesome and funny.<br/><br/>The Twins, pure frat boys, those two. What Warner Brothers need to do is give James and Oliver Phelps their own movie! <br/><br/>How about the fallout between Harry and Ron and the crazy makeup afterward? All I can say is leave it to men ('cause, let's face it, Dan and Rupert are practically men at this point!) to find ways NOT to say ""oops what a jackass I was to doubt you!"" ""Hey it wasn't like I had told you in the beginning it wasn't me!"" I loved how Ron turned that skid around to make it look like he told Harry about the dragons...and loved Hermione's response: ""Boys!"" <br/><br/>Couldn't have said it better myself.<br/><br/>The Three Tasks sequences were dark and lovely, esp. when Harry fought that dragon outside the stadium. That dragon was like the Energizer Bunny, it just kept going and going and going.....until Harry kicked his ass! <br/><br/>The Yule Brawl, I mean, Ball was cool. I loved how it started all classy and everything and went all dark and alternative with the appearance of the Weird Sisters. I wished my prom had been like that. Man, the sparks that flew between Ron and Hermione was enough to start a five alarm fire. <br/><br/>I noticed how cool Ron was and how insanely angry Hermione was, and then I got to thinking ""Rupert is a Virgo in real life and Virgos tend to stay away from arguments, especially when they know they are gonna get ugly. Since I don't know Emma's sign, my guess is she might be a Scorpio, because we Scorps love confrontation, and as much as we love that, we also love being the Drama Queens too."" <br/><br/>Right now the only perfect song that could have gone with this sequence would have been ""Careless Whisper"" by George Michael. (Trust me on this, just listen to the lyrics and think about this sequence when you do) <br/><br/>The entrance of the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons...Everybody say ""Soul Train."" Even I was jamming to their entrances! And did you see how Ron was checking out the Beauxbatons.....you could almost hear him say ""Damn!"" <br/><br/>Now to the two scenes that are gonna cause controversy if they keep talking about too much (which makes what I am about to say utterly pointless and redundant): <br/><br/>When Rita Skeeter (love that name along with Nagini and Fritzy Rodriguez, not a character, but a name I came across one day) interviews HP for the Daily Prophet and they go into that cramped broom closet....was it just me or was she seriously coming onto Harry? The only thing that came to my mind was ""Meeeeee andddd Mrs.,Mrs Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs Jones.....we got a thing going on!"" (That's from an early '70's song, if anybody is old enough to remember that song.) <br/><br/>The Hot Tub scene with Moaning Myrtle....I can see why she was moaning!!! She was trying to get a peek at Harry's----ahem----""goods.""<br/><br/>Go on Myrtle, Go on with your bad dead self! <br/><br/>No wonder they made this thing PG-13. Next thing you know she'll being propositioning him, a la ""The Graduate"" (""Why, Moaning Myrtle, I do believe you are trying to seduce me!""), she's old enough.....<br/><br/>Ron's threads for the Ball, just one word: Prince, if he and the Revolution went to Hogwarts. He looked like he wore the leftover wardrobes that Prince wouldn't be caught dead wearing onstage. In fact, all Ron was missing was those high-heeled boots, Wendy, Lisa, Appollonia and Morris Day and you got ""Purple Rain"" Harry Potter style.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was great, especially Rupert's. This young man is getting ready to breakout in the worst way, he still outshines no matter if he's making funny faces or comments, or conveying every emotion in the book. He is still is my favorite. And it doesn't hurt to look good either.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, I could go either way, but even I have to say that he was really good this time around. Emma Watson's acting was OK, but her best moment was in the Yule Ball/Brawl with Rupert. Jealous much? All in all, this was the best $6.00 I ever spent and I plan on seeing it again after my finals are done.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, get up off your ass and see it, you will not be disappointed!"

But for Harry, this isn't the only news causing him anxiety -- he still has to find a date for the Yule Ball. AND ALL THAT JUST IN 2AND A HALF HOURS!!! THIS IS THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR!!! I WOULD GIVE 10 VOTES JUST FOR THE SCENE IN A BATH !!! lol THAT IS HILARIOUS!!!"

","I was disappointed from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I doubt that even if I have not read the book in advance I would like it. It doesn't offer anything new  and I have to say that I was bored till its end. The length of the movie is more than enough to allow more detailed representations of the events in the book.<br/><br/>Only the effects were good  I liked the way the dragons were made and the chase scene was well made. Still if you are one of the Harry Potter fans like me you may enjoy seeing yet another representation of the book. My opinion is that the previous parts were much better filmed.<br/><br/>The overall atmosphere was dark  with less scenes exterior scenes. In addition the acting of many of the actors were not enough persuasive. Especially of the Victor Crum."

","I thought that the film wasn't as good as i hoped to be. I waited for the film all year and when it finally came i was disappointed. Somehow i didn't fell the ""magic"" of the film. I didn't leave the theater:""OH!!my god what a great movie!!""They really left out a few parts. I've read the book three times and knew all the details, but for those who have seen only the film it was harder to understand. When Krum attacked Fleur, there was no explanation why, only this one sentence:""Viktor was bewitched.""At the end Dumbledore didn't explain what Priori Incantatem meant.At the beginning the Dark Mark was cast from Harry's wand, they didn't mention that.The gillyweed was given by Dobby not by Neville.I think it would have been more spectacular if they would have shown how the others got the golden egg or at least mention how they got it.They never actually mentioned what Moody was drinking from his bottle.Of course it was Polyjuice Potion. ...........something else i didn't like in the movie:the two girls who went with Harry and Ron to the bal.Come on, what are Indian girls do in england? That scene was so laim when Harry and Ron were sitting alone with their dates and everyone was dancing.Is Harry that stupid??? P.S.:Hermione was HOT though:))!...that's from me, take care"
"sshamba","9","0","0","12 December 2005"," Great Special Effects, good adaptation
","This was the best Harry Potter movie so far (however not by much as the first two movies were also great). Daniel Radcliff certainly has developed as an actor. While in the third movie he was completely unsure of himself, in this movie he is certainly holding his own against some of the best Brits in the business not to mention Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, both of whom are excellent. The story adaptation is best that it could be, given the sheer complexity of the book. The special effects are great. The only thing that I could find wrong with the movie is Micheal Gambon's acting. I think he has Dumbledore completely wrong. He screams and yells and acts bewildered where the word that I would associate with Dumbledore is ""calm."" Richard Harris had Dumbledore down cold and I wish Micheal Gambon could learn a little from his example."

","I've heard that the original cast won't be casted in anymore Harry Potter movies after the one that comes out in 2007 is finished. (I heard the reason was that they're getting to old for the parts.) And again I'm not sure whether this theory is true or not. If so, I believe that not having the original cast would be lame because you pratically grow up with them. I work at a movie theater so I work with a load of movie freaks. They know everything when it comes to movies. And the rumor going around was about Harry Potter. So once again, does anyone know if the original cast will be playing in the movie after the one that comes out in 2007? If anyone knows if this is true, please inform me whenever possible. Thanks.<br/><br/>Or perhaps the next movie will be the last....anyone know?"

","Hard to say whether this flick deserves a 4 or higher. But for a book with 750+ pages, we should've seen this a mile away that it was going to be a piece-meal of a film. Too bad they ditched the idea of making an extended version. The actual story would actually benefit from the added footage. As it is now, it skips along grabbing only the more important aspects of the Tri-wizard Tournament, making those that read the book, gaping in utter disgust as to how they butchered the story. I'm sure if they added say 20-30 minutes more, it would probably have flowed so smooth that you wouldn't have noticed that it was three hours long.<br/><br/>As for the acting, four films later and it still seems that the kids are trying too hard to actually ""act"" than act as the kids they are supposed to be. Dialog is forced and Daniel just seems to try too hard or just doesn't get it.<br/><br/>Out of the four movies, I'd say this is the worst of the book translations. Which means the rest of the series, knowing full well that they're tipping the 750-800+ pages we've come to love, will probably be just as spliced as this one is.<br/><br/>Too bad. The book rocked. The movieis typical Hollywood."

","I have to admit, I'm a 23 yr old male - not exactly the target audience for Harry Potter - but as each movie comes out, I become more and more of an avid fan. This movie is superb, as are all its predecessors. The movie is a little darker than the previous 3, and has all the usual subtleties and beautiful attention to detail.<br/><br/>The tri-wizard tournament scenes are all fantastic, the special effects are flawless as always - and the maze is mind-boggling. The ending is sad, but makes the movie less of a fairy-tale story, where all characters always survive. I'm certainly not a book-reader, but I've now started reading the Order of the Pheonix, because I simply can't wait 2yrs to find out what happens next! This is undoubtedly one of the best few films out this year, don't miss it."

","The last two Harry Potter movies were very forgettable. They seemed to be too much of an impossible adventure as opposed to a story. They didn't follow the book very closely and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The Goblet of Fire, with a new director, seems to be a cut above the rest. Yes, the terribly awkward dialog is still there. They try to suck as many cheap laughs out of Ron Weasley and the Weasley brothers as possible, and it gets old. Harry is a terrible actor, Ron is even worse, Hermoine is way too dramatic to be considered realistic. Yes, those last second miracles are still here. Harry finds himself about to meet his certain doom and then WOOSH! Someone comes dashing in to save him at the last second. That situation seems to be reoccuring over and over in the series, but we are used to it now and have to grudgingly accept it. Despite the gaping holes, they are not as big holes as the first three movies. I really enjoyed the direction, the film came off much darker. There was more attention given to little details, and some excellent shots of scenery, etc. The graphics seemed to be much improved, although still very cheesy at times. If you didn't like the first three movies don't worry. This one still has some of the basic mistakes, but is better at the same time. You should enjoy it."

","I am not denying the fact this film was brilliant and the special effects were fantastic, yet i could not help but feel disappointed by the lack of attention to detail, yes i realise that would make a 10 hour film, but such little things like slightly more emphasis on the match, which i was looking forward to, with the Veela and team mascots. Instead i find the Veela are particularly normal looking girls who don't have the intense effect as described in the book. In the first film attention to such little things as the assorted beans were a delightful touch. I also find that Voldermort was oddly normal looking with a menacing nose, another let down. The fights with the dragon was superb and would have loved to see the rest of the fights, but lack of time wouldn't of allowed it. Although true to the story, people who have read the book will agree, there was so much plot and so little of the magic anymore. A slight let down. 7 out of 10."

","I only give the movie a 4, and its only a 4 because if the graphics and the art of the film, nothing to do with the plot or story line. I was very disappointed with this film. Being a HP fan, I read the book only a week ago so I knew what was meant to happen before seeing the movie...and the result..disappointment. <br/><br/>The movie was rushed. they went from one scene to the next within a matter of seconds. one second we're at the Quiditch game, the next we're at school being told about the tri wizard. The next Cedric's dead and voldermort is back. I felt like i was in the cinema for merely half an hour. It did not feel like 2 and a half hours. <br/><br/>They missed SO much important information out. And this is only important for those ppl who have read the books (which I would say is 70% of the population of the world). I can list everything they missed out, but I would be hear for ever! Winky, Crousch going mad, the story of crouch's son and wife, the REAL story behind the fight between harry and Ron, how Hermione and krum met, the truth about Neville's parents (i believe it was mentioned but not enough for it to stick in your mind, Ludo Bagman..oh i could go on.<br/><br/>The only thing I found interesting about the movie is the graphics, the dragons were great, the scenery were great, everything was great, just the story line was rushed and missing. <br/><br/>My advice, ppl who haven't read the book go see it, ppl who have, give up on the movies.<br/><br/>Question- what about the next movie? they are going to have to miss out a HEAP of things just to cover this movie and then the next movie is going to have the plot missing and so forth."
"Rich B","6","0","0","5 December 2005"," Too fast paced, some poor moments, but darker and scarier than the others to date.
","Straight up though I have to say, I wasn't as impressed at this movie as I was by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, for me that movie is still the best of the Harry Potter series, but now not by much. For this movie is a very close second.<br/><br/>It is, as everyone seems to agree, much darker than the other movies and I really do like this aspect. It's a well written story, and seems to lead things well to the next instalment. The tension and suspense are built well throughout, towards a strong and fitting climax. Some have said that the ending is confusing if you haven't read the books, I do disagree although you'll obviously have had to have seen the movies.<br/><br/>The effects are superb, and the best of the series to date. You just have to watch the Dragons in action to understand what I mean, they are stunning creations and totally believable too. As are the effects in the underwater sequence, a sequence that is well edited and provides one of the most powerful and scariest moments of the film. This is surely where its rating comes from. Yet it's a perfect scene to provide the more adult issues facing Potter and his friends, and shows that his life is becoming more serious and more involved with events outside of his school world.<br/><br/>However, there are issues I have with this movie and some with the whole series itself. For instance, Potter is a wizard and he's in a wizard school, and yet you hardly ever see him casting spells and he openly says that his strong point is flying. I don't get this, and I realise there are differences in the books, but I'm talking about the movies, and in these he appears as a bottom of the class wizard. Indeed this is the first time I remember him casting successful spells. Then, with all that, he goes on to fight one of the most powerful creatures in the universe, or so we're led to believe. For me that's quite a leap in the story.<br/><br/>This last battle also comes to a very contrived ending which seems far too convenient, appearing as it does out of absolute nowhere. It's a ""get out clause"" that appears just in time and is explained later on. For me this reeks of the characters being written into a corner and a quick backdoor being created for them. I really didn't like this moment.<br/><br/>The entire movie seems harshly and overly edited, there was barely time to keep up as we leapt from pivotal scene to pivotal scene with rarely a breather for character development or backstory. You could tell this has been seriously cut down. Scenes seemed to begin late and end early, with characters just appearing ready to go. For me this didn't have the affect of keeping up the pace but actually harming it and racing on too fast with the story.<br/><br/>The acting is interesting among the younger cast in this movie, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have an awkwardness about him, and perhaps that's him playing the character, but it's apparent in most scenes where emotions are called for.<br/><br/>Emma Watson will have to mature some and learn to tone down her acting, for she was guilty of overacting at times. Yet I can see her becoming a big star in the future. She has the looks and you can see great performances in her.<br/><br/>Surprisingly it was Rupert Grint that provided the best performance from the young cast for me. He just seemed so natural in every scene, and so believable.<br/><br/>Overall I was impressed by the effects and the darkness of the story, yet the editing and the too pacey story meant that I didn't have time to follow the pace of the movie rather I had to race to keep up. I suspect this may take another viewing to appreciate it, or perhaps even a fuller DVD version, but for me this falls in as the second best Potter movie to date."
"ricks1978","8","0","0","12 December 2005"," Good, but leaves you hanging-sort of.......
","First off...if you love Harry Potter, have seen all of them up until now, then you NEED to see this to set the stage for the next. If you don't really care about Harry Potter, then this movie is not the best one, and is actually different in a fews ways. But as a movie by itself, it would be a strange place to start if you have never seen a Harry Potter movie....it is:<br/><br/>Darker (Much!)<br/><br/>MUCH more serious, very little laughs....<br/><br/>Airier, but somehow seems a lot less scaled<br/><br/>Deals with Teen sexuality, or the beginning of it<br/><br/>Deals with pitiful jealousy issues, where Ron goes on a tantrum with Harry being in the spotlight, getting into the Tri-Wizard Tournament, etc...for starters, Harry Potter will never be a nobody, and Ron knows this. For two, it seems Ron easily forgets that Harry is one of the only people ever to treat him as an equal, being that the Weasley's are J.K. Rowlings version of hard working lower middle class people(wizards). Also, does Ron not remember all the times Harry has saved his neck along with everyone else? Even Hermione seemed to be angry, more reclusive, and the three would never be called best friends unless you saw them before. Strange also, they are his best friends, but abandon him when he needs them the most, where he stands the most potential threat he has faced yet. Friends just aren't like they used to be!<br/><br/>Is a transition piece, taking Harry Potter from small kids to young adults and beyond<br/><br/>The summary will make you wonder what all the other fuss is about!<br/><br/>This movie is almost IDENTICAL to the book, with the book having a little more drama and background material, as expected. I read the book first, and the only thing I can really remember that is different is that Hargid is more active in the book, and is having trouble with his love interest, who more rejects him in the book than in the movie. This is a good thing, and bad thanks to the strange and dry material. Like most transitions, some will like the change, some won't!<br/><br/>This movie just seemed...emptier...hard to explain. Plenty of thrills, and new material...but just missing some of the magic from the first 3...<br/><br/>Did I just see a nude scene with Moaning Myrtle and Harry Potter frolicking in a bath tub? NO WAY.....<br/><br/>The main concentration on this film is the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and if you have not read the book (which I can't suggest you do before or after, probably read it after the movie) hides the true plot of the movie, a confrontation between Harry Potter and Voldemort. The scene where this takes place is in a very nicely done Cemetery, and Ralph Fiennes does a perfect job as the dark lord himself (see devil). The first three movies failed to show Voldemort, at least not as his recent carnation. This movie does a great job of making it worth the wait!<br/><br/>The settings and special effects are top notch, and nicely done. <br/><br/>I never thought I would see DeathEaters (Devil worshipers), limb sacrifices, and so much sexual tension in a Harry Potter movie. <br/><br/>Richard Harris was the best suited person to play Dumbledorf, and I was saddened to hear he died, but I had trouble seeing a new person play as him (how I learned Richard Harris died) but I actually liked the way Micheal Gambon played as him in this movie (still not as good as Richard Harris would have done!) <br/><br/>The people from the other schools just seemed too lifeless, and it was hard to see what attracted Harry, Ron, and Hermione to them other than Fleur's looks (pretty for a younger girl). Also Cho, though cute, has a weird personality. Then again, in high school and grade school I also liked people who were similar so I guess it is very real!<br/><br/>I must also say that I like some things more about the last 2 Harry Potter movies, and something about the first 2....I like the creepiness of the last 2, with the Dementors, Voldemort, murder, and the more adult orientated movie type. The problem has been that the light hearted themes are becoming less and less. Sure, there is still laughs, but less wonder and maybe things are a bit too serious. A nice mixture of, hate to say it, ""cuteness"", laughs, and with plenty of dark material, creepiness, murder, lies, deceit...hopefully the next Harry Potter movies will live up to that. There again, if you love Harry Potter...see it!!! I cannot wait to read ""Order of the Phoenix"" and then see the movie, I have heard it's awesome!"

","As much as I love the books, I hafta say that the movies kinda rot. They didn't insist upon John Williams for the 4th score, they've changed directors how many times, and they used different filming techniques. There is little continuity, though the sets of the 3rd and 4th are closer in similarity than from the first two... I realize it's a 733 page book, but they should have at least ensured that viewers would understand the plot without having read the book first. The climax was rushed, the tension not nearly as steep as the original work. They didn't supply reasons as to why certain events happened. Mff, okay that's all I have to say."
"Sane88","7","0","0","11 December 2005"," Is it a good movie? Yes.....Is it too rushed? Yes.
","I saw this film the night it was released, and I had been waiting a very long time for this one, and what I expected to see was a masterpiece. What I got in return was a choppy and rushed film. The scenes were too rushed, a lot of major plot points were missing that should have been there, and the scenes that needed to be cut were there instead. The Tri-Wizard tournament was good, but there were things in those tasks that were importantly missing, and parts added that were never there in the first place. Now, nevertheless, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire stands as the best book turned movie in the Potter franchise. Some reasons: The new director, Mike Newell, is the first Brit to direct a Potter film, and he brings some good humor and visuals to 'Goblet.' His ability to create a world of happiness and darkness at the same time was remarkable.<br/><br/>He also brought some good performances out of the child actors as well as the adults. Daniel Radcliffe has grown into his Harry Potter role quite nicely; Emma Watson makes a very pretty and still always on top of things, Hermione Granger; and Rupert Grint was hilarious as the clumsy, red headed Ron Weasley. As for the adults, they handles their scenes professionally and charismatically, except for Michael Gambon, whose Dumbledore doesn't do it for me. The grandfather figure that we would expect from Dumbledore is no where to be found, and the replacement over the great Richard Harris still stands as a bad choice in my opinion.<br/><br/>The two stand outs, however, are Michael Glesson as Mad Eye Moody and Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>Glesson brings a strong presence to his role, and he brought Alaster Moody out just the way I had pictured him, even if he is a tad bit zany. As for Fiennes, his Voldemort was right on target. Not over the top, with a cold, perfect subtleness that is chillingly scary, Fiennes gives Voldemort an evilness we rarely see in a lot of movies these days. Plus, his lack of nose made it even cool.<br/><br/>So, finally, Harry Potter 4 is a good book turned movie for entertainment, and it stands at number 1. For story telling and plot, and ranks at the bottom. I'm sorry, Mike Newell and the Potter team, it was a good effort. Just next time, I would suggest reading other chapters besides the chapters on the Tri-Wizard Tournament."

"psi_fla","8","0","0","11 December 2005"," The Harry Potter franchise is maintaining a high standard
","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has entered his fourth year at Hogwarts' school of witchcraft and wizardry. Both him and his best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are into their teenage years and are having to face the trials and tribulations that come with them. Harry will face a greater trial than either of them, though, when he is selected to perform in the deadly Tri-Wizard tournament...<br/><br/>One thing that has struck me about the adaptations of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books is that they have just kept on getting better with age. The Prisoner Of Azkaban was an improvement over the Chamber Of Secrets, which in turn was an improvement over the disappointing Philosopher's Stone.<br/><br/>I knew that Mike Newell had a hard act to follow when he took the responsibility of bringing The Goblet Of Fire to the screen. After all, according to yours truly, Alfonso Cuaron had not only improved ""on (Chris) Columbus's (two) Potter instalments more than we could have expected"", but he had created ""a Potter film that truly stands on its own."" The bad news is that the run of improvement seems to have come to a halt. The good news is that The Goblet Of Fire really is no worse than the last instalment. I can't say that it stands too well on its own (indeed, character familiarity will help) but this is a very minor complaint. This is a fast moving and energetic adventure capable of being enjoyed by all members of the family.<br/><br/>It's as if Newell realised that he would not be able to match the dark atmosphere Alfonso Cuaron created - indeed, I have heard that he did not have as big a budget to work with - but he has focused on his skills with actors, personal issues and storytelling. Despite a slow start to the film, those skills are very much in evidence.<br/><br/>The problems associated with adolescence are dealt with capably and in an entertaining fashion, and there is a wide array of striking set pieces for fans and non-fans to enjoy. The way Chris Columbus handled the Quidditch match in the first film now seems rather limp compared to the treats that Cuaron and now Newell have served up. Although the ""wow"" factor in terms of special effects is down from the previous film, there's still some delightful visual moments. That, and the film seems scarier than before.<br/><br/>The acting appears better than it ever was. Never mind the criticism that is being directed at the acting ability and ageing of the three leads - Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter. The same is true of Rupert Grint & Emma Watson and their respective characters. I wrote last year that the best thing to do would be to hang on to the young leads for as long as possible, for stability's sake, and I maintain that stance. My only concern is that nearly all credibility will be lost by the time The Half Blood Prince comes around.<br/><br/>Every other regular (including a returning Jason Isaacs) is as solid as ever. Newcomers include a rather giggly Miranda Richardson as an irritating journalist, Brendan Gleeson as probably the most interesting (and bizarre) Hogwarts teacher of them all, and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort himself. As if this wasn't enough, we have David ""Doctor Who"" Tennant playing somebody who's rotten to the core (this actor is more versatile than you think) and Jarvis Cocker making a surprise cameo.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, The Goblet Of Fire has not improved on The Prisoner Of Azkaban, but it has maintained a standard that we can only hope The Order Of The Phoenix will match.<br/><br/>David Yates, the camera is yours.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"
"charliehorsefrenchfry","Null","0","0","11 December 2005"," Plot
","I am very disappointed with the way that they butchered the plot of the fourth Harry Potter book when it was made into a film. They skipped many important parts, and the parts they did include were short and not satisfying to myself (ie. Quidditch World Cup). I was disappointed in the lack of linear-acy. It was hard to follow what was going on, as large periods of time were skipped over. I knew only because I had read the book. And why is Ludo Bagman not in the movie? And where are Dobby and Winky? Sirius was supposed to be in Hogsmede, and they were supposed to go see him and bring him chicken. He was also supposed to be in the hospital wing with Harry at the end, and Snape is supposed to finally know its him. The third task was also butchered, as there were no magical creatures inside. The disagreement of Fudge and Dumbledore was entirely skipped over at the end. The champions should have had more to do with the movie.<br/><br/>Although I am disappointed, I must say that some scenes were quite well done, including the first and second tasks, as well as the scene where Voldemort comes back. I also enjoyed the fact that Krum said next to nothing, if anything, and found that absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very curious to find out how they will bridge the gaps they made in the fifth movie. It will most definitely be interesting."
"Keith_Sparrow4","4","0","0","10 December 2005"," Truly Pathetic.
","The first two ""Harry Potter"" movies were disappointing, but were still good enough to re-watch. After seeing ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", I thought that the movies were finally shaping up, and that they would, like the third volume, take on the mood displayed in the books. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was truly a masterpiece, the fourth installment in the popular series was horrible. The movie was cut in the most awkward places, and the director neglected some important details. Some of the characters were pathetic, as was the movie itself. This director changed the wise and calm character known as Albus Dumbledore into a crazy, temperamental old man. In the books, Dumbledore is one of my favorite characters, and is wise, calm, thoughtful, and humorous. In this movie, he is constantly shouting and he gives off a feeling of anger and frustration, something which J.K. Rowling's character never does. The newly-introduces Alastor Moody hardly fits Rowlings's description and to top things off, they made him look even more pathetic thanks to the ridiculous eye patch-like device conceived to hold his magical eye. His appearance alone was nearly enough to make me want to leave...and that was before I saw the rest of the movie! The director tried to add in some humor. Unfortunately, added in way too much, and the end result had me rolling my eyes and wanting the movie to go on. The bath scene with Moaning Myrtle was simply ridiculous too. What a waste of precious screen time. Oh, and what about the time Harry found Crouch's dead body, ran to Dumbledore, but never mentioned it? The only part of the movie that was done decently was the scene with Voldemort. That was truly a success. The rest wasn't even worth seeing."
"MaxBorg89","9","0","0","10 December 2005"," Harry Potter Episode IV: Return of the Dark Times
","In issue 107 of Total Film, in an article about 2005's summer blockbusters' commercial success, it was said that if Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire had been released during the summer, we would have witnessed the ultimate box-office war: Potter vs. Star Wars (Revenge of the Sith was the most successful movie among those listed in the magazine). That article's author was right: it would have been a huge battle, since both HP4 and ROTS are the best episodes of their respective franchises (actually, ROTS shares the title with The Empire Strikes Back) and both deal with more mature situations and characters, as evil is about to make its triumphant return. And in the case of both movies, the PG-13 rating was justified, the darkness factor being doubled compared to previous installments (in the case of Goblet of Fire, we've also got a few puberty-related gags and dialogues which aren't exactly suitable for everyone). But enough with the Star Wars comparisons, let's talk about the teen wizard's individual merits.<br/><br/>The most important thing is perhaps the new director, Mike Newell, who, knowing that it would be impossible to adapt the entire book, chooses to ditch most of the early section (chapters 2-5 are entirely missing) so that he can focus on the core of the movie: the Triwizard Tournament, a competition between wizardry schools in which Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is selected as the Hogwarts champion. This raises suspicions because a) he is too young to compete, and b) he did not put his name in the titular goblet, a magical object which selects the contestants. Add the fact that Voldemort's mark has started showing up again, and it is pretty clear this might be the teen wizard's most unusual year thus far.<br/><br/>Because of the action/thriller-style plot, Newell does not just skip the introductory chapters, he also leaves most of the funny bits out, with the exception of the Yule Ball and the previously mentioned teenage-gags, proving he hasn't lost the sense of humor audiences learned to know in Four Weddings and a Funeral (minus the frequent swearing, of course). However, fans needn't worry: unlike Alfonso CuarÃ²n, who directed the third Potter opus, Newell hasn't cut subplots that will affect the sense of the main story, making Goblet of Fire the most enjoyable installment in the franchise. (I didn't actually realize several subplots has been left out until I came back home after the viewing).<br/><br/>The other important element, as always with the HP saga, is the cast: the original actors are still convincing and use all their screen time extremely well(particularly Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman, their roles being downsized to cameos), and the new entries are good too: Miranda Richardson is brilliant in her comic turn as gossip-journalist Rita Skeeter (as opposed to her villain in Sleepy Hollow), David Tennant is remarkably effective as Death-Eater Barty Crouch Jr.(I'm curious to see what he'll be like as the new Doctor Who next year), and a special mention is required for Brendan Gleeson, who plays new teacher ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, part funny, part creepy, all weird...<br/><br/>But of course, there is one character in particular everybody's been waiting for since the saga began, one whose presence shouldn't be anything less than hard to forget: Lord Voldemort. And memorable he is, played with smug unpleasantness by Ralph Fiennes. Having previously sunk his teeth in disturbing roles in Schindler's List and Red Dragon, he knows exactly how to make the best of his limited yet precious minutes, endowed with the same unsettling charisma that defined Christopher Lee's Saruman and Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine (shoot, another Star Wars comparison!), with whom he forms what seems to be the trinity of great 21st century screen villains.<br/><br/>A perfect entry in one of the biggest franchises ever, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ensures the magic is kept alive, and it leaves David Yates, the director of the fifth movie, with a big challenge: make a film that can live up to this one.<br/><br/>9,5/10"

","Do books ruin movies, or do movies ruin books? If you can get past the vast amount of material that didn't make the cut for Goblet of Fire, then the answer will hopefully be neither. If not, then I sure hope for your sake that the Narnia movie stays true to Lewis. Being an old Tolkien hand myself, I am able to appreciate just what a good job the writers did compacting a truly enormous book without losing the important points. Were there no faults? Au contraire, Fleur. Characters were not nearly as developed, scenes lacked some of the humor, impact or exposition that a novel allows. Some key points in the book were changed since the explanations were too lengthy to even consider. It was still far better in that sense than Prisoner of Azkaban, where I felt anyone who hadn't read the book must have been tearing their hair out (which raises the question, do people who don't read HP books see HP movies?). I can definitely say that this is the best Potter movie so far, at least in my opinion. I will always prefer the books, but that is me and I don't presume for a minute that everyone agrees with me. My wife was very disappointed, even though she really enjoyed the movie, and said that ""it was like watching a slide show of the book"". Fairly accurate description. So do books ruin movies or do movies ruin books? Is the glass half empty or half full? Why ask why? Just enjoy the drink and when it is empty, pour yourself another."

","I read the book and I didn't think it was one of the best books. But this movie definitely is the best so far. Its close to the book but they have left parts out, which are I suppose for the better. No one really wants to watch another quiditch match when they know how the winner will be. I watched it at the weekend with my girlfriend and we both loved it. We talked about it for ages afterwards(Sad). There is a lot to talk about. The movie is long, but its one that you actually want to sit though. But yeah the acting of the 3 main actors has improved. The visual effects in this movie are stunning. And there are genuine funny bits in this movie. The newer spells are really cool. I give this movie 10/10. It really does deserve it. Go and see it now!!!"

","Being an adult Potter fan, I waited to write this review until I saw the movie a couple of times to get a good feel for it. Why a couple when I gave it such a low rating? Because I was very disappointed with the movie the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>Entertainment Weekly hit the nail on the head when they said the movie felt like individual LEGO bricks dropped into places on the screen. There were many scenes in the movie that could have been dropped with how little time they got, and there was too much humor in this movie and not enough story. First the good points: <br/><br/>1. Relationships are developed - We begin to see the clear lines drawn between friends and enemies.<br/><br/>2. A realistic Dumbledore - There is a reason why Voldemort fears Dumbledore. He's not supposed to be calm and cool all the time. I liked the general concern for Harry and how Michael Gambon portrayed it.<br/><br/>3. The Yule Ball scene - This was the closest scene that was true to the book.<br/><br/>4. Creating Ron - Rupert Grint does a wonderful job with developing his character. He doesn't give the same stupid look all the time anymore. I found his character less annoying in this movie.<br/><br/>5. ""He was their friend!"" - Dan Radcliffe has definitely improved his emotional acting in this film. He was actually crying this time.<br/><br/>6. Hermione Power - Hermione's entrance into the ball was the best scene in the bunch. She looked so lovely coming down the stairs and the way Harry looked at her made your heart melt. This scene was well directed and I give credit to Newell, but this type of directing is what he needs to stick to.<br/><br/>Now for the not so great stuff: <br/><br/>1. Castle Layout - DON'T have your students coming down the same stairwell for defense against the dark arts that you used in the previous movie for divination. It's just not right.<br/><br/>2. Portkey Problems - If it wasn't for the importance of the portkey, the Quittich World Cup scene, for the amount of time it got, should have been cut.<br/><br/>3. Snape, the Death Eater - Instead of showing us two little bits of Karkaroff to make us believe that he was the one that entered Harry into the Goblet (which didn't fool anyone by the way), the book scene in which Mad-eye Moody and Snape on the stairwell talking about Snape's death eater days would have been more appropriate, as Snape is a large part in future books.<br/><br/>4. Bouncing Ferret - This scene could have been done better with CGI. It was dull and not as exciting as in the book.<br/><br/>5. Dance Lessons - Although funny, this scene was unnecessary and should have been left out for more important subjects.<br/><br/>6. Barty Crouch Jr's dream? - When Harry was having his vision at the beginning of the movie this was the WORST stray from the book that I have ever seen. Barty Crouch was CERTAINLY NOT in the vision in the book. This was a grave mistake.<br/><br/>7. Veela or Nice Body - To make Ron, and everyone around him, stumble over themselves because Fleur has a nice tush just doesn't seem right. It should have been explained that she was half Veela.<br/><br/>This is only a small amount of the major problems that I have seen so far. The most interesting fact that I would like to point out is that we have not heard a single review on what J.K. Rowling thought of the movie. With the other 3, she went to the premiers and gave a review on how she liked them straight away, but there has not been so much as a peep about this one, and she did not attend any of the premiers.<br/><br/>Also, on that subject, I don't think that they had a very good consultant on this movie as they did the others. There was a mistake, that WB had to fix with CGI, with the Riddle gravestone in the cemetery. They had the dates of death wrong. That leads me to believe that they didn't put a lot into research for this movie.<br/><br/>I like this movie in that it is a Potter movie, but they are going to have to make the DVD spectacular for me to buy it."

","As a major fan of the Harry Potter books and the first two movies, I have to say that this, like Azkaban disappoints. This movie lacks the energy and enthusiasm of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Enormous chunks were cut out of the book, including major characters, sub-plots and parts of the main plot. The bare bones of the book plot were left in and even then there was quite a lot of disconnection. A few new story threads were added to make some sense of the overall story post its radical surgery. There was no understanding of time and pacing through the movie; for example the Quidditch World Cup being held in the summer holidays; the fact that the Triwizard champions were supposed to have one task per term. Other characters were cut back to a cameo at best: Sirius, Snape to name but two. I appreciate that a novel needs editing to take it to the big screen - I loved the treatment of the first two movies - but this seemed like butchery.<br/><br/>My other criticisms: 1. what was going on with Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon's) accent? One minute he was from South East England, the next from Yorkshire, the next from Ireland. At one point I thought he was trying to impersonate Richard Harris! 2. Daniel Radcliffe really needs acting lessons. He is getting worse with each movie. He seems to struggle with expressing any subtleties of emotion<br/><br/>Things I enjoyed: 1. The special effects are superlative, especially the scenes with the dragon. Harry's interaction with the dragon was excellent: very creative and entertaining. 2. Rupert Grint is getting better and better as Ron, managing more subtle humour with his very expressive face. 3. Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort and the whole scene in the graveyard. I felt that this was very true to the spirit of the book and the portrayal was suitably sinister.<br/><br/>If you are an avid Potter fan, you still *have* to see this movie. Just don't hope for too much or you may be disappointed."

","The movie was a disappointment. I understand that the book is far too long to incorporate into a movie but, I hoped that what little they picked out from the book they could have tried getting it right. The headmaster Dumbledore was completely out of character behaving more like a angry old man rather than a calm and wise old wizard. Voldermort turned out to be a joke with his rock singer like antics. They got the 'slit-like' noses, and the 'high pitched' voice though. But he looked anything like the most evil wizard of all. Who picked these guys to act anyway? As for the plot, there were some agonizing moments in the movie such as the quidditch games which started, and then never ended. Sort of a clear message to the viewers saying: ""Sorry folks we've got to finish up this movie and we can't put in everything. Moving on to other things in brief...."". Well I'm sorry, but the show length was 157 mins long. That's still less than 3 hours, and if you include a scene at LEAST complete it. Pretty bad work Mr. Director.<br/><br/>Some of the major characters were left out. Such as Molly Weasley and the House Elf (whatziznameagain?). Time wasn't an excuse.... bad job...really bad job...<br/><br/>The underwater scenery was good, and so was the dragon chase (but it was highly exaggerated) AND.. a NEEDLESS waste of that precious commodity, time...<br/><br/>Harry Potter book fans will be disappointed...I think the movies are targeting the fans who haven't read the book. How disgusting."
"Barky44","7","0","0","9 December 2005"," Great Effects, Poorly Crafted Film
","I am quite disappointed with ""Goblet of Fire"". The key problem: this film can't decide what to be.<br/><br/>Is it an action-oriented, effects laden moneymaker? Is it a coming-of-age story? Is it a kiddie flick? Is it a comedy? Is it a mystery? Is it a thriller? I don't know, and I doubt the filmmakers did, either.<br/><br/>I empathize with them. GOF is a very large book, there are a lot of subplots and ""things"" going on. But, sadly, they weren't up to the task.<br/><br/>Sure, there are some great effects sequences, and the young actors' acting has improved over prior films, but the filmmakers lost the focus of the story by an inability to dictate the genre.<br/><br/>Example: there is a mystery in the beginning when the premiere wizard sporting event is disrupted by terrorism. That incident is then ignored for some time, whilst the school hosts a sporting tournament of its own. Then we're told (not shown, but told, a key error in film-making) that someone is trying to kill Harry. But then that is put on hold while we watch teenagers fumble over dating (which is very well done, I'll grant). Then suddenly Harry is in danger again, and then the big spooky pre-climax climax, then a wrap up to the earlier mystery that we've all forgotten about.<br/><br/>Prisoner of Azkaban was a much better film. It's a shame Alfonso Cuaron couldn't work this one, too.<br/><br/>7 out of 10. Some great battle/special effects sequences and the ""teen angst"" stuff was fun. But the pacing and scripting issues can't hold it together.<br/><br/>Barky"

","Since the Potter movies came to the theater, I've been watching them, and collecting the DVD's, and reading the books the second they were available for sale. While I enjoyed the different directing style of the third director, I felt some of the magic was missing from that movie that was evident in the first 2 movies. Cauron seemed to be going for a more realistic look at the grounds and castle, but that seemed to take away from the mystique of the magical aspect of the movies. However, the 4th installment was a wonderful combination of both realism and magic, which was really quite breathtaking at times. The emotional element of this movie was real, and the character of Harry was really humanized more than ever before. I would watch it 1000 times in the theater if I could, and when it comes out on DVD, I will be first in line to take it home. A must see for any Potter fan, this one is the jewel in the crown so far. I wish Mike Newell could direct them all, he would give Spielberg a run for his money."

","The greatest of the ""Harry Potter"" series of movies, but the saddest, also. I will keep seeing it on and on, without getting bored not once. The actors are great and the special effects extremely well made. A few changes from the initial story-line in the book, but not too many, which makes ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" one of my newest favorite movies ever.<br/><br/>Worths all the money! I have yet a little problem with how Voldemort was realized, I've been expecting something more hideous, but works fine like this too. I have been extremely pleased about the way the dragon fight scene was realized, the details are wonderful, such as the dragon ruins the roof of the towers, and the fire he spits. I also loved the way the ""Lake task"" was made, although I wish those creatures were looking a little more different, and as far as I know from the book, there were males and females, not only non-defined ones. Howhever, this movie can keep you with the ""heart in your neck"", as we, Romanians, use to say. I am also amused that they used my country's name, Romania, as the country where they took the dragons from, and made me laugh, thinking that this country looks like the country of all possible monsters, thanks to Dracula and other nasty things met in the movies.<br/><br/>Some of the things that kinda bothered me were: the way Dumbledore acts, because seeing him so nervous and angry kinda scared me, knowing that the book Dumbledore was always calm and calculated, after all, he wasn't a great wizard if he was always so easy to disturb. I didn't like at all how Cho Chang looks like, I would have found a better looking young Asian lady, because this one looks so.... normal, has nothing special, nothing to pay attention for.<br/><br/>Hermione's (aka Emma Watson) acting seemed to me the worst ever of the 4 films, because, such as Dumbledore, she is so tense, nervous and almost all her replies are like shouting out loud at somebody, like she is about to lose control every single moment.<br/><br/>I don't care about the Dobby and Winky stuff, I didn't like them anyway, as for the Quiddiche games, I don't care either, so they didn't affect my opinion.<br/><br/>I am sorry, though, for the fact that they didn't show Rita as an animagus, thing important for me. The fake Moody was too evident with the tongue flick, but hey, it's a movie for kids, mostly, after all.<br/><br/>I was also expecting something else from Madamme Maxime, I was expecting something big, but also a strong woman, I mean, fatter, but this one was like a very tall ugly witch. And at the beginning she walks like the circus big-legs-guys, I am not sure what's the English name of those things you walk on them, wood made of, and you are very tall ... She walks like she got no knees and somebody has to keep her hand to help the actress walking or she will fall.<br/><br/>Generally, I won't change my feelings about the movie itself, because from all 4, this one almost made me cry from time to time."

","Harry Potter has always been one of my favorite books. When I first read them I was hooked.

Also in the beginning of the movie they cut out a lot of info, and some cool stuff. Like in the World Cup Quiddicth (Sorry about spelling) they didn't even show who won, or what happened in the match. Now that was one of my favorite parts was the match. I love quiddicth and I couldn't wait to see it on the big screen but they didn't show it.<br/><br/>Also the actor for Cho Chung, was cute but a little weird. An Asian girl with an Irish accent???

","In the Fourth install meant on film of the Harry Potter saga, the feeling of this movie differs from that of the first three. In the Prisoner of Azkaban you could tell that the series was starting to get a dark feeling. This continued into the Goblet Of Fire. When Harry's(Danial Radcliff) name comes out of the goblet of fire he is as surprised as everyone else. Jealousy and resentment follow when his friend Ron Weasly(Rupurt Grint) believes that he somehow figured out a way past the age line that Dumbledor had put around the goblet to stop those under 16 from entering. During the first task he takes on a dragon and tries to capture the Golden Egg. He does so with a very cool bit of flying. For the second task he must go down and save Ron from the Merpeople. And the third task was to get to the Tri-Wizard cup in the middle of a maze. When himself and a fellow tournament competitor reach the cup at the same time. They decide to take it together. When the cup turns out to be a port-key they are transferred to a village where they watch Lord Voldemort return. The other competitor is then killed and harry battles with Voldemort and manages to get away once more.<br/><br/>Through the first three films there was an underlying comical part in the films.

","My son has grown up with the books, and I've always brought him on opening night to each of the first three movies (which we also have in our DVD collection.) He just turned fourteen in October which was apropos for the release of this movie. Of course again, having been enchanted by the first three films, (expecially the last Cuaron sequel,) I again brought him to opening night. Wow, being 48 and a big lover of the LOTR movies, I was absolutely enthralled! All of the characters were so much more fleshed out. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint have grown so much as actors as well as just, well grown! I think that's why so many more adults can access this film on a more common ground. Sometimes we forget what it was like to be a kid, but we never forget puberty. NEVER!!! <br/><br/>The themes and dangers were more adult: The story itself is much darker and involving. And of course the unveiling of the evil Voldemort packed all of the emotional wallop it was supposed to convey. <br/><br/>I loved Richard Harris as Dumbledore so much, it was very hard for me to accept Micheal Gambon in the role. However, in this film he really conveyed a much more complicated and interesting character. No more omnipotent; he seemed much more vulnerable and human. His deep connection and fear for Harry was much clearer and well defined. Since I could no longer hold out reading the next two books in the series, I can definitely see how this character arc veers seamlessly into the next two films.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson, GREAT!! As were all of the supporting actors as usual. <br/><br/>And what can one not say about the wonderful special effects! I could go into details but that would take five pages or more. I can't believe just how far we've come sometimes in CGI. This film combines live action with digital animation INCREDIBLY and WONDERFULLY!!!<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next one!!!!

","I left my viewing of the Latest cinematic Adaption of J.K. Rowlings, Harry Potter series with mixed feelings, while the film overall was a vast improvement on Alfonso Cuaron's attempt it still lacked the magic the Rowling manages to weave in her books. As hard as it has been for me to accept the changes that have been made to the plot I understand that due to time restraints not everything can be included. What I'm not willing to accept is the horrible acting I was forced to sit through especially from Michael Gambon has the man even read the books? Rowling gives such a detailed description of Dumbledore's personality yet Gambon seems to struggle with the basics. Within the Books Dumbledore comes across as a caring man who even when angered is calm, in control and all knowing, yet Gambon's interpretation is far from the truth he comes across as a man who is easy to anger and generally reacts before he thinks usually with an unexpected and unnecessary outburst, for example was bashing Harry against the wall really necessary? It wasn't in the novel. I all I can say is I hope some where along the line direction is as much to blame as interpretation. As for the cast as a whole I believe only Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith can hold their heads high everybody else tried too hard.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in my summary the film is a improvement on the 3rd installment but only because it followed a similar order to the book, although I had read the 3rd book I found the film difficult to follow due to the lack of plot flow and detail. This Film showed some respect to the time that Rowling spent creating her world.<br/><br/>Another concern I have is they seem to be making each film to stand on there own, I'm finding it increasingly hard to see the connection between the films like there is with the books. There seems to be no consistency between the films which doesn't make sense considering there supposed to be a series.<br/><br/>To the fans of the series, maybe they'll get The Order of Phoenix right. To the general movie goer enjoy a film with a huge special effects budget but don't have high hopes if you after a good acting performance."

Quite frankly, it was a major let down.<br/><br/>To many story elements were either changed or completely left out. I do understand they had to chop up a big book for a movie, but they could have made it a little longer, the story just kinda rushed through and just made sure it got the ""main"" story. No other connections to anything else. No other character development besides the main few.<br/><br/>Also,the characters were not convincing at all. (Voldemort wasn't scary the least bit with his stupid accent and his baby blue eyes (could have sworn they were red); Dumbledore wasn't convayed as being very caring as he is in the books...or maybe it was just the actor) <br/><br/>If they can't get more of the story in it than that... then why try to make a movie.

","I have put up with the massive material cuts the directors and screen writers have insisted upon in the first three movies because most of the Feel and Emotion of the original stories were still there. This is not the case in Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>The story, as written, has been hacked up to the point that had I not read the book, I would not have been able to make any sense out of the movie. It moves the viewer at an Express Train pace through a conglomeration of disjointed scenes that have almost no continuity, and nearly no relationship to the story line in the book. Many of the main plot points that needed to be emphasized for a proper flow of the story line in the next two movies were not even touched upon.<br/><br/>This is a story that needed to be made into two movies.

","Having seen this film I was impressed with everything about it. The special effects, acting, music, locations etc were brilliant. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so. However, what annoyed me was the omission of certain bits from the film. Understandably, due to time constraints- keeping the film a manageable length, they could not include everything. I saw the stadium scenes in the trailer, and with these looking so spectacular, was hoping for a little more of that. However they barely focused on the Quiddich match at all, leaving out little details here and there such as the house elf Winky and her wrongful punishment for crimes she had not committed. We don't see her at all. In the book she comes with Barty Crouch JR hidden so he can watch. However he becomes free of his fathers constraints and it is he who conjures the dark mark hoping to scare both muggles, witches, wizards and especially those Death Eaters present who did not suffer in Askaban for Vodemort, like he did. He remains at large due to everyones belief that he died in Askaban some years previously and the fact that Winky was caught with the wand that did the spell. She covered up for him by removing the wand as he lay stunned and hidden from view. At Hogwarts, there is great speculation about the triwizard tournament and the contestants. Nosing around for store is one Rita Skeeter, journalist, busybody and gossip for the Daily Prophet. Inexplicably she is able to get great stories from inside the school despite being banned by Dumbledore. How does she do this? It is never mentioned. She sees harry collapse in Divination and declares him unfit for even attending school let alone the tournament. She catches Hermione with Krum and proclaims them to be an item, noting Hemione's taste for Quiddich players- him and Harry. We see, in the film, Hagrid and Madame Maxine talking about themselves but this scene remains unfinished. In the book we see Harry and Ron stuck outside listening to them, make a horrible discovery, that Hagrid is a half giant and so must she be. She denies it of course knowing that giants are fearsome, mean and violent and she'll get a reputation as being that to, or at least people will hate her or withdraw their children from her care. However, Harry and Ron are not the only ones listening in and the next day the front page of the Prophet has a full page article about Hagrid and his half giant status. How did she find out thinks Hemione who soon discovers the answer- she is an Animagus- that is, she can turn herself into a beetle and fly around picking up juicy tid bits about Hogwarts. Anyway.

I mean they completely cut dobby and the female house elf that was introduced in the book causing the movie to take a different route to the end which is upsetting. But they did an awesome job recreating lord voldemort and the triwizard tournament...its just how they got there thats upsetting. Is there something so wrong about creating a movie that is three hours long, so that they can do a better job at covering the important parts in the books? I have heard arguments about the movies being targeted towards a younger demographic, but I have to ask, what is the age of the average demographic going to see it? I'd estimate and say 25. And I think that'd be young....OH one more complaint: the face in the smoldering embers is not what I, or anyone I know, Imagined when they were communicating thru fire. It looked ridiculous and made no sense..."
"jawsnnn","8","0","0","1 December 2005"," Pros and cons
","A review for harry potter<br/><br/>Mike Newell is a talented director. I have seen Donnie Brasco and I just loved the way he handled characterizations of all the characters irrespective of their length of roles. So when I heard he was to direct the fourth movie I was delighted at the prospect. The only thing which worried me was - would he be able to capture the essence of the novels? Because as the series progresses, it becomes more and more difficult for each director to get all the background knowledge about the characters and the plot. I mean, how many 40 year olds would take the pain to read Sorcerer's stone - which is essentially a children's book? So when I saw this movie I was pleasantly surprised with a heartfelt rendition of the novel which was anything but amateurish. But again, as I watched the movie I couldn't shrug aside the nagging feeling that the movie was leaving out a lot of things to explain. For example, those who haven't read the books will be very confused by the arrival of the ship and the flying carriage as it is not mentioned until ten minutes later that two new schools have arrived in the hogwarts castle. And even then it is not mentioned which school arrived in which vehicle. Also I was all geared up for the quidditch world cup when all of a sudden it was over. I think a decent quidditch match is long overdue since the third movie cut it out too. The movie feels as if it is rushing along to its end, which really can't be helped given the book's size. The key scenes though, including the last one could have been elongated to give a better effect. Voldemort was not given enough time to scare, neither enough lines. But Ralph Fiennes does a good job portraying a difficult character in his own way which is bound to attract some brickbats. The movie's plus points are its characterizations, which are far more intimate than in any of the other movies. So Ron gets to be funny but not not foolish, Hermione gets to be smart but not powerful and Harry gets to be everything he is in the book - brave, flustered, angry, scared and finally broken. Dumbledore was a bit too flashy. Another actor might have carried it off but Gambon simply doesn't look or move like Dumbledore. Its the right time to replace him as Order of Phoenix demands much more attention on Dumbledore's character. The comic scenes were simply delightful, I really laughed. The CGI were brilliant and the movies sets were exactly the way they should have been, a nice combination of colours and darkness. Another word of caution. It is time for the directors to start putting in little tidbits of important information that is to be used later on in the series. Snape should be given wider berth. The conflict between Snape and Sirius should have been shown. But most importantly, the film skipped out the 'parting of the ways', where Harry's claim that Voldemort has returned is pooh-poohed by Fudge and the ministry. This was too big a plotpoint to miss, since the fifth book is based on it. I think the filmmakers should take a cue from the matrix trilogy where putting maximum story into a few dialogues is concerned. And lastly I hated it when Ron said that thing about the end of 'another eventful year' at hogwarts. It sounded like some cheesy comic book end line. But all these are the flaws which you'll notice only when you see it twice. I had a blast watching this film and I may add it is the best one of the lot."

","I love Harry Potter. I have all the movies, read the books like a million times and know the plots inside and out. I understand that this fourth book is incredibly long, so portions of the movie had to be cut. Out of all the movies thus far, I have to say this is the worst of them I have seen. The movie was accurate in terms of the basic plot which is fine. One thing left out of the movie that has been consistent in all the books and previous movies is the magic and sparkle of the time at Hogwarts. There are times in the book where times are happy and Harry's world comes to life. There are times in the book that shows how great Hogwarts is compared to the life he has at home. none of which was shown in the movie. The movie is dark and lost a lot of the imaginative touch that was put in the book. THe movie is no longer appropriate for children, but has moved to the teenager and adult audiences."

"jrt_joe","7","0","0","1 December 2005"," The Best Potter yet, though that isn't saying much.
","The first three Potter films are some of the lamest excuses for a blockbuster ever. I always thought they picked all the wrong actors, the child characters became chartoonish and slapstick, and the screenplay is some of the hokiest, most clichéd stuff written (Especially the first film). However I feel that they are improving with age, and that GoF is the best yet.<br/><br/>I understand that there are so many 'purists' who hate the films because they leave out so much of the books' content. But the films need to stand alone, and shouldn't be compared to the books. I was initially upset after watching the film as I realised there was a lot left out, but would you really want to see this book made into two films? The first film would be this long introduction that is exciting in the novels, but would be boring and stretched out when translated into the film. The first film would be 2 hours of Harry Potter before he even starts the first task. Plus aside from that the actors would all look strangely years older than before when the 2nd of the GoF film was released, and they are growing up too fast as it is.<br/><br/>The action was kept fast-paced although I felt had I not read the book, I would have no idea what was happening (especially at the end with the 'Priori Incuntatum (excuse the spelling)', as all Dumbledore did was say the those words and then move on. However most of it was kept well organised, and I think they kept enough of the book's detail in to sustain the film.<br/><br/>At last, for all these years, the makers have promise a darker Harry film, and finally we have it. Scary, brooding and not for the very young, it captures the feel of the book, which I don't think the others did.<br/><br/>The older actors are all fantastic, especially Maggie Smith, who steals every one of the few scenes she has in the film, Brendon Gleeson, who is clearly loving being Mad-Eye-Moody, and finally Ralph Fiennes, who creates a chilling Voldemort that we have all been waiting for. The only adult I am slightly unsure of is Michael Gambon (Dumbledore). I know that he has tried to make Dumbledore his own, but at times he seems quite violent and shouty, a far cry from Richard Harris's portrayal. However, I do think he succeeds in making Dumbledore more human - in this film he really doesn't have the answers, through the previous books/films he was always there, all-knowing. But now he is unsure, and it effects him.<br/><br/>The child actors are improving with age, some faster than others. Emma Watson (who's Hermione in the first film was embarrassing), is the best out of the trio by far. She has a lot of emotional scenes, and she cries very well for her age! Rupert Grint is not bad, but is still left with the lines that make the 6 year olds in the audience laugh, but it is Daniel Radcliffe who is still unimpressive. With all due credit, he is SO much better in this film, and that could be down to direction, or just coming of age. His emotional scenes when he is crying at Cedric's body are actually moving instead of the laughable scene in PoA (""He was their friend etc etc"") which was cringe-worthy. Hopefully he'll be better again in the next film.<br/><br/>The special effects are fantastic, and the dialogue is less cheesy but still pleases the younger audience.<br/><br/>Bring on Order of the Pheonix!"
"topherwriter","10","0","0","4 December 2005"," Excellent!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an excellent movie. There was a great plot and great special effects to go along. The cast, for the most part, did well on their parts; the new characters (namely Rita Skeeter, Mad-Moody, and Voldemort) were especially well casted.<br/><br/>The story is about Harry Potter in his fourth year in Hogwarts where he has to enter the triwizard tournament, a deadly series of contests between elite wizards. The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Mad-Eye Moody, gives Harry Potter advice on how to win the tournament. In the end Mad-Eye Moody's advice was intended to be given to Harry so he would be killed by Voldemort. Mad-Eye Moody also ends up to be a different person because he drank the polyjuice potion.<br/><br/>Fans of Harry Potter would really like this if they aren't expecting things to be perfectly like the book. It is impossible to make a movie completely true to the book, and if one considers that fact, this movie is excellent all around."
"stevehadd","9","0","0","4 December 2005"," Probably the 2nd best $180 million ever spent on a movie (SPOILERS!!!)
","CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>Despite being a Potter fan, I felt quite happy with Mike Newell as director. Special effects would never be the challenge in bringing HP to the big screen. Rather portraying the humour and magic of the characters in the books would be problem. And Newell has done that very well in this film. The book is huge, both in length and density, as almost every character seems to get their own subplot! All of these have been cut, but the characters have been been woven into the main story effectively.<br/><br/>The result of this weight loss is the story races along and there is not a dull moment to be had. The great thing is that despite this we do get some nice comedy scenes (the pre-yule ball dance lesson, the Hagrid-Maxime romance, the bath scene). There has been much talk about adolescence, which was pretty much all talk in Azkaban. Here it is all much better handled. The Weasly twins shine again. Hogwarts also feels much more like a school, and less like a setting for a Famous Five adventure. Some of the adult actors are given a bit more screen time, which is wonderful because every moment is a delight. The Gleeson as Mad ex-Dark Arts investigator is particularly good.<br/><br/>The visual effects are incredible not only in themselves, but because they are used to tell the story. It is hard to say pick a favourite because the story never lingers on the amazing visuals to say to the audience, ""Look at these pretty pictures I made"". The story it just told and the audience is awed. <br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect. The pacing might be described as rushed, and I wondered during the first 40 minutes if a first time viewer might wonder why certain things were happening. The book's subplots give everything a a coherence that is there in the movie, but might be hard to catch first time. Not such a problem tough because it's worth 2 viewings for the visuals! Also though the ""child"", or rather young adult/teen actors, are generally good (Grint as Ron has a much better role in this movie, and does well), the intense ending did expose possible problems for later movies.<br/><br/>That said, the Voldemort rebirth scene, which is what I have been looking forward to since I first read the books, is quite spectacular, and the casting of Fiennes is perfect! Which leads me to conclude that all looks well set for Movie 5, The Order of the Phoenix, which should be easier to cut down to size. I am so pleased that instead of just milking the HP brand, Hollywood is actually trying the best possible movies it can with the material. Well done."

","i absolutely loved this movie. from the beginning it moves quickly and is full of action. as an interpretation of a (about) 700 page book, this movie gets the main parts across in an efficient and non-confusing way, which can be hard.<br/><br/>the special effects of GOF are excellent, especially during the water scenes and the maze. the directors and CGI people really captured the world of the book.<br/><br/>also, the addition of perhaps more humor than in previous movies helped. this is such an action packed movie that the humor helps it move, so that you don't notice until you step out of the theater.<br/><br/>of course, people will say that so much was left out from the book, but there was just too much. i think the movie had the important parts and portrayed them beautifully, and i recommend this movie to all harry potter fans."
"Movie-Man-Bob","Null","0","0","4 December 2005"," Dark and difficult times lie ahead...
","It's no easy task, adapting a 700+ page novel into a film that can be viewed in a single sitting. When producing Goblet of Fire, the studio originally intended to split the book up into two films and release them a few months apart, a la Kill Bill. Director Mike Newell talked them out of this idea, and condensed the book into a single film, which moves at breakneck speed, cuts out at least half of the sub-plots, and still manages to run over two and a half hours.<br/><br/>You have to hand it to Newell. He seems to have gone out of his way to ensure that all the essential elements of the book were included in the movie. All the new characters the fans are eager to see portrayed, like Madame Maxine, the half-giantess, and Rita Skeeter, the prying reporter with the poison pen, come dazzlingly to life on the screen. All the new novel bits of magic, like the calling of the Dark Mark of Voldemort, and the head of Sirius Black appearing in the fire at Hogwarts, are executed with breathtaking visual effects.<br/><br/>But the problem is this: in his effort to present all the What's and the How's of the book in this condensed film, Mr. Newell seems to have forgotten to include the Why's.<br/><br/>Rita Skeeter, for instance, appears in one or two scenes, wreaks merry havoc in the lives of Harry and his friends by writing embarrassing articles about them in the newspaper, and then promptly disappears, never to be seen again. Her plot line is never resolved. Her story is never brought to light. Her reason for being in the film is reduced to nothing more than the simple fact that the fans expect her to be. And an amusing cameo by Miranda Richardson.<br/><br/>Likewise the scene between Harry and Sirius Black. In addition to being disappointed that Gary Oldman did not have more screen time, I could not help but feel more than a bit dissatisfied with the scene as a whole. The head of Sirius Black, godfather to Harry and wanted fugitive all over the wizarding world, appears in the fireplace at Hogwarts, molded out of burning cinders. He tells Harry he must be careful, and that he is in great danger. After four years at Hogwarts, it seems Harry should know by now that he is ALWAYS in great danger.<br/><br/>But that is not the problem with the scene. The problem is this: It is Sirius Black's only scene in the film, and it is all business. There is nothing to establish the connection that Harry and Sirius have. How much each cares for the other, and how they are each willing to put themselves at risk to protect the other. By neglecting to use Gary Oldman's actual face, the film negates even the possibility of any real interaction between the two. But the relationship between Harry and Sirius is one of the most important elements in the books.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other missing Why's in the film, too. Why was Voldemort's Dark Mark called forth to be witnessed by all those people? Why are Harry and Cedric so willing to help one another, even despite their rivalry over the beautiful Cho Chang? But perhaps the film does not need to answer these questions. Like a scholarly adaptation of a work of Shakespeare, Goblet of Fire seems to be designed for people who know the source material, and are in the theater not to be told a story, but to admire an interpretation.<br/><br/>In other words, this movie is for Harry Potter fans who are just there to see the magic come to life.<br/><br/>And in that respect, Goblet of Fire succeeds in spades. It is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen. The cinematography will take your breath away. It brings dragons and mermaids to life, turns one boy into a fish and another into a shark, and creates a labyrinth of such eerie complexity and foreboding that it will have viewers on the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>So see this movie, by all means. You are missing something spectacular if you do not. But read the book first. Otherwise, you won't get the full story as it was meant to be told. And then you'll be missing something even more spectacular."
"Mr_PCM","8","0","0","4 December 2005"," Best so far
","So now Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) enters his fourth year at Hogwarts, and as usual someone has it in for him. Upon returning to school (after an all-too-brief brief sojourn to the Quidditch World Cup Final) Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) announces the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and for reasons far too complicated to be explained here (or properly in the film) Harry winds up as the fourth competitor in this three-way tournament, thanks to the eponymous Goblet. There then follows three tasks to determine the champion. However, the story will not end there, and Voldemort, who has had merely teasing mentions and appearances up until now in the series, is finally revealed.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives first of all, and there are plenty of them. Overall, by far the best thus far in the franchise, for both fans of the books and those who just watch the films. Certainly the most exciting, and visually spectacular, dwarfing the previous three films. The book has five action set pieces, and four of them were done superbly - the Quidditch World Cup final at the start was effectively cut from the film, but I'll get to that later. The three tasks and the final showdown with Voldemort are all terrifically done (maybe a little CG-heavy, but what fantasy epic would be complete nowadays without that?) Director Mike Newell, the third director entrusted with steering the franchise, also deserves commendation for his handling of the more everyday aspects of the story  most notably his young stars' emergence into adolescence. It is a joy to see the obvious improvement in the performances of Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione). Rupert Grint in particular seems untroubled by the portrayal of a teenage angst-ridden 14-year-old, and his performance  mainly grunting and swearing  appears very little stretch for him. Emma Watson too is finally blossoming into a fine actress after rather wooden earlier performances and definitely holds her own well here. There is also a rather good turn by newcomer Katie Leung as Cho Chang, an Asian girl with, bizarrely but sweetly, a Scottish accent. Although little more than a cameo, her later importance is established. Her awkward scenes with Harry make for some cringingly accurate scenes to remind us (or forewarn the younger viewers) of our own awkwardness when it came to boys and girls in school. Also wonderfully teased is the ongoing Ron-Hermione sparks.<br/><br/>One of the film's, and series, most important aspects is as the characters grow, so do the films, and Goblet of Fire is no different. The fourth film is a much darker affair, even compared to Prisoner of Azkaban, and has thus garnered a 12A rating  a potential death sentence. However, the 12A is essential given the material, and much darkness is both required and delivered. In particular the climactic graveyard scene with Voldemort, while deliciously dark for older viewers, may prove upsetting for younger children.<br/><br/>Newcomers to the franchise include Brendan Gleeson, David Tennant and Ralph Fiennes. Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody is clearly having a ball, and rather over-indulges himself as the mad professor and new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Tennant only appears briefly, but seems keen to avoid typecasting as Doctor Who before it begins, and thus enjoys playing a slightly unhinged new villain  with hopefully more to come. The undoubted star however is Ralph Fiennes, who is quite simply perfect as the great baddie himself  Voldemort. A genius piece of casting. Also watch for a great cameo from Eric Sykes as an elderly gardener who falls foul of Voldemort at the film's opening.<br/><br/>Criticisms will no doubt come thick and fast from fans. Obviously at 700+ pages a lot would be cut. But even allowing for this, a great deal of exposition seems missing, and the first half set-up in particular seems to be whistled through at breakneck pace, as if to get to the main story quickly and waste as little time as possible on background. As a result, the potentially spectacular Quidditch final is reduced to a mere triviality, and other plot lines and scenes fall by the wayside. Mrs Weasley is cut altogether from the film, as are the dastardly Dursleys, and the scene of the Weasley family exploding out of the Dursley fireplace and into their living room would have provided welcome comic relief from the darkness which top and tail the film. Gone too is Hermione's elvish welfare campaign and much of Miranda Richardson's part as Rita Skeeter the tabloid hack (a none-too-subtle dig by JK Rowling). Furthermore, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are reduced to little more than cameos, and poor Gary Oldman has to make do with an appearance of his face in a fireplace. How he appears in the fireplace in the first place is one of many things not explained too clearly for non-readers of the books. Obviously it will be left to the easy cop-out of 'well it's magic isn't it? Jason Isaacs also pops up for a cameo as Lucius Malfoy to remind us he'll be important later, and his rather English brand of villainy is simply superb  understated but undeniably effective, even with less than half-a-dozen lines.<br/><br/>Overall though the positives far outweigh the negatives, and though fans of the book will definitely quibble over the missing material, the end product is mostly faithful to the story, perhaps even more so than the previous films. Greatly enjoyable, and a good sign for the future of the franchise, which has begun to grow up well. Harry Potter the franchise appears to be in safe hands for the time being, which is unfortunately more than can be said for the eponymous hero himself."

","As a HP-movie lover who has not read any of the books I must say this was one of the most enjoyable ones. The tempo of the movie is simply amazing. Newell never lets u relax or doze off and keeps throwing story lines and events in your face. The amount of humor in this movie was by far the largest of the series so far though good proportioned.<br/><br/>The few negatives i can find were some loose strings and sequences which were a bit odd. Especially the finale of the ball was very abrupt. It looked like the editor used his scissors a bit too enthusiastically there. I couldn't quite grasp what happened between the moment Krum went to get a drink and Hermione sending the boys to bed?!

","This film was amazing! I went to see it the first night it came out, as I'd been waiting to see it for a long, long time. The special effects were incredible definitely the best so far and all completely believable. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Harry and Hermonie) have improved immensely from the last film and Rupert Grint (Ron) was still as convincing as ever. The tournaments were excellently done apart from I would say the third was not long enough and missed a lot out from the book, but it had to be because of small space they had to fit it in. It was definitely the scariest and most moving film so far. However the reason I only gave this a 9 rather than full marks is because it was lacking in all the traditional Harry Potter things that we all love to see, for example there was no sorting hat, no trip to hogsmeade and hardly any actual classes nor any Dursley's or Diagon Alley visits. Another downside was the music in all the other films John Williams (perhaps the greatest film composer of all time) has composed the music yet they got someone different who I feel was pretty awful, on sad bits there was happy music which ruined it, and hardly any music in it at all, and what music there was, was rubbish which was a real shame. Although all of this the screenplay was incredible and the trio were much more believable as teenagers than ever before and some scenes were outstanding like the bath one with Moaning Murtle. I definitely think that you should go to see this film if you have not already and try and see past the bits they just had to miss, and enjoy all the action and funny parts."

","This installment of the Harry Potter series combines brilliant visual effects with an excellent script. The humour helps balance the overall darkness of the film, but it would be nicer to see some brighter colours. <br/><br/>I would have liked to see some more of Cho, and possibly find out a bit more back story. For anyone who hasn't read the books, she will seem like a blow-in, which I suppose she sort of is. Moaning Myrtle's advances on Harry in the bathtub seem quite a bit out of character (isn't she supposed to be a shy little thing?), but I can certainly relate!<br/><br/>The dragon scene from the first task is too drawn out. They don't really need to stray from the stadium, as I am sure they would have been able to incorporate plenty of near blows inside the small arena. There could also have been some danger to the audience, which could have helped with the total feeling of the scene. I was disappointed to not have any so-called obstacles in the maze, such as the sphinx and the Skrewts. I can understand how the normal maze worked though, testing their endurance and not just testing their skill. The second task was basically good, but I thought they could have played more of Harry's insistence on rescuing the others as well as Ron.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent adaptation of the movie, although the absence of Quidditch was a bit disappointing. If they make the trip to go to the World Cup, we should at least be allowed to see some of the match.<br/><br/>Everyone will see it anyway, but I think this time it's worth the time and money, and not just for Harry Potter obsessives."

","Goblet of Fire serves up a nice visual spectacle and avid followers of the Harry Potter books probably won't be disappointed. But folks like me who expect a well balanced cinematic meal and not just eye candy will probably leave the theater feeling a bit empty. The plot for this latest installment might have been adequate enough if this was a 60 minute TV episode but it's wafer thin at over two and a half hours. Wholesale chunks of the movie could have been cut out (such as the school dance business) and nobody would miss them except the fans.

"russem31","7","0","0","3 December 2005"," Not as good as Azkaban
","Although this is a good film, it unfortunately hearkens back to the adaptation technique from the novels of the first two films rather than trying to be a film. Whereas Azkaban really had a beginning, middle, and end, and thus kept the pacing going, this film doesn't and for that reason it seems to be many scenes strung together just to keep the plot going. This makes for a slower pacing and makes the 2 1/2 hours seem like MUCH longer. The problem really is, since this is movie number 4, it has to rely on the previous 3 films and that makes the plot more complicated (thus having to tell more in the same amount of the approximate 2 1/2 hours for each film). In fact, they had to cut a LOT out to even make it possible to keep it at 2 1/2 hours and regardless it still seemed too long! Hopefully, with Order of the Phoenix, which is a long book like this Goblet of Fire but has a shorter plot overall, they can avoid this problem. And as a side note, although Patrick Doyle did try his best with this score, he isn't John Williams and I hope Williams does find time to score the last 3 films in the Harry Potter series. 7 out of 10."

This book in the series is supposed to show a major transition in the adolescent development of students, but aside from the fact that they're obviously older, so much was either minimized or left out entirely.

They didn't show Hagrid talking to Madame Maxime in the rose garden, or Harry and Ron listening, or Fleur and Rodger getting it on in the bushes. 8.

","As most people I'm sure felt, I walked into the theatre wondering how are they going to put that entire book to the screen? I was impressed.<br/><br/>They managed to get the bulk of the story while cutting some of the fat from the written word. The movie was non-stop, kind of like a car chase that doesn't end for two and a half hours, but people who haven't read the book will have a general idea of what is happening. In other words, it caters to the masses.<br/><br/>The effects were incredible and I especially liked the underwater scene as well as the climax with Voldomort which was very close to the way I imagined it while reading the book.<br/><br/>There are, for me, two points that I found a little disappointing. First was Mad Eye Moody. It's not that he was horrible he was just not the way I envisioned him. I guess that falls under the category of 'to each their own'.<br/><br/>Second was how Dumbledore presented himself. He was a little too harsh for my taste. Again, I always saw him as a patient and calm man, not aggressive and curt.<br/><br/>Now with that said, the only other problem I had was not with the movie but with the 'attendees', THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN! I was in the theatre surrounded by some as young as three and four; besides not understanding a thing that is going on, there are some definite points which made me even cringe.<br/><br/>Some people are stuck on the idea that Harry Potter is for kids, but what they fail to realize is that with each passing year they grow up, and so do the plot lines. An advance word of warning...when the next one comes out, leave the kiddies at home...please? <br/><br/>All in all I was happy with the product. I do, however, highly recommend reading the novel. As with most movie adaptations...the book is better"

","I had pretty high expectations for this movie. I went to see it the day before Thanksgiving with my older sister and younger brother who have pretty much read all the books. I must say, even though it wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be, that didn't stop me from loving the movie. In fact, I loved it so much, sometimes I forgot it was supposed to be scary. The special effects were great. The story was excellent, as were the performances by the actors and actresses. My top 10 favorite characters from this movie were of course Harry, Ron and Hermione, Alistor ""Mad Eye"" Moody, Hagrid, Cedric Diggory, Fluer Delacour (I hope I spelled that correctly), Lord Voldemort, Albus Dumbledore, and Viktor Krum. Moody was absolutely hilarious, especially when it came to ""teaching Malfoy"". Ron was a character who often had a kind of sense of humor that was dry and at the same time warm. (Spoiler Alert!!) I liked the scene where Harry and Cedric come back to the arena after the graveyard scene. It was portrayed very well. It was so sad I wanted to cry. Cedric was a cool character and he was very nice despite all the popularity he was getting after the champion selection. Fluer was a good character. I was afraid for her sometimes, (Spoiler Alert!!) particularly when she received her dragon for the first task and the last task, the maze. Viktor was very well-mannered. I wasn't phased by what happened to him in the maze. It wasn't his fault. Hagrid and the whole thing with Madame Maxime was quite funny. Albus Dumbledore was able to show a side to him we didn't really see before: nervous, anxious, confused, and frightened. And last but certainly not least, Lord Voldemort. My, my, what a character. I loved Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. He commanded my respect and attention in this film. As the director stated in an HBO first look special for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Ralph Fiennes is ""immensely well suited"" to play this character. He was creepy and a great form of evil. By that I mean I actually liked him being evil. Even just the look of him sent enormous satisfaction of the character into my body. I couldn't wait to see him again when I went to see the movie again two days later with my best friend and his family. To summarize this, I came out of the theater both times very pleased and very anxious for the film to come out on DVD. I can't wait for this to come out on DVD."

Although at times the film might have seemed a bit rushed, it was still an excellent job of book to film adaption. I would not recommend bringing a young child, as there are a few scary parts, but other than that, I think all can enjoy this film. Harry Potter fans or not. The special effects were great and the acting was wonderful. I saw the midnight showing and it was totally worth it. If you have not yet seen this film get up and go because it was great. You may want to brush up on your potter knowledge before going, watch all the other movies. But most of all just enjoy yourself.

","If common practice is to be observed, I should really mention Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia for comparison when starting this review. However, I will refrain. Director Mike Newell has said that he viewed the fourth outing for Harry Potter as a suspense thriller and the starting scene certainly falls into this category. I got a genuine creepy feeling as Frank Bryce climbed the stairs of the house (and I knew what was coming!) The whole film however doesn't manage to maintain this suspense. My main criticism with the film versions of the Harry Potter books is that they are a series of (very enjoyable) set pieces. Snapshots of the books strung together with a bit of plot. I can't complain too much though. Goblet of Fire is an exciting and enjoyable two and a half hours and does move the series on. The acting from the main characters is better than before, although I'm still not that convinced by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. The next two books in the series deal with more uncomfortable situations and issues which could make for a really great viewing experience. It will also be interesting to see how the next film compares now that Steve Kloves is not writing it."

"lindensong","9","0","0","3 December 2005"," Savagely, yet sensibly, edited version of a huge book
","The big problem this film had to start with was dealing with a huge book and reducing it to a suitable length for film. An early option considered was to split it into two films, but this was scrapped. The editing of the story is necessarily savage, but has been done in such a way that it sill makes sense of itself. Nevertheless, it is part of a sequence, and viewers who might not have seen the other films might be left confused about some details. So much good stuff in the book has had to be snipped.<br/><br/>What really struck me in the film was the strong emphasis on humour. The darkness of the story is repressed right up to the cemetery sequence, giving that much greater impact.<br/><br/>The music is truly awful - within the first 10 seconds of the opening credits, I knew it wasn't the work of John Williams - unimaginative orchestration, drab arrangements, and some poor choices in underscoring the narrative.<br/><br/>The M rating (in Australia) for the film is well deserved, although I suspect most children will have read the book before viewing the film and well know what to expect.<br/><br/>The action sequences are magnificent - especially with the dragon. The Quidditch World Cup sequence is unfortunately glossed over, but really does convey the excitement of a (muggle) World Cup.<br/><br/>The characterization of Mad-Eye Moody is brilliant. A fine acting performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes, as well as (suprisingly) Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. Emma Watson still plays emotions a little woodenly.<br/><br/>The sound design is particularly impressive - the work of the wonderful Randy Thom.<br/><br/>In style, the film returns to that of the Chamber of Secrets - refreshing after the quirky excesses of Prisoner of Azkaban. The nature of the character interactions is quite different in this movie - the characters are definitely growing up! And this is the source of a lot of the humour."

","To start on the bright side, the fourth movie in the Harry Potter series has got very good graphics - the dragon, the mer people and especially Lord Voldemort are very well done.<br/><br/>But those of the viewers who also read the book may be disappointed by the way the director has chopped op the book in a desperate attempt to squeeze all the story lines into one movie of acceptable length.<br/><br/>While the principle is sound (recreating all of the book would have lead to a movie of four hours length), you could argue about his choices. For example: The slowly igniting love-story between Ron and Hermione gets plenty of room in the dance, while the Quidditch World Cup literally zooms by from the opening scene in the stadium to the attack by Deatheaters.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is a good movie with nice play by the protagonists and you will probably leave the theater satisfied."

","I don't think the movie does justice to the book. This is my favorite book, and its adaptation was quite poor. I had great expectations of this movie and they were not fulfilled. The movie was more like a summery of the book; everything is done swiftly, as if every word is redundant. There are many scenes where every character says only one sentence. This prevents developing of dialogues, and overall the characters development as well. There were some moments when I felt I was watching dramatizations of excerpts from the book.<br/><br/>There was much more of the book to show. They have made this movie, as if they wanted just to pass on the main story line, and not to show the whole book on film. The book is deep and powerful. The movie is not.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the movie was full of action, and was quite fun. It was interesting to see parts of the book on film, but unfortunately only parts."
"Monotreme02","8","0","0","3 December 2005"," The best in the series so far
","The Harry Potter series just gets better and better. The first two movies weren't particularly to my liking, but at least the second one tried to include some darker, more interesting ideas. The third movie was absolutely excellent. The new director truly managed to capture the dark, slightly comic feel I've always expected from the Harry Potter books, but the third movie had some disappointing factors, including a confusing plot, loose ends and plot lines opened by the movie but left open, and weak performances from the kids in what were meant to be very dramatic scenes. The fourth installment, featuring yet another new director (Mike Newell, of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Donnie Brasco' fame,) improves on the disappointing factors that affected the third movie, and is a winner from the start.<br/><br/>It seems to me that director Mike Newell has added immensely to the success of the movie. He was able to go under the special effects and grandiose of the movie, and really focus on acting, drama and characters. The acting from the three kids (Daniel Radcliffe  Harry, Emma Watson  Hermione, and Rupert Grint  Ron) has immensely improved since the third movie.<br/><br/>Radcliffe, who had some dramatic scenes in 'Azkaban' but who didn't quite manage to nail them, seems to have gained control over drama, and proves in this movie that he indeed can act. Watson, if melodramatic at times, does show great skill in the Yule Ball scenes, combining a sort of pre-teen squishiness and excitement with dark, teenage frustration and overreaction. Grint, though, truly shines among the three, as he gets a chance to show his drama chops, instead of being reduced to merely a source of comic relief (although he does have his share  the scene in which Professor McGonagall teaches the students  especially Ron  how to dance, is priceless. Ron's character has also developed nicely, and I like how they showed his jealousy of Harry in the movie. It was one of the aspects of the book that I particularly liked.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson brilliantly portrays Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, with such menacing coarseness and brutality; he's practically scarier than Lord Voldemort. Gleeson dominates in the movie.<br/><br/>Another newcomer to the series is the brilliant actor Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes' interpretation of Voldemort is nothing short of brilliant. Like the change in Dumbledore's character, the change of Voldemort's character is an aspect of the movie I was very impressed with. The book makes Voldemort out to be the embodiment of all that is evil on Earth, but the movie takes his character to a different level. Fiennes portrays a chilling and dangerous character, but much emphasis is put on the fact that Voldemort is, after all, human. Albeit a bit deformed, he is still human. This humanity that Fiennes and Newell added to Voldemort takes his character to a whole new level, and makes him far more interesting. Instead of just being a dark lord, he has so many more layers beneath him, similar to Darth Vader's complexity and depth. If they continue in this direction in the next movies in the series, it could prove to be very interesting indeed.<br/><br/>Many people were complaining that the opening of the movie was ""rushed"" and that many of the sub-plots in the book were removed, such as Dobby and Winky, Madame Maxime being a half-giant, and Hagrid's lessons. Well, first of all, I thought that enough sub-plots were removed to keep the movie flowing while still keeping with the spirit of the book, and keeping the focus of the movie on what is truly important in the book. And regarding the opening I actually really liked it. The unbearably fast pace of the first few minutes of the movie takes you totally by surprise and really throws you in to the world of the movie. You get this feeling of 'wait how did we get HERE so quickly?' I didn't think it felt rushed at all. Moreover, I think that enough emphasis was put on what was important in the first 100-or-so pages of the book, and enough was taken out so that it doesn't feel totally jumbled up and hasty. Another one of the major changes, the maze task, didn't bother me at all. I felt it was an interesting alternate adaptation of that task. The maze is so huge; you really lose yourself in it, with feelings of frustration, claustrophobia, and confusion. It's more like a psychological task than a physical one.<br/><br/>All in all, with better acting, more character depth and showcasing great emotion and fear in the characters, while still keeping up with the dark realism look featured in 'Azkaban', 'Goblet of Fire' is the best in the Harry Potter series so far, with many memorable scenes and an irresistible human side not seen before in the series. I can only hope that the fifth movie will be good, but so far, things aren't looking too good. But, one must remain optimistic."

","Let me start by saying i didn't hate this film, it was rather good on the whole, but there were some aspects of the film i really, really didn't like.<br/><br/>It was a great deal better than the previous films, the acting for a start. I really did think the scene where Harry brought Cedric's body back was well done and Ron just keeps getting funnier.<br/><br/>However i do have a few complaints. 1. Why did Hermione spend the entire film looking as if she was about to cry? That got on my wick.<br/><br/>2. The end was far too rushed. To me the most important part of the book is Voldemort coming back and the events that happen after, which aren't really explored in the film. This could make it confusing for film five.<br/><br/>3. Was it just me or was Voldemort not very scary at all? I don't know why, but he was a lot creepier and scarier in my head. Maybe it's just my warped imagination. I thought he was a bit too hammy.<br/><br/>4. This isn't really a complaint, but I thought that Viktor Krum looked like he should have an ASBO. Was that just me?<br/><br/>So, on the whole, a rather good film with a few flaws. I would recommend people to see it but only if they have read the book or it could get a little confusing."
"the-evil-cult","8","0","0","3 December 2005"," Long movie with good special effects, but be wary of violence
","Goblet of fire is a long movie, about two and three-quarters of an hour, so be sure to empty your bladder before the movie and don't drink too early during the movie. I found myself holding it in and towards the end it became very uncomfortable. Although this is a long movie, the book is much longer relative to the other books in the Harry Potter series. Given that the book is so long it is quite remarkable the filmmakers were able to keep the movie under three hours. It was suggested early on that the movie be split into two (like Kill Bill was), but this plan obviously didn't go ahead.<br/><br/>Another aspect of this movie I found annoying was the ethnic stereotyping. The Indian girls just happen to wear traditional Indian clothing and the Bulgarians act so much like stereotypical Bulgarians. I'm not certain whether Rowling or the filmmakers are to blame for this but the whole movie feels like a mishmash of simplistic stereotypes.<br/><br/>Sometimes the acting, I thought, was rather fake, with characters overacting or exaggerating expressions. But given the age of the actors (most I presume are teenagers) I guess this is tolerable.<br/><br/>The movie has good special effects, especially pictures of the lake, the maze, and other large-scale outdoor scenes. However, sometimes the special effects looked plastic-like, such as early on in the stadium at the Quidditch World Cup.<br/><br/>Something else to keep in mind is the violence. Characters are murdered, hands are chopped off, blood is spilled, and much of the movie is rather dark. Be wary of sending children to the movie. Most children, especially those who have read the book, probably won't be too bothered by the violence and tension. There is probably much worse on TV and on the Internet, so there is a good chance they have already developed an immunity for violence."

"Baldrick44","8","0","0","2 December 2005"," Good, but not quite Azkaban quality
","I must admit that if I was going to do a Harry Potter film, I would think that the ones that would be the most exhausting would be numbers four and five. Why? Because of the mass of characters that need to be fed into the machine in order for it to be a coherent storyline. Fortunately for HP fans, Mike Newell does a pretty good job, with only the occasional slip up.<br/><br/>The great thing about Goblet of Fire is that it is the book that truly turns the series on its head; with the idea of a dark foreboding evil becoming fully realised and Harry's destiny becoming more than just magic and wands. The script is handled well, with the story continuing to adhere closely to the books, with the cutting out of a couple of peripheral characters, allows the story to move quickly and efficiently from scene to scene.<br/><br/>The new actors are all very good, particularly Brendan Gleeson as Moody and David Tennant as Barty Crouch Jr. A special mention should also go to Ralph Fiennes who played Voldemort with a very reptilian sort of menace ( he didn't so much move as swooped ) that gave the Dark Lord a quality that is totally unique. His performance helped to really move the film along in the closing stages. All the other actors performed their parts with the usual aplomb, and Michael Gambon has moved beyond Richard Harris to become a new Dumbledore, one that although may seem a little gritty for this film ( though he was still very good ), will suit Dumbledore perfectly in films to come.<br/><br/>There were however a couple of things that seemed to irritate me in the movie. For starters, the Yule Ball scene went for too long. It was an event that was important in the scope of the moment, but it really had no consequence on the rest of the film. Secondly Gary Oldman as Sirius Black should have been used more to flesh out the characters of Karakroff, Moody and Barty Crouch instead merely appearing for ten seconds in a fire. Perhaps the scene on top of the mountain in Hogsmeade would have been better to see than the one in the fire, despite the absence of special effects. Thirdly some characters seemed to merely peter out instead of finding out what happened to them; Rita Skeeter disappeared off the face of the Earth, Draco seemed to have nothing to say about the return of the Dark Lord and the relationship between Fudge and Dumbledore if one had not read the book at the end was anyone's guess.<br/><br/>But I may be being overly critical as the book is incredibly difficult to do, and for every irritant, there are 4 cool things to make up for it. The Potter series rolls on in good stead, with Harry's destiny before him."

","When the first few Harry Potter movies came out, many fans were concerned. Important themes and subplots were being cut, and those movies were based on 300-400 page books. What were the film makers going to do when they had to tackle such formidable books such as Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix? Well, the answer has been revealed. Goblet of Fire, although flashy and fun for a Harry Potter fan, falls short of the mark set by the first three books and disappoints the book it is based on.<br/><br/>Many readers agree that Goblet of Fire was one of the most powerful books, and it was certainly the bridge between Harry's boyhood and his maturity. Themes of death, love, and loss start to emerge in Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>The movie misses the mark by focusing only on a few elements of the book while ignoring others. The subplots that the film attempts are mutilated and make no sense in the movie, because there isn't enough time devoted to them. Meanwhile, there are scenes of meaningless drivel, especially in an extensive scene at a dance. After ten minutes of watching teenage awkwardness, I grew angry. I was here to watch Harry Potter! If I wanted teenage angst I could go back to middle school.<br/><br/>There are a few good scenes in the movie, but overall the director failed to fairly represent the Goblet of Fire.

Is it the case with this one? yes it is. <br/><br/>Did I like this movie? Certainly. <br/><br/>Mike Newell directed his version of HArry potter in a way that only a Brit can...in a uber British way, with a dark murky atmosphere and a uncanny dosage of British anarchy.<br/><br/>Unlike the first two movies, that was a straight forward artificial pieces, driven by a quasi sense of magic and acceptable special effects, this film, is more like the third that raised the bar for quality of content.<br/><br/>Unlike the first two that was utterly claustrophobic concerning the school and castle, Newell shows us that Hogwards is gigantic,enormous and a colossal school that is much more than a castle. <br/><br/>In this movie,everything goes, anyone goes and the once goody-two-shoes atmosphere of the other movies seems faded. <br/><br/>Enough of that. <br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson was superb as Alastor Moody, Albus Dumbledore seemed more human in this volume, more tense and exactly like an actual headmaster. <br/><br/>The main three were amazing and it was certainly great to see our silver screen heroes at it again. <br/><br/>Ron were superb as the sidekick-like friend trying to find a voice of his own.<br/><br/>Hermione- dazzling as the swan who is (at a fast pace) becoming a lady, that is caught in the midst of a love triangle. <br/><br/>Harry- the everyman person, was well acted by Daniel Radcliffe and he carried the film well.<br/><br/>The main attraction was however Ralph Fiennes, without the benefit of a nose and in thick make-up and robes. He was mesmerizing as Lord Voldemort, a guy so evil and arrogant you love to hate the hell out of him. <br/><br/>Yes movie fans, I loved this movie...saw it twice on opening day, and I am going to see it again tomorrow.<br/><br/>It entertains like only Harry potter movies can and David Heyman produced something amazing and most of all entertaining, for us. <br/><br/>Although scraps of subplots and unresolved themes were almost littered through the movie, it did not break the film. And although many people reckon that Radcliffe cant act, they forget that Elijah Wood cant even spell the word not in one movie and not in any of the LOTR movies.<br/><br/>I think Daniel Radcliffe was brilliant, and though I believe this movie to be better than the mediocre pieces of slime that is the first two, I cant truly say that it is better than ""Azkaban""...for Cuaron managed his piece loads better than Newell managed this utterly difficult piece. <br/><br/>But still its worth every show you can lay eyes on...so go out there, see the movie and write your review."

Do not criticise me but I fail to see how what he does is seen as acting. This is my opinion though. <br/><br/>The trials were very impressive, save the last one. Again this was rushed in my opinion and I do know that they probably had a set limit in terms, but still was slightly boring for me. <br/><br/>Great new actors, especially Krum. Although his appearances are quite brief, they are well set out. Fleur was good and well played. Cho had a small yet obvious part and she and Harry obviously notice each other.<br/><br/>So with the fantastic effects, yet slightly rushed storyline, I would give this a 7/10. Let us hope that Order of the Phoenix continues the series well."

","This was a great movie. Not only was this a great Harry Potter film, but it was just a great one all around. I think if I knew nothing of Harry Potter I would still love it. It think it was the best so far. Most definitely. The others were good, but this one stayed the truest to the book. It wasn't as rushed either. The others seemed almost slapped together just trying to fit as much in as possible. This one flowed so beautifully and gracefully. Not to mention the fact that the trio are really growing as actors. I am especially impressed with Daniel Radcliffe. Ever since the movies began he as improved with each succeeding movie. Rupert Grint is no exception either. He has really seemed to discover Ron in this movie, what makes him tick and what makes him who he is. Emma Watson who began as my favorite has seemed to not improve as much as the others. She is still plagued with the misfortune of overacting. That is not to say, however, that I did not enjoy her performance. It was such a beautiful film and I cannot wait to see where Ralph Fiennes goes with his character of Voldemort. The scene in the graveyard was downright frightening and it will only become more so as the films progress. So, all in all, it was a fine piece of cinema that everyone must go see right away. I thoroughly enjoyed it."

","GoF was jam packed with entertainment. It had a lot of sweeping over landscapes, information was missing, and inaccurate (dragon) but it is the public's demand for fast pace action that demanded the dragon should be free to roam. I was disappointed that we did not get to see Sev showing Fudge the Dark Mark in the Hospital Wing and Sirius with the Weasley's but they had to be cut because of time limitations. We did get to see the mark on Crouch Jr though and it was very cool! I did like the scene with Sev pulling up his sleeves to tap Ron and Harry, even if it didn't happen in the books. The boys really improved with their acting! Emma was good too, but I didn't see the amount of improvement the boys had."

","""It was awful!"" - and that from the Potter loving Mrs Frames who had given an (inital)thumbs up to the previous three instalments but later, with two feet in a tub of cold water and a live wire dangling threateningly near by from your reviewer's own hand, conceded that they didn't hold up too well to repeat views. For her, Goblet of Fire just omitted too much of Rowling's book and fluffed the parts that were left. I didn't mind it so much, though I haven't read any of the novels (I'm over 18) and for that reason the film seemed to me OK - though a little patchy and let down by Radcliffe's half-grimace, half-gurning style of acting. Lacking Hermione's natural advantages he'll need to work bloody hard next time round to avoid looking like a new boy screen testing with the real actors.<br/><br/>Having been dragged along, though like sex I haven't paid for it once, I was again relatively surprised to find myself sitting in a packed house with hardly a child in sight. You'd have thought they'd have brought the little wizard-loving sprites along to cover their own fanatical devotion to a set of kiddy books but after 3 flicks perhaps all pretence was left (with the tots) at home. What drives them to see it is another matter. Mrs Frames belongs to the Hype Guild of Great Britain (HGGB) and its a condition of her membership that she must immerse herself in everything that resembles a bandwagon, regardless of quality, which is why she's currently on her 5th I-Pod. Harry Potter for me is the sort of thing I might have loved as a child to which you could add Matricide and Wham bars, but in my roaring twenties it seems pillaged from better stories and possessive of the same tensile strength as urine. The last film was far more successful in its craft and tone whereas Mike Newell, who prior to this would have got no closer to a blockbuster than watching one at home on DVD, isn't nearly as assured with the material and not in possession of so talented an eye. <br/><br/>Devoid of the fanaticism that seems to inflate these so-so stories, I'm rather tired of seeing each film with the promise of darker and deeper to come. When is this going to happen exactly? I could wait forever to find out. As Rowling's books get longer and more difficult to adapt my advice would be to dump them altogether and make an independent series based on the lead characters. Suggestions for future episodes include Harry Potter and the Turkish Prison, Harry Potter and the Hermione Granger Rape Case a.k.a. ""Dirty"" Harry Potter and Harry Potter Goes Wild! Wait a minute, I think I'm beginning to feel the hype..."

","Harry Potter is a series of events which amaze me its similar to the lemony snicket series but has more excitement for example the tri-wizard tournament were harry has to battle a dragon with just a broomstick and a wand! Hermione and Ron seem to be a good role model for children nowadays. I have become so attracted to the series i have all the books and all the movies apart from 'Harry potter and the goblet of fire'. The books may seem different to the films but the books are around 400 pages and more and would take too long to process in a movie. I gave this film a 10 out of 10 because the graphics and the realness of all the characters and creatures. Children or adults should love it!"
"victory_shall_be_mine","8","0","0","2 December 2005"," Overall good, but way too fast
","First of all, i would like to point out that i would have enjoyed this movie so much more if i had gone to see it with someone who would've liked it too. My friend dislikes everything basically, and so she hated Harry Potter too. I have to say thank you to her though, for actually trying to last through the movie. But i don't believe i enjoyed it to the full extent because a movie is hard to enjoy when the person sitting next to you is bored. I'll be glad to see it again soon and enjoy it so much more.<br/><br/>Anywho, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the longest of all Harry Potter books, and i can't imagine how difficult it would be to try and cut down 636 pages into a mere 3 hour and 16 minute movie.<br/><br/>Personally, i found the movie choppy and way too fast paced, but i know that this happened because they were trying to fit in all significant facts into the limited time period. Scenes lasted like four minutes at the most. And especially scenes such as the Quidditch cup scene would have been so much more intense and terrifying if they were longer.<br/><br/>With Prisoner of Azkaban, the movie was able to pace itself steadily and slowly. This movie was just bang bang bang. I couldn't feel much for characters or the things that were happening to them because everything was so short-cut. Especially with characters like Cedric, Cho and Krum. Altogether they got at the max eight minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>In my opinion, i wouldn't have minded if this movie went on longer. Because then the film would actually be intense and emotional. Watching this movie was like reading a fact sheet. It was just like ""Harry wakes up"" ""Harry gets hurt"" ""Harry gets out of bed"". There was just no space for anything too genuinely emotional. Like when Wormtail cuts off his hand, there are no screams, nothing. He just cuts it off, and walks straight over to Harry as if nothing happened. I actually recall people in the cinema not even knowing that Wormtail's hand had been cut off.<br/><br/>Generally it's a good movie, but it just doesn't have heart. You can't feel much for any of the new characters because you don't really get to know them. And Cedric comes out really arrogant despite the fact that he's meant to be kind. I never liked the concept of splitting the film into two different ones. I think the movie would've been fantastic if it even got like an hours more screen time. And people such as house-elves and the Dursleys should have not been cut out."

","Whilst it is impossible to cover everything J.K.

For those who are familiar with the story the expectation of what's next to come will enable younger viewers to see it. If your little one hasn't had the book read to him/her I would probably get a babysitter - as the finally climatic scenes in the graveyard with ""You-Know-Who"" are a little more harrowing that we've seen before.<br/><br/>All in all I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will probably go again on the weekend. 10/10 (it just whetted my appetite to re-read the books)"

","Fantastic film, though there were parts that weren't explained enough from poor editing and missing links. Plus parts that were quite enjoyable in the book, were: Ron's new pet Pigweidgon, Mad Eye Moody- teaching harry for the ""Triwizard Tournument"" (such spells of 'Accio'), the Hogsmeade trip. The beginning was quite different this time, with no mention of Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia. As most people would agree that the book is much different to the movie, but as a reader and fan of the book, i must say the movie is not really different, but gives a fantastic and sumptuous view/visualization of the film. The scenery and the enjoyment of the new characters. Eg. Mad Eye Moody and his wicked eye and sense of black humor or crazy humor and Rita Skeeter's annoyance with newspaper journalism. Though unlike Mike Newell, he uses a different composer for music and a different feel or outline towards the film. very different to Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuarón adaptation, but overall a must see!<br/><br/>Josh S"

","People say that the fourth movie is bad because so much was left out- but wouldn't you still be complaining if everything had been left in and it was six hours long? If you want to read the subplots, read the book. Some things in books can't come across in movies that well. Thoughts, emotion-only scenes, for instance... And subplots are great, but honestly books are always better than movies.<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten that across! This movie is AMAZING. The effects, the acting... And of course, Dan, Rupert and Emma are great again. Emma's part was a bit over-dramatic this time, but that's just a minor flaw. I thought it was interesting that this is the darkest movie so far, and yet it's the funniest. The end was fantastic and dramatic and perfect.<br/><br/>Getting into that.... (*SPOILER* for those who haven't read the book before seeing it in theatres, although wtf is with that, read the book) I thought Voldemort was perfect, perfect, perfect. I had been SO worried they would mess him up, do it wrong, do something stupid... but he was EXACTLY how I've always imagined him. Amazingly, it was joy that leapt into my heart when I saw him form... not fear. well, not until after I saw the movie a second time and was less giddy about seeing it.<br/><br/>END SPOILER anyway I think everybody should see it because it's freaking awesome, PS I love Katie Leung's accent, its pretty."
"the_extremist","6","0","0","1 December 2005"," Main plot suffers thanks to time constraints
","Being tasked with creating Harry Potter 4 cannot be easy. One has to out-do movies 1, 2 and 3 just to meet public expectation. Many of the scenes that work well in the book simply can't be filmed - a lot of book 4 was the thoughts running through Harry's head - and you can't suddenly add voice overs to a sequel when the last 3 movies didn't have them. In these respects, the way the film was adapted from the book was excellent. Other highlights for me were the underwater scene and the dragon chase.<br/><br/>Thats about where it ends though. I did not like the new Dumbledore - I don't think this actor has even read the book or he'd realize that Dumbledore is a quiet, humble, respected man who doesn't have to shout or push people around to get things done. He also looks more like a recovering alcoholic than a kind lovable old man.<br/><br/>The cinematography also sucked. Too many close-up shots with blurred backgrounds. This is cheating - the previous movies always had interesting, often humorous magic stuff going on behind the characters, adding depth and the ability to watch the movie a second time and still notice new things. This one was filmed like some kind of low-budget adult drama. The score lacked depth and did nothing for me either.<br/><br/>And lastly, I can understand that there was a lot to get into a 2.5 hour film and they had to drop certain sub-plots, but I really felt the movie was too rushed, the main plot was squeezed to its bare minimum at the expense of scenes like the Yule Ball, which could've probably been cut out along with the others to allow more time to develop the characters and story (so that it makes sense to people who haven't read the book) and to add back in that touch of humor which makes the potter books so much fun to read."

I get excited every time a Harry Potter film starts and I hear that music. The films are well worth the wait each time. Note to parents, this film is a bit darker and more mature, so if your child is not old enough to read the books on their own, I suggest this movie will be a bit too scary for them."
"werforpsu","6","0","0","1 December 2005"," could have been better
","Okay-Yes it was a wonderful movie, but after that book it needed to be a fabulous movie. They cut it down to much, and removed/changed plot that now forever has to remain that way in the movies. Therefore, here is what I think: The portrayal of Dumbledore was way off. In this movie he was shaken and disturbed. In the books that does not occur (in the readers mind) until sometime in the fifth book. In the forth book, Dumbledore is still a solid rock for Harry to depend on.<br/><br/>The absence of many characters was upsetting to me including Dobby, Winkey, Molly Weasley, Ludo Bagman, the Dursleys, and Sirius.<br/><br/>The absence of Winkey and Dobby changed the plot including Harry's wand getting stolen (Winkey) and the development of S.P.E.W. (both Winkey and Dobby).<br/><br/>We missed the interactions between Molly and Harry which, I feel, is vital to part of the plot in Order of the Phoenix. Molly's relationship with Harry becomes more mother to son in each passing page of the series. By leaving her out of this movie, they have created a mistake that cannot be fixed. Molly and Harry do not share that time before the third task and after the graveyard. This time together brings their relationship to a height that it has not been before.<br/><br/>The absence of Sirius has changed his character. The audience is not made aware of the deep love and caring that Sirius has for Harry. I thought the scene with Sirius in the fire was awful in its accuracy of how the book was written. The book gives the impression of the head coming to the other side of the fire and speaking. This was not done correctly and it will be forced to remain like this in Order of the Phoenix, since Harry uses the fire to speak with Sirius. By Sirius not coming to the school we are not left with the impression that he will do anything for Harry, which is the case.<br/><br/>Ludo Bagman may only be a supporting character but his presence was important none the less. The removal of this character removed the plot with the twins getting the disappearing money, and Ron's grievance with Harry over not realizing that he has a Galleon missing that Ron paid him back with for the gifts at the match (since it was disappearing money also. The wealth difference between Harry and Ron is a sticking point for them and it always has been, it is actually an important part to the plot.<br/><br/>While I understand the reasoning for removing the Dursley's due to time constraints, the fact that the toffee does not get eaten by Dudley makes it so we never find out about Weasley's Wizard Weezes and the twins plans to open a joke shop.<br/><br/>I would rather sit in that movie theater for 8 hours to see the whole movie then watch a condensed 2.5 hour version of the movie. I am worried about the Order of the Phoenix movie since it is a long and involved book as well."

And the answers are, ""Yes"" and ""Nothing really did happen"" At least in the other movies, they can stand alone, they don't reference another movie to follow--that is all this movie is, a fluffer to the next one.

","Overall, this movie was really a giant leap forward. The previous three had mainly been fillers on what happens in the world of magic and the introduction to key characters, i.e. Sirius Black, Ron and his family, the school's staff and grounds. Also, the acting hadn't been up to par and there were all sorts of problems with the 'maturing' of the actors. Because the actors have sort of stabilised, the movie contains some brilliant acting and contains very real scenarios that are prevalent in many people's lives, such as girls and death. The leap from good magic to the darker side of magic in this movie is awesome for the majority of Harry Potter fans, who understand that these books are not just for children but for adults as well.10/10"

Dumbledore is supposed to be a gentle, old codger who's as nice as pie. That part didn't suit his supposed character at all. And get that hair tie out of your beard old man!!!<br/><br/>And the part where Harry found Crouch dead behind a tree, and all of a sudden, you cross over to Dumbledore and Fudge talking about it. That was just too fast, and I only saw it for the first time today, but did you ever actually find out at the end who killed Crouch? Also, the missing out of the 1000 galleons prize money given to Fred and George, that bit gave the clue of their ideas to start a joke shop, it might not have been completely necessary, but that part is used a lot in the fifth and sixth book.<br/><br/>And I think lastly, how Harry didn't have to fight anything in the maze to get to the cup, that was a bit stupid.I wanted to see the mermaid thingy giving him the riddle like she did in the book, and Harry having to fight the blast ended skrewt. And how could Harry know that Krum was bewitched? The eyes weren't that obvious, and he didn't know about it in the book, Cedric and Harry just thought Krum was a traitor. <br/><br/>Oh wait! I remembered another!! Barty Crouch Jr, he said hardly anything when he had the truth serum, what about his mum sneaking him out of Azkaban? And all that, I'm not sure if I blacked out half way through the movie or not, but I thought that was pretty important.<br/><br/>ONE MORE!!! I thought Hermione reacted pretty over the top at the Yule Ball, that part was just weird, Ron and Hermione, get it on already. They so totally will in the seventh book I reckon.<br/><br/>Anyway, sorry guys for rambling on about the cons, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. The acting by the very sexy Daniel Radcliffe, (I'm allowed to have a crush on him, I'm 16) was so much better this time round, he was awesome. (Neville was good too.) The special effects were amazing and the scenery and the music. The characters fit their roles well, except for Dumbledore, and I think they could have picked a better Cho Chang. Most of what was cut out didn't disappoint me much, I didn't think much of it, only the minor details weren't explored enough, the ones I mentioned above. Harry Potter 4 was a brilliant movie, I'm going to go see it again, and again, and again and again! I suggest you do too!"

","To all of those who are not sure whether they should go and see this movie.. what are you waiting for?? I saw the movie (finally) today (we in Aus had to wait an extra 2 weeks after the US and UK - so not fair), and to my great pleasure I can say that you will not be disappointed... Whilst the start tends to chop and change (only the first 10 or so minutes), the rest of the movie flows well and I was quite surprised (in a good way) by just how much of the book they kept in the movie... Given the (relatively) short running time - 2hr25mins.. I expected that a LOT would be cut out... but the script writer Steve Kloves and the director Mike Newell have really done a great job in carrying the essence of the book into the film... Whilst there have been some changes to scenes in the book, they make perfect sense and one can easily see why they did it that way (time constraints, new audience confusion, etc). Part thriller/Part comedy/and Part action, this movie has it all... the darkness-o-meter has been cranked up a notch this time around, and trust me, this is no kids movie. So do yourself a favour and go and see this film, it's a great adaptation of a great book and that's all that matters!! 9/10... I can't wait to go see it again."

It was unengaged, and had very little impact on the emotion of the film. Moments which should have had me in emotional anguish (Cedric's death, Voldemort's rebirth, Harry's conversation with his parents, too many to mention really) felt totally emotionally detached, and this from a guy who cries at sappy commercials.<br/><br/>I have been spoiled by John Williams I know.

"seanyap","8","0","0","30 November 2005"," The Best One Yet
","Like most other people, I believe that this one is the best one yet. In the movie, there were a whole lot of cuts to keep within the film's 2 and a half hour running time. As a result, the movie's details vary quite greatly from the book, although the film's core remains faithful.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the film has to be the special effects, which was nothing short of amazing. From the quidditch world cup, to each of the 3 tasks, all were done exceptionally well. However I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to see the actual quidditch match.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly solid. Newcomers include Brendan Gleeson, who plays the part of Mad-Eye Moody well, Ralph Fiennes, who does enough to make us believe that Voldemort is capable of the evil he speaks of, and Miranda Richardson, who is not around enough for us to care much. Most of the old cast is back too...including Hagrid, who provides most of the film's comic relief in his scenes with Madame Maxime. As for the supporting cast of students, Ginny and Neville see their roles slightly expanded. and the new students, namely Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang are all well cast.<br/><br/>But all those characters play supporting roles as most of the time, the movie focuses on the main trio. By now, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have all made the parts of Harry, Ron and Hermione their own, and now it would be impossible to imagine anyone other than those three playing these roles.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter series has gotten better with each movie. This one is the best yet and it will take a huge effort to top this. As nearly everyone has said, this movie is the darkest one yet (the PG-13 rating that it was given in the US is certainly warranted). But it is also the most complex, the largest in scope, the most exciting, the most emotional, and the most satisfying of all the movies so far.<br/><br/>""Everything is gonna change now, isn't it?"" says Hermione to Ron and Harry in the movie's last shot. She is speaking about the evil forces that are just starting to surround the wizard world. The bright , sunny and fun wizarding world that we saw in the first two movies will be replaced by a darker, more dangerous one. As viewers, we can only hope that it dosen't change too much, and that the magic that all four of the films so far contained will still be there come the next film.<br/><br/>Whatever it is, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

","I really did like the movie in just a plain ""I'm just going out the the movies"" sort of way. I thought there were a lot of scenes that were extended and to make is seem more dramatic and because of that they had to leave out very important parts of the book. Some of the things I missed were the opening scene with the Dursley's; everyone sitting in the top box at the quidditch cup and seeing Winky and Draco in the same box; Ludo Bagman was also a large part of this book and he was also left out; I missed seeing the rest of the Weasley family (Bill and Charlie); there wasn't very much time spent with Hagrid or in any classes; the whole Crouch story line was messed up too; and that there weren't any of Hagrids monsters in the maze. So that is that for what they left out. As for character performances I thought overall they were pretty good. I thought Dumblebore seemed way to aggressive toward Harry. In the books Dumbledore is very calm, well spoken and so impressive but the way he was portrayed in the movie was loud, aggressive and somewhat scary (he is not suppose to be scary!!!) A couple last things that I did not like were Barty Crouch Jr.(what was with his tongue, it drove me nuts the way he kept sticking it out) and the way they should the use of floo powder. I think I was just too hyped up for the movie and I expected them to add much more from the book. I have went twice now and the first time it was with someone that had never read the books and they asked me questions through the whole thing and the second time was with someone who had read the book but a while ago and they were confused on some to the scenes of the movie too. Although I had to realize that they were never going to get all of the major aspects of the book in a movie that was 2 1/2 hrs long. Anyway like I said earlier, overall I liked this movie and I think it was much better then the the 3rd movie. I think it helped when they added the comical scenes (Flich and Fred and George were great!). I would definitely recommend it to others and I can't wait to buy it on video."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best of the series. I found it pretty entertaining, especially i am in the middle of preparing for final exams. It captured most of the main points of the book. The Triwizard Tournament was accurate, even though some parts were missing. Near the ending the graveyard scene was very detailed, considering it is such important turning point of the Harry Potter series. It was very well done and true to the book.<br/><br/>The acting was good for most of the characters, but there is one small part that i found not so true to the book. It was when Harry's name got nominated by the Goblet of Fire, then Dumbledore almost strangled our poor Harry. The emotion was too strong, and is different from the Dumbledore i know from the book who was always calm and wise.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good. The dragons are really cool, even though they were much smaller than what i have imagined. It was pity they didn't show all four combatants' battling for the golden egg though.<br/><br/>The story for the Goblet Fire is much darker than the previous three. I think it is not very suitable for younger viewers. However, older fans will enjoy it.<br/><br/>Over all, the Goblet of Fire is very well made, but i found it was kind of rushed (considering they have to put the story of a dictionary size book into a 2.5 hours movie). People who had read the book should have no problem follow it, but i think people whop never read the book will be kind of lost."

","9... and a half! Harry Potter. Where do I start? First, we had the Philosopher's Stone, with Harry in his first year. Then came The Chamber of Secrets, where Harry grows up a little, and the chamber is opened. In the third movie, The Prisonar of Azkaban, where a little more is revealed, and it turns out that Harry has a godfather. But none of the three are anything compared to the Goblet of Fire. I laughed, I cried (twice!), I gasped, I screamed, I was on the edge of my seat. I loved it. I must say, that a lot IS left out, and I seemed to get confused throughout the movie, getting the fifth book mixed up with this one. I imagined parts of the movie to be completely different, which sort of ruined my own personal thoughts and fantasies, but then there was some things which were identical to my imaginations. The graphics were absolutely amazing (thanks to the Australian composers!) and very realistic. The main thing that bothered me about this movie, is that everything was so quick. Non stop, like BAM next scene, BAM next scene, BAM, BAM, not one moment of boredom. It was confusing, but I guess they had to do it that way, otherwise either a lot would be left out, or the movie would go for 5 hours. All those who haven't seen it yet, I suggest you do... I'm going to see it again tomorrow!"

","I own the other 3 movies. And I will own this one. I have to say that this movie is by far the best one yet. The visual effects are stunning, and I found that the movie stayed more to the plot of the story in this movie, much more so than in the first three. One thing, however, is that we are beginning to be able to see the ages of the characters not matching up to the characters in the book. I am anxious to see how the director deals with this problem. It is unfortunate, but they did have to cut out a pretty hefty chunk of the story line, but nothing to really impair the movie. Some character development was left out, but again, nothing to hurt the movie as a whole. If you have not yet seen a Harry Potter movie, and want to see just one to see what they are like, see this one. It is absolutely amazing and I can't wait for the future movies (and last book in the series)."

","Now I will start this off by saying that the movie was without a doubt good, but for reasons I will name later on you will realize why it is that I gave this movie the score you see above.<br/><br/>Going into the theater to see this movie I was expecting 2 and a half hours worth footage of a movie based on one of the best books I have ever read'. I feel I didn't get this, or anything near it. The movie started off great giving me the feeling that there will be a very dark feel to it throughout the entire two and a half hours, but later on I discovered that this was not the case.I think much of the movie was wasted to show what was happening with Harry and Cho Chang and other small parts in the book, rather then spending the time on more important parts such as the fight at the end, or the quidditch world cup at the beginning. The set for the quidditch cup was great and just when I was expecting a good action-packed part of the movie the scene switched to everyone celebrating and that was a huge disappointment. The whole movie after that I feel was made up of ""incomplete"" parts put together to form what was a very rushed movie and even taking in consideration that if they were to make this movie better it would have to be a lot longer I am still convinced that they could have improved it in many ways and still have it less then three hours long.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie a 6/10. For Harry Potter fans I think for the most part they will walk out pleased, but for fans who appreciate the books as much as I have will realize that there was a lot missing in this movie and it was not the best in the series."

","I went to see this over the weekend and I wondered how close it would be to the book, considering it was only a little longer that Sorcerer's Stone. I walked out happy. The special effects were great and real looking. The adult actors were very good, especially Michael Gambon, who I thought he was better in this one than Prisonor of Azkaban. Even though he isn't as good as the great Richard Harris, I thought he did very well. Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe were better in this one than the others, especially Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson really got on my nerves as Hermione in this occasionally. She seemed to act too melodramatic sometimes, but she was all right. As a fan of the books, I think Steve Kloves did better on the screenplay on this one. Even though many things were taken out and it felt a little rushed, everything went in place all right. I'm glad it was rated PG-13 because the story gets a lot darker as it goes on. I thought Voldemort looked pretty cool, except I still can't remember why he was a little half-human midget. Anyway, I wouldn't really recommend this to younger children because of some language, Frightening and violent images. Overall, I think this is the best Harry Potter film yet, and made up for some of the mistakes in Prisoner of Azkaban. I have high hopes for Order of the Phenoix."

","I saw this movie last night and I had previously read some of the reviews. They either said that the movie wasn't that good or it was the best one yet. I went into the movie not expecting it to be the best movie just so I wouldn't be disappointed. After 10 minutes of watching to ""Goblet"" I knew that this was going to be my favorite movie of the year!!! The movie didn't follow the book exactly but they put in all of the major parts and the parts that they did take out weren't that important. Dumberdore wasn't his calm self either but it didn't ruin the movie like some other reviews said. Even though I have read the book numerous times, my heart was still pumping in many occasions!! The acting was great too; Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have gotten much better since the first movie. Mike Newell did a great job directing as well. What more can I say? I LOVED the movie and I hope that all of the other Harry Potter lovers will enjoy this movie as much as I have. Go out and watch it as soon as you can, it is definitely worth it!!! And even if you aren't a Harry Potter lover (don't know why anyone wouldn't be) you should still go out and see it!!!"

","***Contains spoilers*** Still here? If you haven't watched or read the book don't read any further....<br/><br/>Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire's director is ace. He managed to make me cry after Harry and Cedric (*dead*) come back to Hogwarts and I've only cried during games and books. Never movies... (Well, I've also cried in Lotr Rotk but LOTR's not a film it's art) That was the first film to manage making me cry. Not tearry, I'm talking about sobbing.. And when the scene ended. I stopped. Directing magic...<br/><br/>After that it was the fact that despite it's short length you really felt as if the movie was going for hours and this was a good thing after the rushed movie version of HP#3.<br/><br/>I also liked a lot that Deatheaters looked like members of the KKK only clad in black. That's a nice way to teach children that racism in any kind isn't 'cool'.<br/><br/>Big pluses: Emma Watson whose acting has improved loads and tons. Angry!Dumbledore, Snape in the library and the line ""Potter, what's your hurry?"" <-priceless :) Disappointing facts: Dumbledore didn't explain why the wands connected, Hagrid never revealed being a giant, No Bill& Charlie and no Animagus!Rita Skeeter...

"gambits_cheri","9","0","0","30 November 2005"," Where Book and Film Divorce
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an excellent film, and not just because of the vast amount of eye-candy to be had on-screen. At last the Potter-Empire has found a director that is not obsessed with his own self-image. The film is dark, given its content, but without the over-dramatic, poorly-lit, and cinematic-Xanax affect of PoA. I appreciated Kloves attempt to keep in several key-aspects of the film, even if some parts were lacking--like the entire Quidditch game from the world Cup and the Weasley twins being privy to Harry's Cup winnings. The film also skims over Rita Skeeter's role and does not, at any point, allude to her ability to spy on people in beetle form.<br/><br/>However, Kleeves is sheer genius at alluding to the Golden Trio's trials and mishaps of puberty, without turning into an ABC family special or a Lifetime fiasco. The cinematography is brilliant, retaining the sets' confounding beauty (unlike PoA when a black coverlet was thrown over everything) while accepting the fact that in this fourth movie, Harry is at last coming to the realization that he is locked in bitter combat with a true fiend.<br/><br/>The film is brilliant, and exceptionally accurate, although I feel it's safe to assume that here is where book and film divorce; there most likely will not be a ""Lord of the Rings""-style epic for the kids."

","I have seen the latest Harry Potter twice now(I am so lucky),and both times I thought it was excellent. It is a brilliant film for all the family, but it's not rated 12A for nothing! Half the people in the cinema let out huge gasps when Ron told Harry to p**s off, and when Cedric was murdered.<br/><br/>The movie has a great score, despite the fact that it wasn't John Williams doing the music,yet Patrick Doyle is just as talented. It is a very exciting film, but also a lot darker than the first three. I was slightly worried how it would turn out, due to yet another change of director, but it has been set out perfectly. Top actors, though some could have done slightly better in such a big-budget film such as this.However, yet again, a lot of info is left out from the books(possibly crucial to the story)and this slightly spoiled it for me. The books are infinitely better though, as you can use your imagination!"

","Being a Harry Potter fan from the first time i read the book, i knew i would like this film. But not like this... This is something extraordinary, something breathtaking. I liked the first three movies too, but this one stands out. Then Why? Chris Columbus, who directed the two first movies, practically drowned them in grease, while Cuarcon drowned his movie in visual effects. Newell, however, adds the darkness that Potter deserves. Both Harry himself and the story have become more adult, simply. Newell understands Harry like none of the other directors did. Simply, Newell is the first to take Harry seriously. He also made the characters a lot more interesting, which gives the actors more room to act, especially Mr. Radcliffe, who practically grinned himself through the first movie, but now makes Harry come alive. His Colleges, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson also reaches new heights. The rest of the cast is also very good, especially Brendan Gleeson as professor Mad Eye Moody (or Barty Crouch, if you like). The film Is a bit messy in the beginning, but the ending is just incredible. Ralph Fiennes is marvelous as Lord Voldemort and Diggorys death scene is about the strongest I've ever seen. Young or old, man or woman, SEE THIS MOVIE!!"

","Finally, they FINALLY had a British director. You wouldn't think it would be too much to ask, considering the book was written by an English author and SET in the UK. It certainly paid off as Goblet is easily the best of the films.<br/><br/>The good: <br/><br/>Special effects - the sequence with the dragon, though overly long, was superbly done The maze - one of the highlights of the movie. It was dark, creepy, atmospheric and just fitted perfectly to what Rowling was trying to write. One of the few instances where the film did live up to my hopes.<br/><br/>The acting - particularly the adult cast. Alan Rickman, as always IS Snape. And Miranda Richardson was easily the best. She WAS Rita for me, in a way that no other actor (except Rickman) has managed. Truly wonderful to watch. And Radcliffe has certainly improved. The aftermath of the Graveyard was his most notable scene, the part where he clutches Cedric's body with tears streaming down his face is heart rending. Hard to believe its the same person watching the utterly cringeworthy 'he was their friend' scene in PoA.<br/><br/>The bad: <br/><br/>A few moments that made me cringe - the entrances of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Say no more. Also the music when Hermione enters and comes down the steps at the Yule Ball.<br/><br/>Dumbledore - sorry! Michael Gambon is a terrific actor. But he isn't Dumbledore. Richard Harris rather inconveniently died which is a shame, as he did the character so well. Gambon just doesn't have that...quality. And he would not SHAKE Harry. Ever.<br/><br/>The dragon sequence - too long. Instead, insert another scene that could contribute to character development or plot advancement.<br/><br/>Emma Watson's eyebrows - what was going on there? There was excessive eyebrow movement whenever she spoke. I was transfixed. By the end of the film, I wasn't listening to a word she was saying as they completely took my concentration.<br/><br/>The ugly: <br/><br/>VITAL CHARACTERS MISSED OUT - Winky was crucial to the plot. Where was she?? Sure, Dobby wasn't really needed once they had Neville give Harry the Gillyweed. But Winky! Winky! And where was Ludo Bagman? okay, so he wasn't VITAL exactly, but still.<br/><br/>VITAL PLOT POINTS MISSED OUT/CHANGED - Finding Crouch dead. Should have kept it how it was in the book. And how they conveniently managed to overlook the fact that everyone thought Barty Crouch junior was DEAD. They shouldn't have had him in Harry's dreams either, it made the ending less of a surprise.<br/><br/>Lack of explanation - not so much for me, but for those who haven't read the books. No explanation of Priori Incatetum in particular. Also, not enough was said about Neville's parents and who tortured them. You'd think they'd include this as Bellatrix is responsible for Sirius's death in book 5.<br/><br/>Unsatisfactory ending - no Fudge/Dumbledore clash. I don't know how they're going to work round this as its pretty crucial in book five. Also, how will they explain Hagrid's absence? <br/><br/>Goblet of Fire was certainly the best film, and a very enjoyable one at that. But such a long book can't hope to be well explained on film. They really ought to release an extended version when it comes out on DVD."

"parvati_patil","10","0","0","30 November 2005"," The greatest Harry Potter so far!
","Finally, after having waited for this movie for months, I saw ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", as soon as I could!<br/><br/>First of all, ALL Harry Potter fans  and especially, fans of the books  must take into consideration that they mustn't start counting the differences between the book plot and the movie plot  it will ruin everything and I believe nobody wants that. Judge it as a movie, not as an accurate adaptation of the book. Being a huge Harry Potter fan, I used to complain about the alterations of the plot, but unfortunately, keeping every single detail would result in a 4-hour movie!<br/><br/>Now, my comments. The first events happen really fast, in my opinion  the dream, the preparation for the Quidditch World Cup, the Quidditch World Cup itself and the Dark Mark scene. The last one was a really great scene but didn't last very much, either.<br/><br/>The arrivals of the foreign students happen equally fast, but they are impressive. The infamous scene where Dumbledore pushes Harry onto the wall when he asks him if he put his name in the GOF is indeed a bit strange, we wouldn't expect such violent reactions from Dumbledore, no matter how worried he is.<br/><br/>The 1st task is incredible (the dragon is REALLY scary), as well as the 2nd one. The Yule Ball scene doesn't last very long, but I truly liked the emotional depth they put into it, in the scene where, when Ron gets jealous of Krum and tells Hermione off, she cries and blames him for ruining everything. It was a beautiful scene, showing that the heroes are now teenagers and their emotions and behaviour get intense.<br/><br/>The 3rd task is frightening but not more than the graveyard scene. Really, the latter justifies completely why the film has been rated PG-13. Most people won't feel very comfortable watching the scene where Wormtail cuts his and Harry's hand, although we don't see those precise moments, but Harry's face and reactions. Voldemort is terrifying  but you still can tell from his face who's the actor playing him. I really liked the scene where he unmasks the Death Eaters  so that people who haven't read the book can understand that among the DEs there is someone we 've already seen in the movies. The ""Priori Incantantem"" scene is really touching, especially where Lily talks to Harry and Cedric's ghost asks him to get his body back to his father.<br/><br/>I nearly cried when Harry gets back to Hogwarts and he and Amos Diggory cry over Cedric's body. It's a really depressing scene. The ending is nothing really special.<br/><br/>The young actors' performances have really improved and it's great to see that and the new ones (Robert Pattinson, Clemence Poesy, Stanislav Ianevksi) are very good, too. The adults (Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson) and especially the villains (Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs) are truly AMAZING, they did a great job!<br/><br/>To sum up, the ""Goblet of Fire"" is a great movie, with lots of humour (Ron's role and the Hagrid-Madame Maxime love story are the best!), but it's also frightening, touching and most of all realistic, showing perfectly how it looks like to be a teenager. Mike Newell did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>The ""Philosopher's Stone"" and the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" had been nominated for Academy Awards but didn't get any. The ""Goblet of Fire"" deserves at least one  the special effects are amazing!<br/><br/>10/10. One of the best movies of the year and the greatest Harry Potter movie so far! Definitely worth watching!"

","First thing i have to say is that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter film by far, and the choice of Mike Newell as director has paid off, giving the movie a darker and more well knit and composed feel than the movies by Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron. But if you're a fan who's read all six books then prepare to be disappointed as the book has many elements and characters that are left out in the movie that might leave some shocked and annoyed, but is sometimes necessary in a movie adaption that was already stretched for nearly three hours. As a reader myself, i enjoyed the interesting interpretation the movie gave for the characters and some of the scenes that i had awaited eagerly to see on film, but was disappointed at the lack of involvement of some important characters in the fourth book, and the slight sensation that everything was being rushed through, the most obvious example being Barty Crouch's death left unexplained, as well as the manner in which Harry escaped from Voldemort being left unexplained too. Overall, i recommend it for both fans and interested cinema goers, and i can't wait for the next movie."

","This is the best that they could do? I should hope not because though they did an admirable job portraying the Tri-Wizard Tournament which is the general idea of the book they left out so many things that cross apply to the next movies to explain the twins leaving and the abilities that Harry displayed during each of the three trials that it leaves you wondering how they could chop this up so badly. Even at the end when Dumbledore tells Harry why his parents, the grounds-keeper, and Cedric's spirits appeared during the connection of the two wands that is a small indicator of the connection the two, Harry and Voldemort, share. I know that some of you out there are saying that this is a kids movie and it has to be short to keep their attention, but if the movie is kept as great as it is in the visuals and the rest of the story including, the practice room where Harry learns all his spells, the Rita Skeeter animagus connection to explain all of the news reports, the Floo network talks to Sirius, Ron's owl, and the Gift of the winnings to the Twins, not to mention all of the twins joke experiments. All of the above has been left out and if they only would have made an hour longer satisfaction would have been appeased on my part. Don't MISUNDERSTAND THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE BUT FOR ME IT NEEDS TO BE LONGER AND THE KIDS THAT ARE READING THE BOOKS WOULD WATCH THE ENTIRE THING NO PROBLEMS BUT NOW WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE MAKE AN EXTENDED EDITION ON DVD WITH THE HOUR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE ADDED IN UNFORTUNATELY I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT WILL BE THE CASE.

"Sperry23","10","0","0","29 November 2005"," Best of the lot...so far
","This is -- IMHO -- the best of the series so far.<br/><br/>While much will be made of the ""darkness"" of this film, it must be remembered that the characters are growing up as is the audience for them. There are a few levitation scenes (those 'boo' scenes that make the audience levitate 6-12 inches off their seats), and there is a tad more violence. Fortunately, these scenes are frequently leavened by humorous scenes and/or bits which take the edge off. Still, I would no more take a child under 8 to see this film than I would read them the book it came from.<br/><br/>Speaking of the book, the director did a great job compressing 700+ pages into 2 1/2 hours. Regrettably some material had to be deeply abbreviated (such as the Quiddich World Cup subplot) or jettisoned entirely as was the subplot involving Hermione trying to 'save' the 'poor, oppressed' house-elf workforce of Hogwarts. No Dobby this time.<br/><br/>Another area that bothered some, but not me, was the snarkyness of Harry and Ron. It must be remembered that they are going through puberty at this time and subject to typical young male adolescent behaviors. Kids get sullen, snarky, and their hormones run absolutely amok. Those of us who still recall that we were once that age can relate, as did several 15 year olds I overheard chatting after the film.<br/><br/>The only thing I was less than pleased with was Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore. He has an unfortunate tendency to chew the scenery ... a lot. His overreaction to Harry's name being selected by the Goblet was way over the top. The producers would do well to look for a Dumbledore more like the late, much lamented Richard Harris.

","After watching Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, I was somewhat disappointed. I expected there to be much more. The Quidditch World Cup wasn't even shown. One second, the game is starting, and the next second, it's already over. I found the movie to be fast-paced and somewhat of a disappointment due to how much was taken out of the movie. In some parts of the movie, a scene that took up 20 pages in the book only took 5 minutes in the movie. Before watching this film, I had thought that this would have been my most favorite Harry Potter film made yet. But sadly, I rather enjoy the previous film. Don't get me wrong though, it's very well put together and is a must-see film for all Harry Potter fans. I just expected more from it."

","Well, there are just the main plots of the book in this movie, but the charm of the earlier movies is completely missing, since the director concentrated too much on the special-effects-gimmicks. The sequence with the Quidich world-championship was a real mess, the stadium didn't look like the described one in the book at all, Twinky is completely out of the story, Mrs Weasley is completely missing and so on. There is a sequence with Ron dancing with Profesor McGonagall, that was intended to be funny, but isn't mentioned in the book, Harry was hunted down by the Horntail dragon throughout the campus, just to show how good the animators are, aargh, I got to stop it... Frankly, I can only hope they go back to Chris Columbus as the next director."

","Very well done altogether but as one previous reviewer did point out the following important omissions: *) No Hermione catching Rita skeeter in a jar this is very important as she is indebted to Hermione to do Harry an interview in the 5th movie.<br/><br/>*) No introduction of Charlie and he will also be very important to Movie 6 when the time comes, of course there is time in Movie 5 to correct this one.<br/><br/>Also would like to see more interaction between Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson just for entertainment sake.<br/><br/>However spectacular effects and kudos for the scenes with Neville.

","I thought there were too many gaps in this movie. While i think they did an admiral job of **trying** to condense it, there was too much that was awkward.<br/><br/>For example, i find it strange that Harry, Harmione, Hagrid, and Ron find Bartie Crouch in the forest but they never addressed it at all in the movie - not when Harry went to Dumbledore's office, not after the competition, not when Dumbledore went to Harrys dorm at the end (which is the perfect opportunity to tie things together).<br/><br/>I just hope that i can purchase an extended version that includes all the scenes they deleted - i hope that it exists as it would make a smoother movie."

","Well, many of you are upset that they should have made two movies instead of just one. Some of you are upset that they left so much out, but you must realize people...this is a big blockbuster movie, all they want to do is make a lot of money, and make the general public happy! This movie though was by far the best out of the series...the special effects, the actors, everyone, it just made me euphorically happy. Although a lot was left out, they can't make one book into two movies because these actors would be WAY to old for the next movies. They're too old already, they'd be 50 when they're suppose to be 18. I just had one question for this movie, what was with the sexual tension between Harry and Hermione? I mean they really didn't play up Hermione and Ron in this picture...you got the idea that she was upset that Ron didn't ask her...but Hermione was really vibin' with Harry....will my dreams come true? Will harry and Hermione ever get together? Also, one more thing that was bad about the series is that Ginny is way to young. It's hard for me to see her as a lover in Harry's eyes...it's like he's being a pedophile. BUT this is just trivial matters in the series...if you want to have some fun at the movies and want to see it again, again, and again...GO SEE HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE! I would also recommend it in IMAX because it was incredible to be consumed by Harry Potter. :-D"

I liked the way the scenes with Barty Crouch Jr. played out, I thought those were great. The scene with the Dealth Eaters were awesome, much better than they were in the book. The challenges for the Tri-Wizard contest were really good, and much more interesting than in the book! Dumbledore was a little scary at first, but he mellowed out in the end.

","When Mike Newell, was given the option of making two films out of ""The Goblet of Fire,"" some might say he did a dangerous thing by going against it. In order to make it possible to make the one book, into one movie, the only thing he could do, was take out the bulk of the sub-plots, centralizing the movie on the main theme. A dangerous thing certainly. This was a big change, and he would face the possible risk of an angry reception, if he failed to meet the audiences expectations. But I think he did. And did wonderfully at that. It took quite a bit of courage to make the decision, to cut the book down, and Mike Newell certainly had it. But now, lets look at what made this film, so good.<br/><br/>First of all, the cinematography, was astounding to say the least, and definitely deserves a standing ovation. The movie captured a light of excitement, and an eerie feeling over some parts<br/><br/>Secondly, the way in which it was done. The feel that was given over it. While this movie was to be more sinister than ever, it kept the innocence, that has been kept since the first. It still had that magical feeling, and was action-packed from start to finish. Every location was done to its best, and had artistic beauty.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I would not disagree, with one casting in this movie. The acting was superb, and while Hermione, was a bit protective to Harry, and acted a bit too adult like at times, each character portrayed that of the book, superbly. It had a funniness, excitement, and dark feel, all not, too emphasized. <br/><br/>And fourthly, it had zest throughout the movie, with not a dull moment. It was very hypnotizing, and your eyes were glued start to finish.<br/><br/>I watched this movie twice, and learned to appreciate it more, the second time, for what it really was.<br/><br/>I deducted a point, because of the unnecessary scenes-E.g Neville dancing in the dorm.<br/><br/>Why should you see this movie? Simply because its magic!"

","The first two Harry Potter movies were extremely disappointing and the Prisoner of Azkaban was better than the others but wasn't that great. The Goblet of Fire being my favourite book, I really hoped that it would be excellent. Mike Newell has done an excellent job in making this movie. The special effects are perfect and this movie is the only Potter movie that was quite close to the book.<br/><br/>I do have a few criticisms to make though. Firstly, the Quidditch World Cup seemed to be very abrupt. I would have liked to see more than Viktor Krum flying around the stadium. Secondly, the Third Task did not relate to the book as there were very few obstacles in the movie.<br/><br/>However, it's a great movie to watch on a Friday afternoon with friends. The teenage comedy is simply hilarious and you can't help feel a little disappointed that the laughs were so short.<br/><br/>The acting from the young cast has improved immensely and all Potter fans hope to see them improve even more as the series reaches the seventh movie."

","There are already too many reviews of Harry Potter and the goblet of fire; however, I cannot pass the opportunity to express my disappointment with this last installment, script and director.<br/><br/>The fourth Harry Potters book is probably the most complex and important of the series. It completes the setup, started on the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" which was the best adaptation yet of the series.<br/><br/>""Goblet of fire"" is a rather difficult book. It is not kid oriented at all. Hard matters like racism, government totalitarism, youth rebeldy and adult distrust are treated far from light all over the book. Something that continues even harder in ""Order of Phoenix"".<br/><br/>Mike Newel, a romantic comedy creator, was in my opinion the worst selection for this one. He could probably be able to handle the first lighter installments but this one was a job for Cuaron or probably Tim Burton. This is far from his league and it shows.<br/><br/>Newel / producers decided to make a ""Politically correct movie"". Subjects of racism and fascism together with government corruption and bureaucracy are nowhere to be seen here. The strong riot in the ""Quidditch World Cup"" are gone, just a brief look of burned tents. The alteration of the news by a selfish reporter is barely seen and more as comic matter than the prejudice caused to everybody. Even the end has been lightened as much as possible (it is a miracle they did not change it at all).<br/><br/>What is still there of course are the usual Hollywood blockbuster things. Very simple story, lots of action / digital effects (not too good, my 9 years old nephew said that the movie was ""too digital"").<br/><br/>Still, my biggest disappointment was J. K. Rowlings has become so money desperate to allow the slaughter of one of her best novels.<br/><br/>Beware, the Harry Potter's series is really a literature classic. It is one of few books I ever read that span imagination while TEACHING DIFFICULT SUBJECTS that parents have difficult to touch.<br/><br/>I want the whole series made movies as everybody else, but perhaps it is time to say enough. Literature is art, and a couple of ""functionaries"" do not have the right to destroy art to fulfill their commercial needs."

","Finally, The fourth Movie! In a word, it was awesome! True, it omitted much of the sub plots of the book, it stuck to the story, though focusing mostly on the triwizard tournament. the special effects were good and especially in the three tasks. though they could have tried to fit in some of the creatures, monsters etc. in the maze, as of all the tasks the third one was the shortest (in film time). the confrontation scene between voldemort and harry was really great, it was the exact copy of jkr's description. and not to forget the yule ball, in which hermione looks fantastic. though i was disappointed by Dumbledore's reaction o Harry's name coming out from the goblet, that is so totally not him as described by jkr. yes, the fourth movie definitely seems to be the best so far,not perfect,but much much better than the 3rd. overall i rate it a 9 , a must watch for harry potter fans."
"Cvesterby","5","0","0","29 November 2005"," Just not good enough
","Disappointing, that is the first word that come to my mind when I think of this movie...<br/><br/>After watching the ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" I got a feeling of a movie having to much to tell in to little time, leaving no time to for the actors to act or me getting to know them.<br/><br/>In the case of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", this happens to be even more evident. The movie rushes forward from first till last, jumping between conversations and scenes in a tempo making it all seem somewhat chaotic and confusing. Also loads of new characters are dragged into the plot, without getting a proper introduction. But in my opinion the biggest problem in this movie, is the extremely bad acting. All of the 3 maincharacters (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson), are some of the worst actors I have ever seen. I can not stop to think of Mark Hamill from Start Wars. Another bad actor in a big movie. I do not feel with the characters. I do not know why they do what they do. I do not know what they think. Everything seems very superficial and the plot in this movie is also not as good as ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", which, without a doubt, is the best Harry Potter movie. The reason Why we do not get to know the characters, may not only be because of bad acting, maybe the screenplay simply leaves no room for getting to know them, making it bad as well. I can't help to think, if not only the first book actually should have hit the screen? And what happened to Dumbledore??? I know the actor was replaced, but should that change his personality?? Last I must admit, that I have not yet read the books, but I will for sure."
"toaddreyfuss","10","0","0","29 November 2005"," OK, Whatever.
","First, let me say this. If you're looking for the movie to ""be"" the book, pull your head out. It isn't gonna be. It never is, it can't. You can do stuff in movies that you can't in books, and vice versa. So for all you ""Harry Potter"" fans that are whining about it, grow up. It's a rendition of the movie. Someday you'll get your way and you can have them redone, but it'll be your budget and you'll get to figure out what to cut so you can keep your job. All in all, I'd say this was an excellent film. Incidentally, I've read all of the books too. Several times each, actually.<br/><br/>Second, if you're looking for the movie to get darker ""in a fun way"" as one comment reads, I'd recommend pulling your head out but it's in so far you may as well just push it the rest of the way. This is a dark story. By book 4, it's not ""fun"" dark anymore. Book 5 gets worse. And book 6 worse yet. I imagine the last one will be downright scary. Not for young kids. Enough for your pretty dreams of fun scary. Go back to your smurf cartoons, that pesky Gargamel is looking for Smurfette again and just might get her! Third, from another comment, Dumbledore didn't grab Harry around the neck and shake him. Get your eyes checked. But it was a very scary sequence, and I thought he acted appropriately. Remember that while Harry is just a student, the situations he's involved in are life-and-death for the WHOLE WIZARDING WORLD. I fully expected Dumbledore to act a little nervous. Especially since it was Dumbledore's own magic that was supposed to stop this thing from even happening - and he'd had a previous student that did things that scared Dumbledore too, didn't he? Tom Riddle what? It was also necessary to show how everyone was shocked and not just a little freaked out at the fact that HARRY's name got put in the goblet, and the director had limited time and people to do that with. Certainly Dumbledore was the ONLY choice in the situation he was in, he was in charge - can you see Snape sidestepping Dumbledore to confront Harry? How about McGonagall? Remember that only teachers were present (well, teachers... and Crouch).<br/><br/>Fourth, to the guy that complained about computer graphics, ""ho hum, did that""..... The future is going to suck for you. Really. Get over it. What did you want, a real dragon? I suppose you've got one? Or maybe they could cartoon him in like the dragon in Pete's Dragon. That'd be cool. Or maybe a group of guys in a dragon suit! Yeah! OK, no. Computer graphics are the most realistic you're gonna get, so take a chill pill and until you come up with something better just deal with the fact that technology hasn't caught up to you and your prissiness.<br/><br/>The director did a fabulous job of making the situation as tense as it needed to be. A student died, and he didn't pull punches on the fact that he died WITH HIS EYES OPEN. That was a really good addition because it just added to the stark reality Harry is facing at the end of the book.<br/><br/>There are problems, clearly, but I'd say this is probably the best Harry Potter movie to date. Very, very pleased with it, and glad that it's grown up."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a solid adaption of the book. While everything was extremely condensed and at times missing transitions and a little bit episodic, the movie is full of action and some very funny puberty moments. Daniel Radcliffe improves a lot and delivers on the heartbreaking scene at the end of the tournament, and Voldemort is properly creepy and at times terrifying although I'm not sure the horror of the scene lives up to the one in the book for this viewer at least. The change of the maze was a brilliant touch as it is now very scary in the film and transitions very easily into the graveyard sequence. I don't agree with all the changes, especially how the movie feels very Harry/Hermione centered and how Hermione is portrayed (or is that just Emma Watson's overacted performance?) though a very very fascinating interpretation of Dumbledore that asks some necessary actions about his choices. Overall, the film is a good translation of the novel, and definitely fast-paced and amusing. The visuals are stunning, and the new composer adds freshness to the score. Miranda Richardson and Alan Rickman really stand out and give very funny performances. The film series seem to really be moving in the right direction, first with Cuaron's innovative direction, and now with Newell's continuation of Cuaron's world but moving into his own funny (dare I say more British?), fast-paced direction."

","I finished the book ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" for the first time a few days before seeing the movie and, frankly, I was extremely disappointed. I understand that somethings have to be omitted or altered to adapt a book to a movie. My complaint is that this movie handled things so poorly. I liked ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" because it was a story that didn't require reading the books and watching the movies that came before it to understand the story.<br/><br/>The story in ""Goblet"" is alternately blocky and too fast-paced. I don't recall any slow scenes for characters (or the audience) to soak in what's been going on or to mentally chew on the plot. Setting is not properly established for the first 20 minutes or so of the film. Flashing a picture of a train and a castle does not lead the brain to conclude that our main characters are taking a train to a castle where they go to school.<br/><br/>The relationships of the characters to each other also is never fully explained, something all the films fail to do. If I hadn't read the books, for example, I would never know that Ron, the twins, and Ginny are all siblings. Ginny, in ""Goblet"", appears to be nothing more than a girlfriend to Hermionie. As Harry says about girls, ""they travel in packs."" Why is Ron jealous of Harry's newfound fame? You'll never know if you only watch the movie. Why can't he afford the treats on the train ride to the castle? Why does he have to wear those hideous dress robes? You'll never know from the movie. Here's where a line or two of explanation would be worth more than a thousand galleons of prize money.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing Harry practice the Accio charm before the first task... but all we get is Harry awkwardly saying the incantation when facing the dragon . . . no build-up whatsoever. New information really shouldn't be presented in a story the very first time it is vital to the plot. With no explanation of what he was doing a casual audience member might not know what the heck was going on! I really dislike vital bits of information left out of ""Goblet"". Why did Harry and Voldemort's wands connect? A line or two from Dumledore could have shed light on the event... but there is none (except for his muttering of the phenomenon's magical name under his breath . . . for all we know it could be a reference to some Catholic rite-of-passage!) I give this movie a thumbs down! Sorry Rosie!"

Still after seeing the trailers and hearing all of the tremendous feedback, I went to see Goblet of Fire with no idea of the storyline, no idea who any of the characters were and left the theater HOOKED! I was glued to my seat throughout the film's entirety and was thoroughly engrossed with each and every scene. The acting was superb, the young cast going head to head with such veterans as Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, and so many more.

The comedic sections are very funny, while the more serious parts cannot be mistaken for anything else. It is definitely not straight from the book, but is close enough that a reader knows what is going on. However, some characters are not in the movie which have fairly large roles in the book. They may have been cut for time, but a lot of people may not have cared how long the movie was.

","I did enjoy this film and it was most certainly the best of the four so far... But I have my qualms.<br/><br/>It is a huge shame about the apparent lack of funds... After spending so much money on the special effects, it seems they only had enough money left to hire a plank of wood for the part of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>These are big films and will go down in history along with the incredible books so then why do they give us bad acting? It was understandable at first... The kids were young (not to say its impossible to find an eleven-year-old that can act) and new to the world of films, but three films later and Daniel Radcliffe is still spouting emotionless rubbish! Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) are coming into their own, Emma with a beautiful vocal tone with expression and strength, Rupert with brilliant comic timing, which will definitely get him far. But does Mr Radcliffe, the 'star' of the story, not realise he has to prove something to the audience? Yes he may be sitting comfortably with his supposed £15million wage for this film, but I'm far from impressed.<br/><br/>I know I'm not the only person with this opinion, I'm sure half the nation will agree. In short, Daniel Radcliffe cannot act. His facial expression is bland, his vocal expression is blander and his overall performance leaves more that a lot to be desired. Now either they replace Daniel with someone as talented as his co-stars, or get him some acting lessons quickly, or he will be out performed by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The film as a whole was enjoyable, with thrills and some brilliant scenes, perfectly grasping the tension of the book. Ralph Fiennes makes great Voldemort, with charm and charisma on his side, and once again Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman both deliver the goods. Michael Gambon did worry me slightly with his portrayal of Dumbledore in this film. His accent was rather indistinct and his character as a whole seemed less poised than you expect Dumbledore to be.<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable film with a few disappointments. 7/10 from me."

That, combined with the disappointment of the first two movies did not give me much hope for this one, but I was blown away by the director's style and the wonderful screenplay. They did a good job cutting scenes to scale down the time of the movie and included somethings that really made this one stand out as the best. Mostly, you come to care about the characters so by the time Cedric died and Harry was tortured, the majority of the theatre was in tears! Also there were many hilarious parts that were either accentuated (or in some cases completely made up) that really added to the entertainment value and balanced out some of the darker scenes. The action sequences were also very good for those of you who like that kind of thing.

","Four years ago, if someone would have mentioned Harry Potter I would have said, not that childish crap from Britain again. I admit that I didn't even get into the series until seeing Prisoner of Azkaban last summer.<br/><br/>Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were children's films. Prisoner of Azkaban changed everything for the better and the latest installment, Goblet of Fire raises the bar to unexpected heights.<br/><br/>For those who have read the book, it's 734 pages. That's 1 and 2 combined plus a little of Azkaban. I knew that this could not and would not follow word for word. Plot lines would need to be cut. The content that dragged the film along eliminated.<br/><br/>One can look at this 157 minute film and say that was long. I sat through all three Lord of the Rings films and Titanic and every other epic and think GOF is terms of running time is just a hop, skip and a jump.<br/><br/>Editing was crucial and for the most part they tweaked what needed to be tweaked and got to the most important points. Basicially this film revolves around Harry Potter and the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the three, technically four tasks (if you include the Yule Ball like the book does).<br/><br/>We really don't get to see the competition (Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour and Viktor Krum) do much, but the story isn't about them. It's about Harry and his trials and tribulations. So the tasks do seem short in that sense.<br/><br/>We also do not get to see many of the classes. Just a DADA class. It's like Hogwarts took a year off and committed to this tournament. We get very little of the regulars in Malfoy, Hagrid and Snape. Even the new characters, though well performed get too little screen time with the exception of Ex-Auror Alastor Moody.<br/><br/>Another complaint I have is that the clothes are too Americanized and too modern. This is supposed to be set in 1994-1995 and yet the students are wearing trends from 2005 without question.<br/><br/>But looking that aside, the film is incredible. The CGI, especially the Hungarian Horntail in the first task is unbelievable. You can actually believe that there is a dragon and not something rendered off an editing studio.<br/><br/>This film opens so many windows, many already known through OOTP and HBP, but also for the series as well. Dan, Rupert and Emma are better with age. I may have doubted the casting four years ago, but not now. They are completely focused and it really shows in the last and this film.<br/><br/>I'm just glad that the franchise got over the hump of the first two movies and after GOF, June 1, 2007 cannot come soon enough for Order of the Phoenix. 10/10"

","I know that the book was so long that some things had to be cut. However, it seems to me that whenever a cut is necessary it is always the softer, 'sensitive' and humorous side which gets it, leaving and even expanding the ""action"" i.e. violent side. All of Hermione's activities to save the house elves which are very funny sequences are omitted. But even worse, the manipulations which necessary to eliminate the roles of Winky and Dobby in the plot were not only complicated but made much of the Barty Crouch Jr stuff inexplicable. If I had not just reread the book, I'm not sure what I would have made of the whole thing. On the other hand we were subjected to that whole flying dragon thing which was not in the book and minute after minute of swimming thru mer-people and thrashing thru hedges. Those sequences could certainly have been shortened especially since the whole thing was so truncated that the tasks seemed squashed into each other. This is the third ""classic"" (Pride and Prejudice"" and ""OLiver Twist"") I've seen this year in which the director made perplexing choices in cutting. However as I always say, ""Any Harry Potter is better than no Harry Potter"""

","I'll be brief. I did not enjoy sitting through this movie. While fantasy films are fun for me, there are some things about this film that got to me:<br/><br/><ul><li>laden with sexual themes / love that did not relate to the main plot so much as they were to goad it for girls, they didn't even really build upon the relationships in the past HP movies - you perhaps expect to see Harry become something more of a wizard but instead he just stumbles through everything as usual, not really using his noodle - magic can be used to solve any problem, there are no constraints around it whatsoever, all it takes is asking someone or searching through a library and then you suddenly have the ability to defeat any situation. this might satisfy kids but someone looking for a plot will be disappointed - some of the settings were outlandish, even for fantasy. The Graveyard dripped Goth stereotype. - CG still has to come a long way before it becomes convincingly realistic, so it should be used sparingly, but it isn't in this movie - the climax wasn't so obvious as it was just dumb. The warlock was either evil or an impostor of the real guy, you knew it had to be either one. How many times did they have to show him drinking that potion? - The acting of everyone in the movie was 'forced'. By that I mean it was not natural, but this is a problem with all of the Harry Potter movies (except for the original Dumbledore). - They aren't trying very hard to make fantasy creatures look cool anymore. Those sea people were just...ugh. The dragons weren't so grand either. - The invasion of Voldimorte's (a cliché-sounding goth name) forces at the start made little to no sense, and happened pretty damn soon. What was the deal with that skull and snake in the sky? I'm not looking for a thematic explanation so much as a 'why they even bothered putting it in the story'.</li></ul><br/><br/>Well, that's as brief as I can get. If you like the Harry Potter series you'll want to see this just for the heck of it. If not, don't bother..."

The end was very scary but i knew Harry wasn't going to die because there are other books as well to be made into films!!! Can't wait until the next ones come out!!!

","Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie? I guess I'll start off with the good stuff.<br/><br/>The Good- I really liked the advancement in acting that the central three showed in this movie. Yes, there were some cringe-worthy moments of which I won't get into, but for the most part I really liked them here. The special effects were nothing short of great (in particular the first task). Everything about them was outstanding and didn't look dated or fake. The revealing of the ""bad"" guy was effin great!! Some people didn't like the look but you know what? He is EXACTLY as I've pictured him for the years that I've read these books.<br/><br/>The Bad- Severely chopped story. Well, I guess I shouldn't complain too much because I knew that with time constraints we wouldn't be able to see the movie exactly how we would have wanted to but some of the stuff could have been put in to help a non-reader understand the plot. I had to explain a few things to my wife about the story just so she could have a general idea of what was going on. Not having Gary Oldman (Sirius) in this one was a huge letdown. He, in my opinion, is an integral part of Harry's life and not seeing some sort of family figure in this movie gave me the sense of basically a teen angst movie with some action put in just for good measure. Dumbledore's portrayal, in particular, I did not care for because he is also supposed to be sort of a father figure to Harry and I didn't feel that here. The lack of screen time for Miranda Richardson (Rita Skeeter) also perturbed me because I greatly enjoyed (hated) her character. And one last ""minor"" thing: Fleur is supposed to be very beautiful, almost ethereal and I didn't get that from Clemence. She is very purty, no doubt about that, but I wasn't in awe like the characters in the book , particularly Ron, were.<br/><br/>The Harry- Bad things aside, I thought that this was a pretty solid movie by Newell. The fact that they used the same ""landscape"" as Alfonso in POA was, in my opinion, a good factor. Newell definitely captured the British-ness (not a word, I know) of the novels. On its own, I felt that this movie was a 10, but as a book-reader I know better and decided to give it an 8 out of 10. This movie, despite its flaws, was extremely enjoyable and I can't wait until Order comes out."
"brentabel","3","0","0","26 November 2005"," The Special effects will not hide the truth from a true fan about this movie.
","If you are a fan of the Harry Potter Books and especially the Goblet of Fire you will be disappointed by the the theatrical release of the Goblet of Fire. So many parts of the book were left out that needed to be there.<br/><br/>In the Beginning they skip from the end of the riddle house scene where Frank Bryce is Killed by Voldemort and Wormtail to when Harry and Ron Wake up just before leaving to go to the Quidditch World Cup. Also in the Riddle House Scene Barty Crouch Jr. was with Voldemort and Wormtail when in the book he was not there. In the Scene where the Weasley and Diggory families meet to walk to their Portkey Bill, Percy, Charlie, and Mrs. Weasley are nowhere to be found and they are not in the movie at all.<br/><br/>At the Quidditch World cup Winky the House elf of Mr. Crouch did not appear at all. They don't even show the quidditch match at all and they just introduce the teams and then a minute later the weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were in their tent. In the scene where the death eaters start setting the tents on fire that was OK. One of my friends and I both liked how the portrayal of the death eaters reminded us of the KKK (Klu Klux Clan) and that made it a bit comical showing their mockery. And when Harry sees Barty Crouch Jr. produce the dark mark that was well done with some good special effects.<br/><br/>From there on they skip a chapter or two and the kids are back on the Hogwarts express. In School many parts from the book were there. Collin and Dennis Creevy were both omitted from the movie. The Part where Mad Eye Moody Tortures the spider in class was done well.<br/><br/>Each of the tasks except for the third task were done how I pictured them from the book. In the third task there were no creatures like the book mentioned inside the maze. I believe they were missing the sphinx and Bogart and other things that I forgot. They did show some nice aerial views to show you how large the maze was and I liked when they showed Viktor Krum being controlled by the imperious curse.<br/><br/>For the second task Dobby never gave Harry the gillyweed like in the book. Instead the morning of the task Neville Longbottom gave it to him.<br/><br/>In the Graveyard when Voldemort was Resurrected there were many mistakes. When Voldemort was resurrected he was supposed to tell his story about the last thirteen years since he lost his powers. He was also supposed to mention about how he discovered about the quidditch world cup and cast a memory charm on Bertha Jorkins. Also he never mentioned the death eaters that weren't in the graveyard because they were in Azkaban, were going undercover for him, and abandoned him. Finally when Voldemort and Harry Duel the connection between their wands was only brief while I remember it being longer.<br/><br/>When Moody takes Harry back inside the Castle and Dumbledore and the others discover them things went wrong. They never interrogated him nearly as much as in the book. All they did is realize that he was Barty Crouch Jr. disguised as Mad Eye Moody Using a polyjuice potion he constantly drank in his flask. Then they sent him back to Azkaban. No story about his escape or nothing about Barty Crouch Jr. and Barty Crouch Senior's relationship with each other.<br/><br/>There was no argument after the third task with Cornelius Fudge about whether or not Voldemort had returned.<br/><br/>There was no scenes at all where Harry and the school go to Hogsmeage Village. Harry only talks to Sirius once through the fire in the Gryffindor common room and that is all for Sirius in the Movie.<br/><br/>They never showed Fleur De La Cleur say goodbye to Harry like in the book. They Showed the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang leave but they never showed the Hogwarts Express head back to London.<br/><br/>They never had as many stories in the Daily Prophet humiliating Harry and his friends as I thought. They never told about how Hagrid is only half giant and criticized Dumbledore. Hermione never exposed Rita Skeeter that she was an illegal Animagus to Harry and Ron like in the book.<br/><br/>Hermione never tried to help the house elves in Hogwarts like she did in the book.<br/><br/>This is just what I remember offhand after seeing the movie yesterday. If There was more omitted from the movie then be my guest and add it as a summary to the movie."
"spam-539","8","0","0","25 November 2005"," Great Harry Potter
","Great Harry Potter movie. For those (who are most of us) who have read the books, this movie cuts out about 40%, where part 3 cut out 20% and 1 and 2 cut out less than 2%. This is because the books have gotten bigger, and the directors have changed.<br/><br/>The negatives are the same as part 3. Dumbledore. The actor they got to play him is horrible. I understand no one can play the part like Richard Harris, but they could of at least tried to find someone that could at least try to play the role. After part 3 the internet was in an uproar at the awful behavior of Dumbledore and the way he was portryed. The ""new"" dumbledore said in an interview that he had never read the books, and that he didn't even watch part 1 on and 2. He simply read the screenplay and decided he would play the character how he felt it was. Of course his performance was horrible. If you go in to this movie hoping he will do a better job, or at least have taken some acting lessons, read a book, or tried to get into the role of Dumbledore, you will be disappointed. He's every bit as horrible, and whats worse, he has more screen time. <br/><br/>The word Veela was never used in the film :( and the women who were supposed to have Veela blood did not. Nor were they attractive. The entire plot was stripped from the movie as I suppose it would of cost them too much extra money to put Dooby or Winky in the movie. <br/><br/>What does this mean? It means most of the key points of the story through the 7th movie will have to be rewritten to pay for this oversight. <br/><br/>Some good things however. The twins have a lot more involvement, lines, and screen time, and most of their scenes were not cut from the movie :) Thats a huge redeeming value right there :) Also Luscious makes an appearance! Sirius Black actually talked to Harry in the fire, but since again I guess it would of cost too much to put his face above the fire, they rewrote how flu communication works, and had the logs talk to Harry instead.<br/><br/>The movie was excellent even with the lack of a dumbledore. Mad Eye Moody was a great cast for this film. Voldemort was a great cast and looked fantastic. Diggory and Cho were excellent. <br/><br/>I loved the film as it is Goblet of Fire. But I can't get over the biggest disapointments that not only hurt the quality of the movie, but also forshadow ruining movies in the future."

","I LOVE this Movie!!! I have now seen it three times and have fallen in love. Every Potter movie is more deep than the last.<br/><br/>To All those who think Michael Gambon was a hyper Albus Dumbledore, I respectfully disagree because he only raised his voice at Harry once and that was after the Goblet spat Harry's name out. but, however, he did go off on Harry a little bit then, and I don't remember Dumbledore being like that in the book. he seemed calm. had Richard Harris been much healthier and still alive, he would do that scene calmly. You know, dark times are looming and even the most magical and even-keeled headmaster is human 1st. and Wizard 2nd..meaning magic may not be able to stop them from being scared.<br/><br/>I respectfully disagree with all who said Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson overacted their parts!! What Daniel is portraying is a stressed Harry who is forced into a dangerous tournament; fighting dragons, encountering vicious deepwater creatures and mad maze of hedges; all the while going through something magic won't be able to eliminate and that is PUBERTY!!! That pkg. includes: crushes, P.O'd best friends etc.!!!<br/><br/>Now, Emma Watson, as Hermione Granger, is worried about Harry and the Triwizard Tournament. who would not be worried if one's closest friend is battling dragons, deepwater creatures and lunatic mazes?? Not to mention being ticked at Ron for getting overly jealous about Krum. And if she was not acting, Emma would make Hermione boring...so...tough vomit!!<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort (Voldy) is so superb. had the Voldy I imagined down to a science..with a scary image and voice. the interesting thing is there is a quality about Voldemort that strikes me as a man who would eat organic foods and practice Feng Shui and yoga and tai chi, etc. (if you strip all that evil) Madame Maxime, is just who I imagined. tall, big and soooo in loooove with Hagrid. Now I admire the hell out of Steve Kloves for doing the hard task of condensing a 700-page book into a 2 1/2 hour movie. I would have loved to see blast-ended skrewts and the other stuff in the maze. I have always enjoyed the Dursley's getting their comeuppances compliments of Harry Potter and those wild Weasley twins (Dudley eating Ton Tongue Toffees) But...a Potter fan can't get everything they want in a Potter movie without it running the risk of being too long and run-on. All the most important parts were beautifully portrayed. It is a Harry Potter purist's right to complain, but the next time they feel a complaint brewing, they should imagine themselves tryng to condense those fat books into 2 1/2 hour movies!"

A lot of things from the book were not included in the film versions of the others, but this one was so much more accurate to the book!! With the pensieve and what Harry sees in it, and particularly Neville's reaction to the Cruciatus curse!! It was just wikkid. And the guy playing Krum is hot too. And Ralph Fiennes is fabulous. And Pulp are in it!!!! It didn't drag at all, they've really used the 2 and a half hrs, i couldn't believe id been in the cinema for over 2 n a half hours when it ended!

","The tradition is not broken - the 4th Harry Potter movies is the best one yet, full with terrific action, dazzling plot twists, stunning visionaries and typical ironic British sense of humour. Dan Radcliffe is great. I have always liked how he portrays Harry Potter, but in the 4th movie he is simply amazing. If he is so young and can shows so well the emotions of his character, he has a bright future ahead of him. I wish him well. He deserves it. But the other actors were very good, too. As a Bulgarian I can't help, but feel proud with our boy Victor Krum. He looked like a tiger in this movie, dark and dangerous. And the dragon, oh, the dragon! Finally someone to show how a dragon should be made! His chilling fight with Harry was extraordinary. My only complaint is about Voldemort. He looked too disgusting in my opinion. On the other hand this is what Voldemort is - a wizard, who thinks himself great, but actually is a pathetic cruel creature, which takes pleasure only in suffering. Overall, the 4th Harry Potter is the best one yet and tied with ""The Revenge of the Sith"" as a movie of 2005. Kudos for Dan Radcliffe, Mike Newell and the others, who created the magic!"

","This was the best Harry Potter movie I have seen so far. But was sad that they had to cut a lot out of the book because it was too long. The one part they didn't show was that Snape accidentally killed Barty Crouch Jr, but they didn't put that in there. Also, in the book Dobby got Harry Potter gillyweed, not Neville. I wish they had Dobby do it. The special effects were really good though. And when Voldemort rose again, that was scary. I can't wait to see them all and read the very last book. My favorite part in the movie was when Harry was doing the first task with the dragon. I kind of with that all 4 movies had the same director though, cause they there would be similarities. In the 3rd movie, Harry's firebolt was black. In the 4th, it was brown. Professor Flitwick in all 3 had crazy gray hair and beard. In this one is hair was black and tidy, no beard. The pictures on the walls looked just like normal picture. I know I said this was the best movie so far, but why am I dissing it? It was still the best movie done, but it could have been a little better. Thats why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10."
"SelvarajanK","8","0","0","28 November 2005"," Harry Potter and Fill in the Blanks
","After the disappointing prisoner of Azkaban (Harry's earlier version) The Goblet of fire is a welcome sign taking the fact the installment from JKR (the author) is still spending. All credit to the director for making it a perfect entertainer. The cinema hall was filled with children from all age group, one that remembered me of my school days. The 2 best in the series so far after the Sorcerer's Stone.<br/><br/>From the opening frame the director had made it very clear to keep it very simple and look exotic, well he has achieved it. Even though there was a lot of opportunity for making it as suspense, thriller with the (Brendan Gleeson) Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Mood character, the director has taken a safe route of comedy with all the character. Probably this version of Harry is the darkest and the funniest so far.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned (except for those who have read the book) is a mere fill in the blank till we get the final episode. This will fall in the series of The Matrix Reloaded (part 2) were every thing in the movie looks good to enjoy but ultimately they turn out to be just for making it a 2hr film (sorry for being so rude).<br/><br/>Three things in the movie that needs to appreciated are the cinematography and special effects as usual and the third thing is of course the dialog for keeping it simple and funny. For those who don't read the books (that's a big crime  and I am the first accused) the film will definitely be a perfect entertainer."

Heaps of scenes made no sense at all, lots of things were never explained, and I got the feeling the film was only for those who have read the book already. And the plot of the movie was downright stupid. Why would the school have a competition where it was really likely that some of the students would die, just for the entertainment of it? And nobody thought it was a bit strange to almost sacrifice the lives of the competitors friends, also just for some entertainment?

It was a good movie just to say, but just reading out the book this summer it has caught my attention that every seen was not depicted clearly. In the book they talked about how Barty Crouch was going insane and HArry left Victor Krum with him to go meet Dumbledore to help...however this was not shown and somehow no one (who maybe never read the book) would know what happened to Mr. Crouch. Also I remember reading about how BArty Crouch Jr. escaped from Askaban with his mother drinking polyjuice and exchanging places with him and she going to Askaban for him. I don't remember seeing that and somewhat the movie scenes were unclear. As I said again...no one shows how Mr. Crouch Junior got out of Azcaban or where or what happens to Barty Crouch.<br/><br/>I know that Goblet of Fire was one of the most demanding series, especially as it has been making for about 2 years since the last movie.

","There is something wrong with the HP serial. The forth movie along arouses nothing but boredom. I didn't expect breathtaking script twists, since the story was known clear beforehand. But the acting, the camera-work, the movie arrangement, the atmosphere-all that makes a movie worth watching-EVERYTHING is missing as well! The narration is scattered into a number of badly tied together episodes ; almost all episodes by themselves live nothing in memory, except for the marvelous scene in the bathroom (where poor Harry is impudently harassed by a horny ghost-girl.)<br/><br/>Remember picturesque sceneries in the LOTR? Well, they all stayed there. Camera was definitely something HP-makers saved on. <br/><br/>Acting was always HP's week point(yep, even weaker, then the others.) I say it and i mean it: the Trio didn't know how to act then, neither it do now. Thankfully, this series's freshmen, unlike horrible prof. Lupin from the HP3(I swear, he had a constant hangover), made a good impression. Alastor Moody and that dastardly reportress inspired a spark of life into the sleepy realm. Alas, the moment they are gone, it's goggled eyes and dummy moves time again. <br/><br/>What's left? ""The dark and frightening atmosphere?"" Phu-ule-ease.

","Let me start out by saying that I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series of books, and also that I have very much enjoyed the three previous installments of this series. That said, this movie was quite a disappointment.<br/><br/>The visual aspect of the movie is quite wonderful. The effects are leaps and bounds better than those in the previous ones (the flying scenes look nearly authentic, especially when compared with the quidditch match in the first film).<br/><br/>The acting was not as good as I had come to expect from the regulars in the Harry Potter series, and the casting for installment specific roles was sorely lacking.<br/><br/>The major complaint I have about this film is the disjointed nature of its story and character development. Admittedly fitting a 734 page book (hardcover) into a 157 minute movie is a near impossible task, but the storyline was helter-skelter, with giant character and story leaps becoming apparent only after they happened and then with no explanation.<br/><br/>Overall the film was a disappointment, especially when compared with the three films preceding it. Die-hard fans will see it; and casual ones should also, but only once. It's just good enough to carry the viewer on to the next installment, nothing more."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the longest book in the Harry Potter series: 734 pages. When the movie adaptation was first discussed, the plan was to make two movies out of the book, to give room for all the sub-plots and emotional development of the characters. The filmmakers should have stuck with plan A. Although the movie is visually spectacular and action-packed, the film suffers from the editing required to squeeze the massive book into a single movie.<br/><br/>The special effects and CGI of the film are seamlessly integrated with the live action, making for stunning visual magic (and for a production budget of $150 million, you should expect nothing less). I couldn't help but hold my breath during the sequence where Harry battled a Hungarian horn-tailed dragon. I jumped a bit when the mer-people attacked Harry while he was underwater, rescuing his friends. And the scene of the evil Lord Voldemort's reincarnation made my skin crawl.<br/><br/>But good visuals are only part of the movie. In the previous three installments of the HP saga, the emotional bond and development of the intrepid trio of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger made for sympathetic characters. The compaction of the Goblet of Fire book squeezed most of the life out of the characters, despite the film's focus on issues of teenage romantic angst. Harry, in particular, came off as bland. Although this may be partly due to condensing the book, I wonder if Dan Radcliffe, who plays Harry, simply doesn't have the skills to both make Harry a wizardly action hero and a flesh-and-blood person with so much action demanded of him. Ron Weasley comes off the best, seeming the most like a real, male teenager: filled with conflicting emotions about his friends, fear and ignorance about girls, and grunting as a substitute for talking. Plus, Rupert Grint, who portrays Ron, shows a deft comic touch.<br/><br/>Brendon Gleeson, who plays Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, the Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, is also a hoot. Gleeson walks the tightrope between wanting to protect his students and coming completely unhinged from the accumulated trauma of fighting dark magic all his life. He can go from entertaining his students to scaring the living daylights out of them and back before they can catch their breaths. In his best scene, he is fiercely protective of Harry, inappropriate, and scandalously funny, all at the same time.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Dumbledore, however, is completely inconsistent with the prior films. He's devolved from Richard Harris' calm, wise, benevolent, and subtle 2000-yr-old headmaster to Michael Gambon's moody, uncertain, and twitchy bundle of nerves -- like a robed Al Pacino on a bad day. In the first three Potter films, I could easily believe that Voldemort would fear Dumbledore's skill and cunning. Now, I'm equally certain that Voldemort could dispense with Dumbledore by paralyzing him with his own indecision.<br/><br/>As a piece of teenage entertainment, the movie is several cuts about the pack of typical action flicks aimed as this age group. In addition to the great production values, I think teens will relate to the awkwardness in dating protocols and rituals. The loyalty that the three friends display despite their growing pains and Harry's moral fortitude under duress provide good role modeling. But as an adult, I wanted more meat on the bones of this part of the saga."

","My husband and I saw this movie over the weekend with our 3 kids, ages 2,3, and 6. We thought the younger two would sleep through it since we went to an 11pm show. Not true, they all loved it and watched the movie to the very end. I felt that it did the book justice. Everything I hoped they would put in was in. The only thing my oldest noticed was that the Harry Potter theme wasn't really in this movie. Hopefully, it will be in the next movies, for, even though the theme doesn't really affect the movie, I would agree with my daughter that it would be like watching Star Wars, or Superman, or ET without their themes; something is just missing. All in all, wonderful movie, worth seeing."

","Dumbledore's death in book six may be open to debate, but there is no doubt that he was brutally murdered in movie 4. I'm not quite sure whom Mr.Gambon was portraying but it was not the serene and profoundly wise character Albus Dumbledore (and I would be lying if I didn't say I found that more than a little distracting). Couple this with the abbreviated portrayal of the World Cup and you have my two biggest complaints about this movie. Did I miss the Dursleys, Weasleys and Sirius? To be sure. Would I have preferred more details? Absolutely. But I felt this movie managed to hold its ground despite the changes made. And in all honesty (despite all the fuss) there were certain things that really should have been left out; Winky and S.P.E.W. being at the top of the list. It is hard to imagine, even with two separate movies and a total of four hours, how you could explain a race of people who enjoy servitude, don't want freedom, and become angry or fearful with anyone who tries to help them achieve it (even one of their own). I barely grasp this concept within the confines of the 734 page storyline. Suffice it to say that including Winky (a modern day throwback to Prissy from Gone with the Wind) could only be described as celluloid suicide in this day and age(think Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars fame). In this case Mr Newell made the right decision and should be congratulated for doing so. Some things REALLY are best left to the printed page.<br/><br/>As far as performances were concerned no one seemed to command as much attention as Daniel Radcliffe, who (despite rude comments to the contrary) seemed to embrace Harry Potter wholeheartedly in this installment. His acting (even before the graveyard scene) showed incredible growth and fearlessness paralleling that of his alter ego, and I have to admit that I was happily surprised. All in all I found this movie very enjoyable despite its shortcomings, omissions and alterations and I can only conclude that Harry Potter fans everywhere would do well to take a cue from Harry and just grow up."

","The subtle and not-so-subtle changes over what actually occurred in the book work VERY well. The screenplay writers did an excellent job of condensing the gist of a lengthy book, and eliminated information that wasn't critical to the primary plot. The additional footage of Harry's dragon challenge left me wondering, ""Did I miss that in the book""? (Of course not, since I've read it 4 times.) There's just one thing- was it trick photography, or was the actress playing Madame Maxime REALLY that BIG????? The movie soft-pedaled the resulting friction between Albus and the Minister of Magic, making it difficult to fathom the animosity that prevails in Order of the Phoenix. The absence of Sirius Black in the final scenes is a disappointment; however, some things HAD to be cut to avoid too much fiscal heartburn at Warner Brothers."

","I think this was the best Harry Potter movie they've put out yet. There is only one thing that I didn't like about this movie. That was the scene where Harry's name is shot from the Goblet of Fire. In that scene, Albus Dumbledore catches the piece of paper and says Harry's name, but then he yells it as if he is angry with Harry. And, though he might be, I feel this scene contradicts the personality that J.K. Rowling has created for Dumbledore. Not once in any of the books released so far has Dumbledore ever raised his voice to anyone. Even in the fifth book when Harry is rampaging his office after Sirius's death, Dumbldore does not yell. I found it a bit disturbing when the character I had come to know through reading the books took such a drastic change in the movie. Dumbledore has always been described has having patience, and even Harry gets upset with how calm he can be."
"colonel_green","10","0","0","27 November 2005"," Another terrific entry in a great film series.
","I'm a die-hard fan of J.K. Rowling's magical ""Harry Potter"" series, and I have enjoyed each of the four Hollywood films that have been based on her novels, to varying degrees. Chris Columbus' two films were good, but it was Alfonso Cuaron who elevated the series to artistry, and Mike Newell follows Cuaron's lead.<br/><br/>Cuaron's poetic style and intimate camera is gone, replaced with ""Star Wars: Episode III"" epic sweep. Everything in this film is big, loud, and energetic, reflecting the many changes sweeping through Harry's world, and the cataclysmic struggle that all informed viewers know lies ahead. The Triwizard Tournament is the centrepiece of the film, consisting largely of the three tasks, with the Yule Ball wedged in between; all leading up to the Little Hangleton graveyard, perhaps the single greatest scene in all Rowling's canon.<br/><br/>As the series evolves, it's young stars continue to thrive. Understated and effective Daniel Radcliffe, bumbling everyman Rupert Grint, and energetic, mannered Emma Watson have all become their characters, and it would be a tragedy were any of them to miscarry before this series ends. They're backed up, per usual, by the whole British Screen Actors Guild, doing the damnedest to steal their individual scenes. Michael Gambon is a powerful Dumbledore, Dame Maggie Smith an intelligent McGonagall, and Alan Rickman a suave Snape; newcomers like Brendan Gleeson do great work, although the presence of David Thewlis' Lupin is missed.<br/><br/>To all involved, our thanks."
"jewish_cookie","7","0","0","27 November 2005"," The Darkest Harry Potter Film
","The minute I began watching ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" I was immediately drawn to it. When I saw the snake beginning to slither towards the mansion, I knew right away that the movie was going to be dark, yet entertaining. The change in direction was different and refreshing. The movie was excellent, yet it was not completely flawless.<br/><br/>ACTING Negative: First of all, I don't think that Micheal Gambon makes a very good Dumbledore. When I saw him grab Harry's shoulders and violently shake him after Harry's name came out of the Goblet, I immediately knew that Gambon was going the wrong way in trying to become a good Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore is supposed to be calm and collected. His personality should have wizards and witches look up to him for reassurance and guidance. Yet, Gambon took a different approach to the role. He looked as if he was lost most of the time. However, I do not doubt his acting abilities; I believe he is an excellent actor, but his acting in this movie is just not right. Second of all, I believe that they could have found a better Fluer, she seemed too week and frail in this movie. Even though Clemence Poesy (Fluer) is very attractive looking, she didn't exude that complete beauty and grace that Fluer does in the book. She didn't look like a veela.<br/><br/>Positive: The Trio has matured quite well in the acting department. Daniel Radcliffe played Harry Potter perfectly, yet was still slightly dry in the deeply emotional scenes. Emma Watson was excellent and lovely , if a little melodramatic. Rupert Grint was hilarious as Ron Weasley, just hearing him say 'bloody hell' makes me laugh. The Phelp twins were also quite hilarious (and cute) in their roles of the Weasley twins. I was tremendously glad that they were included in more scenes.<br/><br/>I also have to give a thumbs-up to Fiennes in his role of Voldemort. He was truly frightening and eerily handsome at the same time.<br/><br/>Direction Negative: No matter how wonderful the movie is, their are many gaping holes in it. The movie just left out WAY too many things from the book. It is understandable that they didn't want to cram the entire book into the movie (Since the book is HUGE), but many of the things that were left out were actually quite valuable.<br/><br/>Positive: I love the new director. Here is a director that finally understood that silence is as frightening as noise. Firstly, when Harry went into the maze, all you could see on screen were large hedges, mist, and completely silence that were filled with tension and excitement. This movie just gave me the shivers. Plus, the music score gave the movie more of an edge. I'm glad that the music wasn't entirely explosive in the action sequences as the first three movies.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie definitely meets our expectations. I'll give it a 7 out of 10. The movie is most definitely recommended."

","We all know that movies are not as good as the book, but this movie decided on first 30 minutes on the stuff in the book and the rest of the time it was hurtling you through the Tri-wizard tourney. I know the book is long, and it would be impractical to do all the stuff in the book, but come on, at least use some of the stuff. Also people who did not read the book might have had trouble with character recognition. One last thought, bath scene with harry and moaning Myrtle was kinda weird. This movie is more orientated towards the older kids and teenagers. The graveyard scene did, in fact freak my little cousin out. Also, the comedy scene at the ball with the Prof. Flitwick getting passed along above the crowd was out of taste with the flow of the movie."

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is NOT a children's movie,it very much earns it's PG-13 rating. Parts of it are in fact darker than Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.Michael Gambon has completely filled in Richard Harris' shoes as Dumbledore.For the first time we see the Dark Lord Voldemort as an actual threat to Harry.He is played by the brilliant Ralph Fiennes,and he looks hideous.Fiennes has created another brilliant villain,he was definitely a wise casting choice.Our young stars are maturing and their performances are the best of the series.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is thrilling and it doesn't feel dumbed down into a kid friendly film like the others do.

Although it was very long, none of the time in the movie was wasted or pointless; everything was important. The director and actors did a very good job of explaining things about what was going on for people who have not read the book. My only problem with it was that it had unnecessary aspects for which it was rated PG-13, such as random cursing, which didn't seem very Harry Potterish. Other than that, I would recommend it to anybody. If you like action, but aren't sure if Harry Potter is your ""scene"", this would be a great movie to get you hooked and to make you anxious for the movie for The Order of the Phenox to come out!

","This was a horrible movie. Okay, I will understand if you have never read the books before you might find these to be wonderful, but as a big reader of the Harry Potter books, so many things were missing or wrong. First off, Dumbledore was the worst acting job i've ever seen. I understand the one who played him before died and you cant really control that, however, this Dumbledore couldn't have been farther from what he should be. He seemed frantic and not at all calm or wise like he should be. When Harry's name came out of the Goblet he seemed scary and not at all someone Harry could depend upon. Also, the maze was horrible, there was never any moving trees, instead things that they had to battle, like a sphinx or a Bogart. Barty Crouch was never in Harry's dream in the beginning nor did Hermione wake him up from it, she never knew about his dream. Then, when Sirius visited Harry by floo powder, i think it was a horrible representation of how that worked, it was supposed to be his whole head coming through, not just his face in a long. Obviously they can't include everything, but it was definitely the worst of the four. If you have never read the books, you must have been completely lost. The movie was like 20 second clips of like little things in the book, very little explanation to anything."
"ajbru","7","0","0","27 November 2005"," Slightly disappointing, but still good
","I will not write a long winded review here, since everyone should know the book's plot by now. But of all the Harry Potter movies to come out so far, this is definitely not the best. The only problem with it is the sheer volume of information that is cut from the book. But yes, I do understand that a 750+/- would make a very long movie, I still thank that even another half hour of screen time would have made it better. You cannot imagine my sheer disappointment with the Quidditch World Cup. A lot of subplot/trivial info was cut as well, like Fleur Delacour being part Veela, the Dursleys, or Rita Skeeter pestering Harry, Ron and Hermione terribly, and Skeeter being an unlicensed Animagus. There was even extremely important stuff cut out, too. Like Professor Trelawney not prophesying that Voldemort would come again.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I will still say that these kids are extremely impressive. The very embodiment of the series' heroes. But you already know that. The other actors in the movie are also great, with a great performance from Ralph Fiennes playing the newly resurrected Lord Voldemort. It's also unfortunate that Robert Pattinson won't be appearing any more, because his acting as Cedric Diggory was also quite strong. And I will also say that I am exceedingly happy that Cho Chang has finally entered into the Potter movie world, since she was nowhere to be seen in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"". A lot of the movie's humor would have been lost without her.<br/><br/>The movie has an accurate portrayal the main plot of J.K. Rowling's 4th novel. But unfortunately, the movie suffers because it doesn't really stray beyond that. But it is still a good movie, and definitely worth the ticket. (Which isn't always the case these days...) Hopefully, though, the mass-cutting of subplot does not occur in the 5th movie, being that the novel is as important as it is to the wizarding world. But again. Read it. Then see it.<br/><br/>P.S. Hermione's hot! ^_^"
"barthes39","3","0","0","27 November 2005"," Disappointed
","I was unfortunately disappointed by this film installment. I really enjoyed The Prisoner of Azkaban, and felt it really worked for people who did and did not read the book. It felt whole and coherent, though obviously a lot of stuff had to get dropped in order for that to work.<br/><br/>In the case of Goblet of Fire I hadn't read this one, so for much of the film was pretty lost as to what was going on. It felt very disjointed - scenes started and ended abruptly, and weren't allowed to play out their natural rhythms. It felt more like a very long preview than a complete movie, constantly rushing on to the next thing. Many older characters barely got a word in while new ones were brought in without any kind of introduction or context, they just showed up and started saying lines.<br/><br/>The whole Quidditch World Cup was a real let down - you saw the lead up, and then the celebrations afterward. What happened to the most interesting part?<br/><br/>The special effects were generally very well done, though visually I didn't find it as imaginative as Prisoner, though it inherits much of its dark style."

","The Goblet of Fire was one of my favorite books in the series, but the movie does not capture the magic of the book. My feeling was that the film was rushed, and very brief. They failed to elaborate on the characters and the plot The first 150 pages in the book are compacted into 10 minutes of film, and the yule ball(which is not an essential to the plot)was drawn out and boring. Snape, McGonagall, Hagrid,Malfoy and Dumbledore all have small roles, and they give the best performances out of the whole cast. Moody was well portrayed, and so was Voldemort(although he looked like something from Men in Black). Some characters were completely cut out of the story, such as Dobby the house elf, and Ludo Bagman. Finally, I think that Harry, Ron, Fred, and George should all get haircuts because they look doofy with that hair. This movie was good, worth the 10 bucks, but did not live up to the book."

And if you don't go to the cinema to see special effects, then it's the story and characters feelings that interest you.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see how the other two books will be translated into film, although I really await the release of the seventh book more than anything.

The Goblet of Fire left out the not terribly important bits, left in the incredibly important bits, and only slightly tampered with story lines and scenes. You feel for Harry and the others in a way you haven't been given the opportunity to do in the past. The cinematography is incredible. The acting has improved considerably.

","I have not had the chance to read the Harry Potter novels, so I am certainly not one to comment on how good of a translation the films are. However, I have enjoyed each of the Potter films and feel they have gotten progressively better.<br/><br/>This latest film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, is better than the last in many ways and yet not as good in others. The story and the acting were an improvement to the previous one, and it is apparent that the young leads have all grown in their abilities since the earlier films. They have obviously become comfortable with what they are doing and are now reaching out in their performances to enrich the screen presence of their characters.<br/><br/>The story was the best of the films so far. Previously, the stories had at times fallen victim to the follow-the-plot-crumbs handicap of so many films. This film was much more self-contained and each element connected with the next much clearer. The story was much darker as well, and the film easily earned its harder rating. It is obvious that J K Rowling has crafted each book to grow with the reader, and it has translated effectively to the screen.<br/><br/>The biggest shortcomings in the Goblet of Fire fall on the direction of Mike Newell and the rather unimpressive special effects. Mike Newell certainly is a talented director in being able to draw performances out of the cast, but sometimes his camera work leaves a little to be desired. At times, the vast majority of what was happening in a scene was obscured because of a series of tight shots, and the effectiveness was sometimes lost because of it. As well, some of the special effects looked fairly unimpressive. The CGI shots were clearly CGI shots and thus it was a little hard to be impressed with things that were obviously meant to impress.<br/><br/>Overall, the Goblet of Fire is easily recommendable and certainly stands with the rest of the Harry Potter series as an enjoyable and rousing work."

","Finally, the fourth Harry Potter movie has arrived. I have been wondering for months what is would be like, and...wow. I'm impressed!! The actors have improved dramatically, although I have always thought they were good. It is possible to see the differences between each of their characters. The ideas transmitted in this movie continue to be loyal to the book: Friendship, courage, loyalty, love. Although this movie is much more dramatic and thriller-like than the other three, it does not diverge from the main point: A wizard teenager growing up(with a few added problems, like the fact that Voldemort wants to kill him). I must congratulate Mike Newell on his direction of this movie. It's not too fast or too slow, it is exact. Mike Newell, J.K Rowling, the crew, and everyone who helped with this movie, have been able to demonstrate how Harry, Ron and Hermione are real teenagers, with feelings, thoughts, and, of course, jealousies(as is apparent with Ron). The tasks are amazingly shown. The viewer can almost feel the nervousness that Harry goes through throughout his fourth year at Hogwarts. The three main actors must be congratulated separately. Rupert Grint(Ron) is able to continue being comical and, at the same time, to act more serious, concerned, sorry or angry, as is necessary. Daniel Raddcliffe(Harry Potter) is able to act his part amazingly well. He is able to show his ""love"" towards Cho Chang in an obvious, but not overreacted way and, at the same time, he is able to act scared, nervous, happy, angry and/or sad during the entire movie. Emma Watson(Hermione) is, in my opinion, one of the best actresses in the film. She is able to transmit Hermione's thoughts, feelings, ideas, and, specially, her actions incredibly. It is easy to understand what she is saying and it looks as if she really does feel what she is saying. There is something about the look in her eyes during the different scenes and her body language that enhances clarity ti her character. She doesn't just recite the lines she has memorized. She FEELS them!! This is what I call a real actress. All of the actors in this movie are able to do this, but Emma Watson is exceptional. Congratulations J.K. Rowling. Mike Newell, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Daniel Raddcliffe and everyone else who contributed in any way to making this movie so incredible. Oh!!I almost forgot; little children might not want to watch this movie, as it is a bit scary and we don't want them having nightmares, so we?"

","Overall I enjoyed this installment of the Harry Potter series and I agree that it is the best so far. There were some aspects of this film that I took issue with however, although I will openly admit that I am an avid fan of the book and therefore I realize that I might be more critical than the average viewer.<br/><br/>First, the positive: The visual direction is superb. The screenwriter did an excellent job of condensing such an extremely long book while keeping true to the integrity of the story. While I felt the previous movie lacked faith in the viewer and gave way too much away (thereby spoiling the ending) this movie in contrast made necessary story adjustments but skillfully kept the suspense the book had. Ralph Finnes was extraordinary as Voldemort, and Rupurt Grint is, by far, my favorite of all the regular characters in the movies. He has made the transition from innocent child to angry teenager so smoothly and his portrayal of the character was spot on. The same goes for James and Oliver Phelps, and Daniel Radcliff. All of the new actors in this movie were phenomenal.<br/><br/>The negative: Emma Watson's Hermione seemed to be on the brink of an emotional breakdown in every single scene she appeared in. She cycles from hysterical to belligerent then back to hysterical continually throughout the movie. Aside from the fact that this is opposite of the book's portrayal of the usually level-headed Hermione, it is annoying to the point that I found myself hating her character. Another issue I had was with the portrayal of Dumbledore. In this movie he strikes me as an angry, weak, and desperate old man. From slamming Harry into the trophies, to pitifully lamenting that he sensed something was wrong but couldn't figure out what was going on, Dumbledore's character lacked the transcendent wisdom that made him such a powerful character in the book. I hope these two elements are fixed in the next book."

Having won four free tickets, my respect for the movies has gone way above my line, and am deeply happy with the result.<br/><br/>It's just like reading the 476 or something pages of 'Goblet of Fire' -except putting an incantation on it to make it move with pictures and colors. David Newell really did read the book, and my god, did he direct the movie it with enthusiasm, delight and a wide variety of knowledge of the novel by world renowned J.K. Rowling.<br/><br/>With its scenes of darkness and a lot of teenager (or how J.K. states it herself, ""boy-girl"" stuff) issues, nothing could take my eyes away from the Bauxbatons Academy entrance into the great hall of Hogwarts...whoever came up with that idea of butterflies being released from their pose is a true genius.<br/><br/>The movie, in my opinion, was really based on the teenagers and issue that they face in the Muggle & Magical world. Here we have Harry, trying to find a date for the Yule Ball, and then there's Hermione and Ron (who are played by Emma Watson and Rupert Grint respectively) fighting about the enemy (AKA: Viktor Krum, Bulgaria's Quidditch Seeker and Student of Durmstrang Institute), while there was a close up footage of Bauxbaton's walking entrance,'shagging' their asses.<br/><br/>Not to mention, I did see some sexual references in the movie: 1. The ghost of Moaning Murtle having a horny (or probably a transparent orgasm) experience with naked Harry in the Prefects Bathrooms..hmmm...<br/><br/>2. Giant Hagrid and Giantess Madame Maxime, Headmistress of Bauxbatons Academy, having a nice dance at the Yule Ball. It did go rather well when Hagrid 'accidentally' slipped his hand to feel his dancing partner's bottom.<br/><br/>However, there were a few bits of the movie that the production team did delete and I wanted to see; like the Quidditch World Cup, and actually seeing Ireland vs. Bulgaria play the sport; or when Mr Weasley had his excellent exit out of the Dursley's living room. By the way - where were the Dursley's? There were more I expected as well, such as house-elves Winky and Dobby, and Hermione's support to save the slaves of elves.<br/><br/>But the main things that did stand out were the sound effects, locations of the scenes and best of all, the humor. It had a really hilarious side to it...the Weasley characters did his usual ""Bloody Hell"" quotes and segments, like Fred, or was it George(?) that asked Angelina out to the Ball in his interesting sense of manners and gestures, and when Ron trying to dance with Professor McGonagall made great reactions to what the teacher proposed to do to him. Professor Snape was a highlight, too. He made the study scene like a comedy drama act when he was annoyed at his students talking.<br/><br/>As always, I usually forget the point of Harry Potter, but its pretty obvious: The good vs. the evil. Voldemort really didn't look scary, but that nose he had must've taken hours...the Dark Mark looked cool and the Death Eaters were fair...but the most saddest part of the movie was the death of Cedric, and his father crying the loudest in the Tri-wizard Stadium.<br/><br/>Overall, what a great way to spend 2 and a half hours of your time watching witchcraft and wizardry at its best. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best movie out of the series so far, so I truly encourage anyone thinking about seeing it to go for it and spend your good money, for what awaits you, rewards you with excellence in the field of movie making. I congratulate the whole cast and crew for their dedication to make my anticipation pay off...you're a fantastic group whose actually making magic! 9/10"

Sure there were holes I think for those who are not fans of reading the books... but I loved it! Very scary at parts.. wonderful changes in the characters.. like Dumbledore for the first time losing control.. well played.. very well played.. what a performance. The only thing that I can say that would be remotely negative is that Bartimus Crouch Sr. comes off like a child molester.. I read the books of course to I knew the implication was not that in anyway.. but for someone unfamiliar, they might wonder at his motives and why Moody says..

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an exciting and well made movie. Because of the size of the book, the decision was made to focus on Harry and his challenges, including the one with budding romance, which meant a great deal of trimming from the storyline of the book. Director Mike Newell's vision of this chapter of the continuing Harry Potter saga is flawless as he applies just the right touches to give the viewer the sense of danger and darkness along with a masterful sprinkling of humor amid both serious and embarrassing moments. Over all the movie is excellent and the special effects masterful. 2 thumbs up!"

","First, a warning. If you're one of those people, the ones that call themselves ""purists"", and you scream bloody murder if a single detail is changed or omitted when a book is made into a film, you probably won't like this film. However, if you're a bit more realistic, and realize that something on a page doesn't always make a good transition to a screen, and if you are a fan of movies, you will love this film.<br/><br/>This is, hands down, the best Potter film to date. Up until now, most have considered PoA the best film; this one leaves it in the dust. It's all there. Action, drama, and art.<br/><br/>The film is artfully done, the sets and cinematography are beautiful, carefully set up, but not as self-aware as PoA, which is a good thing. At times PoA could be a bit contrived.<br/><br/>The 147 minute running time goes by like a breeze. I felt that I had been in the theater for an hour instead of nearly 2 1/2. The film moves quickly, especially in the beginning. But this is only to it's credit. The action is non-stop. You simply can't catch your breath. The Triwizard tasks were magnificent. If J.K. Rowling has one fault, it's that she doesn't write action particularly well. No hint of that here.<br/><br/>And the acting? Incredible. Only one slightly false note jangles in the performance of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. His Dumbledore is a bit rough, a little off the character we know from the books. But one cannot help but feel that the fault lays not with Gambon, but with the decision of the writers and director to show us the weaker, more frightened side of Dumbledore that we don't glimpse until Half-Blood Prince.<br/><br/>There was one person, however, who made this film with their performance, and it may come as a shock to you.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe. He absolutely blew my socks off. His acting has improved so much I couldn't believe it. Before this film, I probably would have said that Rupert Grint or even Emma Watson was the most natural performer of the three. But after this, I can say that if people give him a chance, especially the chance to expand and perform in other roles besides Potter, Radcliffe will be really something to watch in the coming years. He should really be proud. This was a difficult performance to give, and the risk for an unexperienced actor to make it a cheesy cringe fest was great, but he rose to the occasion splendidly. Well done.<br/><br/>So there you have it. Don't listen to me, though. Go and see it yourself. In the words of Hagrid (from the film), ""You'll be glad you came""."

","The first three Harry Potter movies were magical. This movie, however, isn't of the same caliber as those movies. That ""magical"" element that was present in the first three movies was lacking in this one. The Goblet of Fire just didn't dazzle me the way that the previous three Harry Potter movies did.<br/><br/>I initially was expecting this to be a movie that would top the Prisoner of Azkaban (which, in my opinion, is the best movie of the Harry Potter series) in terms of quality. After all, this movie looked spectacular in the previews. Unfortunately, this movie turned out to be a huge disappointment. The best way to describe this movie is that it was a convoluted mess. It felt like if I was watching several different stories lumped together into one movie. Furthermore, it was a boring movie.<br/><br/>The young characters are older now, and the series (as expected) has gotten progressively darker. And, we finally get to see what Lord Voldermort looks like. Still, I wish that this movie had been directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who did a fantastic job directing the Prisoner of Azkaban. Considering that that movie already contained dark elements (Dementors, a werewolf, etc), it would've been nice to see Cuarón wield his creative wand and make this movie even spookier (and more stunning) than the last.<br/><br/>I satisfied my curiosity by going to see this movie. But, had I known that this movie would turn out to be a letdown, I would've waited until it was out for rental. This is clearly the worst movie of the series."

A lot of people feel that Emma's performance was a little, over dramatic. It was but it wasn't like over the top. <br/><br/>The storyline of the movie in comparison to the book was, simplified. I think that if a person hasn't read the book the movie will seem kind of confusing, especially the ending. The explanation of Barty Crouch Jr. or the different magical creatures in the third task were non-existent. <br/><br/>It felt slightly rushed. Lots of things that I wanted to see weren't included. Humour was plentiful and not as stiff as it was in the other movies.<br/><br/>Other scenes from the book that weren't included were the Blast Ended Screwts. A lot of the Rita Skeeter scenes were skipped as well. As for Harry's classes, only one class was showed and that was Professor Mad-Eye Moody's Defence Against The Dark Arts class.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good movie. Slightly choppy, but I suppose thats to be expected seeing as the book is massive. <br/><br/>PS: If you haven't seen it, go to a late night show if possible.

","I have watched the Goblet of Fire last night and I found it good, but rushed, though. Some, in my opinion, important moments from the book were barely mentioned or not mentioned at all (Quidditch World Cup, e.g.), and events are happening too fast, so those people who didn't read the book can barely keep up with the story. Also, the scene when Cedric dies is rushed too (Wormtail says ""Avada Kedavra"", green light flies and Cedric falls dead) - the whole scene lasts for a couple of seconds, and that is, together with the scene of Voldemort's rebirth (which is also too short), key scene of the fourth part of the saga. I think that the movie would certainly be a lot better if it lasted a half an hour more, but what to do - what is done is done. That aside, that new type of shooting (with camera always in motion and short cuts) and special effects, make this movie an excellent adventure with no boring part, which makes this movie (in my opinion) the best in this serial so far, and this made me give a solid 9 to the ""Goblet of fire""."

"Sy-4","7","0","0","26 November 2005"," An Impossible Task?
","Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, carried the series into a whole new dimension - that dimension being the thickness of the volumes. Almost twice the length of its predecessor this mega-tome was always going to be problematic to condense into a watchable movie. For my money, Mike Newell's result is a valiant, but predictably rushed and uneven affair that will leave fans of the series disappointed at what was left out, but that will also leave newcomers (if there are any people still in this category out there!) bewildered as to what on earth is happening. The movie felt exactly like the edited highlights of a much longer movie that had been roughly pasted together. As a side effect of having to race through the story, there is no time to develop any real depth in the characters, which is unfortunate. (In most cases, anyway: with each new episode I grow ever more irritated with Daniel Radcliffe's wide-eyed and mumbling performance as Harry.) Interestingly, the one character who displays any real passion is Voldemort, played by Ralf Fiennes, and I look forward to seeing more of him.<br/><br/>In summary, not the best of the series so far (that honor surely goes to Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban), but not a bad effort given the challenges imposed by the book. I'm hopeful that a decent movie can be made out of the next book, which although it's even longer, has in many ways a more straightforward storyline (and more things that can be cut). 7/10"

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is no longer simply a children's movie it is an excellent adventure flick for the whole family to enjoy. I really enjoyed the dynamic between the trio as they face personal problems that are common with growing up and dealing with puberty and the challenges of adulthood. Hopefully the gaps of this movie will be filled in the DVD edition. I would have liked more on screen time between Dumbledore and Harry, there is almost none. Since Dumbledore is Harry's father figure there should be more time for them to bond and share fears."
"XFeawen","7","0","0","26 November 2005"," Not as good as third, but better than the first two
","In my opinion, this fourth installment of the series is good, but not great. What struck me as its most obvious weakness is the script. Of course, there is far too much material in the book to put it all into the movie, things had to be left out. But what is now left is nothing more than a series of highlights from the book without a proper connection, characters are not given enough screen time to develop and to really make an impression, their motivations are often left unexplained, etc.<br/><br/>Take, for example, the argument between Harry and Ron. It is never really explained, why Ron would have wanted to be a champion (the tournament being very dangerous, after all). Then after the first task they are friends again. What made Ron speak to Harry again is not really made clear, either. It is not explained why Barty Crouch is lying around in the forest, killed for a reason we don't know, and, as far as I remember from the one time I saw the film, we don't even learn who killed him. Rita Skeeter is in the film, but her brief - and admittedly, very well played - appearances are of no real use to the plot. This screen time could have been used to better develop the characters of the other champions.<br/><br/>Other things that might be hard to understand for people who don't know the book are left unexplained as well, e.g. how Barty Crouch junior came to be the Impostor of Alastor Moody, how the Polyjuice Potion works, Krum's behavior in the maze, etc. The film just lacks some quiet scenes, it is too rushed to really explore the depths of things. It also lacks the rich atmosphere of the third movie and the score by Patrick Doyle is - though really not bad - not as varied as the three previous ones by John Williams.<br/><br/>There are, however, many really good moments. Harry and Myrtle in the bath - hilarious. The scenes around the Yule Ball, finding partners, dancing lessons - these seemed to have been real fun for the team. The atmosphere in the World Cup stadium gave me goose-bumps (if only the audience were allowed to see something of the actual game). Also the dark and claustrophobic feel of the maze and the horror of Voldemort's 'resurrection' afterwards. I was very pleased with the performance of Ralph Fiennes there. The special effects are really good, too.<br/><br/>All in all, the film suffers from a weak script, but is brilliantly visualized and pleases with solid performances from the cast."

"bytheseaside","8","0","0","26 November 2005"," Far and away the best yet
","I would have given the first movie 4. Watchable, but just barely. The second a 5, dragged down by that god-awful ending. Third movie a 6 1/2, a definite improvement. This one scored a solid 8. It honestly left the other three in the dust, if you haven't seen this already go and see it! The beginning of the movie was very well done. I have to say that the fan in me was a little disappointed, wanting to see scenes that I have poured over in the books many, many times, but I squashed that little voice down, knowing that seeing those scenes probably would have been a disappointment in itself - one the movie would be unlikely to recover from. Yes, it would have been nice to have seen more of the Quidditch World Cup, but it does not add to the story so would be unnecessary distraction, and the Death Eaters more than made up for any shortening - they were frightening, the scenes were chilling in their realism, the terror and the racial persecution. I also have to say I'm thankful to whoever left the house elves out of it. Winky may have served her purpose in the book, but Barty Crouch Jnr. was far more sinister without her interference - as he should be.<br/><br/>At this point, I have to give thumbs up to David Tennant for his performance, but that's neither here nor there.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was fast paced and covered the story very well. Once again I had to ruthlessly squelch the fan in me during the first task, with a little more regret this time - the dragon was injured, which should have lost Harry a good deal of points. Still the scenes contained far more depth than they may have done previously under other directors. The second task was excellent, very well done, and I did love Moaning Murtle. Just brilliant.<br/><br/>Actually, most of the minor characters were used to their best in this movie, which was nice to see. It is always more satisfying when you have a good solid set of minor characters. Aside from Alan Rickman, usually we suffer here. He always puts in an exceptional performance, but this time thanks to writing and directing everyone was done well.<br/><br/>The maze was not bad, the way the vines kept closing around, and the paths were shifting was extremely creepy, and much better than monsters probably could have been here. A good choice, many movies are still let down by the CGI, and to not have anything that had the potential to go sideways was wise. The effects did go a little off in Harry's battle with Voldemort, with the ghosts appearing out of the wands, but it was short and so not too disastrous.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint and Emma Watson performed brilliantly, both showing off the skills they have picked up through the years. With any luck they have long careers in front of them, they deserve it. There will be plenty of people who denounce poor Daniel Radcliffe once again (though I'm sure there will be those who praise him too). There were some scenes certainly, where I stood back and went 'nah', but for the most part he has done as well as his counter parts in developing his talent and he certainly as a good handle on the character. It is fairly impressive when you keep in mind that he has a lot of weight to carry around as the lead actor. So kudos to all our young stars - can't wait to see you in OotP! <br/><br/>Good movie. A very good movie, and if the general progression is anything to go on I'll expect a cracker in the next one!"
"soul_of_padfoot","10","0","0","26 November 2005"," This movie is an excellent film, definitely worth seeing, don't miss out!
","I am in two minds about this movie. Don't get me wrong, it is a truly magnificent movie with absolutely brilliant Special Effects and all, but it was somewhat a let down throughout. A lot was cut from the film and, while I can cope with that and get over it, the whole film seemed rushed. The scenes were shorter with less detail and seemed to skip to the next scene too quickly for my liking.<br/><br/>Having said this however, the fourth installment of Harry Potter is really really great! Even if the scenes were short, they still delivered all of the action of the books. I swear, my heart was pounding in many of the scenes and I was closer to tears than I have ever been in a movie or book when a certain character was killed. Brilliant acting was displayed on screen and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the light moments which were littered throughout the film.<br/><br/>I have one piece of advice to you all: Do not wait for this movie to be released on DVD! It will not have the same impact and the spookiness of the graveyard scene in particular must be seen on the ""big screen"" at least once. I give it ten out of ten for the simple reason that is impossible to make a movie that does serious justice to the book it is based on."
"cramerg2000","8","0","0","25 November 2005"," I was skeptical, but this movie indeed manages to impress.
","If you enjoyed the style of Prisoner of Azkaban, as compared to the previous two movies, then I feel that you will enjoy Goblet of Fire even more. Prisoner of Azkaban was critically acclaimed because it managed to deviate from a strict translation of the book. It took a risk by adding little jokes and extra scenes that were necessary for a movie adaptation. Goblet of Fire does this even more, and I feel the result is really quite a good fit. I am sure Newell gave the kids loads of freedom in choosing how to act our their parts, and the result is that the scenes among the students seem completely genuine, believable, and entertaining.<br/><br/>In contrast with the earlier movies, the acting is a major plus. I'm not saying Daniel Radcliffe is up for an Oscar this year, but the acting was still good enough to be thoroughly enjoyable. One very minor complaint is perhaps that Hermione's acting is a bit over-exaggerated. (However, this kind of fits Hermione's personality, so one cannot complain too much.) Also, Cho Chang doesn't do much except smile all the time, but that's to be expected. Hopefully, her greater role next movie will be more interesting. Otherwise, the chemistry worked very well. I thought Krum and Cedric were well-casted and fit their parts well. Fleur was also good, but I wish we could've seen her show some actual magical talent. All the older actors (especially Moody)were great, which comes as no surprise. I still feel Richard Harris played a better Dumbledore. Michael Gambon does a good job, but he's a bit more stern and emotional than the Dumbledore portrayed in the books.<br/><br/>I feel that people already familiar with the books will most like the first half of the movie. Readers pretty much know what happens at the end, so the climax will not be amazingly exciting as it was when you read it for the first time. The third task leaves out a bit more than I would've liked, and no film interpretation can match the book's suspenseful graveyard scene. That said, all of this was still just as entertaining as I could have hoped.<br/><br/>The special effects are great, and the dragon scene is pulled off very well. The second task is also well-translated from the book, though still not as thrilling as the first.<br/><br/>Some people criticize the fast pacing of this movie. I once thought that no movie could ever do justice to the 734-page book, given all the good material that would have to be left out. However, I now am convinced that the pacing here is actually just right. Everything that had to be left in is there. Yes, it is a bit quick. I wish the third task and the graveyard scene could've lasted just a bit longer. But the pacing is as good as it could've been given time constraints. Splitting the book into two movies would've been overkill. There's not THAT much good material in the book.<br/><br/>This movie shines most during the Yule Ball and in low-key moments that fill the gaps between the major action scenes. Again, the acting is great. Fred and George are especially good at providing some laughs. I admire this movie because it does not rely solely on its excellent special effects and climax action sequences to lure in its audience. It is refreshing to see every little nuance handled professionally by both cast and crew. Well done!"

","though, the movie leaves out large portions of the book, it still manages to capture the essence of the story. as a die-hard potter fan, i was very disappointed with the previous three movies. this one pays great attention to all the important elements of the book and captures them in fine cinematic style.while the Weasly twins (the best characters in the entire series) get good enough coverage, the screen time given to Snape, Hagrid and Sirius is far too less. still, a great visual treat characterized by fine acting by all the protagonists, who seem to have grown into the roles. a special praise for Emma Watson, who is outstanding as Hermione. Gambon as Dumbledore is still far too insipid compared to the fantastic portrayal by the late Richard Harris. the highlight of the movie is undoubtedly, Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody/ Barty Crouch Jr. he brings a great deal of subtlety to the role and is a delight to watch. Mike Newell has done a stupendous job in bringing to life , arguably the most demanding book of the series so far. definitely one for the DVD collection of every Potter fan."
"patrick_dunne","8","0","0","25 November 2005"," Good movie, but too based on the thought that the viewers had already read the book
","I thought Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best of the series. I was probably wrong.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a VERY good movie and VERY well done. The movie centers on Harry as he takes his fourth year into Hogwarts. This year, Voldemort's (sorry, ""He Who Must Not Be Named"") power is steadily growing, thanks to his servants, the Death Eaters. Early in the film, Harry and his pals are gathering at the Quittich World Cup. Quickly into the film, the characters are attacked-not by dementors this time- but by Death Eaters, Lord Voledemort's servants. (This part was very exciting.) The film moves fairly quickly, with more mystery than even the Prisoner of Azkaban had. Harry Potter is entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. How? We have yet to find out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Harry, he has no choice except to accept what is in front of him. What also sucks for Harry is that people have died in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Yes, it's that dangerous.<br/><br/>One thing new with Harry is that he is at the stage in life where he is changing. Hormones. More romance takes place, than it did in the others. For example, Harry seems to have a bit of feeling for Cho Chung. Ron gets jealous of his friends, because he can't get a date for himself. Hermione seems to have taken a liking to one of the other competitors. I remember Ron commenting ""Bloody hell"" when checking out the bodies of the French team.<br/><br/>The movie generally is exciting and face-paced, but even if it has a length of 157 minutes, it still moves too fast for its own good.<br/><br/>For example, they never tell us what a port-key is. (The audience has to figure it out for themselves.) The character, Cedric Diggory is hardly introduced to us. There seems to be no beginning the scene where the Death Eaters attack. It just happens out of nowhere. The movie never tells us why Ron gets mad at Harry. (It is because he is jealous, as previously stated.) The three unforgivable curses are never explained. Even if they took out parts of the book to make the movie shorter, they seem to have taken out necessary parts along with them.<br/><br/>I did like the movie, but..""THE MOVIE BASED ITSELF ON THE THOUGHT THAT THE VIEWERS HAD ALREDY READ THE BOOK."" Therefore, it made itself different from other book adaptations such as Jaws, Mystic River, A Simple Plan, Forrest Gump and Silence of the Lambs. Everyone who has read the book has probably seen it already, and knows what was going to happen, so they wouldn't have a problem. But, for newcomers of the series, it would seem badly-paced and a bit shallow at times.<br/><br/>If I remembered the book, I probably would have liked it better. Too bad I didn't remember so much of it, so I will give this movie.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Good: Darker, better special effects, better story<br/><br/>Bad: Thought viewers had already read the book, which probably contributed to the rush<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

","I could not wait to see this movie. Not only am I a big fan of the books but I am also a big lover of film (which I earned a degree in). Goblet of Fire was by far one of my favorite books of the saga, so I was indeed looking forward to seeing how and if a new director could capture the feel and setting of this book. <br/><br/>I am sad to say I was a bit disappointed. Now with being a student of film I understand that with adaptation of books to film, that a lot is almost always left out. However, I have also learned that if done right the film version can still retain the feel and the integrity of the story that it is based off of. Cuaron was able to do this very well with ""Azkaban"" capturing the dark and uneasiness and even sometimes comedic elements of the book, while still leaving a lot out. Unfortunately for Newell, he did have his work cut out for him. I mean ""Goblet of Fire"" is a 700+ page book, and there is a lot of story to show and cut. The screenplay just didn't seem to flow, jumping from one thing to the other. Not only that, he changed many things from the book that wouldn't have been hard to shoot like they were originally written. <br/><br/>I'm not a director by any means, but something about this adaptation just didn't feel right. For the fact that I was able to see the three tasks come to life, and that the graveyard scene was well done, I give this film 6 out of 10. It is an entertaining movie for the average movie goer, but if you are any kind of a fan of Rowling's writing, I suspect you will feel a bit let down. I salute Newell for giving it a shot, but I think it could've been done better."

I was seeing parts I had forgotten from the book. Wow, this HP movie is the best yet. I was just so impressed this time. I am at a loss for words. Or am I?

","I enjoyed this film but felt that it wasn't nearly as good as the others, especially the third one (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). I know that it's difficult to cram as much was in the fourth book into a film of a regular length that average individuals can sit through, but I feel like the entire film was rushed and slapped together choppily. For those with short attention spans, this would be a great film to see - the individual scenes are so short that the viewer is constantly being thrown between them. I didn't like the directing as much as the previous films, and although the visuals were quite interesting, I feel like it didn't make up for the short scenes and choppy editing. It was good, but I felt like it could have been done better and I wouldn't have minded sitting through more for it to be more like the book it's based on."
"samar123","5","0","0","25 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Falls Short
","You all probably know the story of Harry Potter GOF by now, so I won't waste your time giving you a summary of the movie. I would just like to address the areas in which this movie falls short.<br/><br/>First of all, the casting was quite badly done, no offense to the actors. Mad-eye Moody is described as a tall, dark man with a face that seemed to be cut out of wood. He has a mechanical eye and is a shady-but-cool character. You can imagine my surprise when I go to the movie and find a fat, pudgy actor that has a tacky eye that one would expect to find at a Toys R Us store.<br/><br/>The comes Albus Dumbledore. If you have read the books, you will know that he is one of the most important characters and is an old, good-natured type of guy. To me, Richard Harris was the perfect Dumbledore. It was unfortunate that he passed on after completing the second movie, but Michael Gambon is by no means a good Dumbledore. His voice is a lot more deeper and it lacks the decay of age, his features don't suit the part and was it me or is he a little fat? Finally, I have to comment on the overall feeling of the movie. It seemed to be quite choppy and didn't have the smooth transitions from scene to scene. And what happened to the fatherly figure of Sirius? I think he was only shown once in the movie, and even then it was for a one minute scene. I think the filmmakers just cut out a lot of the important material and extended the events related to the Yule Ball. Another thing that ruined the movie for was the lack of character development. Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory and Fleur are shown a few times but are very static, Barty Crouch isn't shown much and the teachers have maybe one scene. Emma Watson also goes over the top portraying Hermione as an over-emotional girl that is always ready to burst out crying. Saying that, this movie did have an improvement in acting and it had some good ole' humor.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an improvement over the last three movies but still falls short of what we want and expect."

","The fourth installment of the ever popular boy wizard Harry Potter,is in a word,Stunning.Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire is the best film in the series,and also the best action/adventure/thriller of the year.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say what the film is about:the whole world already knows about it,what I'll write is what I thought of the movie.<br/><br/>OK,so Alfonso Cuaron may have done a Harry Potter movie with details that make ""Azkaban"" more than a mere pop-up book:Its a richly crafted world of wonder.But In ""Goblet"",there is not much of details.But there is Human Drama.Its a film developed so skillfully in people's emotion.It brings a great sense of danger and ordinary life.And yet,there is Teenage life.There's even humor in the film,and of course by time,there is sexual tension.One thing I really noticed is how the film really took its turn by comedic moments.So in other words,its almost a grown-up comedy.<br/><br/>The acting is really good,and Radcliffe has bloomed into a more confident actor,so when he returns from the Graveyard with one of the champion's body in his arm,it'll evoke tears of sadness.Watson is also good as Hermione,she in this movie feels more like a mother figure of Harry.And finally Rupert Grint,is the one who gives his best performance to date by his facial expressions. Ralph Fienes,Brendan Gleeson,and Miranda Richardson are the newcomers to the series as Voldemort,Mad Eye Moody,and Rita Skeeter.All of these newcomers give their 100% percent at acting.<br/><br/>The task of the triwizard tournament are amazing!But of course,my personal favorite task is the Maze,since anything can happen in there.<br/><br/>Sure,you might think they have destroyed the film by cutting out so much,but once you think about it,they'v done a ""bang,bang,bang"" motion picture.Its never boring and the action comes alive in each of these tasks.If you start thinking about it,The Dursleys was some kind of symbol that made the films more childlike,but this time,they'v cut it out and replaced it by no other than a death and the ultimate plan of evil.<br/><br/>Once you see the end,Hermione says ""everythings going to change"",and Harry just gives her a simple ""Yes"",like some sort of comic relief that goes in the final scene,but it also means the last shred of hope that Harry has in the future,and that as long as Harry,Hermione,and Ron stay together,they'll be forever strong and their maturity bolds them into much more emotional,powerful people.Its like they loose their innocence from now on,stepping into the darkest Harry Potter territory of the series,the territory JK Rowling expertly portrays into a world they'll have to keep up with fear and despair,but as always,with hope in their lives.<br/><br/>EXCELLENT!"

","Okay, it took me two years to finally watch HP two and three, and even then I cried for lack of insight used by the directors....they've ruined my Harry Potter world. No Peeves, no Ludo Bagman, Hermione's hair is crimpy instead of bushy....her teeth are even normal.... no human could fill the shoes of those characters in my mind. <br/><br/>However, this movie really was good. I disliked the fact that time restraints (the movie was coming up on three hours) prevented a development in relationship between Harry and Moody.... Also, the glass eye was strapped on.... despite several disappointments, the special effects (which usually just annoy me) were good, and the storyline did not turn out half bad despite several hundred pages of deleted plot.

","My wife and I saw it the other night.

I think it is about as good a movie as one can see right now, if you look at it as simply a movie. Good story, good special effects, good characters, and Moody and Ron's antics really steal the show (for me at least).<br/><br/>But, if you can only see this as a book adaptation, then it suffers the same fate as about 95% of all book adaptations: ""The book was better, and I didn't like how they did (blank)."" It's a shame, really, because this film is far-and-away better than most of the tripe spewing out of Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>PS: One thing we both agree on was that Voldemort was FANTASTIC.

I started laughing right from the start and didn't stop till the end.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting of Daniel Radcliffe is appalling, I just couldn't help but laugh. The delivery of his lines was so wooden it makes Keanu Reeves look worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>Then there was that scene where Cho smiled at Harry and Harry tried to smile back. However he had just drank something beforehand and it just all came back out. That scene made me laugh my ass off just for the sheer stupidity of it.<br/><br/>Then there was that exclamation from Neville that he'd just killed Harry. He had such a stupid expression on his face and it just a funny clip.<br/><br/>Even when this film is trying to be serious, it was still unintentionally hilarious. The characters in this film just had some of the most stupid and funny expressions I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave this film 8 out of 10 cos it made me laugh and not because I thought it was that good. The previous film was much better."

I don't know... I don't think that it was as good as the first two HP movies. If each of the newer HP movies keep going on like this, I might not go and watch them (well...

","I was seriously disappointed in the third Harry Potter (HP) movie. Ik lacked a good plot, the book was ruined and the acting wasn't much better. On the other hand, if unlike me, you don't consider the books to be sacred you could have a lot of fun watching it.<br/><br/>The same goes in an even bigger way for this fourth movie. Personally I hate it, I think it's the worst book movie in all of history, and it's the worst movie I've seen in years. It annoyed me, the movie completely ruined a great book, the plot was gone, it was going way to fast, ah well, I could go on for hours. Suffice it to say that if you're like me a die hard fan of the books you probably won't like this movie because it isn't the book.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're not a die hard fan and you just like HP you probably will have a wonderful time with the movie. It has comedy, drama, action and romance. It has a fast plot to keep you on the edge of your seat and nice visual effects.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is not in the acting or anything, the problem is that some great events from the book are not in the movie. Sorry to say this, but for everyone hoping for a spectacular finale of the Quidditch World Championships, forget it, you never get to see the match. This was the first disappointment and at that time I knew I was not going to like the movie and I didn't. I laughed at times of course, but I couldn't fully enjoy the movie because so much was twisted in a bad way in comparison to the book and even major characters left out and major events changed. And that really saddened me.<br/><br/>In short, if you loved the books, read them till the cover came off don't go watch it in the cinema. If you've only seen the movies or weren't such a fan of the books you'll have a wonderful time with this movie."

I realize it must be difficult to put a 700+ page book into a 2.5 hour movie, but there must be some middle ground.<br/><br/>For those that have not read the book it will not matter and they'll probably walk away thinking this was the best movie ever, either because everybody else says it is or because they were simply entertained by the fancy computer graphics.<br/><br/>I hope the next movie is better than this one or at least as good as 1-3, but this is just my opinion."

","Like most other Harry Potter fans, the fourth book is my favorite. I love every single detail and rabbit trail Jo has in the book, but when you think about the fact that every page in a book translates into one minute on the screen, i'm okay with having a 165 minute movie instead of an almost 800 minute movie. As much fun as it would be to see it all, we all waited on pins and needles for this movie, and to put every single thing in would have taken much longer. I was highly irritated with the way Dumbedore was abrasive and very short with Harry. They could have handled casting a bit better, I don't think Clemmence Posey was the best Fleur.

","I guess it's too late to replace Daniel Radcliffe, but from the beginning he was never a compelling on screen presence, and that's a shame. The owlish Harry Potter deserves an edge Ratcliffe simply does not possess. So, every Potter movie including this one seems to have involved spinning some very expensive plates to distract us from this fact. Here are the best special effects money can buy (the Quidditch match is the set piece and is the most satisfying), some rather disconcerting sexual innuendo about Harry's belongings in a bath house, Ralph Fiennes as the evil version of the English Patient (wow, that must have hurt his nose), and the dawning realization that purely through an accident of birth, Harry Potter will prevail over every evil that befalls him. For some reason I find this depressing rather than inspiring. It must go back to my proud American notion that you are not born into greatness, you much create it. Whereas in England, you're stuck for life."

"midea156","5","0","0","25 November 2005"," Good as a movie, terrible as a book-movie adaptation
","For starters, as a movie, this is easily the best of the Harry Potter movies so far. The acting has obviously improved from the first three and the scenery, breathtaking in it's own right, stayed consistent with prior movies (unlike the scenery from Chamber of Secrets to Prisoner of Azkaban). The special effects made the movie seem otherworldly yet believable and the characters had a depth that was somewhat missing in previous installments.<br/><br/>That being said, as a movie adaptation of a book, this was easily the worst of the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>Barty Crouch Jr was unrecognizable as the same character from the book. In the book, we were supposed to pity him, when he was dragged into court kicking and begging, pleading, screaming for mercy. We were supposed to feel angry at his father for exclaiming that Junior was ""no son of mine."" Not so in the movie. Junior is too obviously evil to give us any feeling of pity.<br/><br/>Besides that, nothing of how he escaped from Azkaban was mentioned. It was the biggest question on everyone's lips in the previous book and movie: How did Sirius Black escape from Azkaban? But here, it's a throwaway question, nothing of importance.<br/><br/>The Quiddich World cup, one of the most fun parts of the book, was introduced then dropped, and S.P.E.W. (the Society for the Protection of Elfish Welfare) was completely cut, along with the House-elves in general. Ludo Bagman and his piece of the story (which added depth) was dropped, along with the 1,000 Galleon prize that Harry gets for winning the Triwizard Tournament, which will create problems for the next director when he tries to explain how the twins will finance their joke shop.<br/><br/>Voldemort, while looking and sounding much like he came off as in the book, was far too insane, not nearly as calm and collected as he was in the story. It was how calmly Voldemort discussed the punishment of his Death Eaters for not finding him, how calmly he planned to kill Harry, how calmly he acted and spoke, that made him so frightening and unnerving. I found it difficult to imagine him killing so many people; he was just too crazy.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie, yes. It was fun to watch and interesting to see. But it left a mess for the next director and made a mess of the book, which definitely lowered my opinion of it. If you're going to watch it as a book to movie adaptation, I'd recommend that you watch something else. If you're looking for a good movie and don't mind if it doesn't fit the book, then go ahead and watch it."

","I saw the newest Harry Potter movie on a Saturday afternoon around 3:00 pm I think. I don't remember lol. I was thinking of couple things before the movie started, acting, special effects and the directing of the movie. Halfway through the movie I thought it was just alright until I saw the true acting when Harry, Ron and Hermione were all fighting. You could think it was a big emotional scene. That's what people look for in these movies (also action.) The directing was outstanding. Mike Newell showed lots of the Castle in this movie (some things were changed though which no one really cares.) Special Effects were cool. Special Effects were 100% perfect in this onebut the other special effects in the last 3 were okay too. The music was outstandinglike always, John Williams is always at his best with the theme,Patrick Doyle also did outstanding job when it comes to movies like these. I rate this movie 10 out of 10. Now...I can't wait to see the next one."

","Wonderful special effects and sets make this film a great event worth watching. Part of the fun is how much the series allows you to be part of the characters' lives. Such as, how they are becoming obviously, more mature. I highly recommend this film. Another fun part of this film series is how different ideas and objects are introduced. The school is the same, but there are new characters which we learn about as we watch. The fantasy of a person flying in the air with a broom is enchanting, however, it is just that, a fantasy. The sadness I felt as the story unfolded was a little unsettling, but it was just a story, of course. The costumes were, as usual, great, and Maggie Smith was wonderful as one of the professors. The other actors were fabulous in their roles. Have a great time watching!"

"Squeaky-Voiced-Teen","7","0","0","25 November 2005"," You know what?....NOT the best potter movie yet....!
","Title referring to the endless amount of user comments starting with : ""best potter movie yet""<br/><br/>Anyway, I have been a huge fan of harry potter since the beginning of it all. I have anticipated every movie and book before their release date and have never been as disappointed as in this case. Don't get me wrong Harry potter and the Goblet of fire is a great movie, but not the best potter movie yet. This because of several reasons: - All the ""raving and rating"" here at IMDb, with reviews like that i expected a lot out of it, that's the first reason. - The previous potter movies, the philosopher's stone was as magical as anyone could ever make it, couldn't have been better. The second one also was very good, done in about the same beautiful Columbus style as the first. Azkaban however, caught me off guard, so totally different from the first two, it was kind of amazing, the darkness captured beautifully and great cinematography, i have learned to appreciate Cuarón's way of shooting even more by watching the DVD over and over again, awesome movie. So having these three movies as your predecessors bears a lot of pressure and in my case didn't fulfill my potter needs, so to speak (that sounded kind of perverted) - And the biggest reason, too much Mike Newell, almost 45 minutes was dedicated to the dating/girls part of the movie, i am very well aware that the book also had a lot of this going on but when you're going to cram a 400 page book (about a wizard) into 2 and a half hours, make sure there's plenty of magic. what i'm trying to say is that, this would have been a great comedy if it didn't play in hogwarts, you know. Not enough magic, great, now i sound like a 5-y.o. <br/><br/>Anyway it's obvious Mike Newell's area is romantic comedy and he tried to put that in as much as he could, too much of it, and then the climax with the final showdown was in complete contrast with the rest of the movie and kind of rushed as well.<br/><br/>All in all, a fantastic movie (special effects were great but ever big-budget flicks'are nowadays) but kind of disappointing, sadly. Everyone has to see this movie cause obviously a lot of people's opinions differ. I hate that i didn't like this movie though, tough luck..."

Also, the movie does good justice until the third task...after that it sort of like, director realized movie getting bigger than 2.5 hrs and just rushed thru it. (I don't want to listen to the reason that 3hrs is unbearable compared to 2.5) He didn't even consider important to show the death of Barty Crouch Jr. upon which entire 5th book is dependent on. Why should'nt the ministry believe harry if crouch is sent back to azkaban(as it is conveyed in the movie)."
"mindcrime79","9","0","0","23 November 2005"," Best of the four so far!
","I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter novels and was somewhat disappointed with the Azkaban film since I felt a lot of the necessary content was cut. Although quite a bit of the story had to be cut for Goblet of Fire as well, I believe this script was better. The movie concentrated on the important aspects of the story such as the changing relationships and Harry's growth into a teenager. The special effects were absolutely wonderful and I think they make great casting choices. Daniel, Rupert and Emma are becoming quite good actors and I hope that they remain for the remaining films. Goblet of Fire is full of action and humor and is well worth the money. My only complaint is that it is somewhat hard to follow if you haven't read the books. My mother had a hard time keeping track of some of the new characters since they don't get a lot of screen time. The role of Barty Crouch was cut a little too much and you don't get much of a sense of who he is. Overall, it is an excellent movie and I think it is the best Harry Potter movie yet!!"
"oneandonlygod","Null","0","0","23 November 2005"," Evilpanda's Goblet of Fire Review
","SPOILER WARNING: Although I don't really know why I put this here as most people have already read the book, and it's not as if the movie strayed that far away from the book. Nevertheless, it is the cordial thing to do, so if you don't want to be spoiled then stop reading now.<br/><br/>Okay. So you've seen the movie. Chances are you've read the book. No more beating around the bush. I liked the movie. HOWEVER (saw that coming did you?) for me to say that I simply liked it means that I did leave disappointed.<br/><br/>I first have to say that I thought the edits were brilliant. Cutting out the elves and SPEW were the perfect solution to shorten things up. Rushing through the beginning I had no problems with either. Beefing up Neville's character was perfect. There's a lot of meat in this story, so it's best to get there as soon as possible. So ask yourself, what's the meat of this story? What is the one crucial element that is the very heart of this arc? If you answered anything but the return on Voldemort, you answered incorrectly. Book 4 is the turning point. It's where EVERYTHING CHANGES, and we need to see this in the movie. Now the question is did we? Overall? No.<br/><br/>What was so great about book 4 was that JK didn't hold back any punches. We're killing Cedric. No heroic death. Just freaking kill him. The graveyard scene is one that sticks with the reader, as being dark, evil, and dangerous. I didn't feel it. I felt they could have made the graveyard scene a LOT darker. I wanted Harry to be scared out of his freaking mind, to have no idea of what to do. I wanted him to come out broken and bleeding. I wanted Evil to be shown for exactly what it is with no punches pulled, because that's exactly what JK did.<br/><br/>I felt this movie needed the Empire Strikes Back ending, where you truly feel things are going to change, the characters are different by the end, and that NOTHING is going to be the same. Having the Minister there to denounce what Harry saw. Having Harry calling out the names of Death Eaters left and right. It needed that raw intensity the book had. The scene where Harry comes back had a great intensity, but they didn't sustain it. Instead it ended light and fluffy like a bunny rabbit. <br/><br/>At the end of Book 4 you felt as if you were standing at a huge cliff hanger. The response that you got from every reader was that ""things will never be the same,"" and even if things may not have actually technically changed, there was a distinct sense of change. There was an impact and an intensity. I felt none of that, and adding a cute little dialog between Harry & Hermione at the end doesn't cut it for me. ""So Harry, I guess things are going to change?"" ""Uhm. Yeah."" What?!! And why on earth would you end the movie with a shot of both the schools leaving? <br/><br/>The direction of movie 3 went completely in another direction from the first 2, which is exactly what needed to happen. I felt a plateau in 4.<br/><br/>The first 3/4ths of the movie I did thoroughly enjoy. I thought it was brilliant. The pensieve. The entrances of both schools. The dance. Rita. How they did the effect with Sirius in the fireplace. The scene with Mertle in the prefect bathroom. (what a bathroom!) All the little things were there. But I felt from the maze and everything after felt a little too rushed. You can breeze past the rest of the story, but when you get to the real deal, the meatiest part of the meat, the climax, the duel at high noon, you need to stretch things out Goddammit! You can't rush that, and that's exactly what the director did. Overall, I will say that it needed to be Bigger & Darker.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Remember I said I liked it. I was hooting and hollering with joyous glee for many a scene in the movie. The end however, left me feeling a little flat. As a fan of the series, there's always a joy in viewing the books on the big screen. To a non-fan though, they may feel the movie didn't rap up tightly in the end. Was it worth it to see a midnight viewing with friends? Of course. Is it matinée or nighttime price? I would say matinée for non-fans, but for fans, it barely makes it to a nighttime price ticket. In the end, I still rank the 3rd movie the best."

","This is by far the most embarrassing installment of the harry potter films, not that I enjoyed any of the others. What really annoys me about this film, and I mean REALLY annoys me is the completely wooden performances by the lead characters, and how Daniel Radcliffe has become the UK's most valuable teenager is beyond me. Stirred up by the success of the books, these films are riding purely on the parental pester power from pre teens alone, and the release of these films is such an allegedly major event that parents feel they can't deny their kids. What is also obvious from watching this film, ( well when I say watching, i mean catching the film between me falling asleep in the cinema), is that the director is packing to much CGI and action into the film when it isn't needed. What happened to the directors of films such as Run Lola Run and Lord of the rings, who use their obvious talent as directors rather than just budget to create a great film.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is unimaginative, dull, boring and not worth even a fraction of the entrance charge. I won't be buying this on DVD!"

","I was a bit surprised to see the number of comments proclaiming this movie to be the best in the series. I suppose there is a little bit of that after each one comes out. I felt that this was the most poorly directed and least enjoyable out of the 4 movies. The third one was by far the best imo. Perhaps the task of fitting the contents of the book into GOF proved to be too daunting, as it felt like much was missing. What was there from the book felt both distorted and lacking of any continuity. The sequence of events, while ordered, felt very broken throughout the movie. It feels like scenes are being rushed through, and then I am thrown into a new one, with little to no transition. While the acting was on par with the previous movies in the series, the portrayals were far off for some of the characters. I am specifically referring to Michael Gambon's depiction of Dumbledore, which was absolutely horrific. Dumbledore lacked the calm and kind demeanor displayed in the book. Rather this Dumbledore seems to border on angry, mean, and frantic. Madeye Moody and Lord Voldemort also suffered in this movie, displaying personalities vastly different from the book. Come to think of it, McGonagall and Snape were also very off. Snape didn't come off as a hateful teacher, just rather strict. McGonagall on the other hand lacked the sternness she has displayed in the books and previous movies. <br/><br/>Mind you my complaints aren't based on the movie not being a picture perfect interpretation of the book, but rather the feeling the movie distorted main characters and the feeling that everything in the movie is rushed."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","8","0","0","22 November 2005"," Vastly flawed, but still an enjoyable chapter in the series
","When you ask most Harry Potter fanatics what the worst film in the series is, most will probably respond with Goblet of Fire. If you ask a non reader what the best Harry Potter film is, most will probably respond with Goblet of Fire. That's a rare trait in a movie. To the mainstream audience, Goblet of Fire is the definition of a summer blockbuster (though it was released in November). It has far and away the most and best action of any film of the series, and is a beautiful movie in its production design, music, and other technical aspects, but on a direction level, it's weak and on an adaptation level, it's even weaker. Let's just say that most Potter fans are glad this is the only one Mike Newell got his hands on.<br/><br/>GOF follows young hero Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in his fourth year at Hogwarts, where a new tournament is being held between three wizarding schools: The Triwizard Tournament. However, when Harry is unexpectedly chosen as a fourth champion in the potentially deadly tournament despite being below the age limit, it has become apparent that the legendary dark wizard Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) may be closer to returning than ever before.<br/><br/>I guess you could say that GOF is the worst acted of the Potter films, and the main problem lies with Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. Radcliffe gives a pretty wooden performance, but shines towards the end of the film in the climactic Graveyard sequence. Emma ""Crazy Brows"" Watson needs to contain her eyebrows, which dance about so much that it's distracting. It's amazing how she went from best actor of the trio to the worst. Clearly her early success was the work of Christopher Columbus. As always, however, the adult cast is phenomenal. Alan Rickman's vile Severus Snape has to be one of the best performances of the year, even if he has little screen time. Coming from an avid reader, Rickman is absolutely perfect as Snape. Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall is also one of my favorite performances, in addtion to the the showings from Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, a new character. I also must commend the performance of Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic and evil incarnate Lord Voldemort. In addition to his grotesque appearance, Fiennes' Voldemort is easily one of the most fearsome film villains of recent memory, just like his novel counterpart. He is hardly recognizable in the role, in fact, even the sharpest moviegoer may not recognize him.<br/><br/>As always, the Potter films continue to boast Oscar worthy art direction and visual effects. The brilliant sequences include a massive dragon chase, a dangerous underwater scene, and of course, the terrifying (though not as action packed) showdown between Harry and Voldemort. Mike Newell, however appears to be the wrong choice for the director's chair here, as the only thing he succeeds in is creating great action and divulging some great comedy from James & Oliver Phelps (the Weasley twins). This film is also very angsty, full of teenage hormones running wild, as Harry develops his first crush, and Ron and Hermione realize that they may feel more than friendly feelings for each other. Sadly, this is the weakest script in the series, in addition to being poorly edited. It's very possible to get lost in the plot (even though it's not that complicated as many subplots were cut). The character development of Ginny Weasley is nonexistent (even though she does get a couple hilarious lines), Voldemort's screen time is laughable, Snape is horrendously underutilized, Barty Crouch Jr.'s character is altered completely, and the characters Dobby, Winky, and Ludo Bagman are gone entirely. The fault for all these miscues goes directly to Newell and writer Steve Kloves.<br/><br/>On its own, Goblet of Fire is an outstanding action film that the average moviegoer will enjoy, however, it is a horrid adaptation full of bad editing, plot holes, and bad character development. Of course, I can forgive Kloves for the miscues, as this book is much larger than the previous three, but not Newell. He was probably the worst director for the series, while my favorites are David Yates and Alfonso Cuaron."
"ciderjam","Null","0","0","22 November 2005"," Underwhelmed
","After viewing the fourth installment of the Harry Potter series, I've found myself in the minority. For the first time in the series, I did NOT read reviews of the film before seeing it myself. Whether that is the reason for my disappointment with the newest ""Potter"" adaptation or not, I must say it was my least favorite of the four.<br/><br/>The first three had a fluidity of storytelling that ""Goblet"" did not. I can assure you that I had as much anticipation about the film as the next fan, but throughout the film I found myself emotionally unengaged, wondering when ""a cool part"" would happen. It's difficult to elaborate on what I mean without giving spoilers, but suffice it to say there are a number of subplots which are left underdeveloped, an annoying amount of screen time is dedicated to silly, pre-pubescent melodrama, and the climactic scene in which Voldemort (I've probably misspelled it) is seen in full form is weak. I honestly find it perplexing that so many of the reviews now are praising Ralph Fiennes for portraying ""he-who-should-not-be-named"" so well. One review I read of a 16-year-old fan said, ""I thought Voldemort would be faceless..."" I share the 16-year-old's disappointment. Oh well...Of course I will be in line on opening day when ""Phoenix"" arrives in theaters, but until then, I can definitely say I'll be indulging Chapters 1-3 of the saga and not so much chapter 4."

"dramarye","10","0","0","22 November 2005"," A Very Faithful Adaptation That Is Rarely Seen In This Era
","After viewing this movie in theaters, after all of the speculation and guessing, I must say the one and a half year wait was well worth it. From the beginning of this movie, from the thundering scores of the brilliant Patrick Doyle, to the rich, dark scenery, I knew this was a completely different Harry Potter film. <br/><br/>As it opens with a very creepy nightmare, so faced paced it seemed almost surreal, but still frightening, the juicer part of the movie begins. Now, I am not going to go and explain the entire plot, for most all of you have viewed it, but I am going to point out all of the parts that make this movie very special.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting in this film is top notch. My personal favorite was the brilliantly insane Mad-Eye Moody portrayed flawlessly by the talented Brendan Gleeson. He was the one that stole the show for me, although I know everyone is buzzing about Ralph Fiennes's characterization of the warped, malevolent Lord Voldemort. To me, his performance didn't stick out very much, but perhaps I was still getting over the shock of his gruesome appearance. <br/><br/>My favorite actress to enter the Harry Potter series is the endlessly capable Miranda Richardson, whose Rita Skeeter is so seductively annoying you just want to smack her. Pity she has such little screen time, but I think they did a very good job of jamming her in every scene possible. The second female I thoroughly enjoyed was the gut busting performance by Shirley Henderson as Myrtle who is moaning for a new, different reason. The new kids on Potter Street, the champions, were all in all very good, especially Cedric Diggory and his father, who gave a very raw, tear jerking performance near the end. More mentions of newcomers include Roger Llyod-Pack, as Barty Crouch, who I found to be an interesting depiction of such a big politician (Has he gone through puberty yet? He's like a soprano!), and his son, played as a complete madman by David Tennant. These two characters have so many layers in the book; I pitied Barty Jr. soooooo much. He was such a neglected child, and his father was a emotionless hack. But in the film, they skim this over, which was what I found most disappointing, the lack of humanity which is depicted so well in the novels.<br/><br/>Moving on to the original actors, boy is the trio good! Daniel Radcliffe who had a fair few very pathetic scenes in the past, is really shaping up to be an able actor. Rupert Grint is the most natural child actor I have seen for a very long time. (I've seen a lot, I'm in the theater industry.) Emma Watson is excellent, but is sometimes too dramatic where it is unnecessary, such as the quivering voice in DADA. The twins are finally completely canon, which makes adds one missing star to my review. The adult cast is fabulous; Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman were born for these roles. Timothy Spall is very frightening in his role, almost more so than Lord Voldemort, and Sirius was a succinct, passable cameo by Gary Oldman. Some hilarious scenes with Robbie Coltrane and the very talented Frances De La Tour, one of the two perfectly cast headmasters beside one not so perfectly cast one. So, while we're on the subject of casting headmasters, WHO HIRED Micheal GAMBON? A very talented actor, but portrayed very wrongly. I don't mind him screaming ""HARRY POTTER!"" at the top of his voice, but please, put some personality into it, buddy! I disliked his scenes very much.<br/><br/>Why am I blaming him? Because the excellent screenplay by Steve Kloves didn't mess up any other characters. Mike Newell captures the essence of all of the other actors. It must be him. I say, please try to put back that PoA twinkle Mike!<br/><br/>All in all, this is the best possible job I think they could have done with a two and a half hour movie. Not everything could make it, and this is the first one where I thought the only things thrown away were the unnecessary plot lines. Plenty of action, romance, and comedy make this the ultimate Harry Potter movie. Mike Newell put a lot of heart into it, you can tell. The Britishness really shows, so I am happy to hear there is another Brit coming for the fifth. Harry Potter has grown up, and so is the quality of the films. 10/10"

","I understand that there is only so much time before you lose a viewers interest in a movie, which is why I understand why they had to cut some story lines short. to be honest,I thought there were some scenes where the acting was good, but the actors didn't exactly portray the character very well. I believed one to be a little over dramatic. other than that, there are some great scenes where emotion is just pouring out of the screen, which is why i rank this movie so highly. the only problem was some people being out of character. One for example i found to be Dumbledore. there is a scene where Dumbledore strides across the room and practically tackles Harry. another example would be Lord Voldemort. i find Voldemort to be a cool-headed, evil and manipulative sleek man. and the actor for Voldemort in the first Harry Potter movie did a spectacular job of that. however in the Goblet of Fire he seemed to be having an overly expressing attitude that made it look like a Broadway production. but really aside from that there seems to be a good connection with the book."
"madscientist2787","3","0","0","21 November 2005"," The weakest of the series so far.
","Spoilers Herein.<br/><br/>I'm somewhat sad to report that The Goblet of Fire is as of yet the sloppiest, most awkward and least heartfelt entry into the Harry Potter series. While it does contain a few gold moments and a spectacularly dark climax, the majority of the film is a collection of proverbial sore thumbs, and it pales in comparison to both Chris Columbus's decent, kid-oriented entries and Alfonso Cuaron's marvelous Prizoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>I believe the movie's failings are because of two reasons - first, that director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) doesn't really understand the story, and is probably pretty shaky on the entire Harry Potter universe. This is probably why the film seems so unsure of itself. Everything in the film dealing with the Yule Ball is practically a movie-within-a-movie on how to shoot bad scenes. Don't get me wrong - I'm not opposed to romance in the Potter universe. There were moments in Azkaban where we'd see little hints of a romantic subtext in the way that Harry would accidentally touch Hermione's hand and what-have-you, and they were handled expertly with subtlety and skill by Cuaron. Newell instead opted to beat the audience over the head with obnoxious teen movie clichés, and even managed to bring his own lackluster efforts screeching to a halt and loudly bringing us right out of the movie by sticking a glam rock band right in the middle of it all.<br/><br/>Many of the actors seem equally unsure of themselves, which is a typical result of a franchise film by a director who doesn't really ""get it."" The worst of all is Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore, who took over from the brilliant Richard Harris in the last couple of films. While Harris did a fine job of conveying a sense of wisdom, and the ability to reduce the Great Hall to silence while speaking barely in a whisper, there was also a sense that the guy was just too damn old, and it was nice in Azkaban to see a Dumbledore with a bit more of a twinkle in his eye. Here, unfortunately, the twinkle is nowhere to be seen, and in its place we have a hyperactive Dumbledore who yells at the top of his lungs and bodyslams Harry against the wall. He looks like he could unscrew your head and poop down your neck, but he isn't very believable as a grandfatherly, wise old wizard.<br/><br/>In fairness to Newell, though, I don't think that all of the movie's faults were entirely down to him; many of them are to do with J.K. Rowling's original book. Azkaban was by far the best film because it was also the best book out of the ones I read, and it was handled by a director who understood the universe, and was skilled at making both intelligent children's films (such as the highly underrated A Little Princess) as well as more adult fare. I know a lot of Potterites complained about how much of the story he left out, but such is always a dilemma with filmmakers adapting popular books - they have to deal with trying to fit ten pounds of poop into a five-pound bag. Azkaban omitted some details and sub-plots but remained a remarkable film, because, among other reasons, the book was remarkable too. The Goblet of Fire was not so remarkable. In fact, the only thing I remember about that book was that it was even longer than the previous three put together, and the next two that I didn't read were even longer. After all the deeply personal trials faced by Harry in Azkaban, a plot revolving around some wizard Olympics-type contest feels pretty uninteresting in contrast.<br/><br/>There are a few nuggets of gold in this picture. Brendan Gleeson is terrific as ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, which, if you have been following the series, is the teaching position which always ends up being filled by someone who is a little weird. Out of all the child actors, Emma Watson gives the best performance as Hermione, showing a great deal of emotion and character development since her Chris Columbus days, whereas Radcliffe and Grint appear to be having second thoughts about signing on to make these movies for the rest of their youthhoods. Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman do wonderfully as always, and Ralph Fiennes has a brilliantly evil turn as You-Know-Who, whose scene toward the very end is one of the darkest in the whole series. Harry's encounter with the dragon is also quite a nice CGI set-piece. However, as I said before, these are small bits of gold in an otherwise very awkward and lackluster film, a cake which could have baked a lot longer in the plot and characterization oven before pulling it out icing it with CGI gimmicks."

The other part was the music, which to me was not as good as the other 3 movies, maybe the loss of John Williams was the reason.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie had some good attributes. The actors all did very well, and the adult actors especially showed all the class they had even if they had short scenes. Even though all the cast members were fighting for screen time, I thought some of them really stood out. Brandon Gleeson, in his performance as Mad Eye Moody, was quite good, along with Maggie Smith, who as always will always give you fine acting, even though she only had a few minutes of screen time. Likewise, Alan Rickman also stood out in the two scenes he had. I was also impressed by Miranda Richardson's performance as Rita Skeeter, who to me really represented the character in the book superbly.<br/><br/>As for the young actors, they have improved since the first movie. Daniel Radcliffe doesn't seem so wooden anymore, Rupert Grint doesn't look like an idiot Ron and Emma Watson looked sound as a mature Hermione. Matthew Lewis also stood out among the young actors, giving a lot more perspective to Neville, other than the clumsy Neville, which thank goodness he did, because Neville was given perspective by J.K Rowling in Books 4 and 5 and it was important that Lewis showed that.<br/><br/>I was slightly disappointed by Michael Gambon's performance though, as he performed a lot less cooler version of Dumbledore, which to me was a betrayal of the character we love in the books. For example, seeing Dumbledore shaking Harry vigorously to ask whether he put his name in the Goblet of Fire was totally unlike Dumbledore, who is supposed to be cool and calm, and to the point of being cold when angry. Perhaps this could have been the fault of the script, but to me Harris' Dumbledore was perfect and ever since Gambon came in Dumbledore just seemed...more erratic and frantic.<br/><br/>This brings me to the point in the beginning...the script. I felt that Kloves did not do a very good job here, because he had cut out a lot of parts that were vital to either continuity or thrill. I have to take my hat of to Mike Newell, who to me made a miracle when he made the first 15 minutes work. Those 15 minutes involved the Quidditch World Cup, the nightmare and the the Dark Mark work, by getting his actors to act properly to ensure that there are no issues of continuity.<br/><br/>Even then, the dark mark scene did not make sense as leaving Harry alone with Barty Crouch Junior means that Barty Jr could just take Harry and apparate straight to his master and then, Voldemort could use Harry's blood for his return. And what in the heck is he doing at the Quidditch World Cup if he's supposed to be with Voldemort at the time, helping Wormtail take care of him? Another issue of continuity would be the Veritaserum scene where Barty Jr was forced to tell the truth. Barty Jr was supposed to be kissed by a dementor so that Voldemort's rising would still be a secret to the rest of the wizarding world. It looks as though Mira Nair has a lot of work to because now Movie 5 has to explain what happened to old Barty Jr and how Fudge and Dumbledore parted ways, added to the burden of the huge cutting they have to do for Book 5.<br/><br/>I also thought that the edited storyline for the third task was poor. I mean despite all the feeble attempts to make the maze scary, all it basically was wind, blowing around and roots trying to snag Harry and Cedric. Please, this is the third task! The Final Task. No matter how much editing there was to be done, the third task should essentially be more dangerous than the other two tasks. Krum's controlled mind does not count, as it's not part of the third task, but of Barty Jr's imperius curse.<br/><br/>There were a lot more goofs than that, and I could go on all day but, they all point to the storyline. This movie had so much to offer. Marvellous acting, good direction from Newell, good special effects and lots more but it was spoilt by the compressed segmented and ultimately patchy script and editing, but in all accounts this movie has not doomed the franchise, and don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this movie is bad it's still above average, just that it could have been so much better."

","This is the first Harry Potter movie to be directed by a British director. Mike Newell takes the helm , and produces a visual feast of wonderous special effects, and drama. The first three movies, have all been fantastic, and faithfully followed the story, almost to the word. Upon watching ""Goblet of Fire"", I actually found myself being disappointed. From the first scene, there are subtle changes made to the story, so they can keep the film at a reasonable run time. In fairness, the book is almost three times as long as previous ones, so the film could have made the 4 hour mark, however, for those of you that have read the book, will find these ""changes"" quite annoying. It ruined, unfortunately, my enjoyment of the film. But if we gloss over that, and focus on the good points.<br/><br/>This is the first Harry Potter to receive a 12A certificate. So parents, be warned. This is a much MUCH darker outing, in which we see our first student die. It also contains a fair bit of violence, which some younger viewers may find a little bit frightening, including a sacrificial scene which is a bit gruesome. Slightly more naughty language, and some innuendos , as our intrepid young wizards have now reached the age in which hormones start to cause havoc, and they all have one thing on their minds.<br/><br/>We get to see many new characters, including harry's ""love"", Cho Chang (played wonderfully by newcomer Katie Leung). Also, Brendan Gleeson plays the role of eccentric ex-Auror, Professor Alastor Moody, who has some wonderfully amusing, and occasionally dark scenes, which continues to set the scary over-tone of the whole movie. <br/><br/>As with the other Harry Potter movies, the special effects are second to none, including an exhilarating dragon chase around Hogwarts, a fantastically claustrophobic underwater sequence, and then the terrifying maze finalé, in which we get to see, for the first time, Harry's nemesis Lord Voldermort (played by the exceptional Ralph Fiennes) in physical form. Plenty of Brit-actors abound, including the new Doctor Who, David Tennant, appearing as Barty Crouch Jnr, son of Bartemius Crouch (played by Roger Lloyd Pack). Old favourites are back, including Ginny, Fred & George, Hagrid & Neville. <br/><br/>Another one of the reasons why I didn't like this movie so much, was the fact John Williams was not providing the music. I was devastated. John Williams made Harry Potter, with his fantastic haunting tracks, which really dragged you into the world of Muggles, Wizards and quidditch. Patrick Doyle provides the music for this one, and I am happy to say, he does it justice. We do get hints of the famous ""Hedwigs Theme"" throughout, as well as being treated to Jarvis Cocker singing some rock music for the Yule Ball, including ""Can you dance like a hippogriff"". Wonderful. <br/><br/>I was quite disappointed we didn't actually get to see any of the quidditch action from the World Cup, or the fact we only get to see Harry battle the dragon, or Harry performing the second task, etc. It would have been great to see a little bit of the other guys, but once again, I was left feeling unsatisfied. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, as most of the book is cut out, some people may be left feeling a little confused, or unfulfilled. The Duresleys are unfortunately missing from the movie, as well as Mrs Weasley, and the two new weasleys that we meet in the book, Bill & Charlie. But this aside, if I was to look at the film as a stand-alone action packed kids film, I would say I loved it. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and the special effects are breath-taking, and really helped you get into the whole swing of things. <br/><br/>But being a fan of the book, and as an adaptation of such a great book, I didn't like it so much. It could have been so much more. I was quite happy to sit through 3 and a half hours of Lord of the Rings, and I'd be just has happy to sit through the same with Harry Potter. Maybe at some point, their might be some kind of Extended Version, with never-before seen footage... who knows. <br/><br/>On the whole, its an enjoyable film, and as its near Christmas, will keep the little ones quiet. May I just offer one piece of advice to those who have read the book. Forget what happens in the book. Go see the film with a clear frame of mind, and you will enjoy it more."
"sirwootalot","5","0","0","20 November 2005"," Good and Bad at the same time...
","I had VERY mixed feelings after watching Goblet of Fire. As someone who's nuts over the books, I highly disagreed with the direction the director pushed the movie in. The movie would have been SO much better (perfect even) if, instead of piling on joke after joke about the yule ball and hollywoodishly (is that even a word?) over-dramatizing the first task, things more central to the overall plot were included - the introduction of Bill Weasley, some buildup to the excitement of seeing the quidditch world cup, actually SHOWING the quidditch world cup itself instead of just the opening (which was in itself very flawed compared to the book), Hagrid's blast-ended skrewts, Rita Skeeter's Animagus status, the Sphinx in the final task, etc etc. Not saying I didn't laugh at the jokes (ron saying ""bloody hell"" at the beauxbatons' entrance sticks out), or that I didn't appreciate the amazing visual effects - just that I wish the movie focused more on the rest of the story than the yule ball. oh, and I forgot to mention, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort is simply ingenious. I couldn't even begin to imagine someone who could play the part better, and his appearance was EXACTLY how I imagined Voldemort would look. Overall, it's still an entertaining movie and definitely worth your money; but it seems like it was made for the people who have only seen the movies and never read the books."
"Admirison","7","0","0","19 November 2005"," Better than others, but too cut down
","While ""Goblet"" has some fantastic moments, to be certain, those moments feel compacted together where they shouldn't be. Anyone who has read the book will know what I mean when I say that the movie was a bare-bones coverage of the book's events. A lot of the characters we could as book readers grow to either love or hate are all but glossed over or given short details in which director Mike Newell seems to rely upon prior knowledge of them from reading J.K. Rowling's series for us to understand them. Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter (though well-portrayed by actress Miranda Richardson) is one such case of sad underusage, as are the other Triwizard competitors (Robert Pattinson's Cedric Diggory, Clémence Poésy's Fleur Delacour, and Stanislav Ianevski's nonetheless fantastically brooding Viktor Krum), while characters such as Bertha Jorkins, Ludo Bagman, and Winky the house-elf, pivotal to the events of the book, are entirely absent.<br/><br/>While it is quite understandable that some events that occurred in the over 700-page novel would have needed trimming, lest ""Goblet of Fire"" run ten hours long, it feels like all but the very bare-bones of the plot - the dangerous Triwizard Tournament and the disastrous Yule Ball - were completely stripped away, leaving the movie seeming as though it lacks a real driving plot. The more major events of the book are thrown out in quick succession with almost no explanatory backstory motivating them, where Newell again relies on familiarity with Rowling's book series.<br/><br/>There are some bright glimmers in the fabric, though. The battle between Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and the Hungarian Horntail, while completely deviant from the book, was done in a way that had the entire audience of the movie theater I was attending on the edges of their fold-up seats, the infamous ""second challenge"" with the grindylows and merpeople underwater was excellently executed without too much reliance upon CGI monsters, and the climactic confrontation between the evil Lord Voldemort (a deliciously evil Ralph Fiennes) and Harry, with Peter ""Wormtail"" Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), Lucius Malfoy (the as-always appropriately greasy Jason Isaacs), and the rest of the evil Ku Klux Klansmen-esquire Death Eaters looking on was sharp and emotional in the wake of Diggory's murder and well-made out of a particularly confusing scene in the book.<br/><br/>Radcliffe, portraying Harry, has clearly improved from his previous appearances. Emma Watson, portraying his friend Hermione, is still rather wooden in a lot of scenes but does have her moments. Rupert Grint, who plays Harry's other friend, Ron Weasley, is still the best of the leading trio, capturing the essence of Ron admirably. Brendan Gleeson as Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody was surprisingly good, far outclassing my dismal predictions of how he would come off from the previews I'd seen, while Predrag Bjelac made a fine appearance as the sinister Igor Karkaroff.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some other things about the movie rubbed me the wrong way. The people behind this film seemed to be trying a little too hard to romantically connect Harry and Hermione and downplay the sexual tension in the book between Hermione and Ron conversely, though this might have just been my imagination. Cedric Diggory was portrayed as an arrogant jerk rather than the noble, self-downplaying young man of Rowling's book, which served to make his eventual death much less impacting (save for in the case of the a few sobbing young ladies in the audience, which I can't really seem to find a way to explain personally). Very little of Harry's ordinary school life, dodging strict professors and exchanging heated volleys with melodramatic Divination teacher Professor Trelawney (completely absent from the film, unfortunately) and visiting the wizarding village of Hogsmeade, was shown. The third challenge of the hedge maze was sadly dumbed-down, but with so much that challenged our hero in the book version absent (most noticeably Hagrid's vicious Blast-Ended Skrewts, which I sorely missed for some inexplicable reason) it hardly had any alternative to being a strange magical version of ""The Fog"", but inside a giant maze. And perhaps most importantly, the usual emphasis on the magic of the Harry Potter world was, by and large, completely absent.<br/><br/>""Goblet"" was more dark and gritty than typically charming, which is appropriate for its subject matter, but it feels still somehow unfinished, and as if it showed us snapshots of the fourth year at Hogwarts and somehow tried to make them indicative of the only events that occurred. For overall good acting and a lessened reliance on spectacle, as well as its daring in breaking the old formula, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" earns a 7/10 for me and a recommendation to go see it. Just make sure you've read the book already, and don't be expecting everything.<br/><br/>And yes, I did get shivery goosebumps every time the name ""Voldemort"" was mentioned in this film. You may consider me impressed with the movie's portrayal of the villains, certainly."

","OK this film is good... very good. it is simply stunning to look at, the visual richness is breathtaking in places.<br/><br/>the acting, from some of the younger stars in particular, is not worthy of any Oscars shall we say but, looking back over the other films so far you can easily see the improvement of the young stars with age. They all seem to carry of their roles successfully, with a fairly accurate amount of teenage awkwardness and the newcomers fit in quite well look out for the gorgeous Robert pattinson(Cedric diggory). The more adult actors all help pull the film together, a special mention for Brendan gleeson who is great as mad eye. oh and another special mention for David tennant (soooooooooo gorgeous).<br/><br/>but, one can't help feeling that there are many things missing, especially if you've read the book, i can understand that they had to do it this way to get it in on a reasonable run time but, you can't help but, feel let down.<br/><br/>all in all it is a great film and i would recommend it to everyone, may i just mention that it is that bit darker than the others so parents with young children beware.<br/><br/>oh and all these rumours that are going round... having watched the film the word f**k does not occur. Ron says p**s but, thats about it.<br/><br/>so yeah go see it and enjoy."

","Months before the movie came out I knew that molly weasly was not going to be featured in this film and was disappointed. So much was cut from the book. It would be extremely confusing to someone who has not read the book. So if you have not read the book I suggest reading the book before watching the movie. Long book yes...but if you have time on ur hands and are a fast reader like myself you should be done with it in about a week. It took me 3 days :P. I was also upset that they cut out the scene where Sirius Black and Harry met up in dumbledores office after the maze. I was really looking forward to that scene. The only scene Sirius had was when he appeared in the fireplace. They really sped up though the whole movie and didn't explain much through it. Perhaps Order of the Phoenix will be better *crosses fingers*. Read The Book if you have not already done so before seeing the movie."

","All the Harry Potter movies are very good, but this is by far my favorite. The acting was as great as it has always been, the special effects were brilliant, and all the tasks were done very well. One of the major improvements I found was the humor. ""Goblet of Fire"" is funnier then the first three movies put together. The fourth movie is also more mature then the first three, as is the book. It's interesting, not to mention hilarious, to watch the characters turn from children into young adults. Daniel Radcliffe has given his fourth outstanding performance, and has also become a great deal more mature himself. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" deserves four stars and 10 out of 10 points! It was an absolutely brilliant movie!"
"noni4eva7","6","0","0","20 November 2005"," Best of the films so far.
","As far as I can see, this film far outstrips the previous ones for sheer entertainment. Unlike the others it does not drag, or have numerous tedious lulls. It may not stick as closely to the book as some readers may have wished but it benefits, as well as suffers, as a consequence.<br/><br/>We see the story played out before us, all of the book-readers knowing the inevitable outcome but still praying that somehow the film will be different from the book. The build-up throughout the film works. It is as simple as that. We reach initial climaxes that would fool the then unknowing into a false sense of security. This makes the ending all the more powerful. But amongst the grief, there is also an element of humour that was far from present in the other films. As 'The Prisoner of Askaban' was hailed as the darker, more sinister and 'better' film in comparison with its predecessors, I think this film turns out to be that ten times over and more, to the entire series so far.<br/><br/>Without spoilers it is hard to describe the plot, but as much as could possibly be contained in a short, child-friendly film, was there. This meant that, although there was always something happening, there were rather too many times where plot threads were started and discarded within minutes, leaving the audience feeling disconcerted and even cheated. An obvious example is the introduction of reporter Rita Skeeter early on - we wait for fireworks and all we get is Harry reading the paper, looking a tad p**sed off at the article and then turning to have a conversation with someone. But the film definitely had pace because of these additions and was an entertaining couple of hours. I would recommend it to all die-hard HP fans, as well as haters - as this is the only film of the series so far that might change their minds. In short: entertaining, though flawed, superior Harry Potter film.<br/><br/>(Note to those with small children: the film does contain some scenes that would frighten young/young but not tiny children. As a measure (and without spoilers) there are a couple of scenes during which I felt it necessary to cover my thirteen year old brother's eyes.)"

","This book is one of my favorite in the Harry Potter series. The movie cut out much of it, understandably. The special effects were amazing, and what part of the story they put in was tolerable, with a couple of exceptions. For example, where on earth did they find Dumbledore!?! He is NOT the Dumbledore in the books, not even close. Where is the powerful, yet kind and soft spoken man that watches over Harry, and all the students at Hogwarts? This man is harsh, loud, and unforgiving. There were also some key script changes, especially in the last scene with Voldermort, that completely changed the plot of the story. In the end it was entertaining if you are tolerant to the script changes and a ghastly Dumbledore."

","This movie was horrible. I enjoy Harry Potter. I love the books, and the movies up to date. However, this one was not up to par. I understand that this book is rather long, and that the plot needed to be trimmed for the movie. However, it seemed a bit extreme. I thought that the movie lacked continuity. It seemed to skip around from scene to scene without trying to tie anything together. There was none of the little details. The idea seemed to be to hit you over the head with highlights and hope for the best. Furthermore, several times in the movie, it seemed that they just hoped you read the book, because they made no effort to explain crucial details. Overall, the movie was found wanting."

","The Harry Potter franchise, an exponential phenomenon since film one, doesn't fail to dazzle and delight with it's newest installment. To put it simply, the film is fun, full of palpable teenage dilemmas and nightmarish threats from the true forces of evil.<br/><br/>It lacks the emotional strength that drove ""Azkaban"", opting instead to present a foe that isn't covered in any Hogwarts classroom - a problem that no fourth year student is eager to deal with - puberty. In between action scenes, which are part of a traditional magic tournament of champions, our heroes fight awkward moments with the opposite sex. Harry stumbles upon his words as he attempts to ask Cho Chang to the school dance. And just like in real life, the girls seem to have it all figured out before the boys. As ""After School Specially"" that this may seem, the moments are broken up well, so we're not overwhelmed with embarrassing memories from our childhood.<br/><br/>The nightmare comes in the form of Voldemort, the evil wizard and leader of a gang known as the ""Death Eaters"". Voldemort - a disembodied nemesis thus-far, chills us with his slimy hissing voice. It isn't until this film that we finally see the real face of this creature, who happens to be Ralph Feinnes, and part of the eeriness disappears. The threat is eminent, but the mystery is gone, and once you look in your closet - the monster isn't so scary.<br/><br/>It's a fair adaptation (this having been my favorite book up until ""Half Blood Prince"") and proves worthy to stand in the library, but the emotional arc of Harry Potter seems to get lost in the picture somewhere. If this film was able to contain that fragile theme of being alone in the world, it would have been my favorite, but ""Azkaban"" wins that prize."
"looneyxav","5","0","0","19 November 2005"," not as good as it should have been
","I just watched it this afternoon, and I was not impressed. Of course, it looks good and polished and everything, but there are flaws in the story and in the filming of it. I never read about films before seeing them, and I do this so that I don't go into the theater with expectations of what the film is supposed to be, except that I expect it to be well-made at the very least. This film suffers from technical problems which frankly should not be an issue in a film like this: it has a massive budget and an experienced team. Now by technical problems I means issues of continuity from one shot to the next (specifically, after Dumbledore greets the Beaux-Batons headmistress and then hops up for his speech) and computer graphics simply not looking right (when Harry returns after losing the Hungarian dragon and flies over the crowd, and Krum under the effects of the shark-head spell). These types of things bothered me a great deal. The story aspect of the film I can forgive because this is a massive story to condense into a film. In the end however, the movie feels incomplete, as if there are gaps that should have been filled but weren't. The movie is unable to stand by itself as a story: the viewer needs to have read the book to know completely what is happening. And n my opinion, this is a weakness. Overall, I found this film to be mediocre. I think it could have been better made by another director."

","I really don't get why this movie got an 8.2 out of ten. There is so many awful things to say I don't even know where to start! First of all, the whole thing seemed rushed, although it was better than the previous ones, but there was still something about it that seemed like they were trying to get through it all in time. This also made it seem like it took place in a really short amount of time, much less than a year. But if that was the case? Why did they have so many extra bits? Like the graveyard dream? Or the AWFUL scene where the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang people came into the hall, or the whole flying all over Hogwarts fighting the badly done dragon scene. And they cut so many good parts, like Rita being an Animagus. Plus, they seemed to want to save money by cutting Dobby, the Dursleys, and Mrs. Weasley from the movie Another thing was the LOTR-esquire scene with the music and everything. Oh, and the hero- ifying harry. JK Rowling does that enough in the books. Like having Harry be the only witness to the dark mark? It just seems like they're making him into an even more wonderful, wildly talented saintly person then he really is. Having said all that, I really liked Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory, and I adored Ron and the Weasley twins (of course). And this was, hands down, the best HP movie, which says a lot about the other three (what I thought of them, anyway)."

He's certainly grew up- he's tall, thinner and attracting the girls. Same for Rupert. The pasty skin boy is tall and gorgeous with his longer hair. Newcomer Katie Leung excelled. The girl who played Fleur was good at her Frech accent-or is she actually French? I don't know! Think twice about taking young children- there is mild threat,horror and swearing.

","Don't know where to start, cuz if I start the wrong place I'll write a couple of pages, or just end up with a few lines. <br/><br/>Mind the holes when speeding! <br/><br/>The plot is off course very much like in the novel. The differences is the speed with which we are dragged through the story, and one understands if we keep the lenght of the book in mind. There are few important plot holes, but most are nicely filled in and the story goes along as we remember it. The many holes would be a huge minus if Kloves and Newell, hadn't managed to put all the things together without jeopardizing the storyline, and yet move things around. The speed on the other hand is a huge minus. I was left with the feeling that there had to be more. <br/><br/>Going for the throat <br/><br/>A huge plus is the acting, I was very positively surprised with the young actors: Dan, Emma, Rupert and co. They have all evolved into good actors. Dan really pulls every aspect of being Harry Potter off brilliantly and Emma proves those who thought she couldn't be Hermione wrong. Brendan Gleeson is crazy and wonderful as ever, Alan Rickman still deserves more screen time, Miranda Richardson is just awful, which in this case is good. The bad acting are found in places one may not expect to find it. Michael Gambon is, by name, a solid actor, yet he fare from pulls of a Dumbledore one will grow to love. He gives some of his lines good, but seems to forget that the body also tells a story. Who has ever seen Dumbledore go for Harry's Throat, literally. Ralph Fiennes is not bad in this picture he is just wrong. He plays Voldemort more as a pompous jerk than the more nonchalant dark lord I imagine him to be. A role I know Fiennes to be great in. <br/><br/>The good news <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is where you begin to se the differences between books and films. Not that you couldn't see it in the prior three movies. But now they have learned the universe to know, and know where to cut something and add something. And still it remains a little bit more loyal to the book than Prisoner of Azkaban. If you like me go to the movies to see a movie based on a novel, Goblet of Fire is just wonderful. It is a story set in this universe and it is given information of the background and through the text and image of who people are. Goblet of Fire gives most of the story in words and action, but still remains loyal to the book, by using small informations in the background and the pictures we are shown. They have like in PoA instead of cutting the film into several short scenes in a row, tried to bind everything together through longer scenes. The visual sides takes from PoA and thus have the same gloomy and dark fell to it. The tones are at points almost grey and death, yet the highly coloured world of Rowling gives it life. We see a huge development in the characters. Harry and Hermione are very deep persons with a lot of feelings that are shown in numerous ways. Those two characters are, along with Ron some times, the most interesting characters, and these two roles are very well filled. The best about this movies is that it really works well. We don't sit with the same feeling as PoA could bring: ""but what about...?"". It is more complete and enjoyable for those not familiar with the books I imagine. And even more so for us who knows them.<br/><br/>The Bad News <br/><br/>Again we see a very pathetic Ron, unaware of others, and what they feel, and that have been turned into a joke, along with his already humorous lines. Right in the middle of the film there are five minutes of sheer laughs, all centering around Ron. This is a shame, especially since Rupert shows in the more sensitive scenes, and more serious scenes that he can handle it. He says it himself: ""just Harry Potters stupid friend"" Dumbledore has really become aggressive in his old days, and a bad actor too. I once knew a Dumbledore calm and at ease, he would present himself as calm to the world and still be able to show emotion through actions. But he would never go for Harry Potters throat. He yells and hits, and even goes to become almost depressed at one point. It is what he feels. And you know what? For a guy one and a half century old, he can really move, running and jumping around, reminding one about Yoda. A thing also brought into Voldemort, as great as Voldemort looks, he for me brings images of Darth Mauls into mind, in his way of moving. The ballet-touch is overdone and didn't even fit in to Star Wars in the first place. Why should Voldemort then move like a dancer?<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>I see I started the wrong place!!!"
"ghanta051","8","0","0","18 November 2005"," This Movie should have shown in 2 parts to enjoy fully
","first, i want to make it clear that the movie didn't fulfill my expectations i have after reading the book. <br/><br/>Now if you look at the plus points of the movie, Then it had managed some scenes gr8.<br/><br/>for e.g the three tasks (These tasks had somewhat change from the books.) Still 1st(dragons) and 2nd(under water) have some similarity but the 3rd task (maze) don't have any magical creatures as mentioned in book. It could have made it more interesting. Instead of this they have shown changing position of walls(this effect is also thrilling).<br/><br/>The yule ball is nicely presented. Also the movie have some good little scenes. Like the portkey use in starting, the weasley brothers Fred and George trying to enter there names in goblet of fire....etc.<br/><br/>In the end, the graveyard scene is gr8. especially the return of the dark lord.Its covered rushly but still its thrilling(but it does not mark harry's courage as it is in book). The dark mark appearing in sky is shown gr8.<br/><br/>If you look at negative points then....<br/><br/>In starting Barty Crouch junior is shown with voldemort which is not there in book (It is considerable change b coz everything cannot be shown shown in movie as in book but it decreases suspense which is crated by J K Rowling in book) but the movie doesn't give much information about him in which one will be interested .<br/><br/>one would have loved to see the Quidditch final match-the only Quidditch match in 4th part (in movie there is only intro. part of match). Also the scene of death eaters at campsite is literally rolled up. End of movie is hastily made to finish off movie in time limit.<br/><br/>Also Dumbledore is shown like a psychic person-out of control. He never shown shouted at harry in books but in movie he is shouting at harry after selection of champions. The book readers will never like to see him like this. Mad eye moody is comic here but its OK since it makes laugh for the moment.<br/><br/>there is no scope for different characters to develop themselves in this movie. for e.g there is no sign of Cedric being a good,helpful person which is shown in book at the end of 3rd task.Also not for Ron an Hermione.(especially Hermione...she never shown helping harry in spells ,etc.) this b coz director has to convert 700 pages book to movie. but it makes movie less interesting as it cuts many things from book. <br/><br/>Instead of this i would have like to see movie in TWO PARTS releasing them back to back. So that the story can be presented more effectively, in more details. true HP fans would have like it. IN this manner I think 1st part should have up to Yule ball and 2nd should have started from 2nd task. This could have shown movie in good details. <br/><br/>The 4th book of HP is my favorite one and i have expected Best potter movie on it. but this movie didn't fulfill my expectations. Still it had shown gr8 all the 3 tasks and returning of Lord voldemort,etc so i am rating it as 8/10(though i don't expect such cutting in next films). <br/><br/>After all, i can tell you to watch this movie at least once and enjoy it for 3 tasks and voldemort."
"cruciatus","8","0","0","19 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Kick Butt.
","This review has spoilers, but we're all Harry Potter fans and have read the books, RIGHT? So read on! My review's blunt. Just to tell you now.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire felt rushed in the beginning, but once you get to the end, you realize that the movie was actually way too long. Things that really didn't matter were discarded and rightfully so, unlike in POA where the Marauders were completely overlooked. The problem with GOF is that the actors had schizophrenic performances.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe comes out like a true actor in this movie by extending his spectrum of emotions. Ron is also no longer the stupid comic relief character, his character is given more depth and Rupert does a great job at it. Emma's acting declined in my opinion, her crying wasn't very convincing and she cried too often that it lost its' affect. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is something that I've always had a problem with, Dumbledore comes across as a senile and emotionally unstable old man. If I was Harry Potter, I would NOT feel safe at Hogwarts, especially with Voldemort and a crew of Death Eaters coming after me. Dumbledore's character, in my opinion, is suppose to put the students and the readers of the books at ease because no matter who horrible things get, Dumbledore is always watching carefully over the children. In this movie, Dumbledore was just ... um, no.<br/><br/>There is hardly any Snape, McGonaggal, Sirius, the Slytherins, etc. etc. and that was disappointing because there's no variety at Hogwarts. Beauxbatons and Durmstrang's appearance was great, though very limited. Krum had a whopping two lines, Fleur had one and a half with some sobs in between, and Cedric grinned his way through most of the scenes. The main focus is the trio, Mad Eye, and Voldemort. Brandon Gleeson as Moody works just fine, but I did imagine him as a thinner man, considering he's an auror and fought dark wizards.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, the most dramatic performance is from the actor who portrays Amos Diggory. At the end, after Cedric dies and Harry brings his body back to Hogwarts, his few, but very striking lines: ""My boy! That's my boy!"" and his tortured sobs really struck me hard. I wasn't moved by Daniel's crying, just like in POA, I thought he was laughing for a second. But Amos Diggory's actor definitely effectively radiates the anguish of a father who has just lost his only son.<br/><br/>The rock concert at the Yule Ball ... um, no. It takes away from the majestic-ness of Hogwarts Castle and the traditional and classic feel of a great hall made of stone with high ceilings and fantastic glass windows. Plus, none of the actor could dance.<br/><br/>The music was fantastic as was the special effects. I noticed a lot of similarities to the Lord of the Rings in terms of music, special effects, and scenery but that's a good thing because LOTR was an amazing movie. The movie's strongest scenes were the graveyard scenes, only because the creepiness of Voldemort and his KKK looking death eaters DEMANDS your attention. I was surprised to see a Harry's arm cut open like that, but it amused me because I saw a lot of little kids squirming in the audience, heh heh. The death eaters were creepy, just as they should be. Very very creepy. Run, Harry, run.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire has an epic feel to it, it shows more than just Hogwarts, but gives the audience a wider view of the wizarding world. I definitely recommend this movie, even though I had some critical opinions, I DID enjoy the movie and I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. Cheers!"
"druss44121-1","5","0","0","18 November 2005"," it coulda been better... shockingly better!
","Beware Potter fans for I am about to speak utter blasphemy: I was bitterly disappointed with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>Okay, so I'll be fair, it is not that bad of a film. However, after already three films in this franchise some things begin to get too annoying to ignore.<br/><br/>For example, why is it that in every Potter film all the most important story points happen in a dingy room with Harry talking to some evil character we thought was on his side but was really evil all along, or vice-versa? And why is this always interrupted at just the right moment by the forces of the good guys? Also infuriating is that a lot of the minor characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts that take away from the impression that the Harry Potter universe is a fully magical world with living, breathing inhabitants.<br/><br/>For example, there is the Daily Prophet writer Rita Skeeter who is pretty much the same exact annoying character as Gilderoy Lockhart from the second film. She is a sensationalist liar full of her own arrogance.<br/><br/>Most of the villains of Harry Potter are just as shallow, too, fitting the old stereotype of evil being ugly and good being attractive.<br/><br/>Also, it has been said before but I will repeat it again: a film must stand on its own.<br/><br/>This particularly crippled Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with the scene in the Shrieking Shack, as a lot of plot points were brushed over and everything became very unclear. Here the problem lies more in many of the little details that are vague or never explained.<br/><br/>For an epic film some of the spectacle is ignored, too.<br/><br/>Near the beginning there is a huge Quidditch match where one of the main characters, Viktor Krum, is introduced. However, as soon as the match is about to begin we are suddenly whisked away in time to the partying afterwards.<br/><br/>Would it have killed anyone to show a little bit of the match so we could at least get a feel for how great a Quidditch seeker Viktor Krum is while also getting a little bit of nifty action? The biggest disappointment, though, is a case where entirely too much is shown. Now, I am treading into minor spoiler territory here so read carefully.<br/><br/>After three movies, Voldemort is finally revealed.<br/><br/>Here we are supposed to discover the essence of wickedness but instead we find an Oscar nominated actor in some very silly make-up. As good as Ralph Fiennes is, here he looks like an aquatic fish-man.<br/><br/>Worse, though, is the fact that this evil villain is nothing new. He spouts nonsensically that Harry Potter will die, that he will get his power back, that his henchman are not loyal enough, that he will finish the job he began, that blah blah blah.<br/><br/>We've heard it all before. Why are you boring me when you should be threatening me? Not everything is a missed opportunity, though.<br/><br/>The very beginning is wonderfully creepy and Voldemort really seems threatening and mysterious (the two things he loses in his climatic appearance.) Also, the introduction of the death eaters is downright awesome and the images etched in the sky with smoke are suitably sinister and foreboding.<br/><br/>Overall the visual style that new director Mike Newell gives this fourth outing is beautiful and memorable, and this is probably the most spectacular Potter yet.<br/><br/>The main fault of Newell is that his pacing is somewhat clunky, as some scenes drag on too long while others are cut woefully short.<br/><br/>Thankfully the romance between Harry and friends is not nearly as sappy or overdone as feared, though some of it comes off as a little rushed and the Goth-rock band playing at the Yule Ball seemed hilariously out of place.<br/><br/>In the end, if you are a Potter fan you have probably already seen this blockbuster film and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>However, for the rest of us there might be the discovery that beneath all the pretty colors and classic themes of good and evil lays an unoriginal story cobbled together by elements of other fables in search of that extra something that could be called magic.<br/><br/>Critic's Conclusion: Already an epic hit, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a rousing action adventure full of both spectacle and many holes. Ultimately hollow at the center despite visual beauty, the pacing is sometimes maddening and by the end it is hard not to be disappointed, at least if you're not infatuated with Harry Potter."
"akjensen","7","0","0","19 November 2005"," Entertaining, but it's not the book...
","I think, had I not read the books already (and, mind you, I read them all in between seeing HP3 and this film), I would have enjoyed the movie more. The special effects are as spectacular as one would expect, but there is no meat on these bones. All the major plot lines from the book are diluted or left entirely out of the movie. One can't expect a 6 hour movie, but it feels more like Cliff's Notes with a few major special effects sequences thrown in.<br/><br/>One more parting shot: Michael Gambon does a poor Albus Dumbledore. I don't know what happened to him between this and the last film, but in some scenes, he takes away from the stoic, greatest wizard ever aura that is tantamount to the character. He was an impostor.<br/><br/>So, all in all, it was entertaining, but it did not live up to the hype that is Harry Potter."
"ari-25","6","0","0","19 November 2005"," Too condensed
","This movie was the only Potter movie to disappoint so far. It's not that the directing wasn't great. It's just that, in order to cram that big book into a Hollywood time frame, too much had to be dropped. Moreover, the background scenes in the beginning had a choppy look to them--it almost felt like they were going through with a razor blade and shaving off frames at the end of it to make their time. The overall effect was far too choppy to quite enjoy as much as I have the last few. Even the climactic scenes just felt like they never quite resolved. The director should have just split them up into two movies like he was originally intending. Besides, that way they'd make twice as much money."
"kasi-4","7","0","0","19 November 2005"," The quality of the Potter-movies improves by the number.
","The Prisoner of Azkaban was already a positive surprise in the series of Potter-movies. The stories keep improving in The Goblet of Fire. <br/><br/>The movie was more consistent than it's predecessors and a bit surprisingly the length of the movie was not a hindrance (even though it perhaps lingered a bit in the first act). <br/><br/>The only (ongoing) sad part is that Radcliffe really hasn't improved. It would seem that the director has tried to cover for Radcliffe's shortcomings, but still in the perhaps most touching scene of the movie, it was Radcliffe's performance that prevented it from appealing to me in the slightest. If only he'd learn how to relax and throw himself in the role (there were a few things he did quite well). <br/><br/>Apart from that, the movie was quite entertaining. <br/><br/>ps. What happened to John Williams?!"
"donk-12","5","0","0","19 November 2005"," Good Movie, but not worthy of JKRowlings
","Having read the books (unlike many of the Reviewers with GOOD REVIEWS) I am sorely disappointed. Yes, it is impossible to completely put a long written book into a movie, as has been proved countless times in the past. But, like Tolkien and the upcoming CSLewis ""Narnia"" series, you had better at least stay true to the books. Not so here. A pretty movie, when you can follow it, but poorly adapted by Director Newell and Screenwriter Klove absolutely missed on most of movie, Hitting the mark mostly on some brilliant show with the ball (dance), and a nice underwater scene. Fair graveyard scene.<br/><br/>Acting good when small interpersonals with the main 3 (Harry, Ron, Hermione)and well done for the Weasly twins. Mad Eye Moody GOOD!, <br/><br/>Lord Valdemort played scary, yet played down, no-one really seems to fear him as before, which will not play well to a sequel in Harry Potter's next movie (5). <br/><br/>However, Dumbledore has absolutely lost his charm, wisdom and much likability in this incarnation. <br/><br/>With the choppy editing, loss of continuity, Outright story changes, and dropping of important minor characters, leave too much to be desired. Movie relied too much on visuals, yet left feeling outright robbed of a great story.<br/><br/>Maybe this should have been a 2 part movie as was suggested earlier. This seemed rushed at best, and kind of a let down.<br/><br/>Help JK Rowling, please come to our rescue!"
"obsessedchikee","9","0","0","18 November 2005"," Better than the others!
","When asked what I thought about Goblet of Fire, I responded, ""Better than the others, and I loved them!"" Mike Newell did a fantastic job! The movie opens quickly, jumping right into the action. Within the first fifteen minutes, we've experienced Harry's nightmare, the Quidditch World Cup, the Dark Mark, and the Hogwarts Express. Not once did I feel like the movie should have been moving along faster.<br/><br/>Our child stars get better and better as each movie comes along. Daniel Radcliffe's Harry is perfect, just who I envision now when reading the books. Emma Watson as Hermione shines as the know-it-all friend and Rupert Grint has traded in the whinyness and is developing into a wonderful comic figure.<br/><br/>New supporting cast, Stanislav Ianevski, Robert Pattinson, Clemence Poesy, and Katie Leung fit perfectly into the Potter world. To me it felt as if they belonged at Hogwarts and had been there all along, just hiding somewhere behind the camera in the last three movies.<br/><br/>A star-studded British cast embodies the Hogwarts professors, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltraine, Sir Michael Gambon, and Brendan Gleeson amongst others.<br/><br/>If I could choose one thing that didn't seem to fit, it would be Sir Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. He was far too aggressive. In the scene following the announcement of the champions, he becomes rather violent, cornering Harry against the wall and getting up in his face. Very out of character and in my opinion, a bad choice.<br/><br/>Stunning visual effects subtly fill this movie, never out of place, but never taking over the story. Gone are the miserable days of the hideous centaur creation from Sorceror's(Philosopher's) Stone.<br/><br/>And finally, with a British director comes British humor, dry, witty, and wonderful. I never expected that I would spend so much time laughing in such a dark movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line? Good enough to see again.<br/><br/>And again.<br/><br/>And again."
"Discfreak","6","0","0","18 November 2005"," Good enough movie, but all action, no intrigue
","First off, I will say I enjoyed goblet of fire. If I wasn't a fan of the books I'd probably give this and easy 8 or nine as the movie moves along nicely, the plot is fun and entertaining, the special effects are exciting and splendid in a few places, all in all an exciting and enjoyable film. <br/><br/>What really disappointed me was that in the process of paring down a nearly 800 page novel into a manageable film the director and screenwriter left us with all plot and no intrigue. No suspense. No mystery. These aspects are what make Harry Potter special, and especially in this book as we are constantly wondering -who is the culprit?<br/><br/>This movie never gives us time to stop and wonder, just keeps shoving the plot along, full speed ahead. The movie opens with Harry and Ron asleep in their beds at the Weasly's, groggy and disoriented as Hermione wakes them. They are rushed out of bed to go who knows where to do who knows what. That is exactly how this movie left me feeling. The audience is grabbed by the scruff of the neck and thrust head first through a portkey. While the navel-jerking, head spinning ride through space-time that magic allows can be exhilarating, it leaves one breathless and at a loss for one's surroundings. Not exactly the mark of good film making, in my opinion."

","It was amazing.O my gawd!!!!!!! It is definitely the best Potter movie thus far. I was very pleased how they dealt with the length of the book. There is so much to put in one movie. I had no idea that they could pull it off so well. Obviously, there is a lot of information and sub plot lines missing, but that is to be expected. Honestly, the movie made me want to re-read all the books again for the umpteenth time!!!!!!<br/><br/>The opening moves along quickly as does the storyline throughout the length of the movie. There are very few slow moments really at all in the movie; yet as a viewer, you still can find time to take a look at the wizarding world around you and take it all in.I was very pleased with the cemetery scene and the emotions it provoked. Talking about emotions, Ron and Hermione are already figuring out the obvious mutual attraction between them. Also, there are more humorous moments in this film compared to the other three (the Malfoy/ferret scene and plenty of fun moments with all the dancing and so many more).<br/><br/>One of the first things you notice about the movie is how much all the actors have grown up!craziness... I feel Dumbledore has lost his spark a bit though; it was not one of Michael Gambon's finer moments, but all is not lost. The rest of the cast seems to be in top shape! Overall, it was great! And I know you are probably going to see it anyway if you have seen the last three...so go now!It is all about Harry growing up and you-know -who coming back!"

","Okay, let's face it- if they were true to the book, I would *still* be at the theatre watching the movie, 7 hours after it started. There is a ton of stuff cut from the book, some plot changes, and my favorite scene wasn't in it, but overall this movie is one I liked a lot more than Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>My company was able to set up a special sneak preview the day before the official US opening (and charged about 1/3 the normal price for a ticket, go eat your hearts out :-) ). About 200 of us were there and I don't think there was anyone there who went away unhappy.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow: PLOT SUMMARY: Harry Potter is now in his 4th year at Hogwarts. After attending the World Quidditch Cup Championship with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger, he finds himself entered into the TriWizard Tournament as the fourth entrant of three, and three years to young to have entered except through some mysterious means. With knowledge of the first task in the tournament and a hint from new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, Harry is able to complete his task against a dragon. Fellow 4th year Gryffindor Student Neville Longbottom assists in the second task with key information after Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts Champion, returns Harry the favor of telling him what the task involves. And both Cedric and Harry finish the third task, just to find out that nothing they have faced in the tourney has prepared them for ""He Who Must Not Be Named"".<br/><br/>Minuses- Not one minute of Quidditch. Rita Skeeter being relegated to a bit part and her ultimate fate from the book not even hinted at. The S.P.E.W. subplot not mentioned. The lack of Dobby. No train ride home.<br/><br/>Plusses- The Quidditch Stadium for the World Cup. The Weasley twins attempt to enter the tournament. Professor Moody's lesson with Malfoy. The dragons, or, in particular, Harry's dragon. Voldemort's reconstitution. The shock of the crowd and Amos Diggory when his son is returned, dead. Dumbledore's attack on Barty Crouch Jr.<br/><br/>If you have never read the book(s), this will be a great movie. If you have read the books, you will feel a little cheated because all of the fabulous interweaving of threads from book to book (and within the book) are lost simply due to the constraints of the medium. Part of the wonder of the books is to see something in one book that goes back two or three books as almost a throwaway line or aside; I am afraid that in a future movie that tie-in lack will cause a problem.<br/><br/>Of all the new characters, Madame Maxime did not match my idea of what she would look like. Voldemort is excellent, Barty Crouch Jr. was great.<br/><br/>If you have seen the other movies, you will really enjoy this one. And if you've read the book, you have to be thinking ""TV Mini-Series""- that would have been the way to do the books right."

","This Harry Potter movie was the worst Potter movie I have ever watched. After reading the book numerous times and then listening to it on Books on Tape even more, I was expecting something amazing, something that would surly surpass the first three movies. Yet, this movie fell dismally short of used toilet paper. I felt sick after seeing it. I had been looking forward to it since I first heard about it. But again I was let down. There were so many important and relevant characters that were not only left out, but completely ignored. These characters are paramount in the development of the story and how this story leads into the next. I cannot believe that J.K. Rowling even Okayed this script. Is she so concerned with money that she would not stop something so terrible? Where are her morals and beliefs, especially when it is her hard work being put on a movie screen for every one to watch? I have been reading the reviews of this movie on CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, and Google and all the ""move critics"" that have written these reviews cannot stop raving about how wonderful this movie is. Do they know a bad movie when they see it? Did these movie critics even read the book? Do they have any idea what is not happening in the movie? And who is not in it? Or are they so busy with making sure that they sound good that they don't want to step on any one's toes? Where are their stones when it comes to criticizing? That they choose to kiss ass then actually report the fact that the movie sucked is pathetic. This movie sucked. This director sucks. If you want to know how a person will do in the future, look at his past. His past movies sucked, this movie sucked, his future movies will suck. If he is directing any more Potter movies I will refuse to see them and I encourage everyone else to do the same. Stick with the book. Hollywood does not know how to anything correctly. 2 and ½ hours of crap. 2 and ½ hours of watching a half ass-ed director slash and hack at an amazing book and butcher the imaginations' of children is unbearable.

","HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is the latest Harry Potter adaptation, director Newell takes a new kind of breed into the most popular movie series around. And seeing Daniel Radcliffe for the fourth time as Harry is still highly entertaining, funny and amazing - and with that said; there's no doubt that there's magical movie-making going around when J.K. Rowling's books makes the big screen.<br/><br/>STORY: Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwart's school of witch-craft and wizardry takes the gang of three into a new level of aging, hitting the teens they again face evils and dark wizardry, challenges beyond reason and striking drama.<br/><br/>Chris Colombus being the director of the first two Harry Potter movies didn't really dive into the darker side of the Potter-world, the much more daring Alfonso Cuarón made a fabulous new excitement and with this year's Harry Potter, Mike Newell delivers a lots of chills and thrills. Though the whole Potter-gag has gotten a lot of punishment because of it's lack of material from the books, there's no doubt that Harry Potter is razor-sharp, especially when it's under pressure - going fantastic with explosions and magic, impressive CGI-effects and fine characters revealing new sides of themselves. With the whole specter of characters from the earlier movies around (Harry (off course), Ron, Hermione, Albus Dumbledoor, Snape and so on) there are always new exciting characters showing off. Alastor Moody being the new teacher this year, with his rolling eye going wild, there's always the stunning universe of Potter taking loops back and forth with brilliant boldness.<br/><br/>Ron Weasley still being the comedian and being great acted by Rupert Grint steals a lot of the show when he's around, but still he doesn't kill Harry Potter's character - because the boy with the scar is a very interesting and amusing character, and we shall be thankful for that, because after all it's all about him really. But as said earlier, there's dozens of fantastic characters here; Maggie Smith's brilliant Minerva giving mature breed, Michael Gambon's Dumbledoor being the most powerful wizard of them all, Alan Rickman's genially Severus Snape lurking around, Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid amusing and entertaining as earlier - and this is just some of them.<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE doesn't overrun Cuarón's ,PRIZONER OF AZKABAN, but it's the second best so far and truly delivers some of the most impressive action scenes and striking features so far."

There are definite plot holes in the movie like when Harry looks at the dead Barty Crouch and goes to alarm Dumbledore, then when he sees Dumbledore he completely forgets about it? What on earth, how can you forget a thing such as a person murdered? <br/><br/>3. Mike Newell (director of this movie) is the worst director in a decade.<br/><br/>4. Where is Dobby and Winky the house elves? in the book they are two of the most central characters <br/><br/>5. David Tennant did not portray Barty Crouch Jr at all well, he was way too old for the role.<br/><br/>6. When Harry talks to Sirius in the fire, you cant even tell its Sirius, so how on earth can Harry tell its Sirius? 7. Michael Gambon does a horrible job of Dumbledore, Dumbledore isn't meant to be aggressive as seen in the movie, he is meant to be calm in any situation, clearly the screenwriters and Gambon didn't think it through.<br/><br/>8. If JK Rowling wrote the series, why cant they rely on her to do the screenplay? it would make much more sense.<br/><br/>9. Viktor Krum barely has a speaking part in the movie, we as the audience should have seen the chemistry between him and Hermione much more.<br/><br/>10. Finally, anyone who gave this movie a high rating obviously isn't a potter fan and hasn't read the book properly or not at all.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm sorry for this movie, i feel sorry for JK Rowling who's masterpiece has shattered on screen. Hopefull HP6 can live up to its expectations."
"survivor_fan","1","2","5","18 March 2006"," This movie is 98% cruddy
","What the heck were the producers and director thinking? This move was the equivalent of a bad haircut- choppy, incomplete, and completely unprofessional. I love the book series Harry Potter, but this movie doesn't even come close to the others(yes even the first two cheeky ones.) For example, It skipped over really important things like the house elves, Winky at the world cup, and S.P.E.W. The only 2% worth watching is the graveyard scene. Ralph Finnes is excellent as Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore is portrayed in this movie as an arrogant, angry, bitter old man, who yells at Harry and doesn't believe him. While the cheeky three(Harry,Ron, and Hermione)have improved as actors, but all the actors direction is bad. I would NOT see this movie unless you are a die-hard fan of Harry Potter, but other than that don't see this."
"noralee","10","2","5","24 November 2005"," Terrific Blend of Story, Effects and Showcase of Young and Old Actors
","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a wonderful treat for the fans of the books and the earlier movies in the series, as it wastes no time explaining anything to newbies.<br/><br/>After the prologue, our first look at Harry reveals he's now a gangly young teen for even more visceral reaction than seeing Anakin Skywalker at the same gawky age in ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" because here it's been the same actor who we have seen age on screen; I immediately vote for continuing with the trio of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley for the rest of the adaptations, as they are literally growing into their roles. (Though with them fitting in other movies in between these I do feel pangs of maternal guilt at their lost childhoods.) Twins James and Oliver Phelps as the Weasley twins have also developed more hunkily than the characters' in my imagination from the pages in the book.<br/><br/>All of their rangy messiness is particularly apt as director Mike Newell better captures the ambiance of normal English boarding school life than the other films, from the dorms to the common and dining rooms and professors' offices to the horrors of the first formal dance and the first awkward stirrings of attraction to the opposite sex, which adds a lot of leavening humor to the adventure. The attention to detail in the production design is marvelous; I counted three people in the credits responsible for draperies. Hogwarts is notably more multicultural this year, and not just because of the international Tri-Wizard Tournament; it challenges American stereotypes to hear ""Cho Chang"" speak with a Scottish brogue like the inimitable Maggie Smith does here too.<br/><br/>Eliminating the dreary annual summer stay at the relatives helps to literally whoosh us fast into magical environs as it quickly moves to the creatively envisioned quidditch world tournament that is necessarily rushed but is still a lot of fun before capturing the spookiness of the stealth attack by the followers of You Know Who -- and viewers have to already know who he and Sirius Black are, the family relationships, and what are Death Eaters, poly juice, sorting, etc. One small weakness is that quidditch fans dress in the same outlandish nonsense as muggle sports fans, but the visiting tournament teams' costumes and choreography are even more fun than the opening ceremonies of the Olympics.<br/><br/>Until that time in the future when a very long, faithfully done mini-series adaptation can be made, it's forgivable that in the rush to fit in as many climaxes as possible of the long, complicated story it is a bit hard to have story insights to make you care for the new characters, though they are played by charming youngsters, particularly handsome Robert Pattinson as Hogwarts' official tournament competitor, and the girl classmates who amusingly prove that female wizards mature earlier too. I appreciate the effort gone to cast a young Bulgarian as competitor ""Vicktor Krum"" with the right physique, but it's a good thing he's seen quite briefly.<br/><br/>I lost count at ten at the number of special effects companies in the U.S. and Britain involved in the production, but it did seem as if CGI was put to effective background service to quaintly old-fashioned models, animatronics and mattes that fit the Hogwarts environment. I was particularly impressed that no matter how cool an effect was, it wasn't repeated for preening purposes and always served the story, as did the music. The underwater scenes were wonderful. The landscape of Hogwarts, from the castle to the lake to the forest, have a real sense of geography. Those who did stay through all the credits were rewarded by being assured that no dragons were harmed in the production, as the dragon challenge was thrilling even as it fondly recalled Ray Harryhausen's mythic battles for a new generation. I was not as impressed with Liam Neeson's make-up for Vol de Mort, as he seemed too much like Marty Feldman's Igor in ""Young Frankenstein.""<br/><br/>But even with all these impressive effects, the films remain a showcase of the richness of British acting talent, of artists who go from TV to theater to serious indie cinema to small roles in this populist extravaganza. Brendan Gleeson seems more avuncular as this term's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher than was in the book, while having fun with his body props. I thought Miranda Richardson was not even as obnoxious or tartily made up on screen as Rita Skeeter is in the books. But I hope they all are signed up for the long term, as this fourth film clearly ends like a serial and I look forward to the next film as much as I look ahead to the next book."

","First of all I have to admit that i am a huge fan of the books and the film, and was really looking forward to see the 4th instalment.<br/><br/>I have to say that the acting of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and especially Rupert Grint and the guy that plays Neville Longbottom (Temporary memory loss, sorry)was excellent, there was no cringe worthy moments, which i found in the previous films. They have all grown up a lot.<br/><br/>The whole film seemed like it had been plucked from my imagination, whilst reading the book, especially the second task, third task, the graveyard and the pen sieve.<br/><br/>I was in hysterics through the first 3/4 of the film and tearful in the last 1/4 film.<br/><br/>I think a non-harry potter fan (bizarre as it may sound that there are people that don't like harry potter)would even enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Cnat wait to see the film again. Well worth watching!!!!!"
"MichaelMargetis","9","2","5","19 November 2005"," ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right... and what is easy. "" - Dumbledore
","For me, one of the most exciting series of movies is the 'Harry Potter' movies. Being a moderate fan of the books (I read 1-4), I found it hard to read them all. I wanted to, but they are just so long and time consuming. To be perfectly honest, I really don't have the time to read them, so I just go see the films. No matter how long they are they never drag and they always hold my attention which is very, very rare for any film no matter how long. Going to to the latest installment 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', I had extremely high expectations that got met for the most part. I was expecting 'Goblet of Fire' to be so much better than 'Prisoner of Azkaban' since they keep getting better, but actually I found 'Goblet' and 'Prisoner' to be equal in quality. You could say I was a tad disappointed, but even still, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is an amazing motion picture that never, ever had me bored during it's entire 2 hour and 40 minute runtime. I was absolutely enthralled from start to finish.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is the fourth chapter in the series. Unlike 1-3, it doesn't open with Harry at home with his evil aunt and uncle and their retched little chunky brat son, but instead opens with a nightmare. The nightmare is Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall - The Last Samurai) the villain of the last film, nursing a weak Voldermort back to health with a strange guy. This sets the stage for the plot of this movie. It's about Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermoine (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) returning to Hogwarts after seeing a Quidditch match. At Hogwarts they are holding a big young Wizards tournament where Hogwarts and two different Wizard schools from across the world are competing. In order to compete you have to be at least 17 years old, and guess what, by some odd-ball chance guess who gets picked to compete? Harry Potter, of course! Now Harry must buckle-up for a dangerous tournament and save the Hogwarts campus once again from a healing Voldermort's wrath.<br/><br/>The plot of every Harry Potter is silly and unbelievable, but that's the point. 'Harry Potter' is a fantasy and feel-good movie, it's not a realistic or ground-breaking film series to any stretch. It's warm, silly, action-packed, dare I say 'family' fun that almost anyone could enjoy. British director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) does a great job directing this, in my opinion he's the best director they've had yet. The screenplay is entertaining but leaves out a lot of interesting aspects the book had. I still can't believe they cut out the opening Quidditch match though, but in order to make it fit in a time frame of less than 3 hours they had to make some serious cuts to the 734 page book. Radcliffe is solid as usual, while Grint and Watson are good, but don't have nearly as big of parts as the did in the three previous films. Actually, no one (except Dumbledore and Snape) have as big of parts as in the other films. Maggie Smith as McGonnagall has what some might say a glorified extra and Robbie Coltrane as the giant Hagrid only has about two major scenes. There are three additions to the cast this time around - Brendan Gleeson, Miranda Richardson and the creepy Ralph Fiennes. Miranda Richardson does a good job playing a nosy wizard journalist while Gleeson owns every minute he is own screen in a show-stopping performance as Mad-Eye Moody. Ralph Fiennes is a perfect candidate for the evil Lord Voldermort even if he is only in the film for about ten minutes. You may remember Fiennes as the vile and malicious commanding Nazi in 'Schindler's List'. The fourth Harry Potter installment also has the best action sequences, special effects, cinematography and make-up so far that is sure to pick up some Academy Award nominations come March.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is an excellent film, and overall it never ceases to entertain you. I can almost guarantee you when you look at your watch after getting out of theater, you will be shocked at how much time has gone by. 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' succeeds with flying colors in enrapturing you in it's content from start to finish. What more can you ask for in an action movie? Grade: A- (screened at Harkins Cine Capri @ Scottsdale 101, Scottsdale, Arizona, 9/18/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

","I can't believe your comment. First you say that you understand that they can't fit everything into the film and then go on to bash it. Exactly how do you think they could've improved it? They had 2 1/2 half hours to film a 700+ page book. There's not much they could do, if anything blame Warner Bros. They're the ones who didn't allow the film to be any longer. Besides, what they did was fine. You just have problems. True the movie was fast but they really had no choice. So if you have such a problem then don't bother people with your bad attitude. Do you not realize that the number of people who like the movie far outnumber the people who don't like it? Also, JKR has a say in the movie too and so if she's fine with it, then I think everyone who respects JKR should accept it the way it is and stop complaining."
"fantasyescapist","Null","2","5","18 November 2005"," Entertaining, but too rushed and choppy
","I went to see this film at Vue at 4:00 today and I was really hoping for entertaining Potter film - I got one but the price for it was a very rushed film. My main criticisms for this film other than it was too choppy is that Emma Watson's acting became a bit too over-the-top at times, and as much as I admire the girl, it just has to be said. I also found some parts to be laughable(mostly with Emma in them) when it wasn't meant to be. An example of this is the over emphasising of her points she makes with her eyebrows and how she acted in the Defense Against The Dark Arts lesson scene when she answered the question of 'Unforgivable Curses'.<br/><br/>Apart from the above, the film was very enjoyable and exciting, especially the three Triwizard Tournament tasks, like the third task that made me jump in my seat a couple of times when the hedges closed in around Harry. The first task was particularly thrilling when Harry's fingertips held on for dear life on the rooftops turrets of Hogwarts castle as the Hungarian Horntail tries to kill him. As for the second task, that was just as I imagined it when I read the book, and was also really fun to watch.<br/><br/>The parts about the realisation of the opposite sex was particularly funny as it was so true to life, although this is a fantasy, as when the boys were asked to dance they declined. Same with Ron(played wonderfully by Rupert Grint) who translated so well onto the screen the ways teen boys have problems dealing with the opposite sex. Another good example is when he argues with Hermione after the Yule Ball and when he sees the Beaubatons girls for the first time.<br/><br/>Dan Radcliffe's performance was moved up a notch from Prisoner of Azkaban(I hated the cringe worthy 'He was their friend, and he betrayed them - He was their FRIEND!'). I, for once, couldn't find a fault in his performance - He IS Harry. The final scenes with Voldemort were spectacular(like when Voldemort's and Harry's wands joined together by a red light) and Dan didn't fail to impress. Ralph Fiennes is chilling as Lord Voldemort himself and I literally cowered in my seat - my only complaint about him is Voldemort's eyes weren't red, more blue to me. Not forgetting, the scenes with Moody at the end are also acted well on Radcliffe's and Brendan Gleeson's part.<br/><br/>On a whole, I did enjoy the film and it was mostly worth my £5.50 ticket price, I only wish that the next film, Order of the Phoenix isn't as choppy and perhaps in the case of Goblet of Fire, a longer running time would have been better. As a Potter fan since 2004, I recommend the film for Potter and non-Potter fans."
"lalala-39","8","2","5","17 November 2005"," it was pretty much awesome :D
","this is definitely a movie everyone should watch. It is significantly darker than the past few movies, but it is probably what you'd expect it to be and more..<br/><br/>Good Points: The Triwizard Tournament, which is in fact the focus of the entire movie. It will literally keep you at the edge of your seat; the scene where Harry and Voldemort duel is truly and utterly magnificent; even though there weren't witty, intelligent jokes the film also offers some good laughs here and there; however, in my opinion the scene where *someone* gets murdered (most of you probably know anyway right?), and the scene following where everyone realizes he's dead and the whole school starts crying for him as Harry returns with his body is REALLY heart wrenching. You'd understand once you see it. And i swear the man next to me at the cinema was crying. In these last few scenes it's clear that Daniel Radcliffe and gang are definitely not mediocre actors. Bravo!<br/><br/>Bad Points: Yes, there ARE bad points. Firstly, because the book was crammed into just one movie, a LOT of things were cut out. Hogwarts doesn't seem much like a school anymore. You only see one short lesson. Next, the film's focus solely on the triwizard tournament makes it seem like they don't do ANYTHING else in school. And quidditch? I don't think we'd ever see quidditch again in the coming movies as the stories get longer and longer, and quidditch is considered irrelevant. Also, on Harry and his love interest, the scenes aren't played out well enough to show just how into her Harry was.<br/><br/>All in all, it was good and I'm sure if the movie could've been longer, it would've been nothing short of perfect. However its close to perfect as it is."

Clemence is good but sometimes Emma'Hermione'Watson(who's supposed to be this ugly duckling in the books) looks better than her.

"MovieAddict2016","7","4","15","22 November 2005"," The darkest, deepest and most emotionally involving film of the series so far.
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is not only the most technologically advanced of the Potter films thus far, but also the most entertaining. Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Donnie Brasco) is careful with the structure of his film, and keeps the pace moving steadily along. He balances CGI animation (such as a breathtaking underwater sequence) with tender emotional moments involving broken friendships and broken hearts. I did not like the first three Harry Potter films, yet I found this one to be a rather pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns once again to Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, under the care of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and Minerva (Maggie Smith), teachers and advisers. His friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) are soon in his company and all appears to be well and fine for him.<br/><br/>However, dark times lie ahead for Harry Potter. His name is mysteriously entered into the Triwizard Tournament  a test of strength and perseverance open only to those seventeen years of age and older. Harry is selected to compete despite being a minor by three years, much to the confusion and fury of fellow classmates and school faculty.<br/><br/>Reluctant, his first battle is with a dragon in an arena, and it only gets worse from there onwards. Soon it is made clear that there is a dark conspiracy centering on Harry's involvement in the competition and it may be linked to the dreaded Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents years prior and caused the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.<br/><br/>What I was most startled by with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was its emotional complexity. Despite a few flaws (particularly in length, clocking in at 157 minutes), Newell concentrates on what the earlier films lacked  depth. Sure, they might have been fairly whimsical and unique, but the characters were given little to do. Here, a good amount of the time is actually spent focusing on the characters rather than the action  friendship tensions between Ron and Harry, for example, as well as Harry's confrontation with his parents' murderer, Lord Voldemort (taking form in the hideous guise of a disfigured Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>The scary moments are effective. I still think Chamber of Secrets was the darkest from a technical standpoint (there are brighter colors used here and less blue filters) but when it's dark, it's DARK. The maze sequence towards the end of the picture would be enough to give the kiddies nightmares for weeks - this segment alone probably contributed heavily to the movie's PG-13 rating. (The first film of the series to be rated higher than PG.) Is this the best Harry Potter movie? Simply put, yes. It is the most entertaining, the darkest and the most emotionally intriguing film of the series. If they continue at this pace of improvement, the next entry  The Order of the Phoenix  could be a very good film."

"Glandros","9","2","6","17 November 2005"," Not just a Harry Potter movie, fourth has true magic!
","'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is easily the best Harry Potter film to date. Action, suspense, drama, and even some touches of horror are all included in the darkest of the stories to be adapted yet. Not only is the film exciting for readers of the best-selling book series, but it also has potential to draw in non-readers who may not have enjoyed the first three films quite as much as other fans have.<br/><br/>As a reader of the books, I was saddened at some of the scenes left out of the film. However, I can appreciate that the scenes left out were not as important to the main story. Other readers will complain about some of these scenes, but the film has enough to explain the story to those who have not yet read the books, while leaving enough out so that the film did not drag on too long.<br/><br/>This movie was placed into the hands of director Mike Newell, and he did a wonderful job with it. The scenes play out as if you were reading the book, even if the dialogue is changed. He does not focus too long on the mundane or on backgrounds already seen several times. We've already seen the hallways with the moving stairs, so he doesn't worry about showing them again. It's the same for other locations. The rooms we see are the ones actually vital to what is happening in the story.<br/><br/>The acting is nicely done. It's amazing to look especially at the three main kids, and compare them to where they were in the first Harry Potter film. Not only have they matured with age, but their acting has as well. Rather than seeming like they're trying to fit into the parts, it seems as if they truly are those characters. Daniel Radcliffe especially does a good job as Harry towards the end of the movie, as we build to the most climactic scenes.<br/><br/>The film is so different from the first three, it is amazing. All four films hold the essence of the books, but this one has the most appeal to the viewers who have not read the books. The first two films tried to pack too much of the story in just to please the readers, and became a little too drawn out. The third film, well better done than the first two, seemed to lack a little more of the Potter essence, trying too hard to fit for non-readers. This film had the proper balance. Certain scenes in the film are longer than in the book, adding more action and suspense. While some readers may wonder at this, it adds more excitement for the casual viewer. And yet, at its core, the film has the true Harry Potter themes running true, even if it lacks some of the details.<br/><br/>As compared to the previous Harry Potter films, this was the best so far, as previously stated. Yet looked at on its own, without comparison to the others, the film is still truly an outstanding piece of work. Rather than being compared solely to the others in the Harry Potter series, it has true magic that carries it into the realm of truly great fantasy films. It may not be entirely perfect, but the film still definitely deserves 9 stars, almost a 10."
"alexandros-7","6","2","6","11 November 2005"," very well made but the adaptation inaccurate are a little disappointing
","The fourth offering in the Harry Potter franchise sees The Boy Who Lived and his chums trying to get through another year at the increasingly dangerous Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry. This means, as ever, secrets and treachery within, hostilities with classmates and life-threatening magical sports days. New to the mix is the embarrassing reality of tortured adolescence, with sexual awakenings and brooding mood-swings exacerbated by the added distraction of glamorous foreign exchange students. Making quite the grand entrance are the chic girls of Beauxbatons Academy and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. Welcome to Harry Potter And The Rampaging Hormones.<br/><br/>This is certainly not a movie for young children, however engaging its characters and comic touches. Teen angst and relationship problems are pretty boring if you're six. But it's not the burgeoning sexuality that's landed the picture its 12A certificate, rather its genuinely darker vein of fantasy horror. For the maturing Potter core audience this is well-developed, with teasing terrors and skin-crawling set-pieces as the dark Lord Voldemort rises again  as all dark lords must, it seems, DLs notoriously being even harder to kill totally dead than the nut-job in Halloween. (Quite why Lord V. is so preoccupied with plotting against the promising pipsqueak Harry is presumably something to be clarified for cinema audiences in the fullness of time.)<br/><br/>Mike Newell, as the first British director entrusted with a series entry, oversees plenty of spiffing special-effects action  the Quidditch World Cup final, a dragon fight, an underwater sequence and Gary Oldman's (all-too-brief) fiery apparition  but as one would expect, he does a good job with the more personal, realistic emotional content, bringing on the young leads' performances noticeably in the process. So it's a shame that he's less successful in handling the necessary novel-to-screen compression.<br/><br/>Even though Newell's adaptation runs to more than two-and-a-half hours, the book is such a doorstopper that screenwriter Steve Kloves had to ditch more material this time around. Harry's annual confinement with his ghastly Dursley relations and Hermione's house-elf-liberation campaign is gone. While he was at it, it's a pity he didn't also delete tabloid hackette Rita Skeeter  however much one likes Miranda Richardson  since she obviously functions as author J. K. Rowling's dig at celebrity-stalking gossips, adding nothing more than running-time the story doesn't need.<br/><br/>As it is, there's too much contrasting material with which to contend: the life-or-death challenges of the Triwizard competition are interspersed with a host of new characters and their sinister or serio-comic sub-plots, school lessons, the agenda of yet another eccentric new Defence Against The Dark Arts professor in Brendan Gleeson's fierce Mad-Eye Moody, Potter sidekick Ron's sulks, swotty Hermione's makeover and Harry's blushing attempts to ask a girl to a dance<br/><br/>Consequently, the story editing goes through some distinctly choppy patches. It looks as if several scenes were filmed at greater length, surviving in quick snippets that are frequently unnecessary. The movie Newell set out to make  eccentric comedy-cum-Hitchcockian conspiracy  can only be glimpsed briefly, before that beast of a plot charges back into shot, demanding attention.<br/><br/>Thankfully, most of it is pulled together towards the end. It's no secret that Ralph Fiennes handles the long-awaited appearance of evil Voldemort himself, and thankfully his big scene is sensationally creepy, ensuring strong anticipation for frights to come. (8.7-10 stars) and i am a big Harry Potter fan."

The way the characters behave, as they face troubles in their youths, the decisions they make, the plot and especially the humour. The films predecessor (Prisoner of Azkaban) is my favourite of the entire franchise with its dark and adult themes. This movie dealing with the characters adolescences feels like a huge step back in terms of character development and storytelling. This story should have been told before PoA and it continues to annoy me every time I rewatch it.<br/><br/>Even though I don't like the movie overall I got to admit that the finale is great.

Ron, Harry's best friend also leaves Harry. People started wearing badges that stated ""Cedric rules. Harry stinks"". I liked that part a lot!<br/><br/>The adventures were really amazing. they were - fighting a dragon, saving a precious friend and the maze.<br/><br/>In the maze, Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory together meet Lord Voldemort, where he kills Cedric. The trophy turned out to be a port-key. <br/><br/>Now to know what would Harry do, watch the movie!:)"
"ThomasDrufke","9","1","2","9 November 2016"," A Turning Point for the Legendary Franchise
","Up until Goblet of Fire, the Potter franchise is a load of fun with some creepy imagery and dark concepts mixed in. But Goblet of Fire is the turning point in the franchise for me. Yes, Prisoner of Azkaban has its dark moments, but the grave sense of danger and threat isn't really present until the 4th film.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire opens with a pretty terrifying dream sequence involving a deformed Voldemort, which may very well be my favorite opening to any of the films in the series. It comes right out and states that this franchise is no longer just a fun adventure, there are dangerously high stakes involved here, and Voldemort is a part of them. Of course, part of the fun nature of this film is its mysteriousness and the unpredictability. I've seen the film several times, but there's nothing quite like watching the Triwizard Tournament with someone who has no idea what they're in for.<br/><br/>Goblet certainly brings some new characters along with its different identity. Most notably, Brendan Gleeson's Professor Alastor 'Mad¬Eye' Moody. Looking back, it's difficult to assess how much I enjoyed the character considering he was kidnapped for nearly the entire length of the film, but his impact on Harry's tribulations throughout the film are felt. I mean, why wouldn't he be an interesting character? He's just the 4th straight new defense against the dark arts teacher to be hiding something in one way or another.<br/><br/>No matter, The Goblet of Fire is full of fresh adventures for the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Most of the film involves Harry competing in the various events of the tournament (which ends up feeling a whole lot like a Hunger Games), but there's always time for some quality trio scenes. Weirdly enough, this film made those scenes mostly deal with romance at the Yule Ball involving the three schools. It's admittedly the next logical step in these teenagers lives, but sometimes it can be a bit overboard. Some of it plays for comedy, but did I really need to see EVERYONE at Hogwarts, and I mean everyone, share the dance floor or have a scene with a love interest.<br/><br/>In many ways, The Goblet of Fire is the turning point in the franchise, and the first time you see someone of importance get hurt in a grave way. Although you don't have a ton of time for Cedric to develop, his death altered the course of the series and the mindsets of those at Hogwarts. That in itself makes it an important installment in the series. Not to mention the fact that there's a dragon, a bada** maze, and one unsettling resurrection towards the end. This is one of the better films, by a good margin.<br/><br/>+Moody's introduction<br/><br/>+Voldemort officially returns<br/><br/>+More mature and powerfully written than previous entries<br/><br/>+Turning point in the franchise<br/><br/>-Too much romance<br/><br/>9.2/10"

","Directed by Mike Newell, the fourth installment to the Harry Potter series finds Harry wondering why his legendary scar which happens to be the famous result of a death curse gone wrong is aching in pain, and perhaps even causing mysterious visions. It is the fourth installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The story follows Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts as he is chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, a highly dangerous competition. <br/><br/>Before he can think too much about it, however, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he will attend his fourth year of magical education. Shortly after his reunion with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, Harry is introduced to yet another Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: the grizzled Mad-Eye Moody, a former dark wizard catcher who agreed to take on the infamous ""DADA"" professorship as a personal favor to Headmaster Dumbledore. Of course, Harry's wishes for an uneventful school year are almost immediately shattered when he is unexpectedly chosen, along with fellow student Cedric Diggory, as Hogwarts' representative in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which awards whoever completes three magical tasks the most skillfully with a thousand-galleon purse and the admiration of the international wizard community. As difficult as it is to deal with his schoolwork, friendships, and the tournament at the same time,Harry doesn't realize that the most feared wizard in the world, Lord Voldemort, is anticipating the tournament, as well.<br/><br/>The main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the Harry Potter films.Mike Newell handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors.Added to that,the special effects are first rate but I think it's always going to be about the characters. And there are a lot of great characters in this movie as it is a more mature story and its young stars prove they have the acting skills to grow with their characters.Like a fine wine, Harry Potter continues to improve with age as each succeeding film version of Rowling's books seemingly surpasses the last."
"beresfordjd","3","1","2","29 April 2012"," Tedious
","Have to admit I am not a huge Harry Potter fan but I do enjoy SFX movies when they are well done. I have only read the first book and it left me with no desire to read another. All that said, I kind of enjoyed the first few movies but it has taken me a long time to get around to this one. The effects were terrific for the most part,but the way the film was put together was less than appealing. It seemed to be an endless parade of scenes which had little relevance to the scene that went before and certainly did not drive the story forward. It was very boring and tedious, made worse by Emma Watson's amateurish performance, breathlessly declaiming almost every line - could Mike Newell get nothing better out of her? Daniel Radcliffe was very good in it -I still think he was a great choice for Harry as he has to carry the movies -if he did not work, neither would the films. Rupert Grint was treading water, both in his performance and script-wise. There was not much for him to do. Brendan Gleeson was a great addition to the cast. On a more positive note I was suddenly hooked by the final half hour. The graveyard scene, when Ralph Fiennes finally entered the action, was superb. For a film of this length to only come to life in the final scenes was unforgivable. I hope the remaining films are better than this one."
"hitchcockthelegend","7","1","2","25 June 2011"," Do not do so lightly! If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!
","Year four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! <br/><br/>The Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. <br/><br/>As is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.<br/><br/>A film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10"
"mccormick632","6","1","2","6 April 2011"," A hint of the terrible movies Still yet to come...
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was, before I realized just how bad this franchise is, the turning point in my thoughts towards the franchise. I thought that this was the last of the ""good"" Potter films. The last two films improved on the shitty original and they set my expectations a little higher than they would be, but does the fourth movie in this overrated franchise live up to those expectations, or does it suck more than the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (a movie that I think redefined what I view as a ""bad"" movie)? <br/><br/>On to the Story, things get to a weird start with an old man noticing that a light is on in a building. Frustrated for some reason (maybe it was trespassing or something) he goes into the building where he overhears Voldemort talking with Peter Pettigrew and some random man whose name I don't know. Already there is one big problem, how is Voldemort sitting in the chair if he is supposed to be dead? Last time he was seen he was in teenage form because of his diary, and before that he was on the back of a professor's head, so how the **** did he become the way he is? Who brought him back? When? I'm only 4 minutes in and I'm confused, god this movie's going to suck! Harry awakens because of Hermione, who soon wakes up Ron as well. What is Harry doing at Ron's house? I am happy that we don't see the Dursley's but still, they are his relatives. Harry desperately needs a haircut; in fact, everyone needs a haircut. So Harry and friends gather around a portkey, which teleports them to the Quidditch World Cup, oh boy, the dumbest sport ever conceived and I'm watching the championship games.yay? But then, they are suddenly forced to leave as the festival is being attacked bywho are these guys anyway? After Harry and friends are attacked they are on their way to Hogwarts, which has been chosen to hold the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a particularly dangerous series of events which Harry somehow finds himself to be a part of. Joining him and Cedric Diggory (played by Robert Pattinson of Twilight fame) are girls from some school from where no one knows or gives a ****, and the Bulgarian students form the north, but to be honest these guys are so obviously Russians, they wear the hats and look like Russians so it's fairly simple to say they are Russians. We are also introduced to Mad-Eye Moody, who saves the students from the horrors of the fake lighting over head.<br/><br/>So we get to Round 1: Harry must get a golden egg protected by a dragon. Of course Harry gets the egg but to everyone's surprise the egg emits a painfully loud screeching sound whenever the egg is opened.<br/><br/>Now we get what must be in every movie with teenagers as the main characters, a dance. These scenes are kind of funny and I will admit the scenes are at least a nice gentle rest until the next action-packed round of the tournament. Harry and Ron have trouble getting dates for the dance (no surprise there, these guys are completely unlikeable), but not Hermione, who is going with Victor Krum. At the actual dance Harry and Ron both show up with their respective dates and as expected, it's awkward beyond belief. Well I would comment on how this scene is uncomfortable to watch but I'll be lying if it's probably an accurate representation of how I would be if in a similar situation. Then we're given..bad rock music. The scene transforms from what a traditional dance would look like into a rave party complete with jumping, screaming, and lots of hands being thrown up into the air. Harry and Ron do what I would do, sit down and not do crap. Ron and Hermione bicker like a married couple (how appropriate) and the scene just sort of stops. It cuts from Hermione crying on the steps to another dream of Harry's.<br/><br/>Round two of the tournament: the participants must dive down underwater and retrieve something that was stolen from them the previous night. Neville gives Harry some weird plant-thing that allows him to breathe underwater, but while underwater the participants are attacked by mermaids. At least they would be attacked by the aforementioned mermaids if they did anything other than float there and do nothing. Since Harry saved two people he is given extra points and moves on to the next round. <br/><br/>And so we come to the final round of the tournament; the participants must go through a hedge maze and reach the trophy in the center to win, it doesn't help that this maze comes alive and will kill you if given the chance.<br/><br/>There is more to go one about the movie but I wanted to get the notion across that this is a awful movie! It is stupid, boring, its too long, annoying, boring (it counts twice!) and the movie is just a mess. I really wished to have one more ""decent"" Harry Potter movie before things got really bad but no, I was asking for too much."
"darkratus","5","1","2","31 March 2011"," Harry Potter: The One Plot of Fire
","I have to report a crime, a murder, the victim? A series of books shot down in cold blood that has wormed its way into the hearts of the public. It's a shame that a series that started so well has been stripped of everything that actually made the series of books enjoyable. As is common with books made into films, they have to fillet out the bits that take up screen time and send people to sleep which does cause havoc with those who've read the book, and even more so, if those greedy money makers at Hollywood strip out its heart, making it barely recognisable or only focus on one part of the story a la Percy Jackson.<br/><br/>The Crime I'm reporting is that of The Goblet of Fire, the fourth instalment of the Harry Potter series. You could say So Much about The Great Series and how well it started as movies, numbers one, two and three were perfect books that led to awe-inspiring films, before it all went downhill and we were presented with The Goblet of Fire, a great book with a series of mini plots and character depth, a captivating story by JK Rowling, that became minced up, the film should be sold at butchers not a film shop. What took place in the Goblet of Fire was unbelievable, there may have been a main plot, but what about the important mini plots that gave the characters more depth? <br/><br/>There was no real characterisation for Krum and Fleur and we don't even get an explanation about what Fleur is, and why people are so in love with her. Yes there is a mention but just no explanation. The main plot is loyal to the book, however it does rush like an overexcited Springer Spaniel. This sensation is carried on into The Order of The Phoenix. The portrayal of the main characters works rather well and Ralph Fiennes does such a convincing job as an insanely evil Nazi character, like in Schindlers list he suits the part well and his menacing actions are terrifying I was struck with chills just by looking at his predator like enhanced features. <br/><br/>This brings me to another point, the relationships in the world of Harry Potter movies come marching out of the blue like we see occasionally in films, we see what looks like a budding relationship between Hagrid and the giant headmistress, but do we get any reason for why this happens? We don't even have a characterisation for her either, yes admittedly in the books she's a somewhat minor character but without the depth of personality, it stumps you. Why is Hagrid is actually going out with her? These books are like bibles to many, it is sacrilegious to change them, and directors, beware reviews like me if you do. <br/><br/>OK, the film decided to change so much, it's only recognisable as Harry Potter and the One plot of fire, however this does not mean the film is not good in its own right. It does not have all the sparkle of the book, but does it really matter? The Dedicated readers of the book certainly seem to think so, however let's step away from the book a second and think about those who have never stepped foot in the book universe that is Harry Potter and have only watched the films. Having looked at some other reviews myself, many seem to give this Harry Potter film a good review without focusing on the book, so that is what I will do right now. If you have not read the books, you have nothing to go on but your own impeccable taste, having chosen to watch a film like this. It is a stunning film showing the transition from the light hearted detective side of things, to the darker more sinister side. The first few films are incredibly light hearted, there is never much sense of danger, more of a jolly stroll through some corridors, on a hunt to find out what the bad guys are up to, deducing like a detective, a young kid detective at that. So what changes in the fourth instalment do you say? It's much darker, more mature and more serious about itself a bit like me. It seems the series has grown up with its audience, just as the actors have grown and just as I have grown from a eager excitable six year old. It starts to deal with more teenage things like puberty, and for boys GIRLS you know those dreaded things with pretty eyes longer hair and high voices, yes, with all this the series changes from its light hearted roots to a dark brooding pit of danger.<br/><br/>The danger is more evident in this one, straight from the start we have Death Eaters invading the Quidditch World Cup, wait a second, a World Cup, and they say they are nothing like us mere Muggles. The invasion created a statement and they certainly made it not just to the characters, but to us the audience as a warning of more evil things to come. And what did we get? Oh we got a minefield of evil things, from Harry mysteriously being entered into the Triwizard cup, to the death of Cedric Diggory RIP. Let's move on. Overall I believe the film is a huge disgrace when it set beside the book, however for those that have not read it, Its still needs good kick up the backside much like a stalled car that just won't get going. It's clear to me that given both this and the fifth film shows us that nothing can save the next film from the horrible mash up that the film industry has begun.<br/><br/>Anyone fancy a plate of filmic mud or a nourishing roast dinner of a book?"

","Now in his fourth year at school, Harry Potter (Dan Radcliffe) becomes unwittingly involved in the infamous ""Tri-Wizard Tournament,"" wherein champions from Hogwarts and two visiting wizarding schools face frightening challenges in the hope of winning eternal glory. With help from his buddies Ron and Hermione, Harry battles dragons, survives underwater, and faces a terrifying maze. Equally scary for him: He must choose a date for the Yule Ball. He has his eyes on the lovely Cho Chang but is too shy to ask her. Lord Voldemort and his Deatheaters play a prominent part in this installment as Harry faces a life and death duel.<br/><br/>The movie is very well written and the acting is good, too. The three kids are now playing 14-year olds and are showing a greater range of emotions. There is much humor when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex, a talent the usually capable Harry seems to lack. Watching the three at the Yule Ball is sweet and awful, as these things tend to be at that age.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and special effects are wonderful as usual and the suspenseful story is acceptable and enjoyable for children over eight as well as older audiences.

","I admit, I have never picked up a Harry Potter book in my life, and I am judging this film, solely as a movie, not as a book.' With that being said, this film is an editorial mess, jumping from one frame to another with little exposition.<br/><br/>Granted, I saw a cut of it at Warner Brothers studios back in 2005, before it was released to the public, but, I am fairly sure that the cut I saw was the final release cut of the film.<br/><br/>The flow of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is atrocious. It simply jumps from one bad CGI scene to the next.<br/><br/>The characters are bland at best, and I really don't care about what happens to them.<br/><br/>Some of the sequences are unintentionally funny, such as Voldemort's cohorts, which look like members of the KKK at a Klan rally.<br/><br/>The film is a giant mess, and unless you're a huge fan of the books, you really won't enjoy this film at all. I could care less what happens to him or any of his companions in the future.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is badly miscast here, in one of his usual ham it up villain roles.<br/><br/>His Amon Goeth, from Schindler's List would eat Voldemort for breakfast! Not to mention, Michael Gambom, an excellent English character actor does a horrid job of playing Dumbledore, the headmaster of Harry Potter's school who dresses in extremely shabby clothing.<br/><br/>He looked more like a weird hippie wizard wanna be, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, Goblet of Fire is more of the same old Harry Potter, bland and uninspiring! Two stars out of four at best."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","2","10 July 2009"," Despite great pacing, fourth ""Potter"" loses a touch of magic
","As a huge fan of the intelligence and beauty that Alfonso Cuaron brought to the third Harry Potter film based on J.K Rowling's fantasy book series, I was saddened to hear that he backed out of the fourth, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" because of the quick year and a half turnaround. Though director Mike Newell -- the series' first British director -- is no slouch, he doesn't fully capitalize on the potential of ""Goblet of Fire"" being such a departure from the previous novels and full of new characters.<br/><br/>The book is cut down immensely, but it works. ""Goblet of Fire"" moves quickly but stays engaging and has plenty to offer in terms of action and special effects. Potter scribe Steve Kloves does his best work whittling the script down without compromise the key and most memorable parts of the story. In this installment, the much older mop-headed Harry Potter (Radcliffe, now on pubescent decline) is unwittingly selected as the fourth competitor in the Tri-Wizard tournament, a once-in-a-lifetime competition combining Hogwarts with two other magic schools: the boys of Durmstrang and the girls of Beauxbatons. New faces include Brendan Gleeson as MadEye Moody, the new teacher that aids Harry in figuring out tournament clues, Miranda Richardson as nosy reporter Rita Skeeter, ""Doctor Who"" star David Tennant as a follower of evil Lord Voldemort and Voldemort himself, finally appearing, fittingly played by Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>An unfortunate side-effect of the condensed script is a slight sacrifice of character. The only actor who gets to take a notable step forward is Emma Watson as Hermione, who gets to play some of the more emotional scenes in the film, in fact she plays a role in just about every one of them. Newell stated this film was intended to shed the kids' goody two-shoes appearance and show them as more mischievous teenagers. While everyone else acts nasty, however, Hermione -- other than a few lines where she acts like a mother to Harry and Ron (Grint) is the exception. Watson's facial expressions -- where a smile sometimes slips in the face of danger or sadness -- is surprisingly candid. <br/><br/>We honestly get little growth elsewhere in this film. Even Harry, who despite great acts of kindness in the story that put others ahead of his own would-be gains, doesn't appear to choose the actions so much as just do them because it's in the script. Newell could have been of more use here.<br/><br/>Newell also seems to strip just a bit of the magic of seeing so much change to the Harry Potter world that this story brings. He keeps the more realistic street clothes element Cuaron emphasized, especially with the Tri-Wizard competitors wearing the equivalent of Nike for wizards, but every new element that ""Goblet of Fire"" introduces is sort of done so abruptly. We aren't teased with it or slowly shown its wonder. When we finally see the young adults from the other schools appear in the Great Hall, they do this campy show that hardly captures our imaginations. Even the awe of the Quidditch World Cup is cut short. Apparently we're to believe that a giant CG stadium with flashing lights happening very quickly is enough to scratch the itch of our imaginations. I would have gladly sat through another 10- 15 minutes for a bit more out of all these elements (most of which are in the first half hour).<br/><br/>""Goblet of Fire"" is quick, entertaining fantasy -- a great adaption of a very lengthy book that is one of the series' most fun and adventurous. I don't quite understand the PG-13 rating, though there are certainly scarier elements as these books only get darker and darker. It simply would have been nice to see the maturity and intelligence that Cuaron brought to the series continued or pushed further."

","Let me say that this is the first Harry Potter movie I've seen and I thought I was going to hate it. But I found myself having a good time watching it. If I thought the first three installments were going to be just as impressive as this one. I would've watched them before seeing the Goblet of Fire. The whole cast including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are great in their roles. The rest of the talented supporting cast includes Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, and Brendan Gleeeson who also turn in admirable performances but they lack screen time only showing up for brief appearances here and there. The pacing was a little slow at times too but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Ralph Fiennes does a decent job with the brief cameo role he has near the end as the evil Lord Voldemort. He's nearly unrecognizable and Fiennes definitely makes for an imposing villain but he like other characters lacks screen time. Besides the pacing the film seems to be juggling too many characters a problem some other movies have had as well (Spider-man 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine to name a few). With it's flaws aside though this Harry Potter is a good film to watch. It has intense action, cool special effects, terrific acting for the most part, and some humor thats sure to please any fan of the genre or the book. If you've enjoyed the previous films so far than chances are you'll like this one as well."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter film of the first four. The tone is darker, the acting is better, and so much more. There is only a small minimal problem that is no surprise. This time around, Harry enters his fourth year at Hogwarts. His name got entered into the Triwizard Tournament and he must compete. Little did he know that the tournament will lead to eventual trouble with a wizard who been gone for thirteen years. The acting is better in this film. Radcliffe is more appealing as Harry. Watson overacts a bit too much, but she did OK. The supporting actors like Gambon and Rickman are fantastic. I also liked the music in this film. It has a nice sound to it. The only problem is that some subplots were left out. I wished to see the Dursley's, Dobby and Winky, Charlie and Bill, the visits to Hogsmeade and Sirius, and the midnight argument with Moddy and Snape.

Watching the movie, it seemed overall the same than the first. Then I read the third book (the best one), and noticed that the adaptation was a little rushed and mostly like a summary. Now, having not read the Goblet of Fire (I couldn't find it in English), I saw the film. Get ready, here it goes: <br/><br/>First. It was way too repetitive. I mean, we already know Harry Potter survived Voldermort (am I allowed to mention his name?). We don't need to be reminded of it by every single Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in every single school year.<br/><br/>Second. The characters were so unreal. Stupid Harry Potter doesn't make a move to ask the Asian girl to the ball. And, even though she makes suggestive eye contact with him, she ends up going with someone else. WTF!!!!!!!!!!! Stupid Ron doesn't even try to not look ridiculous to others. Stupid Ron's mother really thinks any person who wears that ridiculous dress she sent her son won't look like an old woman (some form of idiotic comic relief stunt). Stupid Hermione acts so dramatic about really pointless stuff (she already knows Harry survived the killing curse, why act so undignified?).<br/><br/>Third. Apparently, Hogwarts is so small, the girl Harry wants to ask out already agreed to go with his tournament rival, Cedric Diggory. Also, Hermione, Harry's long time friend, is also going to the ball with another rival of his, that Krum guy, if I can recall. I'm sorry, but I just can't believe any of that.<br/><br/>Fourth. Logic. Voldemort returns. Plain and simple. So the first three movies with him dying in a more spiritual or symbolic form were totally useless. Why wait to this one to appear? <br/><br/>Fifth. Action. There isn't any.<br/><br/>Sixth. The Goblet has no real importance to the story. It's just incidental.<br/><br/>Seventh. Dude, why would you make a contest of wizards where they get killed? If none of them turns out to be that good, they just die, and that's it? <br/><br/>Eighth. Too much politics. It's not a simple plot, but a strange conspiracy theory that doesn't really make sense. However, the politics here are kid's stuff compared to ""Order of the Phoenix"".<br/><br/>Ninth. Predictability. We don't need to read the final book to figure out there's going to be a final showdown between Voldy and Harry and who's ending up with who (Ron with Hermione), among other stuff.<br/><br/>Tenth. Since the audience pretty much grows along with Harry, the story is now oriented to teenagers, more than children. That results in including relationships, dating and more young adult issues. This, in hand, results in just a teen soap opera with a little magic in between.<br/><br/>I was about to become a Harry Potter fan, because I liked the first chapters, you know, the kiddie friendly magic. Since you were new to the Hogwarts world, you felt amazed at the wondrous stuff and places you went. Now, you end up not going anywhere new. No more spell lessons (no real lessons whatsoever, actually). Only a cheesy tone and overextended self-indulgence (yeah, I'm using fancy words). So, I pretty much ended loathing that wiz kid (pun intended) with glasses, as his inability to ask a girl out until it's too late pretty much sums up his magical skills. The only thing I did enjoy was the music (although it was far more John Williams than Patrick Doyle).<br/><br/>To finish, I thought ""The Soup's"" version of the film was way better (You know, the one where Harry and Ron are made to look gay)."

","I have never been fully satisfied with how the Harry Potter books have been brought to the big screen, but this certainly left the most to be desired. It's a pitiful attempt of transferring possibly the best book in the series into to cinema form, with terrible screenplay which leaves out vast chunks of the story. Unless you have read the books you just cant grasp the amount left out. Showed great promise in parts but simply failed to deliver. Pros: Voldemort and his death eaters were just as I imagined. Really like the snake look of Voldemort. The Dragon Task, very tense when harry slips down the roof is very tense The Special Effects in the Film (e.g. the Quidditch World Cup Stadium) Rupert Grint who I think is perfect as Ron. Funniest part in the movie is when he dances with Maggie Smith(Professor McGonagall) The way that everyone is against Harry, Potter Stinks etc Cons: Missing out the action in the Quidditch World Cup final, was possibly the aspect I was most looking forward too. The amount of context cut out from the film, the house elf's in the kitchen etc. Sirius, or more the lack of him. Very minor role in the film, makes his passing in the next film not really matter.In the book Harry relies heavily on Sirius to pull him through the Tournament. He is probably the living person harry loves most in the books.<br/><br/>I just think it's a shame how Rowling's work has been executed so poorly in comparison to the way Jackson directed the Lord Of The Rings. She and the books deserve better."

","At least for me it was ... and I don't know jack about the book(s), so I can't tell you what's missing etc. etc. etc. But what I can tell you is that the direction has gone ""darker"". For a family friendly wizard, that is quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>By now (assuming you know the other movies and/or books) most of the characters have been established, with Sirius Black being one of my favorite, because Mr. Oldman can play ""against"" type (he's so often casted as a bad guy it's nice to see him play someone good for a change)! What's also nice is that you can see a development and a story continuation (although for some it might be too slow) ... but then again, it's all in the book(s), isn't it? (that's not a rhetorical question ... I Sirius-ly don't know ... sorry had to do it ;o) )"

","The good news is that it is better than the previous installment (Prisoner of Azkaban). The bad news is that it's not as good as the first two, which had a sense of freshness and wonder about them. It does a nice job of evoking the Hogwarts environment but is undone by too many characters, too much plot, and too much special effects. To fully appreciate this, one must have read not only the book it's based on but the previous books as well. The Rowling books manage to be ponderous and silly while taking themselves too seriously; these qualities, unfortunately, have been faithfully transferred to the screen."
"shiftyeyeddog","3","1","2","5 July 2007"," A big step down from Azkaban
","After flirting briefly with passable film-making with the third movie in the series, they've taken a big step backwards this time. It's not nearly as bad as 1 or 2, mind you, but it sure ain't good.<br/><br/>With three different directors having taken the reins, it would be easy to lay the blame on the director. But he certainly can't be the only one responsible here. No, it takes the combined effort of a whole lot of people to make so many things about a movie suck. <br/><br/>First and foremost: the story. I've never been a Potter fan, that's no secret, even though I thought the third film was alright. The story here is just as lame and simplistic as the last few, and the horrible writing of both Rowling and the screenplay adapter create such an awful, pathetic plot that I found myself laughing AT the movie and shaking my head in amazement that so many people love this crap. What the hell were those choreograohed entrances of the different schools' students?!? The bath scene (with another badly acted and stupid character - that dead girl)? A Dance? Blatant exposition when Voldemort decided to explain what happened years ago? And again, as in the first films, the headmasters arbitrarily rewarding Harry with extra points or consideration just because he's our hero. And don't even get me started on the painfully horrible dialogue. The acting is just as melodramatic and bad, and the character designs are getting more laughable. ""Mad Eye Moody"" (a complete waste of Brendan Gleeson's talent), has this eye that is the stupidest looking thing I've ever seen in my entire movie-going life. It looks like someone's bad homemade Halloween costume. Simply idiotic. Lastly, the special effects were really not done very well. much of it looks somewhat obviously fake, and even when it is well done, it's often not integrated very well with the live action elements and that makes it look lame.<br/><br/>Of course, much of this would be completely forgivable and understandable if it was truly a film made for kids. Kids don't care about bad acting or bad effects or silly dialogue. But with a series like this, which tries to boast that it's a film for all ages, backed up by the PG-13 rating on this one, it sure comes off extremely juvenile to me. I just don't get it. It's just like the books - If the kids love it, fine. But the fact that adults praise these films and love them? I just don't understand. I guess I never will."
"ablebravo","3","1","2","21 June 2007"," Weak-ish. Could have been much better.
","First off, I will admit I have not read the book. If I had, I'm afraid this film would probably have gotten even lower than the 3 stars which I (grudgingly) grant it.<br/><br/>My overall impression of the film was that it had a very ""rushed"" feel to it- like the filmmakers were trying to pop it out for a holiday deadline instead of taking the time to carefully craft a film instead of slamming it together with a mallet and glue...<br/><br/>Truth be told, GoF had the same feel as the last horrible Star Wars film in that it rested on a lot of CGI and hoped that the wobbly acting, unbelievably clunky script and muddy time-flow would be covered up by the SFX. OK, Radcliffe and the others are growing up IRL as well as in the films, but there was just something wonky about the whole thing. Everyone's acting was just a bit plastic. They all lacked the sparkle that made the first 2 Potter films so fun to watch. Also, like I mentioned a moment ago, the time flow was stilted and confusing-I guess that's what happens when even an experienced screenwriter tries to cram the contents of a 700 page book into a film even if that film is over 150 minutes long.<br/><br/>Casting was *almost* OK, but Michael Gambon as the New Dumbledore was awful. He had NONE of the charm and wisdom that Richard Harris gave the character; he struck me as a half-senile wino trying to dry out. He was my least favorite part of GoF.<br/><br/>Frankly, I can't put blame on a single person for why this film wasn't as good as it could have been. I'm not sure if it was Newell's direction, the editing or the screenplay-probably all three. I did miss the deft direction of Chris Columbus. I was also going to say the filmmakers should have used the same screenwriter as they did on the first HP until I went back and checked; they DID use the same guy! Well, the book was pretty darn long-so was the movie, for that matter but it all came out as more of a mediocre, clunky SFX loaded demo reel with familiar faces in it than it did a powerful, character-driven film like the first two HP efforts were. <br/><br/>Hardcore fans of the first 2 films (as I actually am) will probably agree: not the worst, but certainly not the best. Hardcore fans of the book (from what I've heard) will probably be quite disappointed. <br/><br/>Let's hope ORDER will be better and let's hope Chris Colombus makes a return to the HP world.<br/><br/>All in all, GoF didn't suck, but it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>PS: I clicked the ""spoiler"" box just in case I went too far, but I don't think I did."
"Tubes12","1","1","2","15 June 2007"," Ending Was Pitiful
","Ralph Fiennes was alright, but the director ruined his scene. I don't like that he took great parts out of the movie, but I can understand it. I do not understand why he completely demolished the climax of the movie. The director had Ralph talking as fast as those guys at the end of a car commercial. Also, there was absolutely no transition to the scenes in the movie. It went straight from the bus to foreign schools arriving at Hogwarts. I did think that they did okay with the first and second tasks. The third task was just sad. Oh no, vines. Anything but vines. That couldn't get a five year old's heart pumping. Emma Watson's acting has gone way downhill. Her cry scene after the yule ball was almost as bad as Harry's in POA after he found out that James and Sirius were friends. I would say the best part of the movie was Alastor Moody, but when he turned into Barty Crouch Jr, they included nothing except Dumbledoor saying that they were short a prisoner. If you have to take a scene out, do it. But don't ruin the scenes that you put in. If you see this movie, don't expect much."

"he_who_leads","8","1","2","23 September 2006"," Worth seeing. Much better than the first three.
","The Harry Potter books are wonderful. You should read them, no matter what age you are. I can pick any one of them up, open a page and start reading.<br/><br/>As for the movies, first one, dull and overcooked; second one, a bit better but still overcooked; third one, a bit better than the last one. Steve Kloves - writer, just wants to stuff everything in when more cutting is required. Thankfully, his script is much tighter in this one.<br/><br/>This movie is darker, edgier and much more satisfying. For a start, the kids are much better. In the first three they weren't very good. In fact, I would argue with people that they should replace Daniel Radcliffe as I thought he was bad to the point of distraction. Now I know they're young and I'm not expecting Haley Joel Osment here but just a little naturalness. But in this film they are all much improved. With the Yule ball and all that talk of hormones and the slowly growing love thing between Ron and Hermione, I thought it would be embarrassing but it was okay.<br/><br/>The movie was faithful to the book and the pace was very good. However, a few changes could have made to make this an excellent movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, Dumbledore is too angry and emotional. They're obviously trying to make it more dramatic but those who know him know he's actually quite a serene character nearly all the time. Thoughtful, wise and stately. Michael Gambon (The Cook, the thief, his wife, and her lover)is a good actor but he's still a bit short and round for the part.<br/><br/>They should have really cut down on the dragon scene. It's way too drawn out and unbelievable.<br/><br/>They should have buffed up the big resurrection scene (you know what I'm talking about). Not much sense of occasion here. This is THE absolutely huge event in the Potter series and all it is is a bunch of flashing lights and its over. Again, as in all the movies, a feeling of not knowing what to condense and what to expand. Where's the breeze rustling the leaves of the yule trees and the creepy build up? They could have really bought this home.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes' interpretation. I really like Fiennes and a lot of people praised his performance. But, like Dumbledore, they made him too emotional. He snarled and spat and screamed while his character is actually more calm, cold, intelligent and menacing. This guy is like a nutter escaped from an asylum. When I say Ralph's interpretation, maybe I should be saying Mike Newell's.<br/><br/>They should have cut Rita Skeeter. Not worth it. Loved Miranda Richardson in Black Adder. Maybe she should have played Professor Trelawney ... or Narcissa Malfoy. There's a thought.<br/><br/>Anyway, these are mostly criticism but it is only because the movie is already so entertaining and so satisfying that they rankle that bit more. As I speak they've already cast Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange - good job. They must have seen her sexy performance in 'Fight Club.'"
"restin_him","8","1","2","26 August 2006"," One very good movie
","No movie adaptation of a book is ever perfect. It is a fact of life. However there are times when the essence of a book is captured very well and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of those movies.<br/><br/>It is Harry Potters fourth year at the magical school of Hogwarts. This year things are a bit different as Hogwarts plays host to two other schools all of which will compete in the legendary Tri Wizard Tournament. Things do not go as planned and soon Harry finds himself competing in a dangerous contest facing dragons, enchanted mazes and much worse.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire is a very good addition to the Harry Potter franchise (we can all call it that now). It is great to see the actors mature as the films have and how things at Hogwarts have deepened as well.<br/><br/>The actors all do a great job with one exception, which I will talk about later. The scenes between Harry, Ron and Hermoine are all well done and you can see the chemistry between the kids. Add to this the amazing talents of the original adults and Brendan Gleeson fantastic job as Mad Eye Moody.<br/><br/>The story is well adapted from the book. Again it is not perfect but it isn't supposed to be. Perfect adaptations end up being maxi-series on TV. The writing was genuine however and the interaction between characters should great insight into the book and characters.<br/><br/>The FX are amazing and very well done. The blending between what was real and CGI has been refined well and these FX masters show their talents off well.<br/><br/>My only issue with this film is Michael Gambon, who has been playing Albus Dumbledore beginning with the third Potter film. He took the role after the death of Richard Harris who played Dumbledore in the first two films. In the first two films and in the books Dumbledore is a silent yet strong figure who has the mere presence of authority and respect. Richard Harris portrayed this perfectly in a silent yet refined way. He gave Dumbledore an air that every move action and word was carefully chosen with deep intellect while making the character as whimsical and off beat as in the book. Gambon lacks this skill in the most horrid ways. I am not bashing Gambon in anyway, he is an amazing character actor. Being a character actor however is his greatest flaw. He exaggerates, throws his arms, explodes his voice, looks as if he is on the verge of lost control, all of which Dumbledores character is not and does not. In so many scenes Dumbledore is more of a bumbling old man seeming to need more aid from a nurse than the wise and whimsical guide he is in the first films and books.<br/><br/>I look forward to the next Potter film but hope, with all respect to him, that Gambon will be replaced by a much more refined and controlled character."

","First off, i am a huge Harry Potter fan. I read the books constantly and i love watching the films, i am one of those strange Pottermaniacs. So this film was very important to me as it was one of my favourite books.<br/><br/>I managed to persuade my mum to take me to the first showing of this on the release day. I booked the tickets several weeks and i then spent the rest of my time wondering what the film was gong to be like. From the moment the lights went down to the end credits, i was mesmerised.<br/><br/>So the basic storyline is that Harry has to compete in a special tournament (The Triwizard tournament) when his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, which is a big cup full of fire. The trouble is, Harry doesn't know who put is name in it, because he didn't. The tournament has three tasks which test the witches/wizards.<br/><br/>The film has jaw-dropping special effects, the likes of which i have never seen before. The dragon in the first task is truly amazing. The book was done to great accuracy, but a lot of key moments were missed, the Quidditch world cup match wasn't shown which was a disappointment. Every scene that did appear though was very much to how i imagined it. The actors were all superb in their big or small roles, especially Brendan Gleeson as Moody.<br/><br/>The film truly grabs your heart and your mind and takes you on a ride like no other Harry Potter film before it. It truly lived up to my expectations. However......there is one problem. The directors seem to be making the films at a length so that they are durable for smaller children. This can destroy the point of adaptions and ruin a franchise. The films need to be made longer, and if need be, split into two parts.<br/><br/>But don't let that ruin this completely spellbinding film, because it is fantastic and that is coming from a true Harry Potter fan. You really must see this one."

","Well, they certainly did their best. The effects were excellent, the actors delivered what was needed at the exact moment and it stayed semi-close to the book. Although many things were left out, I can't say that I was surprised, because the book is 734 pages long. That would probably make for a 12 hour movie. There are more things that they should have added, but even without Dobby and Ludo Bagman, it was very entertaining. However, i would recommend reading the book before viewing the movie so that you can understand what is going on during the movie. It will make the inner workings of the plot make more sense to you and help you enjoy it more. All together, i enjoyed the movie and hope everyone else does."

","Acknowledging first that I am a big fan of all three other _Harry Potter_ films to date, I strongly believe this is the very best of the lot. While I do miss the house elves, seeing Harry's 'family' in the Muggle world, and many other interesting details, characters, and scenes that weren't adapted from Rowling's fourth book, I feel the director and screenwriter did an admirable job of pulling hundreds of pages of text into a movie less than 2 1/2 hours. Beyond that, the action scenes, such as the extended version of Harry outsmarting the dragon in the movie, are wonderfully constructed and shot. And the amazing foreboding of the climatic scene in the graveyard leads to a masterful translation of that quintessential moment in Harry's life: he finally gets to 'speak' to his loving parents but only a point when his life is at its greatest risk, when he doesn't even get to say goodbye again in the swirl of light and darkness. The young actors are getting better ever time out and their supporting cast keeps adding more talented actors. This is an all time great adventure fantasy film."

For Voldemort, Mad-Eye Moody, Cho Chang, and Cedric Diggory, they picked extraordinary actors, they were exactly like I had imagined them. Even though it wasn't in the book, the scene with Ron and Professor McGonagall dancing was very funny. I loved the scenes with the 3 tasks, they were done exceptionally well and they were great! But in contrast to the things I liked, there were also some things I didn't like. For example: The beginning was very confusing to people who haven't read the book. They don't know who the old man was (the old man was Frank Bryce by the way, the Riddle family's gardener, but the Riddles had been mysteriously killed, and Frank Bryce now looked after the house). They also changed the whole Quidditch World Cup scene to where almost nothing happened like it should have, and the house elves were completely cut out! But they couldn't put in everything! For how long GoF is (734 pages I think, not 100% sure, that number is off the top of my head) they did awesome and I give it a 10!"

Plus, they hardly explained anything about Professor Moody, and they definitely messed up the Yule Ball. I really, really wanted to love this movie, and I waited forever for it, but I can't help being disappointed. Not as good as the others. I know a few people who saw this movie who had not read the book, and they were totally confused, because there was not enough information given. Furthermore, there were supposed to be all sorts of Magical Creatures in the maze. I kept waiting for some to appear, but they never did. However, I was impressed with the first and second tasks. They were spectacular."

","I know that I have graded this movie very harshly, however, given that it is based on my favorite of the books, i can not help but feel greatly disappointed. It also does not help that this movie came on the heels of Prisoner of Azkaban, which is so far my favorite of the films, and was masterfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron. I felt that this movie contained almost no character development. It seems as if the characters hardly ever even converse. The movie also felt very rushed, as it offers practically no justification for what happens in it. I know that it can be difficult to cram a 700 or so page book into a two and a half hour movie, but it has been done before, and there must be a better way than this."

","How any reviewer can claim this to be the best Potter film yet utterly astounds me.<br/><br/>Newell's direction is phoned in. Bland camera-work and poor performances from precocious theatre school cherubs is propped up on a decidedly dodgy crutch of huge CGI establishing shots and yet another promise of ""more to come"". Yet this is the fourth film and we're STILL waiting.<br/><br/>Best thing about the picture is Brendan Gleeson. Fiennes is OK, but thinks he's playing a villain in the 1980 Flash Gordon film.<br/><br/>Oldman, Rickman, Coltrane - wasted. And Michael Gambon is a poor substitute for Richard Harris.<br/><br/>Bring back Alfonso (Azkeban's director). There was a man that instilled J.K.

"ss454327-1","6","1","2","21 April 2006"," Weakest of the series
","I liked this movie from a movie standpoint but when you consider the book it's from you have to feel a bit let down. I understand that some things have to be left out when you consider the movie is already 2 1/2 hours long and to include everything from the book would make it 2x longer but knowing the series is going to continue means you can't leave out pertinent information. I certainly hope that some of the things left out of GoF are not just dropped from OotP because that would be terrible considering some things continue into HBP and possible the last book. I also have to say that adding things that were not in the book is a waste of time they could have used to put in some of the REAL story. I hope OotP is even better. I didn't mind the way PoA was a little different from the book because it kept all the important stuff and was so close to be accurate that it's hard to notice. The first two were so much like the book that most readers would be able to skip the first 2 books and go strait to PoA without losing anything. Maybe JK wanted the movies and books to differ so everyone would say ""See the movie for the action and read the book for the story..."" That way she wins twice."
"rebeccakscope","7","1","2","17 April 2006"," hhmmm... Two minds
","I'm in two minds about his film... I thought it was rather good in places (e.g, the bathroom scene with Moaning Myrtle, it was great to see her again!), but it did have a few terrible bits (e.g, the Goblet of Fire, I mean, come on Newall, it's meant to be similar to the Holy Grail, a 'roughly hewn wooden cup', not some random antique chalice!). Having said that, the Phelps twins did pull of some spectacular acting, as did Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the others...except Emma Watson... I feel her acting has suddenly deteriorated (her 'Ron, you spoilt everything!' scene was a over-dramatic and whiny... Not exactly the way one would expect Hermione Granger to behave...). Michael Gambon irritated me in this film; Dumbledore wouldn't treat Harry the way he does in this movie... I was also disappointed with Ludo Bagmans disappearance... but David Tennant redeemed the film a little with his wonderful performance as Barty Crouch Jr. All in all, I think this movie is fair, almost the same quality as the second, outstripping the third by far (I didn't really like the way the director created that one...), and a generally good film."
"Ashlee101","9","1","2","26 March 2006"," Excellent Film
","Out of the previous three Potter films, this was the film I was looking foreword to the most as Goblet of Fire is one of my favourite Potter books. The pictures and trailers made this film seem fantastically brilliant and the film lived up to the hype.<br/><br/>What I really noticed is the improvement of acting from the young cast. Daniel Radcliffe greatly improved on the dramatic scenes, his crying was cringe worthy in PoA and I was very happy with his performance in the graveyard and the aftermath of it. Rupert Grint has once again managed to take his character to where Ron needed to be. For the other three films Ron was the comical best friend, but in Goblet of Fire Ron matures and becomes more angry, and Rupert performed this act flawlessly and he still managed to remain humorous and sarcastic. I was most disappointed with Emma Watson's performance with Hermione, her acting is slipping and she sounded as if she was going to burst into tears even when there was an extremely happy moment and was nothing to cry about.<br/><br/>The new actors were fantastic. Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory was spot on brilliant, although we didn't see much of Mr. Diggory but when we did see him Robert portrayed Cedric flawlessly and was a real joy to watch until his tragic demise. Stanislav Ianevski was pretty good, it would have been nice to see more of his acting skills, but from the little bit I saw he seems to be a decent actor and I hope to see him in other things after Potter. Same with Clemence Posey, I've seen her in other things and it was a treat to see her portray Fleur Delacour, she's not only beautiful but she can act.<br/><br/>I did have some things I was a bit upset with. A lot of the book was cut, and I knew somethings had to be cut for the sake of timing, but the film was very choppy and it seemed to leave some gapes that should have been filled. Barty Crouch Jr. was played by the brilliant David Tennent, but his character had a lot of holes and his whole purpose was un-explained.<br/><br/>I give this film a 9 out of 10, Watson's acting and some of the missing parts made this film a bit enjoyable, but overall this is the best Potter film yet, I laughed, I cried and nearly screamed at some parts. Hope film five keeps the Potter legacy alive."

","*There are some clearly marked spoilers near the end of this, in case anyone cares* <br/><br/>First off, I should say that I'm only a borderline Potter fan. I still haven't got around to reading the sixth book, but I've read the rest. On top of that, what kind of Potter fan waits until this has been out on DVD for a month to see it? Exactly. I enjoyed the 3rd one, but it didn't exactly leave me excited to watch this. I was actually quite surprised; not only was it better than #3, Id even go so far as to call it the best of the lot! Mike Newell continued the dark atmosphere that Alfonso CuarÃ³n introduced in the third movie, which was a rather nice touch. I've said it before and Ill say it again however, Daniel Radcliffe isn't a great actor. He's not terrible or anything, but he is dwarfed in comparison to his very talented co-stars. Emma Watson in particular, Id really like to see her in something other than the Potter saga. Surprisingly talented young actress. There was a great chemistry between the actors, especially the three leads. The supporting cast was good as well, though the best were very underused. Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman deserved to be in this much longer than they were. Both are great actors who play great characters in the saga, and they were each on screen for a total of about 5 minutes. Ralph Finnes was great as Voldemort, very creepy and well done. The effects were great every step of the way. To sum up this rambling review, I throughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* <br/><br/>The one big problem that I had with it was the lack of character development on Cedric. In the book, his death was a very upsetting and powerful event, though in the film he wasn't a character that they made you care about. He was just sort of...there. That didn't ruin the film, but it definitely detracted some points...<br/><br/>*End Spoiler* <br/><br/>8/10"
"knight_armour","6","1","2","24 March 2006"," Getting Worse
","This latest installment of Harry Potter was a bit of a letdown. First off let me declare that I have never read any of the books (and probably never will; I have more important things to read). I also never read Lord of The Rings either. The point being that I don't think it's necessary to read any books that have been transferred to the big screen. A movie should be able to stand on its own. The first three films were quite engrossing with all the special effects and intriguing characters but this one shifted focus too much between former and new characters. The threat of Voldermort returns yet again and it's getting pretty old. Harry Potter still has no composure whilst Ron is just as idiotic as he's always been. Hermoine is growing up but there's too little focus on her. Some parts of the movie were quite difficult to understand too. I get the impression they think we would have or perhaps should later buy and read the book. I don't really have a problem with these kids growing up on screen and don't believe it's the reason why this movie was not as interesting as its predecessors. The reason it wasn't as good is probably because too many scenes are wasted on trivial matters instead of developing characters and good dialog. In a way, it's similar to the new Spider-man movies where he just can't decide what he wants to be and takes the 'good guy' thing too far. Harry better shape up and get something going on with Hermoine in the next film. And they should kill off Ron in the next movie."

","The movie was pretty good overall, but the ending had me feeling depressed. Out of all the movies I've seen, the ending when Amos Diggory had his little soap opera-esquire moment on Cedric's body was the most depressing thing I've ever seen. I'm not going to forget this. It almost made me cry. And they didn't even need it. Sure, the loss was something heavy on Amos Diggory's mind, but this is supposed to be an action movie. And the violins and the ""NOOOOOOOOO!!! That's my boy! My SON!!!! BOOOO-HOOOOO!!!"" was sadder than the Field of Dreams ending. I would've minded it if this was a non-fantasy movie since that's what can really happen in real life, but really people: Was the boohoo Amos Diggory crying 2 minutes of depression and emotional scarring really worth putting in the movie? I don't think so. I bet Cedric will end up coming back to life in the seventh movie and kicking some Voldemort butt alongside Mr. and Mrs. Potter, Dumbledore, Sirius, Frank Bryce, and whoever else dies that was on the good side. And imagine Neville Longbottom being the Heir of Slytherin!"

","It is impossible to make a movie based on a book that will please all fans, but you have to wonder if any of these directors or writers have looked at the books, because how can you direct or write something that you know nothing about? Why can't Rowling write the scripts? Even if attempts are made to make a film that doesn't resemble the book, it has to resemble something. Fans don't like this because the book has been gutted and newcomers haven't the slightest clue what is going on because nothing explanatory has been added. Action and suspense have been enhanced in the last two movies and now it is coherence that is fading away. The movie looks great. The first two challenges were good, the scene where Sirius Black's face appears in a pile of ash was brilliant, and casting Ralph Fiennes and Miranda Richardson as (the snake-like) Lord Voldemort and (the sleazy) Rita Skeeter were acts of genius. The problem is that you could put the greatest director of all time in the seat and if he doesn't have a view on what he is directing and a great script(damn you Steve Kloves) than he will fail. This should have been the greatest Harry Potter film yet, instead it is the weakest since Harry Potter and The Sorceror's Stone. I don't care if J.K Rowling or Daved Yates's version of Harry Potter and The Order of Phoenix goes into movie theater's, as long as there is somebody who takes this stellar cast and makes a fine movie out of this pivotal book."

After reading the Book I see a few things were missing but overall it was still a very Good adaption. Though the Dragon Scene plays out better in the Movie then it was written in the book. And the Maze scene is not as exciting as it written in the book. There are some key elements missing from the books that is explain in the dialog of the movie so you have to listen carefully to everything that is said But overall it is still a 12 for those who have not read the books.

Yeah, it was, too dark. I prefer to see what is happening. Yes, I know, I'm just playing word games. Next time, they should turn on some lights.<br/><br/>And, yes I understand that some things need to be cut or adjusted for the sake of time and flow ... unfortunately the changes they made were just terrible.<br/><br/>And, finally, I wasn't thrilled about the casting. With the exception of Brendan Gleeson, the new characters were just not up to what I would have hoped, and a few of the returning characters were very weak here too.<br/><br/>All things considered, I think this one was the worst of the HP movies.

","I am an avid reader of the Harry Potter series, and I found this movie EXTREMELY disappointing. In my opinion, it was nothing like the book. Like the others, they always put stupid stuff in that wasn't in the book and take out important or interesting things that are. I was severely disappointed when Mr. Columbus didn't direct after the first two since his were MUCH closer to the book than this one and the third one. My advice is to rent it if you haven't seen it yet and buy it when it comes out if A) you are a fan of either the books or the movies or B) like to watch good actors playing good characters being portrayed as idiots. I feel terribly for Ms. Rowling having to see her books massacred like that."

Make Harry and Hermione like each other till the Order of the Pheonix? That's a good sign. But still, the Goblet of Fire focuses on Harry getting a date!

"Jack-Bateman","5","1","2","9 January 2006"," 'Goblet of Fire was one of the most disappointing films I saw all year'
","Having read all the (excellent) books I was eagerly awaiting the Harry Potter film series. My disappointment was crushing when I saw the drivel that was released as Harry Potter 1 and 2. Suddenly book three was upon us with a new director and a much darker feel to it - it seemed as if the series would redeem itself from then onwards. Alas it wasn't to be as Goblet of Fire was one of the most disappointing films I saw all year. The intention of cutting most of J.K.Rowlings narrative is a good one (the book is over 600 pages long) but it is this narrative that makes the story so compelling to read. As a film the same story seems thin, either too slow or too rushed and until we see Lord Voldemort only the Tournament Tasks revive us from our slumber. The child actors are not going to cut it in the world of adult acting and it is up to the superb cast of British National Theatre actors (Maggie Smith etc) to give the film a degree of respectability.<br/><br/>Goodness knows what they will do to book 5 (the longest by far of the series) to make it film worthy. Here is my tip: The final part of Lord of the Rings was over three and a quarter hours long but far better for it. There is no rule stating all films should be 150 minutes, so go for lavish detail, thicker narrative and save the Harry Potter film series."
"sammyl2002","8","1","2","24 December 2005"," a tasty movie this is!
","I was a bit skeptic about the movie especially after I saw the trailer. It seemed to me they followed the way of the awful Lord of the Rings stacking separate episodes of the book in a senseless sequence and filling screen time with enormous special effects. Well, now I should admit I was completely wrong. Goblet is a quite tense movie. It has its own pace, breathing deep and breathing hard running intact with the action. And then the details are what pleased me most. They are the point of any movie, ""words"" of movie language. And the creators of Goblet managed to put the book into this language and not to spoil the main plot line. The only weak point I noticed is that maturing of the heroes goes somewhat apart of the action. Still this does not spoil the movie much. I rank it 8 and believe Goblet is keeping on the way Cuaron had chosen with his Prisoner of Azkaban."
"MartinPh","5","1","2","24 December 2005"," This time, the magic only comes from the computer
","Let me begin by saying I haven't read any of the books, nor do I plan to, so I'm judging the film for what it is by itself. Basically, after having seen it twice, I remain unconvinced. It lacks the stylistic and narrative coherence of PoA, which remains easily the best of the 4 present HP movies. The first half of GoF in fact was a major disappointment: it seemed HP had fallen to the level of the next thirteen-in-a-dozen CGI action movie, and I expected Bruce Willis to turn op any moment. Sure, the special effects are more than a few notches up from the now endearingly clumsy efforts in part 1, but as we all know by now special effects alone don't make a movie. Fortunately, the second half is rather better. Beautiful imagery all through, and believable and touching emotions accompanying the much anticipated ""Death"". I wish, though, that Radcliffe and Watson would act with a little more spontaneity; maybe HP should stop clenching his jaws all the time? There is a lot of humor in GoF too, which in a way is nice, though incongruous at times. It's also a symptom of this movie trying to be too many things at once. The rock-band at the Xmas ball was one tongue in cheek joke too many, IMHO, and detracted from the believability of Hogwarts. Believability, on the whole, was my main problem with the film, and I suspect that may well be J.K. Rowling's fault rather than anyone else's. Of course the HP stories require ""suspension of disbelief"" - but that does not imply that all sense of logic and consistency can just be thrown overboard. Just a few of my niggles:<br/><br/><ul><li>HP is a wizard, isn't he? So why, at crucial moments, doesn't he use magic? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>*spoiler*: The whole point of the plot was to get HP over to the graveyard where Voldemort could get to him. For this aim Barty Crouch Jr. (alias Moody) has changed the Triwizard Cup into a ""portkey"". Why didn't he simply change any object HP would touch into a portkey? - he could have done without the entire tournament, it would have been so much quicker and easier! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>*spoiler*: Why, if Voldemort needs HP's living blood to revive himself, does he force him through a potentially deadly tournament? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Prof. MacGonagall is deeply shocked when Moody turns Malfoy into a ferret to teach him a lesson - ""We do not use transformation as a punishment""; yet she apparently sees no problem in sending several students into a potentially deadly contest.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How come HP doesn't recognize Wormtail, whom he met in the previous episode as Peter Pettigrew?</li></ul><br/><br/>Et cetera, et cetera. I'm also bothered by the ""deus ex machina"" device that Rowling constantly applies to get HP out of his predicaments - in this case, the sudden and unexplained appearance of his parents. It makes for very unsatisfying plots. The believability of Voldemort isn't helped either by making him into one of those verbose villains who are compelled to give a speech and explain, explain, explain, before coming to the point (after the hilarious gag made of this in The Incredibles, no movie-maker can afford this any longer). Why would an evil man like Voldemort bother?? (Nor could I believe in Crouch Jr as a villain, but that's due to the fact that I only knew David Tennant as the incredibly silly hypocrite Mr. Gibson in ""He knew he was right""...)<br/><br/>All in all: good entertainment for viewers who like visual thrills and are focused or sleepy enough not to look too far beyond them."

","This movie was killer. I know that there are people out there that get all agitated because certain things get cut out and whatnot. But that doesn't make the movie any more or less good. This movie was the best on thus far. In fact, they only get better with each one. The first two were good, but they were very kiddie-friendly. With the characters becoming teenagers, the stories have matured and become darker. Yes, there are things that are cut out, but this will always be so. If you've read the book, forget all about it while watching the film. Just view the film as if you had never heard it before. You will find that it is a remarkable film. The characters are as dimensional as they need to be. The story is told well. And who really cares if Dumbledore shakes Harry. It's not in my character to shake people, but if it were me, I would have beat Harry down. Yes, it's out of character, but it's not out of the question. This film is great. Go see it if you haven't already. If you have, go see it again. If you have read the book and keep comparing it to he book, go back and see it over and over until you can view it without comparing it to the book at all.

","The movie is about Harry Potter's fourth year in Hogwarts and that means we're going to see more troubles. It's so nice to see the kids growing up, especially the Weasley twins. They are the clown of the show and their appearances on screen are awaited. This year's highlight is the occurrence of the Triwizard Tournament held in Harry's school. Students from other wizarding schools came to compete. When Harry became one of the contestant, people's reactions varied from envy to worry. He had to work his way on this without the usual help from his pals. Meanwhile, he was also haunted by his recurring nightmare about Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>What stands out from this movie was its intenseness. You barely had time to blink. I got a little nervous waiting for this movie because Alfonso Cuaron did a great job with the third movie and I was wondering whether or not this one will live to the expectation. But this movie turned out to be so much better, because without further ado it just moved on a high speed presenting the story of the amazing things that happen in Harry's magical world that we loved. These include the Quidditch World Cup that was so exciting to see.<br/><br/>We know that Harry's life at this point is more difficult than it's ever been and the story itself has been developed into a more serious phase, but somehow Mike Newell managed to deliver the funny scenes brilliantly. It was wonderful of him to put that amount of fun in this supposed-to-be-darker Harry Potter movie and still finding ways to make the movie as dark and scary as it supposed to be. Even though, due to the movie's speed, sometimes the nuance of one scene was so different than the next and when I wasn't ready for the change yet, it got me a little confused emotionally.<br/><br/>As for Ralph Fiennes, all I can say is, on the scene where Voldemort met Harry, I, indeed forgot that Harry's even there, maybe it's the charisma that did it, whether it's Fiennes' or Voldemort's. And I personally think that, the shots the camera took several times on Radcliffe (who was only squirming) while Fiennes was delivering Voldemort's words to other characters were simply to remind us that Harry was there and important to this scene as much as the villain was. But on the other hand, if the situation was created on purpose, and audiences were supposed to forget about Harry at that moment, the job's marvelously done, big thanks to Fiennes."

Although the books are portrayed as children's books, the film versions are a different story.<br/><br/>However, I thoroughly enjoyed it..as I have the others. There are some issues with some of the younger actors, but these 'imperfections' have grown on me and have now become part of the film.<br/><br/>Although I thought the 'new' Dumbledore has done a good job considering the actor he had taken over from...I did prefer the original portrayal of the boss man. He was very regal and commanding, with obvious respect from everyone around him. The new one on the other hand is quite scatty and wired, which is not how I imagine Dumbledore to be.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book since it first came out, so my memory of the story was quite poor. This was intentional as I was fully prepared for the film to deviate from the book.. It does stick to the story well, but there is so much that is rushed or missed out completely, that I would have liked it to either be split into a two part film, or made longer.

"gluttony14","8","1","2","13 December 2005"," A good movie, but a few bumps are pulling it down
","This was a great movie. It managed to turn a 650 pages long book into a 2 and a half hour long movie, and it does so spectacularly. It manages to avoid feeling quite as rushed as the previous movies, despite having far more content. Even viewers who haven't read the book will enjoy themselves and be able to follow, although they may feel a bit lost at some points.<br/><br/>Now, we'll begin with the good parts in the movie: first of all, the special effects were breathtaking. The Hungarian Horntail dragon looked fearsome and realistic and made the first task a truly breathtaking spectacle and one of my favorite scenes in the movie. The acting was also a strong point: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson improved greatly, and Brendon Gleeson gave an excellent performance as Mad-eye Moody, as he managed to be as insane and scary as the book portrayed him to be. Alan Rickman stole the show, despite having an extremely short scene. But even then, his Snape is so cynical and menacing he has no competition on the screen. And finally, I have to mention this, Emma Watson looks absolutely stunning in the Yule Ball.<br/><br/>However, the movie has its share of problems. The first and foremost is the damage done to three major characters: Dumbledore, Crouch and Voldemort. Dumbledore has turned from a wise and calm, if somewhat aloof, wizard who can display his tremendous power into an old person who is quick to anger and has trouble figuring out what's going on around him. This was definitely the most unpleasant change, because Dumbledore's character is one that should give the feeling of a fatherly figure in Harry's life, but in this movie he is merely a headmaster. Crouch was supposed to be a strict, tough man, with an entirely by-the-rules approach. In this movie, he is naught but a weird old man who seems to abide by the rules not because he believes in order above all else, but because he has no other choice. As for Voldemort, while Ralph Fiennes delivers a great performance as He Who Must Not Be Named, it is also entirely over-the-top. Voldemort is far too melodramatic - he is a ruthless, bold-blooded murderer and yet he gets so worked up over capturing his enemy? It doesn't make much sense. While this was the major problem in the movie, there were a few others: Fleur and Krum, who were Triwizard Champions, were given extremely small roles. They barely had 3 lines each, and Fleur was especially left out (Krum at least had a relationship with Hermione). Also, it would have been nice to actually see Gary Oldman. He did have a role and several lines, but all we saw was a CGI version of his face made out of ash and burning firewood. I'd have preferred to actually see him in person. Another problem was that there was a feeling of somewhat of a mess in the movie - at times it seemed as if they tried to cram in as much as they could in the 2 and a half hours and it just fell apart. A good example is Rita Skeeter who gives a magnificent performance in the first half of the movie then disappears without her plot line ever being closed. The time spent on her would have been better used to actually show the Quidditch World Cup. The final problem was the ""Do the Hippogriff"" song in the Yule Ball. It was entirely unnecessary: it was a silly song that only damaged the movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>In short, this is a good movie. Definitely worth a watch, whether you're a hardcore Potter fan or not. It does have some issues though, that I hope will be taken care of in the next movie."
"goldmember25","3","1","2","12 December 2005"," Not only does it butcher the book, but it's a bad movie as well
","This movie is extremely fast-paced and if you haven't read the book, odds are, you'll be confused out of your mind. If you have read the book, you'll be disappointed beyond belief not only because how much is left out, but what the movie's main focus is on: comedy and romance. The most built up scene in the entire movie is the Yule Ball sadly. The acting is far too over-dramatic and it does not have the same ""feel"" of Harry Potter as the other movies had. The plot and main storyline of the story is left to be in the background as unnecessary comedy, drama, and romance scenes are added in and extended whereas parts such as the Quidditch World Cup, Ludo Bagman, the Dursleys, several classes, and House Elves (just being a few) are left out entirely. I haven't looked through too many comments on this movie though I don't doubt that there are a few people on here commenting about how much the movie had ruined the book. That is to say the least, but the movie needs to be looked at as a movie itself and though it is packed with action and humor, it's main mysterious and dark plot line are thrown to the side for special effects and drama. I found this movie very disappointing because when I was watching the previews I finally had a feeling that they had finally got an HP movie right, but only found it to be the worst of all.

","I was extremely surprised at how well-liked this movie is amongst IMDb users - who are some of the harshest critics I know.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was appalling. Not because of the acting, all cast members did wonderfully - particularly Daniel Radcliffe as Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort and Robert Pattinson as Diggory. The special effects were a huge improvement on the sadly pathetic dementors of the third movie, and although there were some minor issues I had with appearances - Ron's hair was ... not well received, neither was Moody's eye, and for me, Michael Gambon cannot do Dumbledore well because Richard Harris did such an OUTSTANDING job, but he gets points for effort.<br/><br/>My issue with the film was the lack of detail. Rita Skeeter and the trouble she causes was completely ommitted, except for one scene, vital clues about Longbottom's family aren't connected, and where the hell was Dobby? And Winky? And important stuff about Crouch? I understood the movie only because I had read the book, my friend who had not read it (and yes, not everybody slogs through Harry Potter) did not understand Crouch well. The subplots - of which there were many - were focused on quickly - snapshots of each subplot, which is, frankly, not good enough. The directors and screenplay writers NEED to decide what they are ommitting, and what they are keeping, and not show the audience pieces of everything. Yes, the fourth book was a big book, but the fifth was bigger. The fifth movie will now have to recap the fourth in addition to its huge plots and subplots.<br/><br/>The actors did marvellously, and I commend them on a good performance despite a terrible screenplay."
"WereCat513","9","1","2","7 December 2005"," Mixed feelings
","First let me say that I have read all the Harry Potter books. I am not biased as far as the movies go because that is a totally different deal. Watching the film though, I felt as if I was watching it in fast forward. The film felt rushed. I understand that there is quite a bit of material in the book to sort through and bring to life in a film but had I not read the books I would have been totally confused as to how to follow it. I brought along with me to the theater an assortment of friends and some have read the books and some have not. Those who had not could not follow along at the pace of the movie and kept asking me questions throughout it. Some who had were still totally confused. I liked the look of the film, was blown away by it actually and the special effects as well but as far as the storyline goes, it felt rushed through. Thats why I gave it only an 8 because I felt they could have done a bit better. I'll have to see it again though to pick up anything I missed."

","The movie was quite enjoyable, with just the essentials required to complete the story,but u need to read the book to get the minor details. One gets a nice surprise to see the snake come out from the mouth of the skull in the beginning of the movie.The movie is good to watch in the introductory scenes. Mad eye moody does make an impression.The screen time given to the Weasley twins was perfect(unlike previous movies) and all enjoyed their humour.The competitions especially the dragon chasing Harry around the castle is a treat to watch on the big screen.The french girl Clemence Poesy(her name is i think-acts as Fluer)did get an oooh from the crowd as she made her introductory bow. Hermione failed to get the applause, coming down the stairs b4 the ball all decked up...most of the guys here feel Emma Watson is cute but she really needs a sun tan to have looked good (Emma are u listening??)in that dress<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes as lord Voldemort was perfect,the grave yard scenes were good in the artwork and lighting side.I guess due to the time constraint one cannot include all the fine minor details that we enjoy reading in the book. But overall if ur a harry potter fan then its worth a watch."

","Brilliant fourth instalement sees Harry becoming a contestant in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament while also battling his arch nemesis Voldemort and clashing with the latest teenage dilemmas. At times it really scratches the surface without explaining what certain things have to do with the plot of the story and like the others, and not a great problem, it's overlong. The scene with Voldemort seems like it should be in a completely different film. However, unlike the others this is getting greatly more grownup; it has a wonderful romantic presence and has a great deal of emotion and grunt to it. Brendan Gleeson is fantastic as the latest teacher Mad-Eye Moody and so is the, more cameo, appearance by Miranda Richardson."
"mateja007","7","1","2","6 December 2005"," A good movie (although it could be better)
","Like many others, I'm sure, I just couldn't wait to see the new Harry Potter movie. Unfortunately it was already 4. 12 when I finally got the chance to see it. Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't all that bad, butsome things really bothered me (*don't read if you haven't seen it yet and don't want to know what exactly happens*) When the movie started I was really excited. After five minutes I was sitting there, scratching my head. I wished I had the book with me, because I was like ""WTF is going on?"" Some of the beginning scenes seemed really unconnected to me and much of what happened in the book wasn't mentioned at all. Because of the choppy flow the beginning can be a bit confusing to those who have read the book many times and even more so to those who haven't. After another 10  15 minutes I relaxed and started to enjoy the movie. I thought it was pretty good until the Dumbledore-grabbing-Harry incident occurred. I must say that I was a bit shocked. Dumbledore was always portrayed as a friendly, grandfatherly figure. In this movie, Dumbledore was an old man with anger management problems. Not quite what I expected. I don't really blame the actor (even though I don't like him all that much) Some of the acting in this movie was a bit rough and overdone, most noticeably so when Ron and Hermione fought after the Yule Ball. Still, Radcliff's crying was *much* better that in the last HP movie (a cringe-worthy moment if there ever was one) and most of the actors were cooler (ahem*Neville*ahem). You can really see how they're growing up. I'll be really sad when they get too old to play the characters... Despite being the first PG-13 rated movie in the series I thought the humorous scenes acted as a really good counterweight to some of the more violent and scary occurrences the movie presented, making it darker than the others but still light enough. The graphics were good, music acceptable... (I must admit that the band at the Yule Ball surprised me and I'm still having mixed feelings about it.) Another thing that disappointed me was the absence of Ludo Bagman, who I really wanted to see. I'm glad I got to see Rita Skeeter -played by Miranda Richardson who was very convincing as the annoying (but funny) reporter. Another thing I noticed immediately was the lack of Voldemort's red eyes and (my personal opinion) the actors voice that kind of didn't fit with my image of the evil Dark Lord. <br/><br/>I think everyone agrees that changing directors practically every year can't be too good, as everyone has a different style. Still, the change wasn't as noticeable as it was when the third movie came out. I think it's also understandable that a lot of things had to be modified or left out completely to fit a 600+ pages long book in a 2, 5 hours long movie. You just have to know the book. In the end, I give it 7 out of 10. A lot of action and special computer graphics... While it may not be the best movie in the world, it's a must-see for all HP fans around the world. (But, hey, when has the movie ever been better than the book? I think most of us always get a bit disappointed because we have already created our own version of the movie in our heads and it doesn't fit with what the real movie actually looks like...) <br/><br/>P.S Please excuse my rather poor English ( I'm a 15 year old from Slovenia. English is my third language)"

","Living near the Hogwart's castle/school makes watching a Harry Potter film that much more interesting. I really like the compactness of this film--- i think that it was great to condense the book instead of rendering every bit of it--- that is best left for reading methinks. I have been engaged in conversation(s) with people who very intensely love the Potter--- they tell me things that happen in the books and the background of every character--- I have yet to read one word of it but have been piecing things together from the collaborative voice of my friends--- I have decided to stay away from the books for now--- hoping to escape the prison that I see people engaged in (aka) waiting for the 'next' book---- I admit that the films are staying good if not--- getting better---"
"me_edaj","10","1","2","6 December 2005"," OMG it was so FUNNY!
","The book for this movie was so long that it obviously had to be cut down a fair bit, this was a tad annoying because people who don't read the books might be a bit confused -but other than that it was really enjoyable. It was so funny, i was laughing at least once in every scene!...so be careful when you're eating your popcorn and stuff. The cg effects were really good and most were believable, Also for girls or guys if you want, Daniel Radcliffe looks like hes grown up quite a bit...you'll see what i mean when you see the movie! I really recommend you see this at the movies-i know someone who hates Harry Potter but still thought the movie was good! So yea see it!"
"TotalRonFan","7","1","2","6 December 2005"," Dumbledore's character was out!
","I did enjoy the movie but Dumbledore's character was definitely out and i didn't like that at all. Even though i understood that they needed to cut and changed things, i think they could still have done it better. i did really enjoy the humour they put in it and the fact that it was really like a school in the UK was very authentic. All in all though it was done very well. didn't understand why they missed out stuff in the maze but those moving bushes were scary and when Fleur gets dragged under was also creepy. Thought Voldormort could have been scarier. I think that Mad-Eye was fantastic, funny and really a good character. Thats about it!"
"vicks87","10","1","2","5 December 2005"," One word UNIMAGINABLE
","Why do you people compare the Potter books to the films? I mean they're totally different things. I thought that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the best Potter film so far. Whoever thought that the film wasn't long enough or that they missed a lot of the book, FINE but I suggest you have a go at directing the film yourself and then we'll see how you could turn a 636 page book into a normal lenght film. As a huge fan of both the books and the films I think that you could enjoy them both without comparing them. I mean in the Goblet of Fire, Radcliffe's performance at the grave yard was absolutely stunning. I could almost feel the pain and fear myself. He just proves he's a real actor with every Potter film that comes out. Grint's just perfect for his character and Watson is so bossy, you can feel Hermione in her. To anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, I suggest you do because it really is a truly fantastic film and don't compare it with the book."

","OK, first let me start by saying that this is probably by far the best of the Harry Potter films so far. Its darker and has more humor and will keep your interest while you are watching. So far so good.<br/><br/>Its got some well handled direction and some imaginative and exciting filmography.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>Harry Potter character hasn't changed since the first movie - sacharin sweet and lacking depth, nevertheless the acting is still way below par from the actor.<br/><br/>Drumbledore also stinks things up, likewise Robbie Coltrane.<br/><br/>In contrast Harmony, Ron Weasley and Brendan Glesson really stood out with some fine performances - especially from Brendan.<br/><br/>The story also suffers, overly long, lacks imagination and is EXTREMELY predictable. With some awful stereotypes used - Irish will certainly find some particularly cringeworthy scenes.<br/><br/>For kids this is great. If you are a fan of the series and/or a very young child then you will love this movie - be aware however that some of the scenes are a bit scary for some children."
"carolethecatlover","Null","1","2","5 December 2005"," The Best Yet, Pay Mark Newell MORE!
","Excellent! The direction is spot on. I was horrified to learn that M. Newell only got a million, and Columbus got 10 million. Give Mr. Newell a second and a third to direct. Rupert remains best actor and gets better and better. Harris was a better Dumbledore! Well edited. Great Music, more thought on the costumes, lovely beasts. The essence of 'teenager' distilled perfectly, minus the spots....did they get CGFX'd out? I can't believe they ALL had perfect skin. Loved the Phelps twins, the true Fred and George, Very good. Ralph Feinnes adds another excellent villain to his repertoire. He does such great villains, and I bet he's a nice chap really. Love Snape as usual. This is the best yet. Carole <br/><br/>But what's with all that 70s hair?"
"SILMARILLI","3","1","2","4 December 2005"," Poorly done. Lost is the essence, and Magic of the Potter films.
","The first two Harry Potter films were and are ENCHANTINGLY MAGICAL! Although a little rough on the special effects, they greatly improve from the first the the second films. The third movie, Pisoner of Azkaban, was a much darker film, and lost some of the luster and magic. It even had some evil connotations that were not in the book and should not have been in the movie, shrunken heads, spinal-column candle sticks!!!......Not what I would have expected from Hogwarts.....The extremely poor recasting of the HeadMaster Dumbledore further dragged the movie down (even given that Richard Harris is a hard act to follow)....... Even so the third movie worked and was enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Now with the 4Th installment of the series, Goblet of Fire, all the essence and Magic of the stories and especially the book is gone. The total mangling of Dumbledore's character to the exact opposite of the book, just made things worse. Gone is the wise and powerful Wizard of the books, leaving a bumbling old fool, very poorly done and greatly dragged the story down. Also gone are some of the most important characters and story lines that are essential not only to the storyline but also lead into the fifth, book Order of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>There is no Dabby, winky, or Weasley's Wizardly Weezes. True the 4th book is much longer, and to fit it all in a 2-1/2 hour movie something has to go. The problems is the movie, in places, dwells on meaningless things and leaves out some of the most important to the story and are tags into the 5th book.<br/><br/>In the Tournament Harry is made out to be much less a hero than in the book, he is somehow made to seem much less capable than he is.<br/><br/>The acting from the young actors was very wooden and often lacked emotion. This I noticed right off. I was most disappointed by Emma Watson who nailed it in Azkaban, by giving a very rich, emotional, performance. But here she seemed almost like she really didn't want to be in the movie or something. This made me sad, for I am a big fan of Emma's, and think that in a few years, she will become an absolutely stunning leading lady. Overall I got the feeling the young actors where trying to hard to act grown up or something, maybe it is just teen angst. Mad eye Moody was way over the top.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning, with an awesome sound track, and that is its only good points. It was almost as if all the effort in this film went into the effect and sound track, and the story line and acting were after thoughts........THE MAGIC WAS GONE! If I were to rate the four films ""Sorcers Stone"" - A; ""Chamber or Secrets""- A+; ""Pisoner of Askaban"" - B+ and ""Goblet of Fire"" = C- or even D. I wonder why the films after peaking with Chamber of Secrets have been slowly going down hill. I have two theories on this. Grossly incompetent interference by studio exec's or Grossly incompetent Directing. Then I looked at who directed the four films so far and the reason became clearer. Chris Columbus directed that first two and thus the MAGICAL quality and feel to the films, Alfonso Cuarón directed the third thus the slight loss of Magical feel to the film, but still a good flick. Mike Newell direct this film (4th) which was out of his depth thus the poor quality and loss of Magical feel to the film. Don't get me wrong Newell is a great director and has done many great works, he simple just does not have the feel for directing Harry Potter.<br/><br/>I hope Columbus does the next or I fear the next film will be even worse, and please get a better Dumbledore, as strange as it seems Sean Connery or Rodger Moore come to mind......Ah maybe not......But then again anyone would be better.........<br/><br/>P.S. To IMDb please quit trying to download SPY-WARE onto peoples computers!!!"
"judas_kiss","9","1","2","1 December 2005"," Its very Greek Drama
","You really need to have read the books to understand this movie. Its a great way to market the books and make the 3 people in each country who haven't read the books buy 10 copies each! Its like Greek drama in this fashion - Greek theatre goers knew the beginning middle end and continuation of every comedy and drama that they watched - just like the majority of the people who went to see this film. Its a great visual expression of the book and it particularly captures the stumbling panic that Harry felt competing in the Goblet of Fire with everyone pushing at him from every angle (better even than the book did). The SFX are awesome and i loved the Hungarian horntail. They removed the exact right elements to translate the book and make it work on the big screen. The first 40 minutes or so are very frenetic and rushed though the last 2 hours more than make up for it when the movie finally settles into its stride."
"gstark-1","1","1","2","28 November 2005"," Missing the Magic
","I looked forward to this installment of the Potter series with anticipation and hope that the magic in Rowling's story would be present. The film fails in this because it the story is told up front and close. All depth to the story is fuzzy and blotted out. Missing are countless characters in the storythat effect Harry Potters life. The Ghosts, Dobby, The Dursley's, Mrs. Weasley, and as always Peeves the Poltergeist. (In my opinion, if the dragon scene had been presented as Rowling's wrote it, there would have been time to add some of the MIA's.) Key elements of the story are missing, other elements are incomplete, and the director and the writer have taken great liberties that are uncalled for. People come to see Rowling's story visually expressed; anything else is a waste."
"g_alan_e","6","1","2","25 November 2005"," Based on half the novel by J. K. Rowling
","That was my comment when ""Based on the novel by J. K. Rowling"" came up in the end credits.<br/><br/>It _is_ a good movie on its own, but it's going to upset many plot applecarts for the later movies with all the stuff left out and the changes.<br/><br/>It opens with the caretaker scene in the old mansion, with Barty Crouch Jr. added, but not identified yet. Then it jumps to Hermione waking up Harry and Ron at the Weasleys to go to the Quidditch World Cup. They portkey right to the wizard camp and all the bits with muggles are left out (there's not a spot of anything muggle in the whole movie). Then it cuts to just before they go to the Weasley's tent where there's a good scene then *fwing!* they're climbing up to their seats at the Quidditch match where they run into the Malfoys for a bit of banter.<br/><br/>Then it's another jump to the teams' entrances, which is all you get to see of the QWC! There's no fairy gold, Ron has the fancy telescope with no explanation of how, and worst of all, the Bulgarian's cheerleaders aren't shown so there's nothing about the veela, which leads to there being nothing about Fleur being part veela. (THAT is going to cause trouble in later movies!) After the non-match, it's a jump cut back to Weasley's tent, just in time for the Death Eaters to blow up the camp, they're just walking around like the KKK in black robes, no torturing of muggles. Crouch Jr. (still unidentified) is shown setting the Dark Mark.<br/><br/>After all that quick jumping, the movie finally settles down a bit and gets into a more steady flow.<br/><br/>As for the three tests, only Harry's dragon battle is shown, and other than ""Accio Firebolt!"" it's totally different and needlessly drawn out, and not a bit of humor in the fight. (I was like ""What?! He doesn't win by giving the dragon severe conjunctivitis?) Sticking closer to the book here would've at least allowed showing Cedric's battle! The lake test is the segment most true to the book and very well done. (If you've read the book, there's nothing more to say about that!) The maze was a big letdown. No blast ended skrewts, no Sphinx, no monsters at all other than the maze itself.<br/><br/>The resurrection and fight with Voldemort was quite well done, but it left out the bit where Harry and Voldemort fly into the air while their wands are magically connected. (That would have reinforced the concept that they were connected.) I'm looking forward to the extended cut DVD, since there are several posts here by people who saw early screenings saying it was three or more hours long! Hopefully there is quite a bit of footage, especially early in the film, to put back in and make it less jumpy."
"psychokitty17","1","1","2","26 November 2005"," Awful and didn't do the book justice.
","I thought that the film was awful. But i also felt that it didn't do the book much justice. The goblet of fire is my favourite book and there are loads of things which are explained in the book which aren't in the film like how harry got into the prefects bathroom, how he found out the accio part etc. But also other parts like the mer-people and the dragon were also quite fascinating and when Cedric got killed it was also very sad. I thought that the part in the maze was also really really good and the port key was well illustrated. The Dark Mark was a huge disappointment as was the start part and the reappearance of James and Lilly Potter Harrys parents. The quiditch world cup was fantastic and harry fighting the Hungarian horntail was to. The yule ball was wrecked in parts but Hermione looked stunning and should have her hair straight most of the time but in the book it doesn't turn into a rock concert which is what it seemed to turn into. Who on earth won the wizard world cup and also the part where harry has a rather spectacular escape which was unfortunately left out of the film. The director was rubbish and should never be able to touch another harry potter movie sirius should have been in more the flu network was extremely badly represented there was only one lesson which was not good at all the absolutely nothing in the film was explained at all. I hated the film but i would recommend it to people who cant be bothered to read the book but wouldn't recommend it to people who like the books. I dread to think how dumbledores going to react in the next film because the way he reacted when Harry's name came out of the goblet was atrocious and he wouldn't even do that to a pupil of hogwarts let alone harry. The dragon doesn't escape from the pen or his chain doesn't break and if it did then there would be people there to stop the massive chase after. The scene in the graveyard was really bad and voldermort was extremely badly interpreted. Id rate it 0 but you cant so ill rate it 1. Bitterly Bitterly Disappointed."
"doritacaferletti","2","1","2","27 November 2005"," I miss Dumbledor's character
","A year and a half of delay to see this result, it frankly seems to me disappointing. I know very well, that is quite difficult to adapt a book to a film. The book contains an immense wealth of details, explanations, feelings, emotions, relations, etc. that is almost impossible to captured completely in a film. But I believe at least, the director and scriptwriter (who work side by side, I suppose), must know the book's plot very well, of such way, that in the adaptation it's understood perfectly, why happens each thing, which are the relations between the characters, which are the personalities of the characters, which are the important facts. Lamentably, nothing of this I could perceive in CoF. First, which has affected to me more, is Dumbledor. He didn't look in anything to the one described in books. On the contrary, he seemed old, doubtful, violent poor man (shakes Potter)fearful, ""shouting"". Who could think that he is the greatest wizard of the world? He doesn't inspire respect. On the other hand, I don't remember that Snape hit to Harry nor Ron. His mistreat always was verbal, never physical. The Wesley twins are older than the trio (Harry, Hermione, Ron) therefore, could not be in the same class with Snape. I've got the feeling that director wanted to show a lot of things from the book, but simultaneously... there is nothing. I believe that the details that appear, are not sufficient so that a person who hasn't read books can understand everything clearly what happened in the film. I think it isn't an acting problem, because the actors make enough good. In fact, I believe the kids, in general, have improved. The adult actors, I cannot either complain. The actors render what a director is able to obtain from them, according to which requires his film. Then, I believe that in this case, Mike Newell, he is the one who changed Dumbledor's personality... and it really causes sorrow to me. I feel like Newell, did not read any book of Harry Potter or simply he understood another stuff. The film, in general, entertains, it's got romance, thriller, it remembers the adolescence to you (if it's that already you passed it), has interesting special effects, casting is well, but for the people whom they like plus books, I don't believe that they like much this adaptation."
"drapp","7","1","2","26 November 2005"," Flashy Superficial Treatment with Damsels in Distress
","At first blush the movie comes across well; but by the end you are left feeling you watched a highlight reel. Others I have spoken with mentioned getting restless in the last 45 minutes; which they hadn't done in the previous movies. The movie has great special effects, is sufficiently dark to equate to the book; but simply does not maintain a well-edited flow of a story. Granted, the movie needed to cut a good portion of the book to fit into the time constraints. Sadly, the choice of scenes and script did a mediocre choice of what to put on film.<br/><br/>A key element of the book was the attack at the match grounds and subsequent deaths, all part of the plan for ""ethnic cleansing"" and Voldemort's return. The panic this engendered was dealt with to a mild degree during the course of the movie; but never actually explained. Instead, you had a random attack by people in hoods, a death here, a death there, etc. No real rationale was given, nor a hint that they were related. Those having not read the novels are left without essential basic information to the plot.<br/><br/>One glaring trend throughout the book is that the director apparently has a very low opinion of the female of the species; as opposed to the portrayal in the novels. The primary purpose of females in the movie appeared to be as arm-hangers and damsels in distress tied to the track awaiting rescue. Emma Watson was primarily a love-struck water-carrier and Clémence Poésy was a simpering incompetent either getting trounced or needing rescue. Even little niggling things like showing the dragons of the three male competitors; but not the female became noticeable in the running trend. For reasons of full disclosure, I am a father with a daughter. I, like other such fathers, do notice these things.<br/><br/>All in all, it's worth seeing (once). Although, I can understand why Mike Newell was paid one-tenth of what Chris Columbus was paid."
"keitharan","6","1","2","25 November 2005"," If you have not read the book...not as easy to follow as the first 3, not as much depth to plot, not recommended as a first glimpse in Harry Potter line
","A fan of the other HP movies, I am glad to have seen GoF on the big screen, even though for me it was not up to par with the first three. With cast and characters now cemented as familiar old friends, it was nice to visit them once again, and to see they have grown comfortably in acting skill. <br/><br/>As a young adult, Ms Hermione Granger has blossomed from cute kid to beautiful young woman with sex appeal, though I feel a bit of a perv for pointing that out since I am considerably older. But the fact is that adding the dimension of young adulthood to all of the characters helps us more ripened folk stay attracted to the movie series, though one has to wonder if the next HP movie to follow will be the last for this soon to be over-the-pubescent-hill group of actors.<br/><br/>Special effects in HP4 are possibly better in some respects than the first movies. Sadly, the spell that wore off on me is the plot which did not have the depth as the previous movies. This was an adventurous action romp unraveling the dreams(nightmares) of Harry as they entwined with ongoings at Hogwarts. Nothing wrong with that, however, the mystery element in the other HP movies offered more intrigue to keep my interest. The others had twists and curves and a moderately challenging mystery to solve. HP4 carried on more like an action/chase scene. One comment I've heard is that this movie was darker, and short on whimsy compared with the previous HP films. I didn't see that. Plenty of worthy whimsy in HP4 if you ask me, some a bit more sophisticated than the previous films.<br/><br/>I did not read this book, nor any of the HP books (I can just imagine sitting at a coffee shop, at my well-seasoned age, whipping out a Harry Potter book), and this movie lost me at times, but not because it was too complex. It just seemed to have holes that only someone who had read the book could instinctively fill in. <br/><br/>All-in-all a good movie worth seeing if you're a fan of the others, but not recommended to the uninitiated as a first foire in Harry Potter genre."

","The plot is as good as in the other movies, since it is based on the book. However, I wonder what was the director thinking? Several important facts of the book are missing, while other scened that are only briefly or not mentioned at all in the book are played. The movies seems to be made of several short scenes, that for someone that never read the book do not make any sense at all. It is understandable that lots of cuts had to be made to fit such a large book in only one movie... but they could at least have tried to create a movie in which there was a clear connection between the scenes and accessible for everyone(not only to those that read the book). In conclusion: very disappointing and illogical!"

","I loved this movie.<br/><br/>Truth be told, i was a little afraid that this movie was going to be a creepy disappointment like it's predecessor The Prisoner of Azkaban. But I was more than impressed, i was awestruck. Every moment of magic seemed real, and every new character was well done and matched what i had imagined perfectly, especially everything to do with Beauxbaxtons and Durmstrang. The giant ship and flying house sized carriage were done perfectly.<br/><br/>One major problem I had was the Quidditch World Cup, which takes up about a hundred pages in the book, and they only spend five minutes on it!<br/><br/>A couple other things that I had major problems with were things that were just details, like they assign the name of a ""Girls Only"" school to Beauxbaxton, when in the book it is clearly stated a boy is the first to come out of the carriage. Another detail that sort of bothered me was the fact that Karakoff was younger than he was descripted in the book. But, if you don't obsess over details in books, you'll probably give this movie a 10/10"
"lastdomino","6","1","2","24 November 2005"," Harry Potter, the Photo Album
","I love the books, but I still recognize that a book this large cannot be placed into a 2 1/2 hour movie without some revision. That was not the problem. In fact, I only see two problems with it: the director and Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.<br/><br/>The director chose to edit his screen play to work only for people who have read the book. If you have not read the book, this film would be moving too fast for any sense to be made of it. The best description I would place on the movie is that it feels like a magic world photo album montage of the events in the book. One of the things I have found interesting in the previous movies were the segways - very smoothly showing the passage of time. This film did not seem to flow at all. There was no recognition of the passage of time.<br/><br/>As for Michael Gambon, I am still a fan of his for the film genres that he does best. I do not consider Albus Dumbledore to be best played by him. Dumbledore is tall, thin, and with a strong sense of humor and whimsy - not traits Michael Gambon portrays very well. I love his past films where he plays the darker side of humanity with its levels of duplicity. Dumbledore is being played too dark, too over-reactionary, and not much of the presence Albus Dumbledore has in the books. I know that he will not be replaced but if I had my preferences it would have been Peter O'Toole who better fits the description in the book. Sir Ian McKellan would also be ideal but I suspect he had been playing wizards longer than he preferred.<br/><br/>On the positive, the twins were well prepared for the next film in which they do have starring roles. Ralph Fiennes was wonderful as Voldemort - exactly what I imagined. And, of course; Daniel, Rupert, and Emma have shown their growth as actors."
"niculamariusgheorghe","10","1","2","24 November 2005"," This is the best Harry Potter movie yet.
","It's a very good movie in which the special effects are great and the actors seem really in touch whit their characters.Although the ending was a bit unusual because i thought that Harry will remain with Cho, Ron will remain with Hermoine and Lord Voldemort will be stopped but even so this is the best Harry Potter movie out of all the other three movies.I think that in comparison with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban this is a lot better and without a doubt a very larger success than it's other three predecessors.Now I can't wait to see what Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will bring because i wanna see what happens with Harry and Cho,Ron and Hermoine and what happens to Lord Voldemort."

","It was more ""to the book"" than the third movie, and was very funny- mainly because of Rupert Grint, James Phelps, and Oliver Phelps. Although the Ron-Hermione relationship was not highlighted as much in this movie, the movie was still great. Each member of the trio has become a better actor. There were only a few unnecessary moments that were inappropriate for younger children. Although the movie is about two hours and forty- five minutes, the length is not noticeable, especially to a true Harry Potter fan. The movie consists of constant entertainment- there was never a dull moment. At all times, the movie was either action packed or laugh-out-loud funny. I highly recommend it to all."
"dmturner","8","1","2","24 November 2005"," I felt as if I'd already seen it
","When I saw this film with my family last night, I couldn't help feeling that I had already seen it. Unlike many film sequels, it doesn't leave me with the feeling that I've been handed a grab-bag of leftovers. It was well acted, with excellent special effects, and even having a horde of middle-schoolers wielding cell phones and darting back and forth to talk to one another in front of us didn't keep me from enjoying myself. I've just seen it already.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is, as always, excellent, and Rupert Grint's eternally astonishing face is a gem. Daniel Radcliffe, as always, has the unenviable job of being the unwilling and not-particularly-distinguished hero, and acquitted himself well. The directing was good. You will enjoy this if you have enjoyed the other ones, because it is very much the same thing, and nothing succeeds like consistent quality, after all."
"FairHairedGal","8","1","2","24 November 2005"," They Keep Getting Better
","I found the fourth installment of HP far more interesting and entertaining than the other three. Of course things were changed from the books, as to be expected, but I feel this director did a better job than the other two, and was able to bring the story to life better. Obviously the scriptwriter and the director are assuming (wrongly) that all movie-goers have read the books, for there are important details left out that have others I have spoken with are confused about. I however, was able to follow the storyline perfectly as I knew what was happening. The children's acting has improved greatly since the last movies (although, why such horrid actors were chosen in the first place baffles me), but they still leave something to be desired in this film. The main adult actors, of course, portrayed their characters wonderfully. I was a little thrown off by Barty Crouch Jr. and the actor's way of playing him, but I do not think it ruined the movie. I was not at all pleased with the appearance of Mad Eye, or how they chose to show his magical eye. But I suppose that is just my OCD showing through. All in all this was my favorite movie, and I hope the sign this director for another installment in the series."
"reiley778","8","1","2","24 November 2005"," Wonderful Effects
","I am rating this as 8 out of 10. Like many others, Goblet of Fire was my favorite book also, at least; until book 6. I was also very disappointed that several key things were left out. Especially the scene with the maze. They left out quite a bit! But I really like how they portrayed Harry Hermione and Ron, a little awkward and so in. Overall, I think it was good, but could have been a little better. Heard they had wanted to do 2 movies for it, for 2 parts? Maybe they should have so not much would've been left behind. I would have liked to see the Dursleys again, also. Almost nothing with Sirius. I thought the effects with the dragons were nice, but would have liked to see the other champions as well."
"eternaldownpour","10","1","2","24 November 2005"," Parents STRONGLY Cautioned
","First and foremost, this is NOT a kids' movie. This is a story about a boy who is the target of a very ruthless, very violent, and very frightening killer. As Harry grows older, his problems grow more mature-themed, and Goblet of Fire is the major pivoting point. To parents who think they can just send their kids off to the theater for a cute little Harry Potter movie, be warned that you'll probably want to see it yourselves first before making that decision. This movie is scary. There are scenes of torture, mutilation, death, implied gore, and a bit of sexual innuendo (""What's got your wand in a knot?""). This movies is rated PG-13, and is about one slip of a mermaid's hair from being rated R. When I saw it in the theater, the outside doors opened at least three separate times so a parent could remove their child from the movie's influence.<br/><br/>And you should be able to tell by the opening scene. The first shot is of a pile of skulls in the dark with a rather large snake slithering through them. The dark palette is carried through the entire movie, with the most color existing in a magical fireworks show near the beginning and in Ron's new robes. Except for these ten to fifteen minutes of footage, the entire movie is extremely drab, and for the most part dark.<br/><br/>However, for those of you that have read and enjoy the books, you will not be disappointed. Many sections of the book were cut, as had to be done for the movie to work. But Newell knew what he was doing; the important parts (that is, the parts I remember from when I read the book years ago) are still there. Also included are many direct quotes from the book, a rarity in novel-to-screen conversions. No important events were cut, added, or altered, and virtually every character is played well.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are definitely figuring out how to act, and give a performance that is a huge improvement from the first movie. With all due respect to Richard Harris, Michael Gambon should have been the first choice for Dumbledore. Brendan Gleeson plays an extremely convincing Moody, and Miranda Richardson perfectly portrays Rita Skeeter's self-obsessed annoyingness.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is excellent. I give it a 10 out of 10 because there is absolutely nothing feasible that I can think of to improve it. Just beware that this is NOT a movie that you'd want to use as a babysitter. Remember that it's PG-13 for a reason."
"geoff246","10","1","2","23 November 2005"," A Great Spectacle
","It's the Goblet of Fire with a very competent director and a fine cast. The result is a terrific movie -- fast-paced, gripping, scary, even occasionally heart-rending. After the first two dismal Chris Columbus efforts, and the good-but-not-great Prisoner, Harry Potter has finally come into his own on film. I mean this generically about the movie -- the actor, Daniel Radcliffe, continues to serve largely as the straight man for the wonderful characters and scenes around him. Whether or not he's capable of more remains unknown, as Director Newell has shrewdly kept him within his normal, passive range and thus made more of the outlandish, magical, unpredictable, sometimes terrifying world he inhabits. A note of caution, however, there are scenes that could frighten young children."

The special effects and the way the creatures come to life is astonishing.<br/><br/>I a sure everyone will love this movie and you should be careful taking the young children to see it.

","This movie was amazing. It was the best by far. Also, unlike Prisoner of Azakaban, it actually included most of the important parts. The length was just perfect, it could actually go longer. <br/><br/>There are only two things that i do not like about this movie.<br/><br/>They are 1) Dumbledore- he just isn't as regal and stately as the first two movies Dumbledore. He is more of a hippie that is trying to act dignified instead of being that way. But, then again, i complained about that after the last movie.<br/><br/>2) Mad-Eye Moody- It wasn't the actor nor the acting. That was great. It was how they made him look. The eye annoyed me. It wasn't supposed to look like that. <br/><br/>Other than that, it was amazing and all the teenage girls (including me) in the theater swooned when Daniel Radcliffe is in the bath. He's Been WORKING OUT!!!!! Also, Cedric is looking fine!"
"Carebear-1982","10","1","2","23 November 2005"," Awesome
","This movie was fantastic; in fact I think so far it is the best of the series. After some disappointment with Prisoner of Azkaban I was holding my breath going into this movie, but it not only met but exceeded my expectations. It is not an exact copy of the books which I know did disappoint a few people I know but I also understand there is no good way to make a 734 page book into a movie and keep a movie audience interested, esp., when a portion of your audience doesn't necessarily read the books. However I think people need to remember that this movie is an adaptation, which means it takes the major plot ideas and uses them for a different medium.<br/><br/>The kids did a great job in this movie, it is so much fun watching them grow as actors as the movies progress. Emma and Daniel both turned in winning performances and I am convinced that Rupert was born to play the role of Ron Weasley. Another thing I loved was that Oliver and James Phelps were in the movie more and that they were acting more like Fred and George in the books than they have in previous movies, taking bets on how the Tri Wizard Tournament would turn out and tormenting Ron. I also noticed that Bonnie Wright and Matthew Lewis played a larger part in this movie; hopefully this means we will see their parts increased in the next few movies.<br/><br/>The movie did a great job of capturing the humor as well as the darker side of the book. The Yule Ball was beautiful, the icy theme, and Emma looked gorgeous. The tension between Ron and Hermione was just as I had imagined it when reading the book.<br/><br/>Going into the movie, the scene that worried me the most was the graveyard, but this did not disappoint. They kept the terror that goes through that scene without watering it down. Ralph Fiennes did an excellent job as Voldemorte; he was just as creepy as I pictured him in the books. I am also not ashamed to say the end of this scene and the beginning of the next one (when Harry returns to Hogwarts) as well as the end of term speech Dumbledore gives, brought me to tears, which while that part of the book is sad, the book did not manage to get that response from me.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
"afzal_football_league","4","1","2","23 November 2005"," Acting was Trash
","As as been mentioned in other reviews, Emma Watson overreacts while having normal conversations. Her acting in the Yule ball was awful. Rupert Grint has trouble speaking, his voice is really squeaky, and you can barely make out what he is saying. <br/><br/>The acting was redeemed by the older actors who knew what they were doing, such as Maggie Smith (Macgonagall) and Alan Rickman (Snape). This is with the exception of Micheal Gambon (Dumbledore) who is portrayed as using violence against the students. This is not how the character is meant to be, he is meant to be a source of comfort to Harry like a parent would be, he is also supposed to guide Harry subtly through the different tasks. This was a disappointing discovery to make. However their parts were too small. <br/><br/>There wasn't much humour as there is in the books. This was also disappointing."

","A superb 4th movie here. Darker and more scary than the previous three, but it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>There are several places throughout the film where comments are made that seem to make no sense, obviously because a preceeding scene has been cut. Hopefully this will be sorted in the DVD release.<br/><br/>So much of the book has been cut though, and several things that occur in future books have been overlooked (How are they going to blackmail Reeter Skeeter in the next film, when in this one her secret isn't revealed?) In future, and especially The Order of the Phoenix, they MUST do it in 2 films to preserve the great story, rather than cutting half the book as they do in this one.<br/><br/>Overall though, another good film, worth the wait."

","Maybe its because I read the book before I watched the movie, but I was very disappointed with the storyline of the movie. There was so much that was left out and some of it was even changed. In the movie they have Nevel give Harry the gillyweed. In the book it was Dobby who gave Harry the gillyweed. The movie doesn't address Dobby or Winky.<br/><br/>I think the movie was okay, but I just think it could have been better. As for the special effects, they were okay, but I thought that the scene with the dragon climbing along the edge of the castle was just cheesy. The dragon would do that why?

"united100","4","1","2","23 November 2005"," Childish rubbish
","Any spoiler is pretty limited, but I'm keeping safe! I hadn't bothered watching Harry Potter films or reading the books until I had nothing better to do on Saturday night (the Real Madrid v Barcelona football match had just finished...3-0 Barcelona, who were absolutely brilliant) and some friends got me to go and see this one.<br/><br/>You'll probably have guessed that I had certain preconceptions about the whole Harry Potter thing. I really like good fantasy - I'm a massive fan of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, but I'm afraid that I really can't understand how this can be thought of as being a remotely great film or anything remotely resembling a masterpiece.<br/><br/>My understanding of Harry Potter to date has been that each story has relied upon Harry being a reluctant hero who receives a call to action in the mould that Joseph Campbell outlined in Hero with a Thousand Faces. Nothing wrong with that...it was the plot device that gave us Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars film (which is, I think, a masterpiece). However, in this film (and I would presume the source novel) the device's use is just too contrived and weakly executed - particularly when Harry is already an established hero to his legion of fans.<br/><br/>The film itself seems also to struggle to fit the whole novel into its runtime. Even as someone who hasn't read the novel, it appears that sections may be missing, or too condensed. A thriller sub-plot that is only really touched upon throughout, transpires to be the crux of the film. And that is the real shame of this movie - a reasonably adult plot that children could appreciate is sacrificed in favour of easy options throughout.<br/><br/>Then there's the way that the film hangs together. It jumps around as if aimed at children whose supply of Ritalin has run out and produces unexplained statements as if from nowhere at a number of junctures. It has the cluttered ""I'm going to save this fiasco by making it purely a kids film"" feel of Star Wars Episode I.<br/><br/>The only way I can really sum it up, however, is to say that it is a ham-fisted combination of The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Worst Witch that seems like it was both plotted and scripted by Enid Blyton, working on a bad day...whilst hungover.<br/><br/>The only masterpieces that I saw on Saturday night were the two goals that Ronaldinho scored for Barcelona."
"hl434894","8","1","2","23 November 2005"," All the major exciting moments of the book, with no explanations in between
","Being a fan of both the HP books and the movies, I have to admit I had very high expectations for this movie, since the book was so great. It's not that the movie was bad, but I was so disappointed at the way they pieced to movie together. I understand that there were time constraints, but I felt there was a lot of plot holes, and certain key elements of the story and character development that were left out. <br/><br/>One particular plot hole is that fact that Harry finds Barty Crouch (Sr.) in the woods dead, but there is no real explanation of what happened to him, why, and how it all relates to Barty Crouch Jr./Mad Eye Moody. The book does a great job of using this point in the story to add to the mystery and intrigue of the story, but in the movie, it is just some confusing incident that never really gets resolved. <br/><br/>It seemed to me that they just randomly choose to cut parts of the movie, while keeping other insignificant parts. IMO they should have made either 2 movies, or 1 longer movie in order for the events to be pieced together more cohesively. My friend and I left the theatre, and I spent the entire car ride trying to explain the movie to him, because he had never read the book.<br/><br/>All that being said, it was still an excellent, exciting movie. The acting, especially Brendon Glesson as Moody, was excellent; even the kids have a better go at it this time. The special effects were amazing, the Quidditch World Cup stadium is especially fantastic. All in all the movie is still very entertaining, and I still give it a 8/10."

Alfonso did a better job on the third movie than Mike did on this one and believe me I was disappointed with the third movie also. I will say that they have an amazing special effects team because that's the only thing that kept me in my seat. Why make a film from a book if you can't even get it right? I am glad that the directorial job will be passed to a different person on the next film. I hope he does a better job. I am sorry to see that Steve Kloves isn't writing the script on the next film though, even though I am appalled at his job on this movie. They added way too much and left just as much out. The Directors are taking too much artistic license but the story is already there, the art is already there they just need to bring it to life. I guess they are assuming that everyone who goes to see them have read the books. Oh well...<br/><br/>Why didn't they put everyone in the top box with the Malfoys, where they are supposed to be? When would Dumbledore ever attack a student? Where were Bill, Charlie and Percy? What was wrong with the fire? Where was Voldemort's speech?

","I just spent an hour or so looking at these reviews. I have to agree with the bulk of them who said the movie did no justice to the book. I was very disappointed to not see so many of the characters that were in the book. I can't believe that they actually had a harry potter movie that didn't start with the Dersley's, and a harry Potter movie without Mrs Weasley?? I love her the best! The part in the fireplace at the beginning would have played great.. what humor! The house elves were completely ignored and Rita never got what she needed in the end.<br/><br/>What was there was great but sadly, because it was so great it made me really miss all the stuff that was left out that would have also been great. It's almost like they took several key points of the book, elaborated on them, moved characters to try to cover up what was cut then missed the mark. People know these books too well to leave so much of the story on the cutting room floor and get away with it. Everyone I talk to said the same thing, it could have been a half hour longer and covered a lot more of the wonderful detail and incredible characters that we were looking forward to seeing again. The next movie NEEDS to be three hours or they may as well not bother. If JK Rowling doesn't put out abridged books, she shouldn't allow abridged movies either.<br/><br/>Harry Potter in all it's glory can give Tolkien a run for his money. Don't cut it short!"
"lizzie22153","10","1","2","22 November 2005"," What I liked
","My favorite scene in the movie is when Snape (Alan Rickman) Wacks, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) several times over their heads. Another scene that I liked in the movie is when 'Mad Eye' (Brendan Gleeson) changes Malfoy (Tom Felton) into a ferret. I will always remember that scene as ""Draco The Amazing, Bouncing, Ferret."" I think if they had Julie Walters as Molly Weasley in this movie it would have been jut a tad bit better. They missed an important points in this movie, like for example, Harry giving his money to the Twins for their joke business or Sirius being at Hogwarts after the 3rd task. Am I the only person here that realized that they used a different actress for Angelina Johnson?. They messed up where Fred (James Phelps) Asked Angelina (Tiana Benjamin) out to the Yule Ball. In the the book he asked her out right in the middle of the Gryffindor common room, In the movie he asked her to the Yule Ball in the Great Hall. The Phelps Twins do an amazing performance as the Weasley Twins in this movie portraying them just as I imagined in the book. I rally like the scene when McGonagall (Maggie Smith) teaches everyone how to dance. You have to see the movie to get what I liked about the movie. Angelica Mandy does a perfect Gabrielle Delacour, just as I imagined."
"gravity3","7","1","2","22 November 2005"," The Best Potter To Date
","HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is the fourth film in the franchise, and the better of the four. I believe it's better on almost every level, except perhaps if you think the stories needed to stay light. GOBLET OF FIRE is the one that finally gets serious. <br/><br/>Mentioning the serious tone, I must comment upfront that there is good reason for a PG-13 rating. Younger viewers could have some trouble (nightmares?) with some of the villains and creatures we meet here. The subject matter does grow quite dark at times, and there are moments bordering on horror. I rarely agree with the MPAA on their ratings, but this time I think it's justified; you've been warned.<br/><br/>The darker, more serious nature of the film makes perfect sense, however. Potter and his school mates are older, and the tone of the film rings with it. More serious issues are brought to the surface, and some more adult themes, as Harry approaches adulthood. More than that, the film is the first to take itself more seriously, and I think it's just the change the series needed. <br/><br/>The Harry Potter series overall is really not so original. It borrows from so many fantasy stories and films that I can hardly count the references any longer. It's been one of the more annoying points about the franchise overall (and why I have trouble giving higher marks to this or any of the films). There are some tangents the story takes that linger a bit long, but I've felt that was true for all the POTTER films. It's the old problem of what to leave in from the book, and what to cut. I certainly would have shorted scenes to bring down that 2 1/2 hour run time. But with GOBLET OF FIRE, we do begin to move past most of the clichés and dive deeper into the characters and some of the more creative story arc ideas, and that's certainly progress.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the humor and fun is gone. While the laughs are tempered to fit the story, they are frequent enough without seeming forced. The acting by the young stars is better, showing that they've grown into their roles. The older actors are great as always, and new to the series is the wonderful Brendan Gleeson, and another fine actor - who I won't mention for fear of giving away a plot point. <br/><br/>The special effects are I think standard for movies of this type - I saw nothing that really wowed me, but then again everything was strongly designed and rendered, with few if any seams showing. The music is new as well: John Williams' themes are still present, but the baton has been passed on to highly capable Patrick Doyle. He sheds new light on old motifs and generally breaths life into the musical storytelling once again. It seemed as if Williams was bored by the last film, and it's nice to hear something new even as director Mike Newell took us in a different, darker, more grown-up direction. He even found a way out of the standard Harry Potter opening scenes - I'm sure you know what I mean.<br/><br/>For GOBLET OF FIRE to be the 4th in the series - where sequels usually sag and creak and we run out of the theater wondering what possessed us to go in the first place - it is a milestone from that perspective. I can think of few fourth outings worthy of anything but direct-to-video or late, late night TV. Moreover, it made me actually look forward to - instead of dread - the next in the series."

","I loved all! The trio is just getting better by the movie. I love how Emma Granger is aging. She is turning into such a beautiful young women, and that really shows in the movies. Rupert Grint is also improving. His acting gets more animated, more ridiculous, and more personal in every movie. And Danial. Where to begin? His character has turned from a cute little boy, to a complex and amazing character, and he has done more than just keep up with the change. The new characters were just as good, though. There were two I was particularly pleased with, and many I still enjoyed seeing. The special effects were amazing. In a movie with three bit CGI sequences, passable is not an option. I especially loved the first talk, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. I would have liked to see more sub-plot from books, for instance SPEW, and the half-giant crisis. Also more Rita articles. But the movie is still excellent. One more thing- I think the ending was too long and climax too short, but you might have different opinions. Overall, I loved it, and it was the best yet."

Although the beginning was SOMEWHAT interesting, if he directs this series AGAIN, I will never see another Potter film again... Harry is once again at Hogwarts, as if you've never heard that one. Harry spends his days screwing around, while Ron and Hermione feud. (what a good friend he is; he cares so much about his friends that he don't give a crap!) Harry saves the day, as if only the put-on-a-pedastal hero could. They put so much emphasis on Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Voldemort, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are just Robin, Bat-man's sidekick. They should've really given Ron and Little Miss Know-It-All some spotlight, like in 1-3. Save your money and order it on-demand. (I don't think that you should waste $9.95... No offense, I'm an avid Harry Potter fan, and I absolutely LOVE Daniel, Emma (cutie!!!!!), and Rupert, but I hate Mike's work on this series and I am going to begin a protest to get him out of the director's chair, and into McDonald's at 5.00 an hour.."
"WendyLauren","8","1","2","22 November 2005"," Well done, better than any other Potter film.
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has been adapted to a film version. This adaption is the best done so far, it doesn't make the story too artsy and the actors have improved very much from the first film. The effects are realistic, and I agree completely with the PG-13 rating it got. Its content is more sophistcated and the three tasks are shown with much exhilaration. The actors for the parts of the newly added characters are very well chosen. Cho is perfect, her Scottish accent is beautiful. Krum is chivalrous, awkward and handsome and Cedric is gorgeous, with just a tad of arrogance. This is by far the best of the 4 films. Thanks for not ruining this one WB."
"ehanson9559","6","1","2","22 November 2005"," What happened?????
","I have to say first of all that I am a die-hard fan of the books, I own them all (as well as all the movies on DVD). I started out watching the movies and then began reading the books after I saw Prisoner of Azkaban. I don't know if it is because this is the first time I have ever seen a movie after I have read the book or not but I was truly disappointed in the film. I keep reading about how everyone is so impressed with the screenplay and adaptation of the book and I think they are totally wrong. I know that everything is totally different in the story from this book on but the movie and the book took totally opposite directions. There was no character development, the film focused solely on the Tri-Wizard tournament and the return of Voldemort. Not that these things aren't important but they don't matter if they are the only things happening in the movie. We should have been told about Barty's son and his whole story when he was captured. As well as dozens of other sub plots that were just ripped out of the story. What about the Quidditch World Cup? And Winkey the house elf? And Neville didn't give Harry the gilly-weed, Dobby did. This movie left so much to be desired. I hope that Order of the Phoenix is done better or they get a different director or screen writer. If anyone out there agrees with me please let me know because I feel like I am the only one that feels this way."
"SLR-3","4","1","2","22 November 2005"," The worst HP film by far.
","What was Mike Newell thinking when he turned down the original idea of having two long films for this book? This one, despite its wonderful performances by Gleeson and Fiennes and yes, at last, even Radcliffe, is a dismal failure. And it's all at the feet of the director who chose to leave out many scenes which were important to the next book, and a few that were important even to this one.<br/><br/>Further, for the first half of the film, Newell either allowed or directed Gambon to read his lines as a harsh Dumbledore - which is totally out of character.<br/><br/>Mike Newell - shame on you. We could have had something magnificent. You chose to do the easy thing, instead of the right one."
"Craig-9","5","1","2","22 November 2005"," Disappointing, but how could it be otherwise?
","I mean, these books are so crammed full of character and incident, how can they possibly be adapted to a two or two and a half hour film? I think the screenwriters did a better job with the last film--I never felt lost or saw gaping plot holes. This time, there's so much stuff that needs to be introduced and new characters to take the stage, that it just feels rushed and incomplete somehow. The whole first hour or so is primarily exposition and is so sketchy that those who aren't intimately familiar with the books might be lost. The movie takes too long to get going and when it finally does warm up and get exciting, blink, and it's over. I'm not one of those purists that thinks every little incident and character mentioned in the books has to be translated to the screen, but I think they might have tried to do too much this time out. We've got a very busy movie that doesn't really have a strong narrative arc leading through it. Again, I much preferred Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to this muddled mess, though it does have its strengths, notably Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. Next time out, they're going to really have to work harder on a screenplay that streamlines and clarifies the story, or else they're going to have to go the other direction and give us a three-hour movie."
"juggernaut19","8","1","2","22 November 2005"," The Best Film Yet
","I recently saw the Goblet of Fire and was blown away by the film. The director did an excellent job of conveying the mystery and darkness now befalling Harry onto the big screen. As for the actors themselves; it was their best showing yet. I was especially pleased by Emma Watson's performance. She has noticeably matured as an actress since the last film. I have not even mentioned the most stunning part of the film. The special effects were magnificent. I caught myself with my jaw hanging five or six times throughout the movie in awe of how masterfully the ideas from the book were brought to life. If you're a Potter fan, this is a must see."
"joeski5651","6","1","2","22 November 2005"," Why buy the hype ?
","HPGOF - being a avid listener of the unabridged books read by Mr. Dale,I believe the movies are a disappointment and a way to make more money off the stories. I am not criticizing the work done to create the films, but what has HP become ? Each one of the books has critical character development and story line complexity that is is sorely missing from the movies. I have to wonder if JKR really has 100% creative control. If the movies are a ""coming alive"" version of the books, than why does JKR spend so much time in character development in the books, just to have it lost ? why doesn't she just write the screen play for her last book instead. I found the rewriting of the GOF to fit a movie, just an disservice to JKR work. One change that works for GOF is Nevel's role. But that was done to eliminate Dobbie's appearance in the movie. Nevel's role was better in the book with the finding out about his parents and their fight with Voldemorte. He is a character, not a device to move the plot. In retrospect, I think a mini series done for TV with all the details would have been a tribute to JKR than the way these films are butchering HP."
"julieannschoen","1","1","2","22 November 2005"," Where's the magic? Where's the love?
","Overall, every single HP movie has been an insult to JK Rowling, her beloved characters, and fans. Apparently the movies are being made strictly for money and have no love (the most potent magic of all) in them. Perhaps Peter Jackson will agree to remake them someday.<br/><br/>Other than a few key actors: Rickman, Smith, Walters, Isaacs, Grint, and Felton the movies would be unbearable to watch. Everyone else is fair (Radcliffe and Watson included) to shamefully miscast (Gambon in particular).<br/><br/>Anyone who rates the HP movies above a D, are either ""kept"" critics (most are) or, along with the directors and editors of the movies, have clearly not read the books."
"hobbit_eyes","8","1","2","22 November 2005"," Better than expected
","I consider myself one of the harshest critics of the Harry Potter films - unlike everyone else who seemed to adore the third one, I myself was left uninspired - but I think that this was very good considering how material they had to fit in, and was the best of the lot.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe has improved (much better crying than his emo rant in PoA), and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also very good. Newcomer Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody also fits in well. However, I still haven't warmed to Michael Gambon as Dumbledore - he acts completely unlike the Dumbledore in the book, and never gives off an aura of being particularly wise or of being the most powerful wizard in the world.<br/><br/>Of course, cramming all of the story into a 2 and a half hour film is quite a considerable task, but I think they did it better than in PoA - it followed a much more structured storyline, and while the pace did leave you feeling a bit ""... Huh?"" at times, it didn't seem to just be showing the main plot points, like in film 3. Some of my friends were sad they cut out SPEW and most of Rita Skeeter, but I agree that while they're great in the book, they don't really have much point in the film.<br/><br/>The Yule Ball is incredible, and deals with their teenage emotions properly without making it seem like an episode of 'Saved by the bell', and, as expected, each of the Triwizard Tasks are spectacular. And the final dramatic confrontation, while not quite how I imagined it in the book, was actually surprisingly creepy and a little disturbing - not good for little kids.<br/><br/>The only thing I'd say about it was its lack of subtlety. I know they have to fit in a lot of plot points, but did they have to make some of them QUITE so obvious?? Even the weather seems to be trying to alert the trio that evil is afoot.<br/><br/>All in all, I liked it, and I'd definitely recommend it to HP fans (though they'll hardly need my encouragement) and even to those who didn't like the last three films - this is in an entirely different tone, probably thanks to the director Mike Newell, who not only being British and understanding our school life but also predominantly a romantic comedy director, managed to inject some much-needed humour into what is otherwise the darkest of the four yet."
"tamigarlock","4","1","2","22 November 2005"," Less than adequate adaptation
","The fourth movie in the Harry Potter series does not do the book justice at all. The story lines/scenes within the movie seem rushed and never allow the plot to fully develop. Although it is completely understandable that a 700+ page book needs to be condensed in order to fit it into a watchable movie, there are certain plot points and characters that could have been included without lengthening the movie. I don't think that the series will be able to successfully progress without the explanation of certain key points - future story lines may just stop because there is not a background for them.<br/><br/>Key complaints include: characters are introduced and then forgotten about without much of an explanation, main characters were not accurately portrayed, and scenes were extended past what was in the book.<br/><br/>Although a true fan will not be able to stay away from the theatre, set your expectations low, and see a matinée to save some money."
"dbgeorge","10","1","2","22 November 2005"," Better read the book first...
","I am a little disappointed by this installation of the Harry Potter series. I have not read any of the Harry Potter books, but I completely enjoyed the first three movies. With ""Goblet of Fire"", I found myself confused, especially towards the end of the movie, because I did not know the significance of everything that was going on. I have had to seek out my nephew who knows all the books by heart to explain why something happened. I still enjoyed the movie, and I liked the darker tone of the film compared to the other 3 movies. I will have to either read the book or wait for the next movie to fill in some of the gaps. Maybe the fact that the book had a lot of subplots that needed to be cut out to fit into one movie took away from the cohesiveness of the film. So as a non-reader of the books (that is my loss), I give the movie a lower score."
"flickhead","5","1","2","22 November 2005"," Harry Plot Holes! Shouldn't have to read a book to ""get"" a movie!
","This one had its moments, but almost nothing was explained, and I'm of the opinion that shearing unnecessary plot points entirely is a much better idea than leaving in just enough to satisfy the readers, because by splitting the middle you please no one. I haven't read the books, (before it is suggested I should tell you that I have absolutely no inclination of ever doing so) and it seemed to me that the filmmakers took it for granted that everyone in the audience had read them. Film and literature are different mediums and books and movies must each stand on their own, so in this respect particularly the film was a failure. The movie was overly long and yet there were a ton of plot holes, which are almost mutually exclusive problems in general; it felt both rushed and run down at the same time. This is a shame following on the heels of the last entry in the series which was an excellent piece of juvenile fantasy, no doubt owed to director Alfonso Cuaron, who directed A Little Princess, which is one of the single greatest children's films ever. He was a natural choice for the material. Mike Newell's only asset seems to be that he is British. While he did direct Four Weddings and a Funeral, everybody seems to forget that he also directed Pushing Tin and Mona Lisa Smile and a half dozen other real duds. Spielberg had expressed interest in directing this entry, and his offer was declined. Say what you will about Spielberg, but the guy knows how direct juvenile fantasy films better than just about anyone on the planet. I think they bungled it on this one. I didn't hate the film, but I was severely disappointed as the subject matter could have touched on a myriad of important life lessons, but came off like a soap opera for kids, composed of hackneyed ideas, snail paced and missing footage. I'm sure most will disagree, as this is a series of films that lures sycophants like pollen does bees. I say the emperor wears no clothes. I'll go see the next one probably, but I hope that they get the right director for the material, and they hire a continuity person who has not read the book, and allow that person to sit with the editor thus allowing for a truly objective eye to uphold the integrity of the piece."

","Note: There aren't that many spoilers. There is only one. I don't even think it is one. I just want to make sure I don't ruin the movie for anyone, by one slip.<br/><br/>Dan Radcliffe is amazing.In the first three films, he was OK, but I was blown away by his improvement. At a certain crying scene at the end of the film, he does a great job. A lot better, when he was crying in PoA. In PoA it was like he was just crying for the sake of crying and he did badly at it. Here you care about him and he's amazing. Also, Rupert Grint is great. Emma is great. Ralph Fiennes was awesome. Only he could have played Voldemort. Mad-Eye was played well. I wasn't expecting the eye to look like that, but I'm not complaining. Miranda Richardson was great and I could tell she was having fun in the role. I can't wait to see the next movie. David Yates better do a good job."

","The new Harry Potter movie is entertaining and has the basic elements of it's predecessors that entertain, but it bogs down in the middle and ultimately sags under it's own weight. While the plot is interesting, the movie suffers from the same affliction that ""Lord of the Rings"" developed, namely an over-reliance on prolonged action sequences and special effects. It is worth the price of admission to see it in the theater for the special effects, but it is an emperor without clothes and does not live up to the pre-release hype.

"bedrew48","6","1","2","21 November 2005"," The Good & Bad of GoF
","OK, This Harry Potter installment was a biggie. There was a lot of things going on at once which i believe is very hard to portray in only a 2 and 1/2 hour movie. From the Beging this Movie is constant action. It puts us directly into the story without warning. So much of this constant action leaves little time to explain what is going on. This movie left out many key characters or doesn't give characters enough time to be in the movie. The Dursleys are not in the movie at all neither is Leudo Bagman and of course Winky. Also I believe that Sirius should have been in the movie more for he is now very close to Harry, as well as Harry's friends Ron & Hermione. I felt that they spent little time in the movie also. Draco was left out in the cold for this one. He only participated in the scene with the ferret (though that was a great scene). Some themes were also left out that I would have liked to see but it is understandable that something have to be cut out.I believe they should have definitely put the involvement of Rita Skeeter being a Animagius as well as more of the Quidditch World Cup and the Winky subplot. Besides the movie lacking some important characters and points I felt it lived up to the others standards. The Triwizard Tournament was extremely compelling and exciting. The Look and Visual effects were again amazing and the acting also extremely well done. So All in All i believe that the director did a pretty good job in fitting in so much into one movie. Though I would have like to see more, Such as the characters I mentioned as well as other themes and parts of the book I found important the look of the movie was flawless as well as the acting. My advice to The Movie Crew of GoF is to focus more on the whole story (not just Harry, though he is very important) and to slow things down not try and fit everything in at one movie but maybe extend the movie. Also put a lot of deleted scenes & extra content on the DVD and I think well be good <br/><br/>Thanks for Reading"
"MissTy98","9","1","2","21 November 2005"," Wow!
","You may never quite see a movie quite like this one. The constant worrying of how well Mike Newell will do on this movie is now over. Mike Newell took his own route on this movie, though still building off what Cauron and Columbus did, yet improving it. All book readers will still be surprised by what this movie has in store for them since it separates the books from the movies.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the necessary Voldemort/Wormtail scene and quickly changes to the amazing and breath taking look at the Quidditch World Cup. It quickly shifts to the main story of Hogwarts and the Triwizard tournament.<br/><br/>All aspects of the teenage life are shown throughout the movie from love, quarreling, and schoolwork. This gives the movie a more realistic feeling and shows that these wizards are normal people, but with magical powers.<br/><br/>Characters such as Mad-Eye Moody, Fleur Delacour, and Rita Skeeter were cast perfectly to the parts.<br/><br/>All the action scenes were amazing and actually thrilling with top rate special effects. All three magical tasks are exciting and believable. The graveyard scene was all that it should be and quite frightening which made this movie earn it's PG 13 rating.<br/><br/>My only words of criticism is this. More time should have been spent on the Quidditch World Cup and the three tasks instead of having all the unnecessary time spent on all the Yule Ball. It made the middle of the movie move really slowly while the beginning and end went fast. The Yule Ball does not add near as much to the plot as the Quidditch World Cup or the the three tasks."

","Having read all six in the series and owing the first three films on DVD, I can say that this film depends on the audience familiarity with Rowling's world. It is visually beautiful, and we are able to witness the development of each character in a way that is true to the actor..<br/><br/>I would guess that the first 200 pages are represented in the first 10 minutes of the film. These minutes were an abbreviated nod to the book's content similar to a story board.<br/><br/>Deviating from the original story line was a necessity. By eliminating the house elves and the Dursleys, valuable minutes were reclaimed for the TriWizard Tournament..Given the brevity of dedicated film time, all reference to the Quidditch World Cup and Rita Skeeter could have been eliminated, as could Haggrid's romance and the unexplained friction between Ron and Harry. I had to explain a number of issues to my husband who has not read anything of the series.<br/><br/>There is always a danger in seeing the film of a favorite book. The vision is always better in our heads.<br/><br/>Too little of too many subplots exist to be truly satisfying, but we are forgiving. After all, it is Harry Potter."
"scottarnold","7","1","2","21 November 2005"," An Outsider's Viewpoint
","When a film has a fan base or is based on a book, it is difficult to find reviews by people who are not part of that fan base and/or have not read the book. I am neither a fan of Harry Potter nor do I read the books, so some of you may find my review of interest in that respect. I am not going to summarize the plot; many other reviews already do that nicely. Instead, given that I have seen every Harry Potter film so far for one reason or another, I will focus on giving my basic opinions on the film and also comparing it to the previous films.<br/><br/>This film seemed a bit darker than previous films. Almost every scene had an ominous weight to it. Yet in other places, like in the introduction of the all female troop, it felt downright silly, like Charlie and the Chocolate factory with the dancing midgets. Moreso than previous films, it had that kind of awkward clash in that it seems like a children's story attempting to be an adult story -- or vice versa -- I can't really figure it out. I think that would be my biggest reason for not being a Harry Potter fan. If they were to replace all the child wizards and adolescent behavior with adult wizards and behavior, I would probably like it a lot more.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes seemed rushed. The film sometimes jumped too quickly from one scene to another. And there were characters who seemed out of place, like the seeker champion who was built up as if he was a main character, yet never seemed to fill that role. This is a difficult issue to address in such films that are based off of books, so you could say it is to be expected. However, the problem seemed a lot worse in the this film than in previous films.<br/><br/>I got a little bored around the middle of the film and wasn't entirely satisfied when it ended. However, I was also feeling a bit tired at the time, so that probably didn't help. I thought the visuals in the film were very well done. Most of the sets felt real and created the ambiance that I think was both good and as intended. Overall, despite the drawbacks, I think it was a fairly decent film. However, I still don't understand the mass appeal of Harry Potter."
"mythweaver1966","6","1","2","21 November 2005"," Mixed feelings on this one.
","There were moments of brilliance in this movie. The major event scenes (triwizard challenges, yule ball, quidditch world cup, and graveyard scene/return to Hogwarts with Cedric) were fabulous, and I can't say enough good things about them. The rest of the movie was an inane, rushed and muddled attempt to connect these scenes together.<br/><br/>Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore was, to my mind, completely off-base in this movie. Dumbledore is a calm, wise, reasoning type of chap. He doesn't grab students by the shoulder, shake them, and shout at them in anger. The Dumbledore in Goblet of Fire is in no way the Dumbledore I've encountered in the 6 books. Although I was mildly disappointed by Gambon's performance in Prisoner of Azkaban, I was very upset about it in this one.<br/><br/>Granted, Goblet of Fire is in no way a kid's movie. I, silly me, assumed that the PG-13 rating would be for violence, and the death of Cedric. The sexual elements present in this movie were completely inappropriate for children. A stained glass picture of a naked mermaid (although granted her hair moved tantalizingly over her more private areas). And while Moaning Myrtle flirted with Harry in book 4, in this movie I thought she was going to jump on top of him. These elements were completely unnecessary in a movie that the makers KNEW was going to be seen by children, despite the PG13 rating. I'm no prude, but the sight of all the 10 and under kids in the theatre who's eyes were being rapidly covered by parents was tough to take. If these elements had been in the book, we'd have been prepared. But the movie makers took an inch from the book and ran a mile with it.<br/><br/>Having said that, let me re-iterate that the big scenes were great. The Yule Ball was great fun. The three kids were brilliant. They've grown tremendously as actors. The tournament scenes, especially the second challenge, were imaginative and well done. But, as I said earlier, I felt like they made the big scenes, then spliced in the rest of the movie around them. It was not well paced, and I deeply felt the lack of stable adult guidance for the kids in this movie. It simply didn't exist."
"kahle328","4","1","2","21 November 2005"," Not the same story as the book.
","To start, I will admit I am a bit of a purist. This harry potty movie is very thin, and loosely based on the book. The movie seriously lacks any dialog, character development, or for that matter, plot matter that was originally in the book. Just about the only plots that weren't chopped out were the tri-wizard tournament and Harry's confrontation with Voldemort. Virtually everything else was eliminated or changed to fit this hacked rendition. Even the tournament lacked the essence portrayed in the book, as if it were just another everyday event in the life of Hogwarts. Several characters are missing, and character personalities are changed to fit the new story. If you are looking for a movie about the original story, this movie isn't it. If you are just looking for another blah action thriller with poor acting, zero dialog, and very little point, this is your movie."
"messages_for_guy","6","1","2","21 November 2005"," Don't See It
","Dear Harry Potter fans,<br/><br/>The newest Harry Potter movie very roughly follows the book and has some really pretty scenes. The movie characters progress compared to the previous movies, they perform many of the same magic spells and feats in the books, and the scenes containing the feats are likable. You can enjoy this movie ... IF you are a Harry Potter fan and have done the following things:<br/><br/>1. You HAVE read the fourth book but definitely NOT RECENTLY. <br/><br/>2. You have given up trying to compare the books to the movies. The books are too delightful, too British (and would be well served to remain so and the American versions to regress a little), and develop the characters in a way that the movies simply can't or don't. <br/><br/>3. You realize that Dumbledore in the books bears NO Resemblance to the movie version or even the actor playing him in the first two movies, AND you are not offended by this pathetic excuse for a replacement. In fact, the new Dumbledore is so bad that it might be better to ignore him altogether in the movies. Admittedly, he is slightly better in this film than the 3rd film but so many of his actions are completely uncharacteristic of my idea of Dumbledore (by the plot or the actor) that it is offensive. The Book Dumbledore was never rash (like grabbing Harry after the Goblet of Fire scene), accidental in any way, and didn't defer to Fudge or Barty Crouch for a rule interpretation or ""what to do next."" Also, I don't care what the screenwriters put in for this actor, he needs to take that rubberband off his beard.<br/><br/>In summary:<br/><br/>Don't see this movie if you haven't read the book. You won't follow it and you'll be better off reading it and waiting for video. <br/><br/>If you have read the book, don't see this movie if you expect this to be anything except a visual replica of the prettier parts of the book. <br/><br/>For me, I enjoyed this film because my standards are sooo low. The movie has divorced itself almost completely from the book and yet uses the book as a crutch to skip plot points, take out key characters, and jumble scenes together. The book is large, detailed, and wonderful so it is understandable that they couldn't get it all into the movie. However, the book and movies are now different entities. I may or may not see the 5th movie because I am curious where the movie characters go but any of the movies will never be as moving and heartfelt as any of the books. The movie characters are no longer even close to my mental image formed from the books. The 3rd movie cleaved my mental image in half, and the 4th movie simply echoes the lack of similarity. More than anything, it is this divorce that creates a difficult line to ride for the true Harry Potter fan who wishes to enjoy the movies. <br/><br/>Good luck to you! I hope you enjoy it but you must have CONSTANT VIGILANCE to be a true fan of the movies. :-)<br/><br/>Guy"
"FMACDONALD","10","1","2","21 November 2005"," These Movies Get Better And Better As They Go Along
","Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is great. It's definitely on my top 5 films of the year list. Having never read the book I just went into the film and took it for what it was. My wife on the other hand has read all the books and was saying that this book which the film is based on wasn't very good. So I guess my expectations were not to high. I was wrong. This is the best Potter film yet. It's funny, exciting, well written, well acted, and sometimes just down right creepy. This time around Harry is entered in a tournament that his school, Hogwarts is hosting called The Tri-Wizard Tournament. This is a dangerous tournament, that even the best and brightest wizards that attended Hogwarts have lost their lives in. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is terrified as well as his two best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Herminee (Emma Watson). Harry enters the tournament an extreme underdog. Goblet Of Fire is just fun, plain and simple. The movie is awesome. We also get to see what big budget CGI looks like when it's done right. Something George Lucas should have done when releasing the new Star Wars films. The Harry Potter films are everything and more than these new Star Wars films should have been. Don't get me wrong I loved Revenge Of The Sith but Phantom Menace was terrible and Attack Of The Clones, though better when I've seen it again, still lacks in quality. The Potter films have everything the original trilogy had. Character development and a great story. When Harry is fighting for his life against a deadly dragon you feel scared for him. When Herminee yells at Ron you feel mad at Ron as well. When Ron feels dumb for doing something idiotic you feel embarrassed for him. This is what made the original Star Wars trilogy characters great, and the same formula goes into the Harry Potter films. That's what makes them classics. The only issue the films can run into is the three main characters aren't getting any younger, and this could pose a problem. In January they begin filming the 5th movie Harry Potter And The Order Of The Pheonix. I imagine the filming of the 6th film Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince will begin shortly after that. J.K. Rowling has begun writing the 7th and final novel in the series, so that should be adapted to the screen rather quickly. I just hope it doesn't get rushed, but in the same vein I don't want to see anyone else play Harry, Herminee, or Ron. Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is great. Once again a wonderful world of imagination comes to life before your eyes. These films will be held in the same light as the original Star Wars trilogy. Just great, great, movie making. On a scale of 10 I give Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire a 10. This film, unlike the last 3 is rated PG-13, and it deserves it rating. It's much darker and could scare little kids. The tag line to the film is ""Everything Is About To Change."" Yes it is and believe me folks when I say, Change is good."

","I think that the movie with the special effects and the way that they captured the teenage attitude was excellent. HOWEVER, I have never known Dumbeldor to be that aggressive toward Harry. I was sadly disappointed that there were several variations from the book. I was also disappointed with Snapes character in this movie. He didn't seem as menacing as in the past movies. I am also not thrilled with the actor who plays Dumbledor- definitely not as good as the original. My husband who has yet to read any of the books, loved the movie. But even he feels that he missed out on some key elements that would explain more had he read the book. I saw it twice this weekend. Definitely a great movie but not as great as the original (THE BOOK)."
"lindsayleighh","Null","1","2","21 November 2005"," Well, better than the others...
","In general, this movie was better than the others. The tasks were amazing to watch. The Yule Ball was done nicely. I'm upset by the lack of Dursley's, and the non-existent Quidditch World Cup, but I understand that certain things needed to be cut.<br/><br/>However, there are many things I did not like. For example, Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. In POA, I thought he was good, but in this movie, he annoyed me. He yelled way too much, when Dumbledore is supposed to be calm. He shook Harry (and in Order of the Phoenix, yells at Umbridge for doing the same thing), and in general, he lacks a proper Dumbledore attitude. Do I think that he can achieve a perfect Dumbledore? Yes, I believe he can, but he needs to work on it.<br/><br/>The next thing on my list of annoyances was Voldemort. I also thought that he yelled way too much. I missed the talk with the death eaters about immortality, as I believe that is one of the most crucial things in this book. I loved his costume and how it billowed about him. I also thing that with some understanding of the books, Ralph Fiennes will make a very evil Voldemort.<br/><br/>The last thing I'll mention is Sirius. I thought he played a fairly crucial part in the book, and was very sad to see his small part in the movie. I had hoped that Sirius would become more active, and I believe that he absolutely has to in the next film. Of course, he will play a very important part next time, so I'm really hoping for more time with Gary Oldman in the next one! <br/><br/>Other than those things, I thought this movie was as good as it could be for such a long book. I appreciate how closely they tried to stick to the book, and hope that they make some small adjustments to the next ones."
"tinker2_819","8","1","2","21 November 2005"," OK in parts-- but what where they thinking?
","I thought the film was one of the better of the four made. They missed many other plot lines, for example the whole ""Hagrid's mother is a giant"", there was also no mention of Doby or Winky. Another difference, some may considered unimportant, is at the end of the fourth book Harry gives his prize money to the twins, this does not happen in the film. I think that it does not set up the Twins joke shop idea, therefore, Malfoy doesn't have any where to go in order to get the blackening powder thing he uses in the 6th book in his plan to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and ultimately Dumbledore's demise. But I do understand various other plots may have been missed out due to time constraints, as GoF is a fairly lengthy book. <br/><br/>Also with reference to Dumbledore, I did not appreciate the changes they made. He is not portrayed as the kind, benevolent man I had envisaged, particularly when he pushes Harry up against the cabinet, this annoyed me as in the fifth book he shouts at Umbrdige for shaking Cho's friend and tells Umbridge that he cant have her man handling his students. I also found Hermione's character slightly weak minded, for example she refuses to tell Moody the killing curse and she gets completely hysterical at the Yule Ball claiming Ron ""spoils everything"", but this may just have been Emma Watson playing up the scene. <br/><br/>All in all I think the film is great for entertainment value, I'd just recommend to all HP readers to try and forget the book."
"frodolives729","10","1","2","19 November 2005"," Amazing
","I know that there have been some bashers of this movie saying that it sucks because lots of stuff was cut out. Well, GOF doesn't suck. It's a great movie, and the vast majority of you will love it. The things the filmmakers cut out, I didn't miss too much. The entire thing clicks together as a great movie. When you go to it, don't expect to see a great adaptation of the book, expect to see an amazing film that blows the other 3 HP films away. Now, for some specific stuff.<br/><br/>Acting: The trio have REALLY grown as actors. They were superb. Breandon Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody was outstanding. The rest of the cast was great (I don't understand the Michael Gambon Bashing. I do prefer Richard Harris, but seriously, what are we going to do about it?) Ralph Feinnes was great as Voldemort (who does come off pretty freakily) Overall, excellent<br/><br/>Directing: Mike Newell has made a superb film out of a superb book. He rocks.<br/><br/>Effects: WOAH<br/><br/>Great Scenes: The scene where Moody is messing with the spiders. This is one of my favorite scenes from the GoF book, and it was great on the screen. All of the 3 tasks were great. The entire Yule Ball thing, I swear Mike Newell pulled this out of my head and put this on screen, it was PERFECT. The graveyard scene: same exact case. <br/><br/>Overall: A-. By FAR, BY FAR the best of the HP films. If you're worried about it sucking, then don't. It doesn't. The first thing I thought when the film finished was, ""Hell, I gotto see that AGAIN!"
"Calum87","8","1","2","19 November 2005"," Not the perfect potter film but close
","I had pretty high hopes for the new potter film after the success of prisoner of azkabam so it was probably never gonna live up to expectations. It came pretty dam close but there were still some lingering problems.<br/><br/>One of the things i disliked about the first potter film was how the plot was second to establishing the world and the visual effects which had a negative effect on the pace. They still haven't found a way to make the whole hogwarts year flow fluently and everything still seems a little rushed. There was nothing on the actual lessons, just the tournament and the yule ball. The beginning of the movie is poorly paced too, with the quiditch world cup only lasting 5 minutes, basically over before it started. The books flow which is one of their best qualities and the small details that are in the books but not the movie make it that bit more charming.<br/><br/>Acting is good, the main trio have matured into decent actors and support is good as always, would still like to see more of some of the supporting players like snape and malfoy.<br/><br/>A pretty decent film which sets up the next film very well. As each film seems to be getting better maybe by film 7 we'll have the perfect Potter film. Heres hoping."
"samseescinema","10","1","2","19 November 2005"," equivalent in quality to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire <br/><br/>reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>rating: 4 out of 4<br/><br/>Mike Newell is decidedly the right man for this job. Christopher Columbus' work on the first two Harry Potters was rightly put by Terry Gilliam as ""simply pedestrian"". Alfonso Cuaron's work on the previous film, although satisfying, felt too alive and energetic for the literary elegance that must inhabit Harry's world. Newell, however, nails the bolt straight through the bull's-eye with Potter's fourth venture onto celluloid. <br/><br/>The film documents, quite simply enough, the famous Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe's) fourth year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His friends, Ron and Hermione (Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) return expectedly, along with a volley of new students from two other wizarding schools brought in for the infamous Tri-Wizard Tournament. The tournament calls for one champion from each school to compete in three tasks of harrowing adventure, fighting to win the all-lauded Tri-Wizard Cup. Things turn awry, however, when the Goblet of Firethe magical device that decides the competitorschooses Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) and Harry Potter to compete for Hogwarts. But rules are rules, and soon Harry's off to the first task. Also troubling Harry is a recurring dream that displays a half-formed Lord Voldemort (Ralph Feinnes) with Wormtail (Timothy Spall) and a mysterious third party discussing dark, evil plans. <br/><br/>In the earlier films, some of the largest complaints were piled against the acting. Some thought, with some justification, that Ron, Hermione, and Harry were all cast because of their physical likeness to the parts, failing to show true acting prowess. By now, however, they've matured. The three have all developed nicely into blossoming, successful young actors with powerful skill. Along with nailing all the lines, the three all exude great physical comedy. One of the finer segments of the film focuses upon the awkward energy of school when a dance--The Yule Ball--is looming in the future. All three of our heroes deal with asking a young lady or being asked by a gentlemen with charming adolescent drama which, in another world less fantastical and endearing would be melodramatic. Here, however, the tiny explosions of conflict break up the Tri-Wizarding action nicely and are performed so well that's it's a delight to simply sit back and enjoy. <br/><br/>Lord of the Rings would be hard put to compete with the adventure The Goblet of Fire offers. The first task of the tournament, in theory, appears simple: retrieve the golden egg from the arena. Hagrid the Gatekeeper, however, soon alerts Harry to the fact that a dragon will also be present in the arena, charged with protecting the precious golden egg from the competitor. What ensues is an incredible feet of CGI magicians' handiwork. The scene takes Harry on a tormenting broom ride, dodging the fiery breath of the fierce dragon and escaping to the shingled roofs of Hogwarts' towers, leaping across them to avoid the fatal claws of his scaly enemy. These fantastic action scenes continue, bringing Harry into the watery depths of a frightening city of mermaids and later, into a towering labyrinth of hedges for the tournament's final task. <br/><br/>We're treated to stunning shows of CGI wizardry as well as picturesque real-life sets. Early on, the group heads to the 422nd Quidditch World Cup (a segment that fans of the book will find rushed due to time restrictions). Their mode of transportation to the event, interestingly enough, is an old, beaten boot called a portkey. The camera takes a first-person view as the group sprints towards the footwear, sliding briskly through the grass, the sun silhouetting those running and darkening the rough outline of the portkey in a shot of kinetic, brimming beauty. There's a myriad collection of shots with similarly high value throughout the film, keeping us interested not only with Harry's startling adventure, but also with the film's opulent visuals. <br/><br/>With each director, the Harry Potter's world has undergone dramatic transformations in its visual presentation. Some noticed in the last film that Hogwarts turned into a kind of rugged, crumbling castle lost in the cold of the wilderness; whereas one year earlier in Columus' film, Hogwarts was a magnificent edifice among a neatly-plotted spot of land. Columbus took magic at a minimum, and Cuaron let it run amok. Newell, however, finds the perfect chord to strike between the two, opting for a kind of fantasy world interwoven with calm reality and a joyous dosage of magic. It feels Harry has finally found his rightful home in Newell's cinematic reality, which, thankfully, seems mostly parallel to the world spun in Rowling's novels. <br/><br/>Some will complain, as they always do, of segments from the novel being snipped from the final cinematic product. But The Goblet of Fire runs at 2 hours and 38 minutes, and unlike the previous films, feels rightly paced. Any more and the film might drag. Any less and it would assuredly feel rushed. My only complaint would be in the casting of Dumbledore, now played by Michael Gambon. His performance is hard and cold compared to warm, light-headed character from the books. A silly criticism, yes, but fans of the books will notice just the same. Other than Dumbledore, however, casting is spot on; especially with the all-important choice for Voldemort. Simply put, Ralph Feinnes is electric. <br/><br/>I feel the Harry Potter series has finally risen to the artistic level of phenomena the books have repeatedly achieved over the last decade. This film, if I may so boldly state, is equivalent in quality to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yeah, it really is that good."
"kyara-miller","8","1","2","21 November 2005"," A fantastic fourth movie!
","This movie was fantastic, the graphics were fantastic, the kids acting was fantastic. The children are growing up, and getting to the age where they start to notice the opposite sex. They must worry about whom to ask to the ball, how to dance, and what it feels like to be rejected. I liked that even Hagrid had a love interest! I feel 100% that this movie was better than the third. Since the book was very thick, there was obviously much they had to cut out, and so I was patient with this one. However, there were still some things that bothered me: <br/><br/>1. Time moved rather quickly, and a lot of good stuff from the book was left out. I know that was to be expected, but those who haven't read the book won't understand as much as those who have. Sadly, a lot of the comedic scenes from the book were the ones that were left out.<br/><br/>2. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) looked years older than Hermione (Emma Watson) and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). Harry and Hermione were believable 14 year old children, since Daniel Radcliffe is skinny and girls do develop faster than boys. I know children age, but Ron is looking 18 years old and really really attractive! Especially when you see how muscular and developed he is.<br/><br/>3. I didn't feel that we got to know Cedric Diggory enough. Or any of the other Tri-wizard champions! How are we to feel for them if we don't see much of them? The dragon scene was absolutely fantastic, but sadly, we only got to see Harry.<br/><br/>4. WARNING! Only read this if you have read the books, seen the movie, don't mind a major scene being spoiled for you, or are a parent and want to know if this movie is suitable for your child! Otherwise, move on to my next point, please. The end scene when Voldemort is rising up was really rather disturbing. In fact, I found it a bit too much even for me. Green smoke rises out of a cauldron and you see a figure forming. The figure is smooth and bubbly and it left me feeling ill. Later, when Voldemort is up and talking, his face is something out of an adult horror movie. I definitely think that this movie would frighten young children, since even I couldn't handle it! Which leads me to my next point...<br/><br/>5. Sensitive women and children, be warned that this movie could be really disturbing. If you want to know more, read my last point (if you skipped over it).<br/><br/>6. Ron wasn't obsessed enough over Fleur (the french Tri-Wizard Champion).<br/><br/>However, aside from those points, this movie was really great, and I give it an 8 (with 2 thumbs up)."
"quinnsx","5","1","2","19 November 2005"," Missing too much of the story-line
","I love the Harry Potter books and discussing these books w/my son. We have also loved the movies, through PoA. However, this movie left out the underlying plots of the movie. These are the plots that tie all of the relationships of the characters. It contained fantastic scenes and special affects, but I think concentrated too much on the teenage angst issues and not enough on the suspense, the mystery, of the story. I don't want to include spoilers, so I am being vague. But, in the movie, we never really learn how the whole story fits together, like we do in the book. I agree, also, that the story is extremely disconnected. Those who have not read the book will have a difficult time understanding what is happening. I was disappointed and hope the new director realizes he's disappointed many fans."

","Sorry folks - I just don't understand all the ""gushing"" over this one.<br/><br/>While a lot of the JKR novel was bloated, the narrative in this film was so compacted and economized I think it lost some of the great textures and backgrounds that drove the earlier films.<br/><br/>I waited in line from 4pm for the 9:40pm showing - so I really wanted to love it, but I and my friends found it very disappointing. More slick and vacant a film than presented by the Potter team heretofore. (The film must be totally incomprehensible to someone who has not read the book.) Voldemort was laughable - seemingly inspired by Max Schreck in ""Nosferatu"" - but this now earthbound Voldy didn't even come close to being as eerie, ominous and menacing as Max in that 1922 silent film - even with all the expen$I've and gee-wiz SPFX. It was as disappointing a ""reveal"" of a movie villain as when Lucas pulled off Darth Vadar's mask and presented us with the cinematic equivalent of a wizened ""Uncle Fester"" beneath. That's ""what"" we (& Harry & Co.) have been afraid off all this time?! Sing its praises if you must, for me it gives great concerns with the next one which was even dicey in book form. If director Alexander MacKendrick was still alive, he probably could pull it off - but I don't think this fellow will if he is given the assignment base on all the puff expressed here."
"jacknhut","7","1","2","21 November 2005"," Overall its a good movie, but not as good as Prisoner of Azkaban
","I think this movie has too many pieces stitched together, some are good and some are bad. I understand that cutting some details from the book is OK but cutting the important one is not. The three most important scenes that need to be included were the three tasks from all the champions, not just from Harry Potter. The first task they only showed how Harry got his golden egg, and completely ignored how Cedric, Victor and Fleur got theirs. People only saw how Harry overcame his dragon and thats it. They have no idea how other competitors do and therefore they couldn't compare it to how Harry did it. The excitement of the tournament is to show how all 4 champions compete against each other, not just how Harry completed his task. The second task is really good compared to the first task since we were able to see competition. The third task was a major disappointment. All they showed were a twister... at least they should included the sphinx and how Harry and Cedric competed. According to the movie, the third task is the easiest since they only run for like 5 minutes and saw the cup and run towards it. I didn't see any obstacle or anything while the third task is supposed to be the hardest,the most important task of all. I felt really disappointed after seeing the movie since it was evidently rushing and skipping lots of important details about the three main tasks."
"beame","8","1","2","21 November 2005"," Best of the HP movies so far
","The Goblet of Fire was the worst of the Harry Potter books but it has been made into the Best of the Harry Potter movies by a large margin. Maybe the simplicity of the underlying story in the book (despite the book's inordinate length) has made the transition to screen easier.<br/><br/>The movie has an excellent balance of special effects and character development. For the first time Daniel Radcliffe actually shows he can act the part and the other characters are all on the right notes both teen and adult alike (Mad-eye Moody and Rita Skeeter are perfect).<br/><br/>This is the only one of the HP movies that I would be happy to see again. HP 3 (Prisoner of Azkaban) did have the right tone (particularly with Lupin and the Dementors) but Radcliffe still couldn't act and the difficult final scene was far from satisfying. HP 2 (Chamber of Secrets) was a loud mess of special effects that had me and my kids fidgeting with boredom with about 30 minutes still to go (although Dobby was well done and Kenneth Branagh was good as Gilderoy Lockhart). HP 1 (Sorcerer's Stone) got some things seriously wrong in addition to Radcliffe's weak acting, most noticeably a lack of whimsy and a far too sinister take on Harry's first encounters with wizarding at Hogwarts; John Williams soundtrack was particular inappropriate and overblown in those scenes. Richard Harris seemed far too weak as Dumbledore, too, even in HP 1. (Maybe it was his health.) I have much preferred Michael Gambon who projects more of the strength of the character although I did find his consonants a little non-British and almost Americanized in HP 4. (Is it his Irish origins showing?)"
"tlbmonkey","8","1","2","20 November 2005"," Mostly GREAT!
","Okay, I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I loved this movie, BUT there were some key points that I felt missed the mark. First and foremost, I truly think that Michael Gambon is not capturing the true essence of Dumbledore. Gambon's emotional performance (too much so at times) lacks the strength and compassion that Richard Harris so effortlessly exhibited. Also, the way they chose to create Sirius's image in the fire is definitely not how it is described in the book. That along with the lack of his presence in this movie, was a big disappointment. I also would have liked to have had someone comment in more detail about Neville's parents, and the pain he's gone through. It seems as if those who have not read the book will not have the same connection with Neville's character and vulnerabilities. The last subplot that I feel was sorely missed was that of the triwizard tournament winnings (the money) and Harry's choice of where to spend it (or give it). This is a subplot that leads to so many other important connections, that if they are all eliminated for the next movie, we fans will be greatly disappointed. They SHOULD present the next movie in two parts. It's just too much good fun to cut out!!!"
"ChineseOldMarketMan","Null","1","2","20 November 2005"," Loved it
","Okay, lets start it off like this. So far, THIS is the best Potter movie! Amazingly done, Mike Newell has nailed the series! Comparing him to the other two Potter directors, Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron, Mike seemed to be more familiar with the boarding school style, and has he ever done a fantasy movie before? What would you call two of his other films Donnie Brasco and Pushing Tin? Mike was pretty much a starter in this genre, and he sure pulled it off nice enough. What's amazing about this one, is that it does not focus on only ONE thing. In the previous 3 films (which weren't that bad, but still) the majority of scenes would end with Hermione saying something along the lines of ""Harry! I found another clue on why Sirius Black wants to kill you!"" No, this one added more on the maturing students, the Triwizard tournament, friendship conflicts and so on. The Radiohead guest appearance was amusing and funny to watch the Hogwarts kids partying like everyday teens. The only thing that bugged me about this was the amount of screen time for Sirius Black. He had more moments in the book, and technically you didn't see Gary Oldmans real face, all he had was a CGI face in the fireplace. A little disappointing, especially to the Gary Oldman fans. Well that pretty much covers the movie, 10/10!"
"muffin_muffins","10","1","2","20 November 2005"," The BEST one yet, by far!
","I have just gotten back from the theater, and I definitely think that the movies are getting better and better. I'm 14, the age of Harry and his friends, and i find the movie very real and something i really can relate too. I mean, the books are obviously, fantasy, but it's about characters that you know and love so much and them being not perfect is part of what makes Harry Potter so great. I'm not saying that the first two movies weren't good, but i think it just doesn't have that key aspect that the 3rd and 4th ones do, but especially the fourth. In the first ones, I would say, ""Wow, well there's something that will never happen to me!"" but in the fourth one, some of the things in there have happened to me and those around me. But, of course, what also makes this movie absolutely amazing is, of course, the acting. I have to say that I was immensely and pleasantly surprised when i saw what great actors/actresses this trio has turned into. Especially Daniel Radcliffe. I'm not saying the others aren't brilliant as well, but he's the one that is holding this whole movie on his back. He, of course, is the actor who plays Harry Potter. He did a job very well done. And, of course, the special effects. Everything was so nicely done. When Voldermort returned, you could see his backbones and ribs, and every bone move when he was re-born, and it was all done with the computer. And the dragon was absolutely magnificent. All the scenes of the tasks are so tense and so suspenseful even when you know it was just a green screen. Much better than i could ever dream of acting. If you just give this movie a chance, i guarantee you, you won't regret it. And if you do, well, you can email me with complaints. I'm my user name @yahoo.com (aka, muffin_muffins@yahoo.com)"
"cchamburs","9","1","2","20 November 2005"," I wish there had been house elves...
","I really enjoyed this installment. I think the actors are getting better with each movie and the director did a great job with the special effects. I know that it is really hard to take such a long book and condense it down for a movie, but I really felt there were key elements left out... especially the house elves and Sirius. I think it will be hard to add them back into the story when they become an essential part of the story in OotP and HBP. Maybe they just couldn't get Dobby to sign on to another film.=-) I loved the movie, Mad eye was great, Voldemort was perfectly awful, Cho CHang is as beautiful as I imagined her to be, and as hard as it is to like Snape at all after reading HBP, I thought he was hilarious in this film. Fleur was a bit disappointing, as was not seeing what Bill Weasely looked liked. If Bill looks anything like the Weasley twins, I think we are in for a hottie! (who knew they'd end up so cute!)

","As someone who has never read the books, but enjoyed the other filmed Potters, I was disappointed with #4.<br/><br/>The biggest problem was the pacing: I found myself loosing interest pretty soon after it started. Not that I ever really got bored. Just that I had a hard time caring. Something about the acting (more likely the directing) didn't ""sell"" me. Plus, the story arc was weird and hard to make sense out of. No matter how good a book is or how faithful you want the movie to be to it, a film must stand on its own terms and be true to its own world. Harry Potter 4 fails on both counts.<br/><br/>Also, some of the music was unbearably cheesy (""prom scene"" and closing credits)."

","I like most people was excited at the prospect of watching the fourth adaptation of a Harry Potter novel.<br/><br/>I'd already read a detailed synopsis of the movie and even though a lot seemed to be missing from the book, I was still excited.<br/><br/>Now having seen the movie, I feel a little let down. <br/><br/>The acting is great, the younger cast are maturing well and I look forward to seeing them in the rest of the movies as i'm sure most other people are. <br/><br/>The effects are stunning and are worth every penny spent on them.<br/><br/>However, the story on the other hand....<br/><br/>I don't mind that there are whole plot lines missing, in fact in some cases I was happy they chose the right story lines to cut. There was no need to have any house elves in the film. The giant storyline was another pleasing omission.<br/><br/>But the story that was presented was rushed, It seems to have been squeezed in between the special effects and humour. Obviously the only reason anybody would want to see the film!?!?!!?<br/><br/>For instance, how can you have a senior minister found dead in the middle of the school forest and not pay much attention to it?.<br/><br/>Emma Watson (Hermione) was great when she was on screen, but seemed to only be there to play the big sister role, instead of having anything useful to do. Rupert Grint (Ron) was mainly there for comic effect. Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) was given very little to say, and what he did say wasn't very helpful to the story line.<br/><br/>And what happened to Barty Crouch Jr at the end? In the book he was killed by dementors, but in this movie?<br/><br/>I took someone who hadn't read the book and I had to explain the film as it didn't flow well or even tell the story that well. I'm sure it was all there, but unless you got every line being spoken it was easy to miss important points.<br/><br/>I've given a 7, though that was just due to great acting and effects. I can see me watching the DVD carefully once released to pick up on the subtlety of what was easy to miss first time around.<br/><br/>You won't regret seeing it, but compared to the other movies, there is far more attention needed to follow the story.

Not that the movie was bad, but without the familiarity of having read the story I would have been lost, and with the familiarity I was wondering where the story went.<br/><br/>The characters did a good job. Moody was pretty close, but I keep getting disappointed in Dumbledore. He is truly the wizard most capable of having power equal to Voldermort, but since Harris passed away, he doesn't appear to have that air of always being in control and knowing what is going on, even when confusion and concern are rampant. I don't think he would ever grab and shake Harry as he did in one scene and I didn't like it.<br/><br/>The movie was just to jumbled. Throws you into the World Quidditch Tournament, then this quick Death Eater thing and then into the Tri-Wizard Tournamanet and you know that there are gaping holes that unless you are familiar with the book, just can't be filled and even then its murky.<br/><br/>I'd rather see something 3 hours long that delves more into the story than some hatchet job, even if well intentioned."
"Rick NYC-2","10","1","2","20 November 2005"," not for the kiddies
","We middled-aged Harry Potter fans loved it, but the nine-year-old godson fidgeted throughout. It has lots of exposition and dialog, and the action sequences were downright dark and creepy. Mr. Fiennes, as Voldemort, will give me nightmares for years to come.<br/><br/>The romance angle was charming, and Hermione has turned into a gorgeous young woman, doing a Cinderella turn in the ballroom scene. Master Radcliffe shows off his torso in a naughty bathtub scene with the girl ghost. Clearly, these three kids are going to be a bit old when it comes time to play 17-year-olds in Movie 7. Only some extraordinary witchcraft in the make-up department will allow these young adults to come off as teenagers in a few years' time.<br/><br/>Already, it was a bit of a stretch to buy Harry as only 14 years of age in this one, but it wasn't impossible, so this outing was by far the most successful rendition of Rowling's words. I'd call it a masterpiece."
"teigeng","7","1","2","20 November 2005"," So many good things, but some very important factors left out
","Overall, I believe this was a good movie and a fair addition to the Harry Potter series, but there were things the screenwriter and director totally missed out on that really ought to have been included.<br/><br/>I can understand leaving out the Dursleys, Ludo Bagman and SPEW, and maybe even Molly Weasley, but poor Alan Rickman was left with so little to do with his character in this one that by the time he becomes a truly essential character in the fifth movie, they're going to have to explain so much that he's almost going to seem really random. The realization that Snape is a Death Eater was an eye opener in the book, yet here it is almost like, ""Oh yeah, by the way..."" It's almost as though they do not know what to do with his character, and he's probably the most important one outside of the trio. Another thing that really was done horribly was the ending. The viewer was left with the feeling that Barty Crouch Jr. is going to come back, when in reality he's supposed to be dead. Are they going to just to add his death into the very beginning of movie five, or what? They also skipped out on Fudge's scene at the end, which is a terrible shame because Robert Hardy could have done that scene brilliantly. The film seemed very jumpy and incoherent in other spots as well. The best example I can give of this is Hermione and Ron's confrontation at the Yule Ball, and then in the next scene they're best friends again without any real explanation as to how they made up.<br/><br/>However, despite these problems, there were many things done well. The trial scene (with the exception knowing Snape is a Death Eater), was really well done and the Unforgivable Curse scene was a lot darker (very appropriately) than in the film. The tasks were all done well, especially the underwater scene. The best scene though (the most anticipated, in my opinion) was the graveyard scene. Ralph Fiennes was chillingly awesome as Voldemort. The priori incantatem was done perfectly and the Death Eaters were maliciously frightening (though I think the budget could have handled a larger hood for Lucius Malfoy).<br/><br/>The acting is better in this one. Katie Leung was fine as Cho (though her character, thank goodness, was not all that big), and yes, she was pretty enough for the part. Stanislav, Fleur and Robert were good as the the other champions, though Krum and Fleur did not get to say much. Hagrid and Madame Maxime's scenes were cute, Brendan Gleeson played a very believable Mad-Eye, Rita Skeeter was played to the hilt by Miranda Richardson, and Dumbledore was not as hyper as he seemed in the trailers. McGonagall had a larger role in this film, but sadly Snape had nothing to do, Narcissa Malfoy did not make an appearance (which will make her seem very random in movie six), same with the Lestranges. As far as the trio, Harry's acting has improved substantially since ""He was their friend"", Ron plays it about the same, and Hermione is gradually weakening with her overblown emotions. Her line at the end nearly killed the movie, but I suppose that wasn't her fault she had to say it. The new music was good as well.<br/><br/>Overall, a 7 out of 10, and I'm being generous. Taken as a movie, it is okay, and the art direction, cinematography and etc. are all great, but the character development is weak. Had the movie been just even twenty minutes longer, it could have been better. Definitely not a contender for best adapted screenplay at the Oscars, that's for sure."
"skwok12","8","1","2","20 November 2005"," Worth seeing movie
","I'm not a Harry Potter fan but with the plot and its excitement in the movie, I give it a thumb up. It's entertaining, excitement and full of imagination. A dragon fight, an underwater sequence and skin-crawling set pieces as the dark Lord Voldemort rises again. It's full of terrors and unexpectedness. Harry, as usual, has bigger things to worry about. His name has been mysteriously entered in the surprisingly dangerous Triwizard Tournament, a series of tasks that appears to lead him in the direction of the dark Lord Voldemort. Steven Kloves' screenplay doesn't make this path particularly clear  a pitfall, perhaps, of turning a 752-page tome into a feature-length movie. But the movie still immerses you in a sense of place and magic that builds its own kind of momentum."
"Swimpenguin","4","1","2","20 November 2005"," Weird Adaptation
","Adapting such a large book into one movie must have been difficult, but I think it could have been much better. The Tournament and Harry and Ron fighting pretty much filled the entire movie. Narrative structure was missing; I would never anticipate or understand the ending if I hadn't read the books. Also a lot of weird directorial decisions; some shots were so dark it was difficult to tell which character was which. Also confusing was why every scene with Hermione and Harry seemed shot to make it seem like Hermione is in love with Harry, which readers should dispute. I was also confused by some sexual comments, which are not part of the book. Hogwarts seemed more like a high school with magic wands than a wizarding school. Overall I was disappointed by how much of the story was missing and more by how the spirit of the story was missing."
"michiganfilm","6","1","2","20 November 2005"," Tell don't show
","I have given this film a 6 because as a Harry Potter fan, I must admit this film did well in visualizing scenes from the Goblet of Fire book. However, viewed as a cinematic work it was very disappointing. The characters of Fred and George are more prominent adding a lot of comedy to the film, but almost all of the jokes were dependent on them, most of the jokes being slapstick. With Harry being 14 years old in this film, obviously there is going to be a new adolescent sexuality to his character, but that was the main topic of the film when he wasn't battling a dragon or casting a spell. Some scenes with this new sexuality lasted precious minutes past their prime, leaving no room for the amazing older actors such as Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. Emma Watson was adorable as Hermione in the first film, but now she doesn't seem to be able to portray emotion without melodramatics. The main problem with this film, however, is trying to fit a some 600 page book into a 2 1/2 hour film. The book was well represented, I have no beef as a Potter fan about that. But trying to fit in all these pages lead to the most blatant explication imaginable. Film is a visual medium with sound attached. In intro screen writing classes, the number one lesson is to show not tell, which Steve Klove seemed to completely ignore. All the questions that arise during the film are nicely and neatly explained with a dull conversation between Harry and one of his smarter companions. He hardly finds anything out for himself. My advice, wait until it comes out on video, that way you can fall asleep in the comfort of your own home."
"dbherer","4","1","2","20 November 2005"," Disappointed
","I was disappointed by the movie. I think that Warner Brother should have invested a little more time, money and efforts. Special effects were poor to say the least. The actor playing Dumbledor is not well suited for the role or badly directed. Professor Moody's makeup and costume makes him look kind of cheap. The castle's design was really impressive in the 3 first movies; in this one it looks dull. The arrival of the chariot and boat of the other schools is really not impressive. Important scenes are missing, for example, it would have been really enjoyable to see each participant's fight against the dragons. With a better script and high quality special effects, Harry's fight against the dragon could have been a really great scene. I left the theater thinking Warner Brother wanted a maximum profit with minimal investment."
"eschetic","6","1","2","20 November 2005"," OK MOVIE movie, less so for lovers of literate film
","I went with high expectations to the new Harry Potter on its second night with a NON-Potter fan. As my friend observed (having only seen the thickness of the book, not having read it), to film a book that thick you HAVE to condense - but the condensation was so extreme I was concerned that anyone who had not read the book going in couldn't FOLLOW what was happening in the movie. <br/><br/>It turned out as the first Potter film my friend LIKED. <br/><br/>The first two films (""The Sorcerer's Stone"" - ""PHILOSOPHER'S Stone"" outside the United States where they don't underestimate the intelligence of their audience - or how many of us learned about the Philosopher's Stone in old Donald Duck comic books! and ""Chamber of Secrets"") were absolute models of FAITHFUL translations of terrific books to screen - a template for how ALL classic (or at least popular) books should be filmed. <br/><br/>The last one (""Prisoner of Azkaban"") wasn't nearly as successful artistically, changing the tone (without good reason - frequently diminishing the potential ""cinematic"" power) and the letter of the best book in the series - and diminishing some of the best pseudo-science fiction overtones. It was distorted by a MOVIE-movie director who acknowledged who didn't WANT to film the BOOK, but make a movie with his own stamp on it (God protect movies drawn from good SOURCES from directors like that!). <br/><br/>Thankfully, Rowlings and the studio stepped in to protect their franchise and insist that some major plot points essential for later developments of the story COULD NOT BE CHANGED. The film succeeded financially, and for the most part artistically, but it worried me how many of the reviews praising this one said nice things about the LAST one. I was right to be worried. <br/><br/>While getting a new director who supposedly promised to be more faithful (a promise not notably kept), he retained some of the worst revisions in visual tone (NOT necessary for the ""darker"" story) imposed on ""The Prisoner of Azkaban."" <br/><br/>Recognizing that as the books get thicker MORE omissions are inevitable, I actually enjoyed this one more, but was still disappointed that several essential visuals from the book (like the LOOK of the use of the ""flue network"" for communication) were thrown out in favor of less effective but more expensive ""special effects"" simply to call attention to themselves. <br/><br/>Yes, massive details, setups and MOTIVATIONS from the book (MOST of the Quiddich World Cup, Ron's admiration one of the players - later to be rethought - and Fred & George's build up for their joke shop - important in the next book/movie, ""Order of the Phoenix"") frequently entire characters, some of them who will be important in later books, were eliminated (the Dursleys, ALL the ""house elves,"" a member of the Ministry of Magic and Ron's elder brother Percy, beginning a climb for weaselly power in the Ministry and most of the rest of the family; the dastardly Rita Skeeter remains as barely an afterthought). Most of these however don't hurt the story (yet), but to toss out the plot specific PERSPECTIVE from which Harry's dreams were seen does. It makes one wonder if part of the director's problem was that he didn't actually READ the book, just the ""treatment.""<br/><br/>Often these eliminations were in favor of flavorless insertions (for no discernible reason other than justifying the ""screenwriter"" credit - like the desultory ""dance lesson""), but occasionally to give MORE screen time to characters who merited it and were being stiffed by elisions elsewhere (Cedric Diggery and especially the increasingly interesting and well played Neville Longbottom).<br/><br/>Also on the good side, while having far less impact than in the book, is Emma Watson's Hermione Granger. Always a firm natural actress, Ms. Watson is developing into a positive beauty who should have a grand post-Potter career. <br/><br/>Ralph Feines is going to be a FINE Voldemort, but throwing out much of J.K. Rowlings' actual plot specific description of details of his face seems a VERY lame make-up artist's conceit rather than inspiration. Michael Gambon (still unevenly filmed in this outing) is slowly growing into the role defined by the late Richard Harris, but his make-up artists are going to HAVE to get his hair and beard back to a purer white before the 6th and 7th films rather than the hideous rat color they've been effecting so far.<br/><br/>I came away from the film having enjoyed it but being honestly unexcited by it, as I had been by the first two. The over-long first ""Challenge"" was an exciting spectacle, but a SEVERE and illogical disappointment compared to the dazzling and highly cinematic work in the book which was FOCUSED and didn't have to roam all over the countryside, destroying castle roofs and ignoring the POINT of the challenge to BE so. The deletion almost entirely of the exciting SCORING of the three challenges or the work of virtually anyone but Harry IN them, removed most of the real interest. The final challenge bears little resemblance to the one in the book and almost none of its excitement or interest.<br/><br/>At the same time, it looks like the film will be SO successful, someday we may actually get the HBO (or some such) miniseries actually DOING the books as written ala the several BBC Sherlock Holmes series or HBO's (sadly historically revisionist) ROME. I guess I'm happy for that - and that to the extent the film excites some illiterate MOVIE people to READ the source they've got wonderful surprises in store for them."
"onegirlchosen","8","1","2","20 November 2005"," A Movie That All Should See
","First, I must say, that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an exceptional movie that will be enjoyed by any fan of the series. Also, it has to be understood that in a two and a half hour film, it is quite impossible to cram in the side-stories and the tiny details that made us smile in the original novel. In my personal opinion, the Harry Potter movies shouldn't just stand alone, but the viewer must have read the book as well to understand exactly what is going on. With all of that said, let me begin.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this film to be a huge improvement from the Prisoner of Azkaban. The acting was far better, it was still visually stunning and they were able to get across that these children that we have grown up with over the past four years aren't children anymore, they're teenagers. They're teenagers about to enter into a terribly dark world where Voldemort will stop at nothing but to regain his control over the wizarding world. Just simple things, like Hermione and Harry laughing at Hermione's ""misuse"" of words while she tried to describe the relationship between her and Viktor or Ron being absolutely mortified when having to dance with Professor McGonnagal. The adults did a good job as well. Mad-Eye's sick humor was perfect. McGonnagal was flawless as always, and I think Professor Snape, even if he said probably a total of five lines, was still a joy to see on screen. The directing, on the other hand, was a bit awkward from time to time. During the Quidditch World Cup Raid in the beginning, I was constantly going ""what?"" because it was just so awkward. Also, Neville's scene on the staircase, ending with the stained glass window, was so cheesy, even Wisconsin would've said it came from its state.<br/><br/>One thing about this film that I'm sure nobody will disagree with me about is that it was rushed. As all fans of the book will know, that saying that there is a ton of content in the book would be an understatement. I constantly found myself trying to catch up with what's going on. The lovely transitions from fall to winter or winter to spring that gave you a chance to think about what happened are gone. They go from one event to the next immediately. I personally didn't mind it, because I have read the books and knew what was going on, but I couldn't help but feel for the rest of the audience who never even cracked a Harry Potter book, wondering if they knew that Wormtail was Peter Pettigrew (which they never explained in the last movie) and if they're going to understand a couple things in the future movies, because those issues weren't addressed in the past movies. Really, I think it's to each his own on this issue. I didn't mind how quick they went from one event to the other in a heartbeat, but to others I guess it could be terribly annoying.<br/><br/>This is definitely what I would title a PG-13 movie. If you have a child under the age of eight years, save it until it comes out onto DVD when you're able to view it in your own home and edit it at your own pleasure. While some of the content might go over their heads, you cannot deny the fact that the idea of the most ultimate form of evil in Harry's world is back and in a very human-like form would terrify a child of four.<br/><br/>In the end, I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. Keep the toddlers out of the theater and save it for home. The acting is quite enjoyable, but the directing is another story. Even if the movie was a bit rushed and you're an avid Harry Potter fan, go, see it and more than likely you'll love it. If you're not, more than likely you'll still love it, just make sure that you can accept that this is just an adaptation of the book and you're probably not going to understand everything immediately."
"john-1425","7","1","2","20 November 2005"," A missed opportunity
","So the latest instalment of the Harry Potter series is among us, and to be honest, it is a bit of disappointment. Mike Newell seems to have missed a trick and this film, is one of the weaker adaptations from JK Rowlings epic series.<br/><br/>First up, just about every scene that they did, was done well. Dumbledore losing his rag with Harry is out of context, and the Maze is poorly scripted, but generally the acting, special effects and screenplay of what was on the screen, is fantastic. A cinematic treat! What was missing was ""glue"" - bits of the film to hold these fantastic scenes together and stop the film being a disjointed mess. This, was not here. Key areas of the books were missing - subplots which will be required in later books.<br/><br/>To me, the film is 80% of the way to be a great film, but, as so often in films, its not whats there that is the problem, its what's missing.<br/><br/>Worth watching, but very much a missed opportunity to create a real classic. Roll on Narnia in December"

"grayhound496","4","1","2","20 November 2005"," Too much left out
","If you did not read the book, there is no way you will understand what's going on during the movie. I think the director made the assumption that everyone has read the book, and therefore left out explanations of why some things happened. I mean I understand he can't include everything from the book, but he left out some pretty significant parts, like the house elves, Ludo Bagman, etc... And when the director strayed away from the book, he created scenes and dialogue that weren't very good at all. And none of the scenes were very effective because I don't think any of them were longer than 5 minutes except for maybe the dragon scene. I definitely think that this book should have been split up into two movies, and I hope that is what they do with the next book."
"victor7754","8","1","2","20 November 2005"," What is the Magic of Harry Potter?
","J.K. Knowlings, author of the Potter series has created an unlikely hero. Harry Potter, an awkward boy with glasses who possesses a powerful spirit. He possesses courage, stamina, logic, sensibility, patience, love and wisdom. He also possesses hate caused by Lord Voldemort, the person responsible for the death of Harry's Parents when he was a baby. Our hero Harry Potter possesses one more trait: He is a Wizard.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire is the Fourth installment of the Knowling series. The young wizards, Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are back for their fourth year at Hogwarts, the Wizard School located somewhere between time and dimension. The school is an incredible Castle on a mountainside surrounded by snowy peaks and green forests and a tranquil lake. Within Hogwarts interior we meet the familiar cast of Wizards, Witches, Creatures, and returning students. It is a colorful and entertaining cast.<br/><br/>Harry finds himself selected by the Goblet Of Fire as an underage competitor in a dangerous multi-wizardry school competition known as the Tri Wizard Tournament in which student representatives from three different sorcery schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. The tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Harry must fend off accusations of tampering with the Goblet of Fire. The School's Top Wizards are concerned for Harry and suspicious of him as well. New characters emerge throughout the film including Alastor 'MadEye' Moody who is the new Professor of the Dark Arts.<br/><br/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione are now 14 and experiencing the hormonal changes taking place. Puberty brings with it many dark forces that all teenagers must battle as they try to make it through school and life. The Goblet Of Fire has an allegorical tone of using the dark forces of Puberty. The Dragons that come at you during those confusing years are powerful but must be faced just as Harry battles his fire breather in one of the tournaments challenges.<br/><br/>British Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and A Funeral, Enchanted April, Donnie Brasco) takes on the Potter series and rises above the call of duty. He creates some beautiful visuals, including a silhouetted shot of the young wizards running along a hillside in the beginning of the film. It was a sure sign that the film was going to be a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The entire cast flows from one to the other and seem comfortable in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe portrays Harry Potter a bit rigid and always wears the same look of wonder on his face whenever he enters anywhere new. He has been at Hogwarts for four years, one would think he would have developed a bit more culture. His character is still young and vulnerable but the Goblet of Fire has chosen Harry's name and he now must act.<br/><br/>Albus Dumbledore, the Head Wizard of Hogwarts says to Harry: ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right... and what is easy. ""<br/><br/>The Magic Of Harry Potter is that he is you and I at our finest.<br/><br/>Rated PG 13 for violence and mature themes."

","I enjoyed watching the newest Harry Potter film and recommend you view it as well. Overall, the movie captured the main points of the novel, but left out the factors that led to them. Such as the house-elves. The house-elves played a key role in the novel and because they were taken out of the movie, several scenes had to be altered. The actors and actresses were superb! I was a little shocked when Dumbledore seized Harry the way he did when his name came out of the Goblet though, because in the novel, no such reaction took place from Dumbledore. Aside from that one scene though, everyone was great. I impress my recommendation that the next 3 novels be released on film, containing the actors Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe, and actress Emma Watson. They all fit the description given by Rowling and are wonderful. As well, the new characters, Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory, along w/ their schoolmates and Professors, Mad-Eye Moody, and so on, were terrific!

"tokenyon","7","1","2","19 November 2005"," Decent, but not overwhelming
","I can't say I was overwhelmed. I will emphasise this isn't a bad film, but it didn't blow me away; at best it succeeds in being slightly better than average. The roots of this film obviously lie much more in the previous film than the first two; this is defiantly a good thing, it reflects the changing tone of the book towards more sinister overtones. The castle is shrouded in dark clouds, 'Dark and difficult times lie ahead', indeed.<br/><br/>Acting from the British greats is as to be expected, spectacular performances from almost all; notably that of recent addition to cast Ralph Fiennes. There is defiantly a lack of screen time for many of the Hogwarts teaching staff, the film largely revolves around the kids; much more so than previous films. This is both a good and bad thing, it keeps the plot moving at a far whack and gives us more time to engage with our protagonists. However it limits our absorption into the world, it chips away at those things that enrich the Potter world. One last comment is on the performance of Alan Rickman (as Snape) which seems slightly uneasy, I can't explain why but the limited encounters with him just seem somehow off. <br/><br/>The acting of child actors is, as always, the contentious issue. I share the same concerns many have expressed over the casting of Radcliffe as Potter, the simple fact is that he is failing to develop as an actor. This becomes increasingly evident as the performances of Gint (Ron) and Watson (Hermione) improve. Gint is worthy of particular mention here as his performance best embodies that which I would like to see from the others, he is beginning to show the signs of a mature actor. Watson is competent enough but does not, to me, embody the true spirit of Hermonie. An IMDb.com quote attributed to her reflects the character as 'snotty, bossy and posh', as a reader of the books this goes against the characteristics I have interpreted from the character.<br/><br/>The plot, as I have mentioned, lacks background substance but it works hard on keeping momentum in presenting its core material, the events of the 'Tri-Wizard tournament'. It does this with substantial flair, the effects surpass expectations and fit neatly in with the already established Potter movie imagery. All the core plot elements are there and while the pace is hurried the flow of the film is maintained admirably. <br/><br/>All things considered this is not a bad film, certainly one that is worth watching; but perhaps just the once. Therein lies its killer flaw, the film is merely a competent representation of the universe keeping continuity with the themes laid out in previous movies. The film certainly attempts at showing both the epic (the tournament) and the personal (the newly discovered romantic feelings of the protagonists), but the two are not so neatly interwoven. I walked away from the film with an impression of missing depth, we got to learn much about the Harry and friends, but other characters are not so neatly cut out. With the movie pushing the roles of new characters Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory; the old, such as Draco and Mrs. Weasly, are rather mercilessly cast aside. They are are almost certainly conspicuous by their absence."
"GipperD5","10","1","2","19 November 2005"," Brilliant!
","Absolutely brilliantly done movie. Despite the absence of a few plot lines from the book (which had to be removed for film length requirements), the movie flows well and very, very quickly through the storyline of the book. Though Newell won't be directing the 5th movie (the directors are starting to look like the Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers in their shifting frequency) because he didn't want to deal with wrapping the 4th while starting pre-production on the 5th, I certainly hope he'll find time in his schedule for the 6th.<br/><br/>I liked Cuaron's redirection with the 3rd movie, but I loved Newell's work with the 4th.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series, I doubt you'll be disappointed...all of these actors have grown into their roles and are much more comfortable with the characters now. The new additions for the fourth film were natural, possibly due to the fact that they didn't have much in the way of speaking parts..."

Fleur and Krum had virtually no lines, and they just stood there half the time. Sirrius was almost completely absent too that was up with that? And did anyone find that little interaction between Rita Skeeter and Harry in the ""broom closet"" to be very VERY weird, especially on Skeeter's part? I really like Ralph Finnes though.. brilliant casting choice. And Cho...Wow.... just freakin' WOW! SO HOT!!! ^_- Overall, I found myself dosing at some moments which never happens to me when I go to the movies.<br/><br/>Anyone agree?"
"feather-16","9","1","2","19 November 2005"," Where was Dobby?
","I gave the movie a 9 because of the artistry, mostly, for the dragons and underwater scenes.<br/><br/>Some of it moved too fast from scene to scene, and there wasn't an explanation given to Harry as to *why*, when his wand crossed with Voldemort's, they didn't destroy each other. (The book explains this, but Dumbledore mumbles something in Latin which meant that they were crossed. . .), and where was Dobby? Dobby was the one that stole the gillyweed from Snape's stores, and where was Winky? And what about more of the pen sieve? The pen sieve explained a lot more. . .and hey, if it would have had to have been a three and a half hour long movie, who cares? It would have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Meantime, I actually cannot wait for the next movie! :) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix should be excellent...let's hope, anyway.

"mustbemike123","10","1","2","19 November 2005"," Excellent overall, but slightly rushed
","This movie was great. I walked out of the theatre and was nearly willing to walk back in and see it again had it not been 10pm. The acting in this movie felt top-notch to me. I feel that Dan, Rupert, and Emma have all immensely improved in their acting abilities, giving a much more natural feel to the performance. And of course, the supporting cast was excellent as always, especially Miranda Richardson (Rita Skeeter) and, as always, Alan Rickman (Snape). Now, before I lay out my complaints with this movie, let me start by saying that I am an immense fan of the books and have read each one numerous times. I am all for having a five hour movie that further encompasses more of the book, yet I have come to expect the reality that such a treat will most likely never come (Although an extended edition, like in the Lord of the Rings series would be great). My main gripe has to do with the time of the movie. Yes, two and a half hours is a long running time, however, for this movie, an extra half hour would have been plenty to overall round out this film. In several scenes, it was noticeable that the actors had rushed their dialogue. Classroom scenes and various non-plot related scenes, the ones that give the books their flare, were missing. And finally, a major part of the book, at least in my mind, was the Quidditch World Cup, yet, where was it, if somewhere besides that short clip of nothing happening. The least they could have done is a five minute scene of highlights of it. Besides these gripes, minor compared to the remainder of the film, I would whole-heartedly recommend seeing this film. Now you'll have to excuse me, for I am leaving to go watch it again."

"lifelikefilms","9","1","2","19 November 2005"," Harry Potter 4
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an amazingly well produced film, although it lacked some key details in the beginning, that would be essential for new viewers/people that have not read the book. For instance, there should have been more of the actual quidich playing in the world cup scene. The last scene, in which Voldemort faced Harry, was particularly dramatic and the music through the film gave a delectable touch to the drama. In my opinion this was the movie most like the book in many respects, as it was the first one (since the Chamber of Secrets) that I found it so like the book that I seemed to think I had already seen it. Deja-vu. Overall the fourth edition to the Harry Potter series was a spectacular merge between digital effects and talented performances.<br/><br/>~C&J"
"monkey_manmarge","10","1","2","19 November 2005"," The best ""Harry Potter"" yet. To the fans, don't judge the film to harshly.
","""Goblet of Fire"" made some people eat their words. ""Harry Potter"" is not just a kiddie franchise. ""Goblet"" is mature, adult (but not in porn-like adult), and scary. I don't think PG-13 (or 12A for Brits)films are meant for the kiddies.<br/><br/>My first reaction to hearing the news of the running time was basically, ""It's impossible. They can't fit it all."" And they couldn't fit it all, but one has to think about what they're saying. In any film adaptation of any book, especially Harry Potter, one has to separate the books from the films. Harry Potter has its books, and it has its films, so the important thing to remember when seeing this is deciding if the atmosphere and the spirit, not the facts, of the books are there. And with ""Goblet"", they atmosphere and spirit were in every shot, with every note of the score. Overall, ""Goblet"" was the best ""Harry"" film yet.<br/><br/>Since the point of my review is to persuade people into seeing it and liking it, I will only talk about the good points, which outweighed the bad. Patrick Doyle is now the new composer filling in the shoes of beloved-by-Harry-Potter-fans composer, John Williams. While Doyle hasn't composed any memorable themes for ""Harry Potter"" yet, his music is the key to creating the atmosphere of every scene. The opening tune is really captivating, and features a minor-key version of ""Hedwig's Theme"" and the music in the scene in which Cedric dies made the scene a lot more emotional than what it could have been without the music. But I still give props to the actors in that scene as well.<br/><br/>Mike Newell has brought more out of the characters than J.K. Rowling has transferred to the pages of the book (but J.K.R. still kicks literary a$$)I thought that in this new film, Snape and McGonagall were very funny, Snape in a darker way. I also loved the scene in which they were speaking with Dumbledore after Harry was chosen for the Tournament. Neville was quite funny, and also, Mike Newell made his part larger to foreshadow a slightly closer relationship with Harry in the fifth film. When Neville moaned, ""Oh, my God! I've killed Harry Potter!"" the theater was in uproar. Props to Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Matthew Lewis! Plus, who could forget the new, more human Voldemort portrayed by Ralph Fiennes? His makeup was really weird/creepy/awesome, and his personality was so much like the book. He talked quite smoothly and calmly, but in a malicious fashion. The only time he expressed anger was when Harry escaped, which was perfect! Props to Ralph Fiennes and to Mike Newell for making him that way! <br/><br/>And last, but most definitely not the least, actually the most important, sort of, Dan, Rupert, and Emma, the golden trio! Many can remember in the first film when Harry's main reaction was something along the lines of ""Oh my God, what the crap!?!??"" and a lot of wide eyes and open-hanging jaws. As he slowly gained a personality, ahem, and finally had one in the fourth film, Dan made sure to give it his all, or at least it's evident. He has brought a lot to Harry's character in the fourth film, such as comedy and emotion. Referring to the Cedric death scene, or the part when Harry takes his body back to Hogwarts, I recall that I said that the music made it more sad. I sort of have to eat my words, because despite the music, Dan could have made it sad by itself. It's hard to cry on cue, people, and being one who cracks smiles during crying scenes and stuff like that, I did not crack even a small smirk. Dan is one of the most talented under-18 actors all over the world. Also, Emma brought much more to Hermione than snobbishness and smarts. She actually had herself a boyfriend, sort of. Once again, Emma stunned us. Lastly, Rupert was really funny, as always, but made so many people gape at his anger, especially his ""Piss off"" comment. Excellent job, Dan, Rupert, and Emma! So what are you sitting and reading this for? Go see ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" right now!!!!!!"
"Kurt_Pearson","7","1","2","19 November 2005"," Funny, Dark, and Good
","Wow, Harry and the gang are growing up. Adults and kids, Potter-philes or not, will love this movie because this is actually a good movie. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are developing into good actors, possibly because of the addition of great talents to the Potter troupe, like Gary Oldman, Ralph Finnes, and Brendan Gleeson. Newell's directing is top rate and the special effects are seamless. I actually noticed the sound in this film being something that obviously enhanced the movie.<br/><br/>There is a ineffable quality here that makes this the best Potter movie thus far, and a movie that sets the bar high for the holiday releases. Maybe it is the story (as the 4th book is considered the best) or maybe this one has benefited from the obvious purism of Columbus and the edginess of Cuaron, ""Goblet"" is a blend of both. <br/><br/>There will be those who want more and complain about what was left out. (Like the 12 year old who exited ""Return of the King"" complaining about what was left out of the 3.5 hour movie.) However, the story is represented very well. I had a hard time remembering what parts weren't told. Sure, I wanted to see a ""Blast-ended skrewt"" and a fuller version of the events occurring at the Quiddich World cup, but this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes and does the job it is asked to do. Besides, maybe in 20 or so years someone will make a TV mini-series out of it and cover everything in the book.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily agree with the PG-13 rating (when the rating was first introduced it was called a ""soft-R""). Admittedly, the humor is a bit more grown-up, worrying about getting a date, and how one is dressed, but not too saucy, and Grint's mantra of ""Bloody Hell"" could be seen as offensive, but nothing that should be considered salacious. The ""darker images"" mentioned have a nightmarish quality to them, but then that pretty much stays with the story. I would not recommend this for kids under 7. My 8 year old enjoyed it and was on the edge of her seat, but she was never hiding her face or clinging to me for protection.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a superior movie. It goes beyond my classification of a ""fun movie"", which is one that you over-look the obvious flaws because it is fun to watch. You care about these characters and identify with them, and find yourself wishing you could stay in their world for a while longer."
"sakurayume","8","1","2","19 November 2005"," Choppy, choppy, choppy....
","After the great achievement of The Prisoner of Azkaban, I had high hopes for the fourth book, my personal favorite in the series. However, after Alfonso Cuaron's wonderful directing and unique use of scene changes, I felt the fourth Harry Potter movie was just jumping from one thing to the next, without any kind of explanation or transition. I wonder how a person who hasn't read the book feels watching this movie. Would it even be that good? Or make sense? (There were a few times where I didn't quite understand what had happened, due to the choppiness of the movie!) <br/><br/>Of course the acting of the Hogwarts' kids has improved a lot since the first movie, I will say that. I did feel disappointed that the characters from the visiting schools did or said very little in the whole film. Even the Hogwarts' teachers had minor roles in this movie. And I find that I'm not the only one who thinks that Michael Gamdon's portrayal of Dumbledore is not quite right. He yells far too much, and doesn't give you that calm, I-will-think-and-try-to-solve-anything spirit that Dumbledore gives in the books.<br/><br/>Of course you can't fit the entire fourth Harry Potter book into one movie that's just under three hours, but I wish they would've taken greater care with both the script and the flow of the movie. Of course I'll buy the DVD in the future, but this movie doesn't merit another theater viewing! I just hope that the director of the next one, David Yates, does a better job..."
"evillad001","8","1","2","19 November 2005"," Disappointing, but Still Flippin' Awesome!
","I went to see the movie, thinking it would be the best I ever saw. As the movie started, I was stunned. My first disappointment came when they cut out the Quidditch World Cup (except the campgrounds and walking to their seat). I really wanted to see the veela, and some Quidditch, because for the Triwizard Tournament, Quidditch was out of the movie. Then came the first challenge. They only showed Harry fighting the dragon, and they didn't even show the Chinese Fireball. The Yule Ball and the events leading up to it were hilarious, and I thought Hagrid ""putting his moves"" on Madme Maxime was particularly funny. The second task didn't disappoint, but it left me wanting more. There were two things I noticed about the third task. First, it was supposed to be in the Quidditch Field. And the second was that they left all of the creatures out, I particularly wanted to see the Sphinx. Voldemort looked good, but the whole thing with him was a little short. In the end, it was good, but not enough."

We are huge Harry Potter fans, and this was quite an engaging movie for us. I loved the addition of characters, and the wonderful action. This movie seemed more real, with more down to earth characters. I would recommend this movie to anyone, no matter the age. It was an all around excellent way to spend a Saturday.

","Cute and watchable at times but for the most part, this left me feeling like the whole thing was just phoned in from wherever... Adult characters far out acted the ""stars"" who had some moments. I think better editing and a little more substance to the script could have made a huge difference in how well this picture played.<br/><br/>None of the dialog felt authenticated. Details seemed gratuitously STUFFED-in by a focus group and not by an artist. Everything felt like it was cut for time, not timing! <br/><br/>A shot near, the beginning, of Harry's amazement at (what I thought to be) the last thing that would ever amaze a guy that's seen what we know Harry's seen, was probably the biggest gaff I ever saw in a movie. It certainly didn't strike anyone else as unusual. Why Harry? Even I saw it coming a mile away. <br/><br/>This movie was a coming of age story and the acting in the related scenes was as awkward as the situation was supposed to be, and I didn't mean that in a good way.<br/><br/>The big contest (which I assume came from one of the books) had no basis in the ethics it was hypocritically attempting to preach.<br/><br/>Then the ending came along with an anticlimax ""take it home parade"" shot worthy of a TV series and we got to leave...<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw Zathura afterward and, actually, wished I had skipped the ""appetizer""...<br/><br/>P.S. Having written this before reading many of the other comments, I am actually aghast to realize that this movie represents a whole school year...! Sure, many of you will say ""Well of course it does, you idiot!"", but there was no indication, production-wise that this was not some aside special event. I didn't get a clue from all the rushed scenes that any more than a couple days passed because the production had absolutely no respect for any part of the story or communicating such trivial details as time passing.<br/><br/>I can't believe how many reviews I've seen that claim this to be the best yet...!!! I can NOT believe that these are not Ringer reviews to just to prevent the box office from tanking! The more I think about what I saw and to find that so much of the story was completely bastardized, the more I regret this waste of my time..."
"lastliberal","9","1","2","19 November 2005"," The Goblet of Fire burns bright
","There was an old Mel Brooks film that I remember called The History of the World: Part I. The tag line suggested that ""from the dawn of man to the distant future, mankind's evolution (or lack thereof) is traced."" Of course, mankind's history cannot be touched in 92 minutes, and do not expect J.K. Rowling's work, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to be given just weight in 2 hours and 37 minutes - it cannot be done. Forget the book and just sit back and enjoy what Mike Newell has prepared for your enjoyment.<br/><br/>My anticipation was palpable: a Mike Newell film from a J.K. Rowling book. There is no film on the planet that is funnier or more touching than Four Weddings and a Funeral. Newell directed his greatest achievement there. With Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, he has taken a great leap forward and given us a movie that is enjoyable to lovers of the books and anyone else who just wants to see a great movie.<br/><br/>I totally agree with reviewer Desson Thomson who states: Director Mike Newell and screenwriter Steve Kloves (who has written all the Potter films) know their primary responsibility: to create three-ring spectacles like the whiz-bang, airborne game of Quidditch, or Harry's mighty tussles with otherworldly creatures. But they also allow time for the characters to breathe. (WP) This film was the best of the bunch, I would not be surprised in the least to see this film exceed $100 million in it's first weekend. I was at the first showing at my local theater yesterday and it was full. I do not know what all those kids were doing out of school on Friday!<br/><br/>If nothing else, you have to see Brendan Gleeson as the latest addition to the Hogwarts staff, Mad-Eye Moody. As Manohla Dargis of the Times describes him: a man of garrulous temperament and removable parts, including a googly eye that he wears like a pirate's patch, Mad-Eye is a pip.<br/><br/>A pip he was and the film was stupendous."
"johnnyblack87","4","1","2","19 November 2005"," I don't think anymore of the movies should be made...
","While the Harry Potter series may be best-selling books, the movies made about the series are not nearly as good as they ought to be. The first few movies were alright at best, and with reason. The three previous movies all had things in common with the books; all three were relatively short. The fourth (Goblet of Fire) was quite a bit longer than the other three leading to serious film-making problems. Even with the movie being over two hours long, so much was left out from the book that the story line was compromised. Fellow moviegoers that had not touched a copy of the book had no idea about what was going on in the plot. The plot was further compromised by added scenes which barely pulled the movie out of the gutter with comedy. Not only will I not recommend this movie to other people, but I will advise people against spending entirely too much money on a movie that relies on the book it's based on to promote itself."

","It was truly worth the wait ! The new Harry Potter movie has all the elements to captivate the young and the adult simultaneously. The characters have grown up very suitably with the actors themselves. The special effects are good but can't help feeling that the movie failed to reach its potential in this regard. Possibilities were endless, couldn't they show something more incredible ? May be the next one will !! The only disappointment I have after viewing the movie is regarding lord Voldemort's return. His return was awesome and long-awaited. But, the fact that a 14-year-old boy successfully fought him head-to-head (even if for few seconds) and managed to escape, somehow lessened the aura of darkness associated with Voldemort. Couldn't Harry just escape without taking him on ?!!! That would make me wait for the future battles between the two with a lot more anticipation. Here lies a hint of disappointment ! However, Ralph Fiennes seems to give a new life to Voldemort in the true sense. Casting could not have been any better. Even though the movie runs for more than two hours, I never felt it was too long. On the contrary, I felt sad while leaving the movie hall. Why ? Because I will have to wait another couple(?) of years to see the next one !!"

"einheber","7","1","2","19 November 2005"," Goblet of Fizzle - minor spoilers
","Because I so thoroughly enjoyed the third movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban, I had very high hopes for this next installment. Unfortunately, they were not only disappointed, but completely dashed to pieces.<br/><br/>My first major complaint is the shift to teenage soap opera. Yes, the characters are adolescents now, but major chunks of the movie come off like The HP on the WB. This sort of thing can and has been tastefully done, but this is not one of those times. There is quite a bit of sexual innuendo, body part camera shots, and other material that is decidedly unsuitable for the target age group. Although this movie is rated PG-13, it is because of ""sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images"". No warning is given, however, that we're about to embark on a journey to Hogwarts 90210.<br/><br/>Somewhat related to the first point, the music for this movie is quite a departure from the delightful ""something wicked this way comes"" vibe we had in the last movie. Portions of the score here, especially those during the aforementioned melodrama, sound like they were lifted from romance classics of the 1940's, complete with what I suppose were meant to be emotionally stirring violin chords. Oh, Beauregard! <br/><br/>Through the movie I kept waiting for a scene to be shot on a set where I'd think to myself, wow, that is really cool. I'm picturing the first time I saw the moving staircases in Hogwarts, for instance. As far as I can recall, the sets in this movie were dreary backdrops that weren't particularly interesting. Yes, there were interesting things here and there, but that sense of wonder and discovery isn't there like the past movies.<br/><br/>Even the magic seemed lackluster in this installment. Apart from a few spells detailed in one classroom scene, there's nothing really innovative here, and we certainly aren't swept along with the excitement of learning new things. It seemed that there was almost an overabundance of magical items through the movie, haphazardly placed and mostly irrelevant to the plot. Ho hum.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This movie does have some fairly good sequences, and some very well done moments (like Harry and Hermione on either side of the tent flap), but overall it was a major letdown for me. This is, by far, my least favorite of the four movies. I'm not sure I'd even watch it again without a good reason. I grudgingly give this a 7/10 (I'd watch it again), but it's almost a 6 (not interested in watching it again)."
"ndcrumpton","5","1","2","19 November 2005"," More a survey of events than a complete movie
","If ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was twice as long, it would have had the potential of developing an actual cohesive story line. However, because the director unfortunately decided to try to smash 700-pages of a book into 2 1/2 hours, the movie simply jumps from one scene to the next without anything tying the events together.<br/><br/>Another problem is that time does not progress in a logical manner throughout the movie. The natural progression of events and relationships developed between characters seems to take place over a period of a week, not an entire school year. I mean, one minute they are on a train heading to Hogwarts (presumably August or September) and 30 minutes later it is Christmas Eve! Another example is that the tournament begins close to the beginning of school, and it ends at the end of school, with only 3 tournament events happening in between. Yet it seems like only a day or two passes between each event. The audience can only wonder how we got here so fast. Even the characters in the movie seem to be still getting to know each other (having had only a handful of social interactions with each other) by the end of the school year.<br/><br/>The unfortunate result is that relationships between the characters (which seems to be an important theme in the movie) are ineffective and rushed, making each scene where a character displays emotion look more like a result of teenage hormones than real issues that can be sympathized with. For example, when Hermione gets upset at the ball and cries, I was wondering ""What's her problem? Oh, I get it, I'll bet she and that red-head kid kind of like each other."" Perhaps if I had read the book before going into the movie, that would have been more obvious.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie does have some entertaining aspects, such as special effects and Ralph Fiennes playing Voldemort. Perhaps the next movie will take a little more time to develop (and give us more Gary Oldman, one of the most underrated and enjoyable actors of this generation)."
"reluktantwarrior","3","1","2","19 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: they could have gone deeper
","While the Goblet of Fire book is over 700 pages, and we can't expect everything to be covered int he movie as it is laid out in the book, I still found the movie to be lacking. The movie pulled in only the main story line, and left out all the small details, mysteries, clues, and puzzles that makes Harry Potter so fun and interesting.<br/><br/>I think that the movie suffers greatly from this simplification. While the 3rd movie did not cover the book exactly as it was written, it still gave the characters and setting a depth that made them seem like real people. The characters in this movie acted more like caricatures, using small ""familiar"" (such as the way Ron's twin brothers are manufactured to be a duel-voiced automaton of pranks who happen to be around all the time), details to make us recognize them from the books, rather than creating an in-depth human being. In addition, the school and the school setting felt much more superficial. The school settings was constantly cold, dark, and foreboding, a weak attempt to set the theme of the storyline, without having to truly go into depth as to what is happening in this time.<br/><br/>I think this movie failed to capture the intensity that makes Harry Potter as drawing and addictive as it is, and instead of feeding into the Harry Potter 'world' this more left us merely, vaguely entertained."
"NanC816","8","1","2","19 November 2005"," Loved it... Hated it
","As an adult fan of the Harry Potter series, I have to say I walked away from the movie opening night with mixed emotions. <br/><br/>First, why I loved ""Goblet of Fire"". The imagery of the film surpassed all of its predecessors. Director Newell succeeded in bringing Rowlings wizarding world to life with the brilliance of the special affects. I have never seen Hogwarts more beautiful. The cast was wonderful. I was pleased to see many characters brought to the foreground and given more plot than before. Neville was a delight in the lighter scenes with Harry and at the ball and brought me to tears in the tense classroom scene where he obviously relived the moment of his parents torture by the Death Eaters during the demonstration of the Cruciatus Curse.Fred and George were a riot, who both most certainly lived up to their ""mischief maker"" status. And I have to say, Filch was a complete hoot, as his dim-witted, lighter side shined through. Brendan Gleeson gave a superb performance as Alister ""Mad-eye"" Moody, and of course, Daniel Radcliffe touched me throughout the movie, particularly in the graveyard scenes until the end.<br/><br/>Now, why I hated it. (pause) People will sit through long movies (ex. Titanic, Gone With the Wind, etc). Why in everything that is holy would someone try to cram 636 pages of story into 150 minutes? There is an old cinematic device called the ""intermission"" which worked quite effectively in movie making history. Why is an intermission effective, well, let's see.. 1)gives the story-maker the opportunity to tell the story correctly without RUSHING through it and DELETING critical information or wow..PERSONAL INTERACTION to help the viewer RELATE to its character and 2)is a marvelous tool to give viewers a break from the action and regroup and hey.. maybe even INTERACT about the movie and get worked up and come back looking more forward to the rest of the film than before.<br/><br/>I was physically ill in the first half of the movie due to the rushed, mushed together scenes that had no break or flow. Newell did nothing more than cut the most action packed scenes of the book and bring them to life (which he did brilliantly) however, why? Anyone who never read the book would be completely lost and uncaring about the characters and to why things where happening because they would not be able to relate. And Mr. Newell a word, people love Harry Potter books because we LOVE Harry, and all the characters.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the most important reason I walked away sick from the movie... the lack of respect by Newell for what Harry Potter is about.. and that is love and the relationship between people. I agree 100% that this film needed to be darker, absolutely. Harry has crossed into the world of Voldemort, adolescence and the beginnings of his adulthood. But as an adult reader and watcher of the films, if I don't care about the people... I won't watch the films or read any more books. It was bad enough that you cut out the Dursley's (by doing so, killing one of the most hysterically funny moments in the book, the chimney scene)and many other people you considered ""bulking"" subplot but there are 2 unforgivable deletions: Molly Weasley and Sirius Black. By thinking of them as ""bulk"" you destroyed pivotal connections(both personal and storyline)between both characters and the main plot points for the future films/books. Do you even read the books? By cutting out Molly and Sirius you cut a critical link to the next journey that Harry takes. So in film 5 ""Order of the Phoenix"" are you casually going to mention ""Oh yeah, Voldemort is back and over the summer we reformed the order."" or ""Oh yes, Sirus and Molly were devastated over what happened to Harry in the graveyard but we don't need to know their reactions so that you will be lost through this film too.?<br/><br/>I think I made my point... and without having to say too much in ending I will leave you with this... Albus Dumbledore...please read the book and see that you have created a wizard that is as much as J.K.Rowlings Dumbledore as he is Voldemort. (sigh)"
"jodiblake2003","6","1","2","19 November 2005"," Goblet of Fire just okay
","As I attended the first showing of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire last night, I found myself trembling with anticipation. Admittedly, I am an adult Harry Potter junkie. My husband and I own all 6 books in hardback and all 3 movies that are currently out on DVD. We were among the first in line at our local theater to see Goblet of Fire. However, my anticipation quickly dissipated as the movie began. My first disappointment came when Mike Newell chose to quickly cut to the port key on the way to the Quiddich World Cup. He chose not to preface the Cup at all and left anyone not as familiar with the books as I am incredibly confused. I heard numerous rumblings around me of people who were already lost at that point, less than 5 minutes into the movie. I felt that the movie continued to disappoint in the minute details that Newell chose to alter to suit his needs. One that stuck with me at the time and continues to stick with me the morning after is his decision to put the Patil twins both in Griffindor house. This is not true to the books; it is mentioned in the very first book that even identical twins don't end up in the same house. I am also disappointed in the way that Hermione was portrayed in this film. I feel that instead of being the valuable Harry Potter friend that she's been in the last 3 movies, she was depicted as being a tag along. Emma Watson was given very few scenes in which to give viewers the true essence of Hermione. The scene at the end of Yule Ball on the stairs is a fleeting example of her talent used sparingly. I was disappointed too to see that Mike Newell had completely changed the look of the Griffindor common room. Although it has been featured only a few times in the past 3 movies, it was a shock to see him make changes to such an important place. All-in-all, I feel that this movie was good and lived up to the Harry Potter name...but, didn't do the book justice. It's impossible to cram a book of this magnitude into a couple hours of film. Although I am not advocating making the film longer or making it 2 separate movies, I am stating disappointment with the decisions that were made. As previously stated, I feel that this movie in its entirety left to chance that viewers were extremely familiar with the Harry Potter legend and with the Goblet of Fire book itself. I do hope they don't make the same mistakes with Order of the Phoenix, which should prove to be an even bigger challenge."
"lore_life","9","1","2","19 November 2005"," character development
","This is a great movie for those who are looking for a mixture of humor and fantasy, and of a somewhat darkness. However, for a movie like this, you need great character development. Despite all of the excellent acting, i didn't quite FEEL for any of the characters,maybe a little bit, but it didn't quite hit the spot for me, especially harry potter. Unlike the book, there wasn't much of a build up of the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, Harry and Sirius.They could've added 2 more minutes of dialogue from the book that are extremely vital to the series, and 20 more minutes of scene's to build on harry's relationship with characters other than his two best friends, Ron and Hermione. Also a lot of the scenes were a bit rushed, and some scenes didn't connect with each other. Readers of harry potter books, such as me, would be really disappointed due to the fact of how a lot of the book wasn't followed. On top of that, a few key characters were left out. i understand that David Yates had to shorten this but there are ways to add 20-30 minutes to cover some really important stuff. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie in a non-reader's, (of the book), view but i think David Yates could've added 20-30 more minutes to satisfy the larger portion of viewers, who consist of ppl who have read the book. There's a major difference between the viewers of the movie, there are those who have read the book and those who haven't, so i'll give this movie two different rating in my rating system. As a reader of the book, let's say 3 and a half out of 5, great movie, just short of excellent, not near solid. In a person who hasn't read the book 4 out of 5, excellent movie, just missed being a solid movie!"
"ebo_10","3","1","2","19 November 2005"," The Goblet of FIre lukewarm at best
","Before The Prisoner of Azkaban came out, I had wanted to see the potter films as each one came out and due to a DVD glitch shortly after the release of the first film, I decided to wait. Not long until the third film was hitting the the theater I watched the first two movies on DVD then headed out to see Azkaban. I was pleasantly surprised and I was now a Harry Potter fan!!!!!! Last night I saw 'The Goblet of fire' and I was..extremely disappointed. I am a movie buff and I know movies and this latest installment of Harry Potter was beyond sitting still. I was squirming in my seat to stay awake. I kept saying to myself that it is going to pick up and hit it's stride. Now the special effects were flawless however. Each seen in which special effects were obviously used were spectacular. I'm still trying to find out why this movie was getting duller and duller but am still in shock as to how it came to be that way for me. At times there were jokes that did make me laugh but they were too sporadic and seemed shoved in there. I heard that this film was the darkest of them all and most realistic. Maybe that was the problem for me. The magic was now gone and it seemed to take itself way too seriously. I'm done with my review because I don't want to seem like i am bashing it because I'm not. I just disliked this film and i advise each future viewer to go into the theater as seeing this as a stand alone film."
"kokopelli-2","5","1","2","19 November 2005"," it looked nice, but...
","this is the least excited i have ever been about a harry potter, well, anything. a die-hard fan myself, i have always been a bit disappointed by the movies. i mean, it is really hard to make a good movie from a worldwide acclaimed novel. but Newell could certainly have done a better job than he did. not only were all quidditch matches and house elves taken out, but key plot elements were not even explained, and i found myself having to retell the whole story to my father after the showing. sure, the aesthetic elements and cinematography was great, but ya need to give us more than that! the whole thing between Ron and Hermione's feelings for each other was completely exaggerated in the yule ball scene, as they end up screaming at each other towards the end, which i seem to remember being more subtle in the book. i didn't even realize until i got home that there weren't really any scenes of the kids actually doing any kind of school work, which is what Rowling does best in her writing, perfectly balancing intrigue and possible romance with the humdrum school life. instead, Newell put major emphasis on the three friends hitting puberty and finding the opposite sex attractive and less on magic. don't get me wrong, that stuff is fine, but c'mon, its just harry potter. Barty Crouch Jr. never gets to explain completely how he got harry to the graveyard, and we never see the true effect on Rita Skeeter's articles in the daily prophet, nor do we find out she is in fact an animagi. i thought the acting was quite good (the kids are really coming into themselves, and Michael Gambon was great), but the film was really unsatisfying. make two movies if you have to! i would wait, wouldn't you?"
"Moonlit_Knight","9","1","2","19 November 2005"," Missing a couple of key scenes
","The movie was GREAT! No doubt about it. However, someone like me who has read the book filled in the missing details as we were watching the film. What the film needed was a couple of key scenes that would explain some things a little more to the people who did not read the book. If the director had added in the capture of Rita Skeeter, an explanation that Harry did win the Tri-Wizard Tournament, formally introducing Gabrielle as Fleur's sister, the Minister Of Magic refusing to believe Dumbledore that Voldemort is back, and maybe even show some of the Wizard World Cup final. it would not have been as confusing to them. I think they were too adamant in sticking to the 2:45 time limit. Other than that the other cuts that were made (No S.P.E.W., No Dursleys, etc.) were OK with me. The visuals were outstanding. I'm hoping that an Extended Edition will be released."
"KeythF","4","1","2","19 November 2005"," Very disappointing
","I just saw the movie ""Goblet of Fire"" last night. It was not very good.<br/><br/>I think that JK has brilliantly developed her story into a rich and complete tale that reflects the maturation and development of her core audience. Many children have grown up just as Harry and his friends have in the last eight years. Younger fans' capacity for more intricate stories, and more complete, deeper, and complex characters and interactions has been fed in a perfect way. If JK had started with a story like ""Phoenix"" or ""Half Blood Prince"", I do not think that she could have achieved such a high level of popularity. She started slowly, and simply. With a world that was quite clearly black and white. Now, characters, very much, explore the shades of grey that signal more a challenging story, open to more plots twists and intricacies. <br/><br/>That being said, I think that the director relied too much on the WOW factor of special effects that did nothing to compliment the characters that JK has developed: A prolonged Dragon Fight. He felt the need to add his own ""entertainment"" value which did nothing to add to the story: McGonagall's dance instruction class. And he ignored significant story resolution which affects future stories. So much so, in fact, that I wonder if he even understands where the story needs to go: Rita Skeeter and the resolution of her antagonism is practically ignored, but pretty important in ""Phoenix"". All in all, I think that Mike Newell has left the franchise in a sorry state. It seemed to me that there was a glaring lack of dialogue, and hence, character development. I can only hope that there will eventually be a ""Director's Cut"" with an extra hour, or so, of movie.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, I did enjoy the movie, for what it was, but knowing that there is so much more to come, I can't help but feel that this movie is lacking in several areas and have problems visualizing how the rest of the series is going to develop after being handicapped by this piece of rubbish. It goes to show you that, in a project like this, consistency needs to be present in the pivotal position of the director. There needs to be a vision to see the project through to completion. Not just a ""fill-in"" to tell the story that lies between the covers of one book, but instead a deeper understanding of where the story is going, what the significant events are, who the characters are becoming, and why the fans are so ravenous about the franchise. Peter Jackson did it with the Fellowship Trilogy. But this series is in jeopardy with a sloppy telling of ""The Goblet of Fire""."

","Well I have never considered myself a Harry Potter fan-at least not a ""real"" one. Up until a year ago-i wouldve equated by knowledge of Rowling's world with that of a muggle's. But a few months ago I picked up ""Philopher's Stone"" and read it. Then I read Chamber of Secrets. Eventually I went on to read all of the Harry Potter Books and have found (despite the fact they're clearly wrriten at an easily accessible reading level) they are quite enjoyable stories.<br/><br/>Then I went on to watching the movies and although there are some differences i enjoyed them as well. This 4th installment is , in my humble opinion, the best Hp movie to date. The acting is better, the cinematography is darker, and i love Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemorte. They took a good action packed book and turned it into a good action packed movie. Also-I found quite a few parts of the movie to be pretty funny. I mean I never quite thought I would have found myself laughing at jokes in a Hp movie but there i was.<br/><br/>The effects are top notch and Williams's score is as good as ever! Even if you are not an Hp fan-catch up on the storyline and check this movie out."

"ansky225","2","1","2","19 November 2005"," Not that great.
","I gave it a 2. I thought it was really bad. They left stuff out that should have been in, and spent too much time on stuff that shouldn't have been in there.<br/><br/>The maze part was horrible. Why did the whole time they were in the maze, did the maze keep trying to eat them? That's not part of it in the book. They left out all the good stuff in the maze. They could have taken out 5 minutes of the maze changing, and put in the part where it turns Harry upside down. And did they just not go to class at all that year, other than that first lesson with Moody? They could have left out the dancing lessons and put in Dobby giving Harry the gillyweed. The first part of the movie was bad too. It wouldn't have been that hard to show Winky with Barty. And why on earth weren't the Weasley's with Fudge in the box? No Ludo Bagman? It didn't say who won the match. I was also mad that they didn't show Mrs. Weasley come surprise Harry by being at the last task. Dumbledore was waaaaaay too angry and overacting the whole movie. Why was Barty in the Riddle house at the beginning? And why did the portkey drop them off (at the tourney) up in the sky and not on the ground?? Where was Percy at the tourney? And why on earth didn't Hermione catch Rita as a bug? How are they going to explain why Rita's not writing stuff in the next book? The movie wasn't wrapped up well at all. I don't know how they're going to start the next movie without the end of this one. The dragon bit was cool, but they could have cut that in half, and added something they left out. And Voldemort? He was comical, not scary. The way he danced around instead of walking was very theatrical.<br/><br/>There were parts that were good, but overall I was really disappointed. I won't be going to pay $15 to see it in IMAX."
"sbsyd207","10","1","2","18 November 2005"," Potter's Back with a Brand new Rap
","Year four has begun at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry and with a few new characters on the scene one can only imagine what a breathtaking, white-knuckle ride this is. As a reader, I was waiting for Goblet of Fire to simply to live the thrills I have read about since the 4th grade. As a movie fan, I was waiting for this film for the plot, the new direction, the acting, the effects and the just plain out brilliant screenplay writing that brought to life the fantasy-come-true that is Harry Potter.<br/><br/>This new year, Harry (Dan Radcliffe) is faced with grave challenges beyond good and evil, right and wrong. This new film is much more mature and gives us a whole new way to see Harry and his friends. They aren't 11 year-old kids anymore, and their age reflects the choices they have to make. Harry is suddenly and unwillingly entered into the Triwizard Tournament. This tournament is a series of three tasks that three young wizards still in school will compete in for each respective school. Because of serious injuries and death that took place during the previous holdings of this tournament, a new rule is enforced, forbidding anyone under the age of 17 to enter. Our main character was looking forward to a year of sitting about and watching someone else get all the fame and glory for once.<br/><br/>But we wouldn't have a film then would we? Harry is entered without his knowledge and is named the SECOND Howgarts Champion. This proves to be very trying to Harry's nerves. From hateful schoolmates who believe he wants to hog all the glory, to Dragons, to Merpeople, to ""Mad-eye"" teachers who are just a tad out of step, Goblet proves to be not only more exciting, but much more comical. The jealous and clumsy-clueless best friend Ron (Rupert Grint) is over anxious with finding a date to the 'Yule Ball', a ball that is held each time the Triwizard Tournament takes place, on Christmas Day. Not mention the obvious feelings he has for the undoubtedly charming Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) who has moved beyond the trio to fresher meat; The boys school Champion and all-star quidditch player Victor Krum. The bubbling about girls and old foes such as Draco Malfoy bring out the normality of the character's teen lives so much that all the quirks an outsider would find distracting eventually dissolve away into what can be considered normal.<br/><br/>But if the petty teenage drama's don't keep you wanting more, why then look into the world of evil that is much more front and center in this film. Voldemort is getting stronger by the day and the Quidditch World Cup goes crazed when followers of Voldemort send his mark up into the sky to cause pure panic. A Tournament judge is found dead and all the while Harry is having dreams of his enemy plotting to kill him.<br/><br/>Dan Radcliffe delivers a stunning performance completely filling out the Harry that Rowling envisioned and non-reading audiences can enjoy. Interperting every reaction exactly how Harry's emotions are described in the novel makes the audience want to root for him that much more. The thrilling plot is wrapped up with a climax that becomes pivotal to the next movies; Lord Voldemort returns. Climbing out of a cauldron and Killing the other Hogwarts Champion, Cedric Diggory, only makes the legendary graveyard sequence that much more on the pg-13 side, not to mention his cat/snakelike appearance with horrible red eyes and two slits for a nose. But the appearance of Harry's parents and Cedric when Voldemort and Harry's wands connect in a duel prove to be heartfelt and riveting, and not so much the mushy gooshy that all fantasy and action films have to have to satisfy the audience, as it was a need for a motive for Harry to survive.<br/><br/>All fans of the novel will be satisfied with the film, despite missing characters and scenes. Goblet takes it one step further and allows the audience to see that darker times lay ahead, and there's not always going to be a happy ending, but there can always be a hopeful one. The bravery and loyalty our Champion displays makes the film all the more heartfelt. Brilliant performances for such young actors, a great plot, wonderful effects, comical moments, and capturing thrill ride makes ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" the best 'Potter' film so far."
"sraeburn","4","1","2","18 November 2005"," weakest of the four
","no dursley's, no bugs, no elves, no history, no quidditch...this movie is far from what i expected to see.<br/><br/>but i think i figured out what this movie was truly missing. apparently it was chosen that this chapter of the movies was going to an action/adventure, whereas the book was more of a revelations piece. throughout the novel, we learned much more history and mystery of hogwarts and many other characters involved in the plot. this movie seemed to bypass all of the important information and display only a series of special effects.<br/><br/>plus the movie took special effects too far. nothing flickering on the screen was close to how my imagination (influenced by years 1-3) portrayed the scenery in the book. and as far as realism can go in the magic world, well, this film has some truly unrealistic moments that were clearly altered from the novel simply for a more glamorous effect."
"undomiel99","5","1","2","16 November 2005"," Very Saddened
","Let me first start out by saying Book 4 is my favorite so far from the series. I was extremely excited, yet scared about what they were going to do to the book when adapted for the screen. Well let's just say all of my fears came true. I gave it a five only because the movie if standing alone is good to watch, but from a fan's standpoint (being compared to the book) is horribly saddening. I know it's a huge book and there is a lot of information in it, but there was so much that they could take out of the movie and replace it with more story and character building time. Examples (spoilers): In the beginning what is Barty Crouch doing there with Lord Voldemort and Wormtail (that's supposed to be secret till the end), and why weren't the Weasley's and Harry (where was Bill) in the Minister's box at the World Cup?? This made the Weasleys look unimportant. At the World Cup that's where they should have put in moreaction, instead the scene is gone in like 60 seconds, they are all celebrating and then boom the Death Eater scene which was CHEESY!!!! No muggles were tortured in this scene, which I feel shows you the true intensity of the Death Eaters. Next we are on our way to Hogwarts and so are the Durmstrangs and Beauxbatons. Now I can understand why they rushed this part. Let's get to the fun stuff. More Blah, Blah, Blah... The Tri-wizard Tournament was way off base from the true text, the whole fight with the dragon was way tooooo stretched out (where's Charlie Weasley?)and the fight with the Grindylows was not at the end of the second task, but in the beginning. I felt the director was trying too hard to make the scenes intense, but there was no need you were already on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens to Harry. The third task is the most disappointing-they were supposed to test their knowledge and skills, not run around and try not to get sucked in by the maze bushes. The Voldemort re-birthing was okay, but that's where they should have extended a scene. VOLDEMORT IS BACK, hello this should be the most intense part of the movie. The whole movie is built up around this ending and all I am saying is, that's it???? Ralph Fiennes is a wonderful actor and I expected a lot more from him. The make up sucked, you could tell it was him. Voldemort shouldn't have a cuteness to him. My last complaint is the end-wait a minute was there an ending-do not know because it was rushed by sooo fast I wouldn't be able to tell you what happened unless I had read the book. I loved the first two Harry Potter films, that is what got me hooked on the books and becoming a fan. The films stayed true to the books, even though people think that they were childish-they were and so were the books. I became disappointed with the third movie. It begins a series of omissions that made the books. Yes these books are long, but if adapted correctly Harry's story will be told just as it is in the books. Plus I believe that true fans will stay and see a long movie....The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was long and stayed true to the books, even though there were story lines omitted it did not affect the heart of the book. I think it's time for a new screenplay writer (Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens anybody??), it needs fresh blood. Also is there a reason J.K. Rowling is letting her books be butchered?? The director Mike Newell was good, better than Alfonso, but there was just a lot missing. Okay I could go on forever, but here it is in a nutshell. Go and see the movie you will enjoy it, but if you are a fan of the book set everything you know about it aside, because well you will be disappointed. I am looking forward to book number 5, hoping they will do it justice and make a long movie with a true storyline."
"javaprincess13","9","1","2","18 November 2005"," Good show all around
","I was a bit concerned going in. How would a 600+ page book translate into a 2 hr and 37 minute movie? After seeing the film, I have to say that they translated it admirably. They obviously skimped on some of the details, but less noticeably than in Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>The actors are aging well within the characters, and in doing so seem to be more comfortable in their skin as each movie comes along. Daniel Radcliff as Harry, comes across still naive enough about the wizarding world, and yet wise beyond his years with all that Harry has gone through. Emma Watson, as Hermione, is much less ""geeky"" and more graceful and she handles the transition well. Rupert Grint, as Ron, gives us much more than the one-dimensional ""scaredy cat"" that has been portrayed in the last three films. He, and the twins, provide some of the movie's best comic moments.<br/><br/>I don't want to throw in any spoilers so I will leave it that some of the missing characters are sorely missed, and I would have loved to have seen a more expanded Quidditch World Cup, but the focus is rightfully on the Tri-Wizard Tournament. The effects used for the tournament are so well done that it is easy to get caught up and taken away into the story.<br/><br/>All in all, with Mike Newell at the helm, GOF has exceeded expectations."
"gypseerose69","10","1","2","19 November 2005"," Wonderful...but I was still Disappointed
","OK, I am a HUGE harry potter fan - I go to the parties, I stay up for the new books/movies, I've read all the books over 40 times, I had a HP themed party for my 25 birthday...and I have always enjoyed myself. That didn't change with this movie - for the most part.<br/><br/>I was completely enthralled with almost every aspect of this film. The acting improves every time, the special effects were amazing, and - even knowing what was going to happen - I was on the edge of my seat for half of it. This movie is - to me - more than just worth seeing...it is one of the MUST SEE movies of the year (a comment that I don't say often). OK, that being said - I want to express some disappointments.<br/><br/>First off, I know that book four is huge, and as such it was almost impossible to fit everything in; but, even still, they cut some intricate parts that have me wondering how they are going to be able to tie together the fifth movie. There were no house elves, no SPEW, there was a huge hole with the whole Ron/Hermione/Victor issue - in fact, it seemed that she would go for Harry throughout the movie - and, on top of all that, Barty Crouch was just randomly dead...no explanation, no story line, nothing, we just saw him dead in a field - that was it. And those are just a few of the things they left out. My biggest objection however, was Gambon. I have mode always said that I didn't like Sir Gambon as DD, I never have - he just doesn't do it for me. But in this movie he was angry - almost violently so with Harry for most of the movie. That just ISN'T the DD that those of us who have read the books have come to know and love, and you end up losing some of the movie just trying to figure out why he is behaving that way.<br/><br/>However, all of that aside, whether you are a die hard HP fan like myself, or if you are just beginning to get into the books/movies, you must go see this movie! You won't be disappointed."
"silby1867","8","1","2","18 November 2005"," A job well done
","I was interested to see how on earth any writer & director was going to manage to condense such a large novel into 2 1/2 hours of film. I think they did a sterling job. They did the only thing possible and eliminated almost all of the sub plots paring the story down to its bare bones. I disagree that any who had not read the book would be left adrift. My son hasn't read it and found no fault with the continuity and enjoyed the film very much. As the story gets 'darker' in content with each new book I was not surprised at the 12a (UK) rating and wondered if the last one will have to be an 18! :) I have no complaints to make as there is no way that you can ever do a completely faithful version of a book. How can you when you are dealing with a completely different medium? Well done to all the cast and crew for a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Can't wait for the next one!"
"rlastolt","6","1","2","18 November 2005"," I FELT EXTREMELY Disappointed
","I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ADAPTATION OF THE 4TH HARRY POTTER BOOK, THE GOBLET OF FIRE. This book was a favorite of mine of the whole Harry Potter series. I walked in hoping to see what I envisioned while reading the book. Where the book allows the reader to become emotionally connected with the characters and what happens to them. THE MOVIE DOES NO SUCH THING. IT IS APPALLING HOW THE MOVIE REMAINS SO DISTANT WITH HOW THE CHARACTERS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. The relationship that forms between Harry and Cedric in the book is no where to be seen in this new movie. Fortunately for me I read the book and knew what was supposed to be happening. For the non reader they would not be able to feel for the character when something happened to them fully whether it was good or bad, because the movie did not form the attachment for them. This was not the only disappointment in the movie. Too many things were cut out along with characters that were not even in the movie. A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT ONES WERE THE FACT THAT WINKY WAS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND, HERMIONE'S REVENGE ON RITA SKEETER DID NOT TAKE PLACE, THE PRIZE MONEY THAT HARRY WON AND EVENTUALLY GAVE TO THE WEASLEY TWINS FOR THEIR JOKE SHOP, WHICH IS CONTINUED IN FUTURE BOOKS, AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT DETAILS WERE NOT EVEN SUGGESTED OR THEY WERE COMPLETELY CHANGED. This left a deflated feeling for this viewer. who was looking forward to seeing one of her favorite books take place on the movie screen. I realize it is very difficult to take such a long book and make a movie from it, but if you are going to do it justice, less time should be spent on adding things that did not happen as well as changing things that did happen in the book. Creative art is honest , true to itself , not adding something just to show off the special effects and to forget about characters that are already endeared to the audience. I would have enjoyed it better if the movie was more true to the book and used the important descriptive and funny details that would have given meaning to the story for the viewer. Now it will be more difficult to truly continue with the accurate story in the future movies. It is a pity that the director and writer for this script went in the direction that they did. Overall, the movie was fairly good but it left this viewer with a feeling that something was not right."

","OK, I have not read the books. I have seen the first three films. I have no idea why everyone is saying ""this is the best yet"". I literally had to fight falling asleep during the first 2/3 of the film. Now, granted, if you are a huge Potter fan and if you just can't get enough of seeing the little darlings on the screen with no plot, dynamics or emotion, then this is the film for you. In an attempt to make the film more ""adult"" or ""real"" the first 20 minutes is filmed very very dark...darn near maddenly underexposed. Special effects and yada yada are all first class, which is what we would expect. But, hey, what about a compelling story line? That would definitely help out the effort."

Yes you see the champions draw certain dragons, no you do not see them do battle (except Harry). Yes Harry is accused of doing the dark mark, no the matter is ended in seconds, no mention of Harry's wand or even the house elves.<br/><br/>Many examples like that through the movie."

","Now let me start off by saying I haven't read any of the Potter books. But this was the worst HP movie I have seen so far. First of all, a large part of the mystique of the hp movies is that based on the scenery, you can't really tell what century or what year all the events take place in, but you usually have an old-time feeling throughout. However in this movie, there is even a scene with electric guitars! It made it feel too modern and ruined the mood for me. Also, there was too much action and almost no relevant dialog. I say ""relevant"" because there was plenty of talking that had nothing to do with anything. Also, I thought the Tri-Wizard tournament challenges were supposed to be uh, CHALLENGING? well in my opinion Harry got through them WAY too easily. Also, throughout the film there are so many parts that don't need to be included, and there are parts that you THINK might play some role later on but they don't, and you just end up getting confused. Of course i'm still a loyal HP fan but i'm hoping the next films are more similar to the first 3."
"jwolfe5","7","1","2","18 November 2005"," Somewhat rushing considering the length, disappointing
","First of all, I'm a big fan of the HP books and have read them all. I went to this movie (with my children) with very high anticipations considering this was one of my favorite of her books. However, it was clear in the beginning this wasn't going to be that kind of movie that stuck pretty close to the book.<br/><br/>***SPOILER** First of all the quiddich (sp?) scene at the beginning was very, very limited with little reference. Also what happens next clearly strays from the book also. The plot was deviated from often with large chunks of information missing or nonexistent. The film seemed to skip along in order to give ""pleasers"" without actually telling the same story as the book.<br/><br/>Yes, it did stick close enough you could tell what was going to happen, but some very important information was not included or simply changed. The girls from Madame Maxine's school were never identified as being part vela (Fleur), the Barty Crouch aspect was misconstrued and the house elf was NEVER in the film at all. The miscues are too numerous to keep mentioning.<br/><br/>I even had my children asking questions after it was over trying to understand some of what happened. Thank goodness I'd read the book and was able to actually give them the real story. One more thing that irked me was how the maze was changed in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, very disappointing. Will I buy it when it's released on video? Probably, since I already have the rest. But it was definitely too hard for this director to incorporate a fluid story in the 2 1/2 hr film :-(."

","I'm new to the Harry Potter world. I just read all six books over the last two months. In fact, it was the third movie, and its excellent direction and overall theme, that convinced me to give the books a go. And I became a true convert. I engaged in HP discussions over dinner. I convinced many jaded friends to give the series a go, especially since book four, arguably the second-best to book six, was about to be released on the big screen. But alas, the new Harry Potter movie was a disappointment. The book was massive, and creative license was necessary to condense so much action into a 2.5 hour movie, but the screenwriter/director team failed to bring the fullness of J.K. Rowling's vision to the big screen.<br/><br/>For instance, its easy to forget that the backdrop of the action is Hogwarts School of Magic since it has become a mere set and there is no mention of the classroom aspects of this year in Harry's life (so where does he learn to do the things he manages in the great feats of the Tri-Wizard Championship?). The subplot concerning Miranda Richardson's character is cut and her character is fairly unimportant to the storyline (unlike in the book, where she is integral to Hermione's character development). But the worst offense in the movie adaptation is a blatant contradiction concerning Ron, dragons and Mad-Eye Moody (I won't spoil it for non-readers, but be prepared for an addition by the screenwriter that is contradicted later on by Rowling's original writing and the adaptation!).<br/><br/>This adaption did not ""move"" me - you know, that feeling you get when a movie makes your heart race or skin crawl. This Harry Potter did not deliver and I am sad :( - But I won't lose hope that Mike Newell is replaced for book five!"

","This is the first time that i have ever been disappointed with a harry potter movie. It was very good i'll admit, but there was a lot of things that they took out and should have kept in. Mike Newell did a job well done but there are so many things as a fan of the books that made me mad and sometimes angry from what i saw they discarded. If i hadn't read the book before i saw the movie, i probably would have liked the movie a great deal, but i did read the book, and i am beyond disappointed with what i didn't see in this movie. Sorry to be so negative, but my thoughts about this must be told. Indeed there were many entertaining parts that made me laugh, indeed there were quite a few scenes that were very emotional, but even the 3rd movie was much closer to the book than this movie. Also i must say that the director made it to where the scenes kept jumping around, and that things went way too fast and it was hard to keep up with what was going on. And by the way, i thought that they did very well with the graveyard scene, the way they made Fiennes look depicted exactly what i was imaging voldemort while i was reading the book."

","Can't they keep the characters the same from one film to another? A gruff Dumbledore, joking McGonagall, and the Three Kids have been washed down to be just silly. Maybe it's the English Humor coming from the new director. This film is too far a field from the others for me. I know... Take it on it's own merits. But there must be some kind of through line between them all, don't you think? Each film can't be shifted so drastically from one set of characters and Hogwarts settings to another! This movie is almost like it was made in a parallel universe/sound stage! Maybe I'm missing something. And don't EVEN get me started on the music!"

There were rarely any flaws, except for minor changes from the book to the movie. This is by far the best acting by the three stars and the rest of the cast. I do think Richard Harris is a better Dumbledore, but Michael Gambon is a pretty good back up. Hagrid is funny, but he is maybe not shown enough. BUT WHO CARES!!! Me and my friends adored this film. I am going back tomorrow. I think Newell is a great advancement in the directing field. I hope he stays on for the Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, and even number 7."

I don't think I have ever been hit so hard with emotional changes so fast, and I LOVED it! I laughed, I got excited, scared, tense, nervous, and I even cried! I know what your thinking.. what kind of nerd cries in a Harry Potter movie?? Well you all better be ready for the emotional roller coaster your about to ride because its unbelievably excellent. This has always been my favorite book of the series, but is now, by far, my favorite movie! So please, everyone, go see it, because you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>I Also would like to comment on how VERY effective Cedrics death was on the viewers. The way Harry would not let go of his body after they traveled through the Portkey was sooo sad. Thats when the tears started to develop for me. Also while his dad was screaming and crying for his son, I wanted to cry really bad, but I didn't. When I buy this DVD and watch it at home alone, I'm gunna ball my eyes out. When I read the book I almost cried as well. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a sad movie overall, just this one part hit me hard, for I am a very emotional person."

","Good movie. I'm not a huge Potter fan, but I was dragged to the movie by VERY loyal fans, and I was expecting an average film. This was actually pretty good.<br/><br/>I gotta agree with whoever said that the Hermione/Ron romance takes a backseat due to the chemistry between Daniel & Emma. Their scenes were chemistry-filled, and all their little looks and touches made me forget that Hermione and Ron are even interested in each other. It made me wish the books were written in a different way in that aspect. Then again, it's not like it could've been anticipated that the 2 actors would have so much chemistry.<br/><br/>All in all- Good flick."

OK, I know that if they'd filmed everything in the book, the movie would have lasted at least six hours, but, still, the movie just ignored or glossed over parts of the book that should definitely have been included. I guess what irked me the most was the ending, where Harry, Ron, and Hermione just literally walk happily off into the sunset, and Harry doesn't seem bothered too much by what all just happened. It just didn't ring true.<br/><br/>I did enjoy seeing the characters mature and interact, and parts of the movie were really very funny.

","I have just returned from a packed theater being among a very mixed crowd of both young and young-at-heart.<br/><br/>What an excellent movie. This film had the darkest side we have seen of Harry's life thus far. Even though time constraints cut out a lot of the book, it still rang true to the writings of J.K Rowling.<br/><br/>I believe it was perfectly rated. This film is not for young children, even for those who have enjoyed the first three. For those parents who did take their 6 and 7 years olds, I kept hearing them next close by, after a scary part, commenting to the children or reassuring them. So if parents want to enjoy the movie, leave the young ones at home. See it for yourself first, then decide if it is appropriate material for the younger ones.<br/><br/>Now we must wait for another year and a half for movie number five. I'm not sure what will come out first, book seven or movie five."
"no_angel652","Null","1","2","18 November 2005"," GOF: spark-notes style
","Don't set your poor little hopes too high about this movie. <br/><br/>I feel like the director was relying too heavily on his audiences being devout Potter fans and not enough on actually telling the story. The movie was like watching an easy digest, in- case-you-missed-it-while-reading, spark notes version of events. True, we were supplied with the bare essentials to make things click (namely the beginning and end of important events) but all of that crucial middle stuff that ties it all together was missing. <br/><br/>Not enough focus was put on the actual story, ahem parts being rushed over or cut out to make way for five hour special effect dragon chases. All very impressive, all very dramatic, but i'd rather have had a plot thankyouverymuch. The director did a nice job with teen awkwardness but enough already with myrtle trying to sneak a peak at harry. He's going through puberty, he's awkward as all hell, we get it OK?<br/><br/>As for Ralph Fiennes as voldemort, he was good, but not much of a stretch for him for those of you who saw the English patient. The costuming and makeup were virtually the same. Also, did anyone else find it hard to accept the guy from maid in Manhattan as the most evil evil havoc making dark wizard of all time and forever? All in all a pretty simple movie, with moral fiber tacked hastily on as an afterthought and some nice eye candy in Diggory. Hmm...what else would you expect from a HP movie? Go and see it but pay matinÃ©e prices. Or download an audio book, it might just be cheaper and more satisfying."

","I went to see Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire this morning and was very disappointed. What there was of the book that made it into the book was excellent. The movie bears very little resemblance to the book. The 3 tri-wizard tasks were featured to the exclusion of almost all else. The house elf line in the story was left out altogether. There is a brief scene or two at the world quidditch championship but for the most part the early chapters are pretty much ignored. This movie would have been much better had it been 4 hours and included most of the important stuff from the book rather than leave it out and making the movie a hollow shell of the book.

It is great entertainment, but as a Harry Potter fan, I want the movies to be true to the books, which this film isn't! But I don't want to write an essay, but only tell that I was very very sad to see Fiennes' acting as Voldemort... Voldemort was not what I had expected... he looked like Rambo gone mental... Too muscular, too human and not at all frightening... Jason Isac were more scary than Ralph Fiennes... Mike Newell should have done that better..."
"brian32672","10","1","2","18 November 2005"," Great Special Effects
","Possibly spoilers - But more of a warning....<br/><br/>Personally, I would say this movie compares to the first in being one of the best HP movies. As far as special effects it takes the cake. I will spoil no more, just that small children may not be a consideration for those thoughtful parents. There are some deaths and some very rough curses (so be warned). The movie itself was entertaining from the start. I gave it a 10, or at least a 9 1/2 for HP movies. For all movies combined I have other favorites so I would say it surely would hit a 8 in my book.... Even remote HP fans should watch this movie. Specially if you disliked #3 or any of the others. This movie should redeem those particular Harry Potter fans. It always gets to me that Richard Harris died, and Michael Gambon took over. I never real thought it was a good choice. But he does play a very good Dumbledor. Granted as most know, Dumbledore in the books seems a little more caring than Gambon can pull off. Anyhow, enough ranting. I have a Home Theater setup with a 120"" screen. I rarely go out to see movies. But this is one that I could recommend, to actually get out of the house and watch at a theater. Bare in mind that a THX Certified theater is where it should be watched."
"justinrolls90","7","1","2","18 November 2005"," Good movie, a bit different than the book
","For fans of the books you will not be disappointed with gof, all of the most memorable and important moments of the book have made it into the film (although some scenes have been altered for the film which may anger purists). Unfortunately, almost everything else has been cut from the film. depending on your patience this is a good thing however as the film runs 2.5+ hours so there is already an awful lot of material here. the story is more mature than the previous (which you've probably already hear 100+ million times by now) but this is good. All of the scenes where the students struggle with the opposite sex are quite entertaining.<br/><br/>The acting in this installment has been really stepped up from the younger members of the cast. i feel Rupert (Ron) and Emma (Hermione) out shined Dan (harry) in the acting department which is too bad as he is the protagonist but thats OK. The professors as always deliver excellent performances (i especially enjoyed Maggie smith as mcgonagel and mad eye moody (can't remember the actor)).<br/><br/>The Special Effects in the film are breath taking. PERIOD.<br/><br/>this movie is worth seeing for all fans and not fans of the potter series alike. The pace of the film is extremely quick (and in the beginning i found it was probably a little too quick). The acting in this outing is a cut above the previous films especially from the kids (or teens i guess i should say now). the film has a sense of humor that is more like that found in the books now, which is good in my opinion."
"the_Poppuns","9","1","2","18 November 2005"," Too abbreviated for me, however...
","what did make it to the screen was pretty awesome. I had prepared myself that a lot of the things I loved in this book would be missing when I heard the decision to make it one movie, and under 3 hours at that. I thought it couldn't be done. Well it wasn't exactly, this was basically a ""best of"" Goblet of Fire, but even still, it works.<br/><br/>Things I loved. The first task in the Triwizard Tournament is one of the best action sequences ever. Honestly. People of my generation who grew up on Star Wars and Indiana Jones should love that as well as the rest of the Triwizard Tournament. But this scene in particular was what movies are about. If producers want to know what will make people leave the comfort of their homes and widescreen TVs to spend too much money on tickets and $7 popcorn, it's this scene. So producers, watch this movie and look for the scene with the dragons and do more of that. I'm a movie buff and I was blown away by it.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the effects. I'm just realizing it now but it's the first time I haven't noticed anything that looked iffy. I think I forgot there were effects.<br/><br/>The acting was mostly great except for two characters, I really don't want to point out who to make anyone feel bad, but in both cases it was some major overacting.<br/><br/>The final task in the Tournament. And you thought 'The Shining' had a scary maze. And for those who have read the book the scene within that scene is awesome. Perfect casting getting Ralph Fiennes. I think it's the first time I'm 100% happy with the casting of any of the HP roles.<br/><br/>Some things that weren't so hot. Barty Crouch, Jr. I don't understand how anyone who hasn't read the books understood what was going on with him. But when you have a movie moving that quickly through lots of information it's bound to happen I guess. And speaking of moving through quickly. the opening chapters were condensed into what amounts to a montage. Which makes this a good time for me to bring up the fact that there were no house elves. I love Winky in the book, but considering what Dobby looked like in CoS maybe we were better off. Although I always felt they'd play a part later on down the line, so we'll see if not including their subplot was a good idea or not. I also don't think anyone could tell from watching the movies that the girls from Beauxbatons were anything more than pretty girls. There wasn't any magical attractiveness implied as far as I can remember.<br/><br/>As far as everything else goes, it was really good. I can't believe that I got over all of the missing stuff but the big scenes were so terrifically executed that I can't help but let it slide. The score I didn't really notice that much. The costumes were okay, I think in this day and age the girls would have had better prom dresses, but Ron's dress robes were priceless. I think this movie should appeal to those who enjoy action movies as well as Potter fans. It should definitely have a larger audience than the previous three."
"gnorbury","8","1","2","18 November 2005"," Don't expect the whole book just a fun & exciting movie.
","Although I'm not sure if realistic is the correct word, this is definitely the most realistic rendition of Hogwarts we've seen on film. The cgi work is a little subdued and blends in with this film in a much cleaner way than one might be used to. In fact Goblet almost makes the first movie (and almost any recent movie that's heavy on sfx) look like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In fact, I'd say these movies are starting to look as good as Lord of the Rings, but just starting. It really is a beautiful picture to behold. The establishing shots are truly majestic and the tighter settings are well detailed. This is the Harry Potter film that has come the closest to matching what my minds eye pictures when I read the books.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent as usual. Emma will remind you of the Hermione from the book more than ever. Although her previous interpretations worked quite well in the other movies, real Potterheads will appreciate the subtle differences in this performance. You'll get a couple of overacting alerts from Radcliffe and Fiennes but it does fit with the enormity of what the characters are feeling. Unfortunately, fans of Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith will only catch brief glimpses of their great skills with Snape and Minerva.<br/><br/>Of course it wasn't perfect, how can it be without being the length of a mini-series. Even at a running time of 2 &1/2 hours all they were able to fit was the core story of the Triwizard tournament and the return of the nemesis. There are no elves, no Durstleys, no Bagman, no Charlie & Bill, no blast ended skrewts, no trips to Hogsmede, and I'm sure there's plenty more I don't recall right now. On top of that, you only get a brief glimpse of a couple of classes, a short conversation with Sirius, and Rita Skeeter (who's story arc they never really finish) is downgraded to a minor aggravation to the heroes. You do get more of the Twins (the character's I most identify my high school disposition with), more Neville (although they do leave out a couple of major details about him), more Myrtle (maybe a little more than you need but it's very funny), more romance (though mostly teen lust), and more action.<br/><br/>It is a movie that fans (especially fans of the books) will have to relax into. After the first scene (another moment that matched my own vision perfectly) which seems to be rendered directly from the book, you get the feeling that they're rushing you through the story. Although the fast pace of events doesn't stop, the feeling that you're being rushed does subside when the setting changes to Hogwarts. When the tournament starts, your only thoughts are on the action and the seamless visual effects. Overall it's damn entertaining and well worth the price of admission. -G"

Many things were cut from the book that should of been in the film just for the sake of character development but instead were sacrificed just to show the tri-wizard tournament and ILM's special effects. That's pretty much all the film was was the tri-wizard tournament. Most of the effect were cheezy as was the unneeded humor. It had the problem of putting to much information into too short of a film. This had the potential to be a great film if it would of focus more on the book or maybe if they would of split it into two films.

I remember sitting in the theater, enthralled as i watched this magical story unfold. Quidditch, dragons, and the Magical feel of Hogwards had me racing to the store for the books. It was then I entered the Wizarding world. I loved it. As the books progressed, getting darker and more adult, my love of the series grew. My love of the movies however... have not. I'm picky i guess. I think that overall the movies were okay, but none of them to date have given me that magical feeling the first one did. Goblet of Fire came close though. I was disappointed at first, there was no beginning confrontation with the Dursley's, which i admit i had been looking forward to. Bagman was done away with. The World Cup was reduced to nearly 20 seconds. Since Bagman had been done away with, there was no set up for Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. So very much was left out that I felt was needed to make the future story complete. Once i tried to forget that I had indeed read the book though, i started to enjoy it a bit more. I was really upset though over the status of Hogwarts. It's gone from looking like a magical castle, to looking like a dingy, dank and depressing place. Ah well.

Dan,Rupert, and Emma have grown so much in their acting skills, very impressive. No matter how many times I've read to book and how well I knew the ended, I cried in the graveyard scene. Very well done!!The only complaint I have is Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore. He kind of scared me in this movie, which is completely separated from the picture I have in my head from the books.

"mad_beckage","8","1","2","18 November 2005"," Solid, entertaining movie
","I think that this Harry Potter installment was a solid movie. It built off of number 3 by integrating the previous architecture and design. In this Harry Potter, the landscape plays less of a role and the director turns the viewer's attention back to the magic and fantasy of the wizarding world. The music was also well done and didn't detract from any aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>The director is playing on the fact that most viewers will have read the book. There are some elements that have not been explained as in-depth as in the books, but that is to be expected-- there is a lot to cover. He did a really good job of the climactic scenes and in juxtaposing a lot of different elements.<br/><br/>The only problem that I could see with this Harry Potter was the depiction of Dumbledore. The actor interpreted Dumbledore as a more aggressive and high-strung character than in the books and previous movies. I don't feel that this interpretation does justice to the core character and this interpretation needs to change for the following movies.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved it!"

I really liked all of the humor injected into the film, especially the scene where Snape keeps whacking Harry and Ron with the books while they discuss dates for the Yule Ball (hysterical!)

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire may be the most truncated 2hr, 45 minute movie ever made. To say that the pace is brisk may well be an understatement. It moves with the ferocity of a tornado, catching you up in its excitement then tossing you to the ground wishing you had better warning. This is purely a movie for fans that have read the book - while others will probably enjoy it, they will probably get lost because of a lack of proper explanations of everything.<br/><br/>That's not to say that it's a bad movie, either. While I was watching the movie I was enjoying every minute of it. I was caught up in the joy of the Harry Potter experience, yet keenly aware that this could have been more with just a few minor changes.<br/><br/>You've probably already read plot details and dissertations on the fidelity of the movie to the experiences of a hormonally-charged adolescent. I'll skip that. As far as a summary of my opinions on parts of the movie: The acting was fair-to-good, cinematography was great, but the writing was bad. There were many top-notch performances in limited screen time from Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort), Miranda Richardson (Rita Skeeter), and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Harry, Hermione, and Ron hold their own, but are not given great dialog to work with, and I think they tend to overact a touch - nothing to pull anyone out of the movie, but I've seen better from all of them. The source material was quite good (best of the series, IMHO), but the adaptation was lacking at several points. The dialog was average and served little more than to move the story along, which was disappointing, considering that the look of the movie was so great. It's mostly seeped in neutral tones to lend an ominous feel to the film, and thankfully, the special effects are finally used as a supplementary device, rather than the showpiece; you feel like the creators are exploring the world rather than building it, and it helps to more thoroughly envelop the viewer in the story.<br/><br/>This movie needed about a half-hour more of padding. Those that have not read the book will have to work very hard to pick up every little clue and detail about what's going on in order to put together this labyrinthine plot. The Tri-Wizards tournament, a legendary sporting event with mystical significance was explained by a short speech by Dumbledore, a speech that was jam-packed with expository information that, unless the viewer was ready to absorb, could easily be missed and not digested.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie just sort of happens without regard for previous events or future events - this is called a pacing problem. The Tri-Wizards tournament features three events, but all three events are scenes with almost no build, nothing to give them the weight they could have had. There's no sense of the Tri-Wizards tournament having any impact on the participants' lives, which is ironic seeing that the Goblet of Fire is first and foremost about the events surrounding that tournament. Each trial comes suddenly, gets fifteen minutes of screen time, then disappears. The characters go about their business for another while and then all of the sudden the next trial happens, with little warning. I was so stunned by the appearance of the third trial that as the band played and the participants entered the stadium, I doubted whether or not the scene to come was about the tournament. Like I said, there was no build to lend gravitas to the final scene, almost like going on a roller coaster where you're immediately dropped 100 feet and then coast the rest of the way. The climax comes too quickly, which is stunning considering the running time.<br/><br/>The other issue that I had, a more minor one, is that everything in this film happens with minimal regard for the outside world. This is a shame because one of the charms of the book was about how much it fleshed out the Wizarding universe that Harry lived in. I know the movie should be treated on its own terms, but some of these events, detailed in the book, are left hanging. How did this guy escape from Azkaban? What happened to the reporter? Who exactly are these other kids that show up at Hogwarts? Why is the guy that played Krum such a bad actor? In the end, I give the movie a 7, because, as I say, I throughly enjoyed watching it and will probably see it again. This is due more to the source material than it is to the adaptation, though; unlike Prisoner of Azkaban, this movie doesn't really stand on its own, but is more of a visual representation of certain scenes from the book. It's extremely entertaining, but maddening because of how great it COULD have been."

","When I was about to see it I was worried, very worried. I had read on beforehand of what was gone, and I was prepared, but as the title came I could not breathe (my leg couldn't stop shaking either).<br/><br/>Well, truth be told I enjoyed the movie immensely, and there were no dull moments. The music was fine, but I did enjoy the Yule Ball music the best. Every scene was used to full effect, and I enjoyed especially the fact that we saw several places used in the third movie.<br/><br/>There was much more humor in difference to the third, that was especially dark, but this one managed to blend in all. It was rather quick paced at some time, but it managed to capture you even so. Each task where presented very nicely, and I felt that many of the characters were more used here. In this one we could enjoy Fred and George's humor, which has been sorely missed by myself. So watch it, it is worth your time!"
"hyperkitty510","10","1","2","18 November 2005"," I loved it!!!!!!!!
","This movie was so much better than the last! I felt that nothing crucial was left out like the last one. I think everyone who has read the books needs to see it. The special effects were awesome too. The dragon scene was so cool and so lifelike. Also the underwater scene with the mermaids was pretty cool too. Oh and the funniest part was when Malfoy was turned into the ferret. You will have to see it for yourself but its hilarious! At the ball, the teenage angst between Parvati, Ron, Hemione, Harry and the other Patil sister was amazing. You could almost feel it. I definitely recommend this movie. People, see it!"
"marija_cachia","8","1","2","18 November 2005"," good movie
","For those who didn't read the book this movie will be too fast, and will leave them with many unanswered questions. But for me, I read all the books, it's OK. OF course there are many left-out scenes but the director manages to pass past this. The movie is full of great scenes and great acting.<br/><br/>I'll start by Emma Watson who even though had many parts of her character cut out of the movie does a great job. Her Yule Ball scene is magnificent and I could understand perfectly how happy she was that someone noticed her and then how disappointed she was in the end when Ron ruined it. In her scenes with Daniel Radcliffe their chemistry ignites the screen and this is mostly thanks to her. Her great way of showing what Hermione is feeling leads to a more understanding of her character for those who didn't read the book - it's obvious how much she cares for Harry and that I think is very important to the plot in general.<br/><br/>There were other great scenes - all the tasks and the graveyard, and even the light ones like when the Weasley twins try to put theri name in the goblet. The part where Harry brings back Cedric's body is very emotional. And therefore the film succeeds in bringing out the right tone for what is going to happen.<br/><br/>Great ending too - Hermione's 'everything is going to change' says it all.<br/><br/>All in all good movie."
"jdlv_","10","1","2","18 November 2005"," Best movie of the Harry Potter series so far!
","I've only read the first book of the Harry Potter series so I believe I can say that I am not a huge fan nor an acid critic, and therefore my opinion is not biased. When the first Harry Potter movie came out I thought it was just OK. Movie number 2 was released but did not really impress me, in fact I found it a bit boring. Movie number 3 and then I really started to feel that I was on a fast moving train. Now, Harry and the Goblet of Fire is a lightning bolt! Best movie of the series so far. However, Emma Watson does not appear to improve her acting as much as everybody else. She appears way too melodramatic. Overall, an excellent movie however not recommended to younger audiences."
"alessandra_francesca","9","1","2","18 November 2005"," What a film...
","I went to see the first showing of the film at midnight which just added to the excitement of it all. In a cinema filled full of only adults there were laughs, gasps and shocks. The film follows the book through the Riddle House to the Quidditch World Cup, to the Hogwarts Express and then to Hogwarts and the Triwizard Tournament. We arrive at Hogwarts with the 'cheerleaders' from Beaubatons Academy and the 'bad boys' from Durmstrangs Institute. These being the two other schools competing in the Tournament.<br/><br/>The film isn't based on the school and lessons this year and most of it is shot outside of the school while the challenges are being performed. This makes it more of an adult film than the first 3 with more violence.<br/><br/>We see Harry, Ron and Hermoine coming to see their feelings for each other and other people. Which is nice is some parts and funny in others, (Ron and Hermoine especially!) Mad Eye Moody is one of the best characters in the series although not all that he seems...<br/><br/>This is my favourite film out of the four so far, even though it is not my favourite book. All the actors have matured and grown into their roles which gives it good continuity from the last film.<br/><br/>A very good film, thoroughly enjoyable!<br/><br/>oh and Viktor Krum...Cedric Diggory...oh my word!"
"PoolOfTears","7","1","2","18 November 2005"," Worth it ?
","Did anyone else think the movie was a bit off ? I mean, I know they can't put everything in the movie that was in the book, but come on, they missed so much. For instance, the lack of Weasleys, no Percy, Bill, Charlie or Mrs. Weasly. We barely see Sirius, no Dobby, no Winky, no S.P.E.W. They do explain the thing with Barty Crouch Jr. but they change the story so that he escaped from Azkaban but they said nothing about his Mother or being under the Imperius curse from his Father. Also, me and my friend were really looking forward to seeing them play at the Quidditch world cup, yes, they did go to the world cup, but you didn't even get to see the teams play. All in all the movie went by to fast for me, everything up to when the champions arrive was about what ten minutes? I found myself constantly saying, we are to that part already? What happened to this part or that part? I was also a little disappointed that Sirius barely made an appearance in the movie, was looking forward to the scene where he reveals himself to Mrs. Weasly and a whole lot of other scenes. However, the movie does have extremely funny parts and extremely sad parts. As a series kind of separate from the books it was a great movie (though, I was a tad disappointed in it all) though,compared to the books, it doesn't even hold a candle. Explanations about why things are done the way they are done, well, lets just say the movie just skims the explanations of it all, not really explaining anything at all. However, the end was very memorable, I just prefer the books over the movie."

","This installment of the Harry Potter series is by far the best one yet. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a rather loyal fan of Chris Columbus'renditions but this one takes his work and matures it. The PG-13 rating is well earned and this movie is not for young children. Mike Newell's interpretation of J.K. Rowlings spectacular world is beautiful and logical. Unlike the last movie, Newell doesn't take the tried and true fans far from the original work. In fact, very little liberty was taken except to cut out what was not necessary. Also unlike the last movie, viewers who have not read the books will not find themselves confused by a lack of intelligible plot. One does not have to read the book to follow along this time. This movie has every aspect right and fans will not be disappointed. (That is, if you can take Daniel Radcliffe's mediocre acting.)"

","It would have been a great *summary* if they had noticed one thing. WHY ON EARTH DID THEY DOWN PLAY SIRIUS'S FATHER ROLE?!?!?!? This is supposed to be the movie in which he takes an active role as a god PARENT and watches Harry's back and with the exception of one scene he wasn't in it? If anyone has any ideas as to why he was basically cut out of the last 3/4 of the movie. It would be appreciated. It just seemed as if Gary Oldman died after filming that one scene and they decided to not replace him or something... (he isn't dead by the way)...<br/><br/>I did enjoy most of the rest of the movie. They did well containing its length for viewers 9unlike myself0 that do not wish to sit and watch a 5 hour movie. <br/><br/>I say bring back Alfonso Cuaron... he did a beautiful job with the third, and I hope the fifth will be better than this one at least.<br/><br/>Who ever gave this 10 out of 10 you are crazy and need to reread the book..."

","I just came back from seeing the movie and I just have one word for it: AMAZING! A lot of things were changed from the book, of course, but you are able to understand the story. It goes rather fastly as to not make a five-hour-long movie, but none of that messes it up. The special effects, the actors' performances, the music, EVERYTHING makes this movie the best I've seen in many years. I insist that you convince everyone to go with you and watch the movie, even if you have to see it 20 times, it'll be worth it. And yes, Daniel does appear fully shirtless for about three minutes, girls, don't worry. But EVERYONE has got to see it, no exceptions, and buy the DVD the moment it's released!"
"oscarhopkins","4","1","2","18 November 2005"," Good for Fans Only...and Not Much For Them
","This is the film I was worried that ""The Two Towers"" was going to be. Amazingly long, overdrawn at the drama bank and without a parcel of sense in the pacing department, this film hobbles along on the crutch of great visual effects, and its name brand.<br/><br/>Once again, great actors and actresses trot out to play hackneyed scripting of dull characters. Once again all characters threatening to be worthwhile are completely ignored.<br/><br/>And once again, Harry is dull as a brick.<br/><br/>...A very worn brick shaped like a cricket ball.<br/><br/>...Which has been named Professor of Dullness at Oxford University.<br/><br/>The lack of personal spirit placed into this project by the creators is completely evident. It is a sorry follow up to the promising third installment, and a cheap substitute for lovers of the book.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is, after all, a character who needs much help being interesting on-screen. In the books, we put up with him because his plot-contrived existence does not smart so much. But up on screen, his striving for mediocrity is hard to ignore. My wife put it best when she said that Potter is not a heroic figure, making the best of his opportunities, but a rather motley, self-indulgent bore, whose response to most situations is ""oh, crap--I've spilled power all over myself; what should I do with it?"" Avoid this film if the nerds in your life will let you."
"nix4205","10","1","2","18 November 2005"," best potter film so far
","This movie was so incredible it is hard to even know where to start. First the adaptation of this book was so wonderfully done, everything that was important or worth knowing from the book was mentioned. The actors are growing and so are their talents, making anyone fall so deeply involved with these characters. The visual effects, well spectacular is the only word that comes to mind when describing anyone of the marvelous scenes. Mermaids, dragons, enchantment all around, only some of the few wonderful things one can expect to see in this film. The suspense that exists in this film, more than any of the other films grabs at your attention through the whole movie and never lets go even to the end. The sarcasm and wit of the film stands out so much, it makes the film enjoyable for the adult as well as the child. Mike Newell kept right along with the dark theme that one saw in the previous Harry Potter film, but takes it to much greater depths. This film had every emotion ranging from humor, to fear, then jealously, and sadness, and most of all satisfaction at the terrific job done to this film. I will definitely see it a few more times because it was so far the most memorable movie I have seen all year. Well done to everyone involved with the film, and anyone who has yet to see this movie, don't wait this movie is so excellent it will have you writing a comment on it."
"chaz_burgess","10","1","2","17 November 2005"," The Boy Who Lived becomes Legend
","This film is truly remarkable. Fabulous clean edits, good use of colour, a brighter and more cheerful look than the last, but a dark story all the same. It deserves its 12a rating, as there are some scenes that even I found disturbing. Fiennes Voldemort is truly terrifying, but harder still it is to see Cedric Diggory die. Moving most of all is the scene in which Harrys parents come back to him in a beautiful vision, the moment at which my eyes watered! This film has everything- romance (cho was very well cast and Likable), edge of your seat thrills (the maze) and heart wrenching sadness. All the actors have come of age, including character Harmione who has stopped whining (appears that in this film, thats Rons job). JK will be delighted to see the book so well framed, but a word of warning to fans of the literary Potter- there's no Hogsmeade and very little Sirius... for he is star of the next movie. This installment of the saga will go down as the greatest, mark my words. Simply beautiful."
"yukn0wyuluvme","10","1","2","17 November 2005"," Unsurprisingly Worth Your Time
","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is without a doubt the most exciting book of the entire series, and Mike Newell's film adaptation certainly does it justice. Maybe it's because I'm biased (after all, it's my favorite book), but not to sickly exaggerate, it seemed to do so much more than parallel the book in adventure and detail, that it was hard to blink or find the motivation to reach for the popcorn. Being a mere two-and-a-half hours, there were obviously some parts that were cut, such as much of the Quidditch World Cup, S.P.E.W. (including Dobby and Winky), Hagrid's and Madame Maxime's story and Rita Skeeter being an Animagus, but it would've unnecessarily slowed the dramatic pace the rest of the movie was going. The acting, in general, was marvelous, especially the main trio, Moody, and the Weasleys. The marginal exceptions were Dumbledore, and ... dare I say it, Lord Voldemort, although that might be a bit harsh on Michael Gambon and Ralph Fiennes. Yet the normality of Voldemort and the dullness of Dumbledore still slightly dampened the superbly written ending; but all in all, this film is definitely worth waiting hours in line for. Already anticipating the DVD!"
"grantfamily2000","8","1","2","17 November 2005"," Harry Potter
","Wow! Got to see the movie on 11/14/05. It has by far been the best Potter movie to date. It's really neat to see these kids grow up right in front of you. The performances of all the main actors only get better with time as do the special effects. Although the film carries a PG-13 rating I would recommend not taking children under age 8. Reason being that some of the more frightening moments in the movie would absolutely scare a child. If you read the book you will know what I mean. There are heavier dark forces at work here so hence the scarier scenes but done very tastefully. Oh yea don't forget the movie is almost 3 hours long."

","I believe that this is the best adaption yet, but it still could have been better. There were too many holes at the beginning, and the producers assumed that viewers would know some things and didn't explain them (Snape questioning Harry about the Polyjuice potion came out of nowhere). I read the book just after the first movie came out, so it's been four years...I don't remember everything. I suppose some things have to be cut out when you have a long book, but you have to compensate for that. I also missed the Dursley's in this one. I hope they bring them back for Order of the Phoenix since Dudley is involved in a major scene at the beginning. Still...a good movie...worth the wait...9/10."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire just came out here yesterday and I was one of the first to rush to theatres and see it. I've always been a big fan of the books, mind you. I'm one of those who wasn't too happy with 1 and 2, but loved 3. Now that I'm done with the introductions...<br/><br/>One word: Awesome. The movie was spectacular in every way. The CGI was absolutely brilliant! The acting was ten times better than in PoA. I was impressed, especially with Daniel Radcliffe and all the newcomers like Ralph Fiennes (almost unrecognizable here, as Voldemort), Katie Leung, etc. Rupert Grint was okay, but I'm sorry to say that Emma Watson annoyed me because in every scene she seemed to be in hysterics.<br/><br/>The script was very well done. This time, more characters were given time to shine. Characters like Fred and George (who were hilarious) and Neville had much bigger roles. The lines were witty and the movie was able to pull of being dark and action-packed, as well as comedic at times.<br/><br/>There were lots of changes from the books, but in my opinion they were handled very well, and I wasn't annoyed. Many characters were cut, but the script was able to work around it. It was pretty unexpected seeing the new stuff that was added.<br/><br/>All in all, it's the BEST Harry Potter movie so far. It has a lot of action, comedy, and even drama (one scene in particular made a lot of people cry in the theatre). My only complaint is how OOC Hermione seems to be in this movie. I blame Emma Watson. blech."
"alvintiamy","9","1","2","16 November 2005"," ""Goblet"" meets my expectations...
","I'm glad to say that I'm not disappointed in this one. HP1 was okay. I haven't read the book when I saw it. HP2 was awful. It's the worst Potter film for me. And honestly, I was slightly disappointed in the first viewing of HP3. But then, the more I watch it (on DVD), the more I realize that the third Potter movie was the best of the three. In terms of storytelling and character development, Azkaban is far better than the first two. The Harry-Flying-With-Buckbeak scene is one of the best scenes IMHO. It is emotional and the music is great. Now comes the fourth in the series, The Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>Judging by the trailer alone, I know this movie is gonna be great. The new movie condensed the 700-page book into an almost 3-hour movie. That means a lot has been left out. I've already expected it so the changes are no big deal for me and I think the movie will survive even without Rita Skeeter. <br/><br/>=MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD= So, here are the things I like: <br/><br/>Pacing. Well-paced but not uses Cuaron's scene transitions in Azkaban; Music. The great John Williams theme is still here (most notably Hedwig's Theme or the opening theme of every HP movie). The new composer Patrick Doyle added a nice new touch in the film's music and makes the film darker. However, there's a part in the Yule Ball where the music is distracting. Imagine, a rock band in Hogwarts? It feels like it's from another movie; Amazing visuals. The arrival of the schools and the 2nd task was almost dream-like. Beautifully done. Tone. It's darker and more mature; Special effects. The CGI was great except for some few crappy CGIs like the landing of Diggory's onto the ground after touching the Portkey, morphing of Krum into a shark. The dance number of Durmstrang...something to do with the sticks; Fleur...Hermione...Cho Chang...Ginny...and...Madame Maxine (haha..joke). Fleur is beautiful!; Dumbledore. I like Michael Gambon than the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Imagine Harris giving the tournament speeches. I can't take it! Young Dumbledore looks like Gandalf the Grey! ; Relationships between the trio; Moody. Great performance; Voldemort. Great job by Ralph Fiennes. His strong performance can still be seen even with make-up!; Acting. Improved acting from Daniel(!) I was almost carried away...two thumbs up for that heartfelt mourning for (see next point..); HIS death. It happened so fast that it was so shocking. I didn't expect that I was gonna cry at that part even though I know he will die. It was so depressing. I left the theater so sad because 1) HE died, 2) the anticipation for the movie is over and 3) the next movie will be out in June 2007. =MINOR SPOILERS END=<br/><br/>Some audience may find it sexist because Fleur was portrayed as if she was incapable of joining the Tournament.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best Potter movie yet. Expectations are getting higher. Newell delivers a strong film. Definitely my new favorite!"
"lgran81","8","1","2","16 November 2005"," Potter always great, but its just not Azkaban
","Well, the wait is over. The fourth release in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, directed by Mike Newell arrived at the big screen November 18.<br/><br/>This year Harry (Daniel Radcliff), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are now 14 years old and find themselves not only exploring magic, but dating as well.<br/><br/>As the movie begins, Harry is having nightmares about devious meetings that are causing his scar to bother him more than ever before. He attempts to brush off these premonitions as they begin their fourth year at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Upon returning to their beloved school, the head master announces the Triwizard Tournament and introduces the additional schools that will be participating.<br/><br/>However, due to the life-threatening and grueling tasks to be performed during the tournament, only those 17 years and older are allowed to be considered  technically this excludes Potter.<br/><br/>The tournament turns out to be more than the school and its participants bargained for with ancient beasts, underwater demons and magical mazes. Of course, like all Harry Potters before, nothing is as it seems.<br/><br/>Along with the Triwizard Tournament Hogwarts is hosting, also comes a Triwizard ball. This proves a difficult task for all three as they struggle with whom to bring as dates.<br/><br/>First of all, when it comes to rating this movie, it's Harry Potter so it just can't be bad. However, this particular one just did not measure up to its predecessors.<br/><br/>The very first two hours of the movie was great with all of the magic and conflicts you can expect from the series, but the end fell sort of flat.<br/><br/>A few major issues that have been lingering since the Sorcerer's Stone, as well as new prominent issues, did not get the recognition they deserved. I would like to explain myself a little better, but I don't want to give away major plot points in the movie. I only hope these issues are addressed further in the 2007 release of Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was pretty good and deserves eight out of ten stars. It's not as good as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban or the Sorcerer's Stone, but the kids, families and Harry Potter fanatics alike will enjoy this present day classic. It's definitely one to add to the DVD collection  like all the rest."

"TheNabOwnzz","6","3","12","24 June 2018"," Ambitious and innovative, but due to little emotional power and quite ugly cinematography it ranks as one of the weakest in the series
","After the extraordinary Prisoner of Azkaban there is no doubt that it was hard to live up to its reputation, and The Goblet of Fire definitely did not manage to do that, as it is definitely the weakest of the bunch up to this point.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this entry when comparing it to its predecessor is its use of digital backdrops instead of natural ones. This is also a part where The Prisoner of Azkaban shines in so brightly, as it used a lot of gorgeous backdrops of natural surroundings and showed a lot of interconnectivity of its area's to create a truly immersive experience. In the Goblet of Fire, many of the outdoor shots are bleak, colorless & quite ugly, and after the incredible cinematography that Azkaban had, the Goblet of Fire just looks like its ugly auntie. Also, this is, like Reign of Fire (2002) once again an absolute insult to common mythology as it is common knowledge that Dragons have four legs, and not two like in this film. The correct term for this creature should be 'Wyvern' instead of Dragon, as they do walk on two legs like the ones in this movie do. <br/><br/>The previous two movies were exceptional at introducing new characters, but in this film this is not so much the case, except for Brendan Gleeson ( Moody ) who was, ofcourse, brilliant as usual as this completely mad and insane yet mostly likeable character. However, the addition of two schools of who we have never heard of and its colorless characters such as Krum or Fleur Delacour definitely does not help give the film character. Ofcourse i do not need to explain to people who have seen Twilight what a terrible actor Robert Pattinson ( Cedric ) is, and it is no different in this film. Luckily, he was only used sparingly and his dialogue is quite limited.<br/><br/>Another obvious problem is the lack of a John Williams score. The composer Patrick Doyle tries to give it his best but he is obviously no match for Williams, and the score for this film is not memorable in any way, which is in stark contrast to the extremely emotionally powerful scores the first three movies had. The result is the iconic feel of the series is kind of gone, and a great part of it is due to Williams's departure from the series.<br/><br/>In the end the film really isn't about anything. It's about a tournament with three deadly objectives just for the sake of 'Tradition and honor'? It seems so out of place after what we have seen in the first three films, in which the narrative seemed logical and humane, but in the Goblet of Fire the narrative seems to be there for the sake of being a narrative, and not much else. There is also a gigantic ball scene with a lot of characters no one cares about and Ron who always seems pissed off at either Hermione of Harry for no obvious reason, which significantly lowers the audience's connections with its three main leads which has been established so wonderfully in its predecessors.<br/><br/>Luckily there still is the final half hour, as the graveyard sequence and Voldemort's resurrection is quite fascinating to behold, although it still has its flaws. It is said many times that Voldemort was scarier when he was not fully seen, and there is truth to this, yet i still find it that this scene is the most memorable in the film due to the exceptional special effects clashing of the wands and the fantastic Ralph Fiennes ( Voldemort ) performance. However, it seems he was so obsessed with himself that he let a hollywood cliché get the better of him, preferring to talk Harry to death instead of actually trying to kill him, and this admittedly makes Voldemort less intimidating compared to how intimidating he was in its predecessors when not being seen. Cedric's death is supposed to be an emotional moment after this, but we do not really actually know Cedric's character or what good he has done except tip Harry off about the dive objective, and therefore an emotional connection with his character cannot really be formed which results in his death not affecting the audience that much.<br/><br/>It is by no means a bad film overall, as its costume design, parts of indoor cinematography and acting by most of the established actors is still pretty good, but for a Harry Potter entry it is definitely a let down. Oh well, atleast the audience has the joy of seeing that annoying guy from Twilight get killed. That alone makes sure it still deserves some praise."

","Oh, God, where do I begin? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth installment from the J.K. Rowling series and this one is the payoff. Not only does each of the series keep getting better by installments, but they also get darker as well. As I mention in my review of Prisoner of Azkaban, the first two installments were ways of getting gawky eyed teenage girls to the big screen; with Azkaban, it was a movie where EVERYBODY, fans and non fans, to see this flick. With Goblet of Fire, the results are more promising than ever.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe returns to his role as Harry Potter, a little older this time, and having nightmares about Lord Voldermort A.K.A. ""You Know Who"", as the scar on his forehead is getting worse as he can see what his happening around Voldermort and his cronies.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also back as Harry's friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, in which time the three characters are hitting the stages of puberty where the guys don't have a clue on how to pick up girls, while a student from another school asks Hermione to the ball on Christmas Eve. Not only does puberty hit them, but also at the same time the relationships start to hit a conflict where Harry can't count on neither one anymore.<br/><br/>The premise of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is that every year there is a tournament called ""The Tri-Wizard Tournament"" where a student from Hogwarts and two other students from different schools (Beauxbatons Academy and Durmstrang Institute) compete for the Tri-Wizard Cup, which will lead the winner eternal glory. The contestants have to be over seventeen to compete in the tournament, which involves retrieving a golden egg from a dragon, saving a loved one from the black lake, and the last part of the competition is going to an endless maze where somebody gets the Tri-Wizard Cup. The way the student is chosen is if somebody writes the name of the contestant on a piece of paper and sends it to the Goblet of Fire where the names will be drawn. Three have already been chosen, even a student from Hogwarts; but now a fourth contestant is revealedHarry Potter. Part of the clause on the contract reveals that no matter what, if the name is drawn, the player must go through all the levels, even if they die.<br/><br/>As far from directing, Mike Newell of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Mona Lisa Smile"" is the first British director in the movie series where as a Britain, he understands everything about a boarding school, even a scene where Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) starts to hit Harry and Ron upside the head for not doing their work. Yet, so funny and realistic that he does an outstanding job making this film.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire also draws strong supporting roles; there's Michael Gambon reprising his role as Dumbledor; Maggie Smith as McGonagall (more of an extended role than Azkaban), Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Miranda Richardson as the slimy Rita Skeeter and Brendan Gleason as ""Mad-Eyed"" Moody, who is the fourth teacher in the dark arts after the three other teachers left (Prof. Quarrel was Voldermort's apprentice in the 1st movie; the fop Gilderoy Lockhart in the second movie; and the eccentric Prof. Lupin in the 3rd installment).<br/><br/>Harry does meet his match with Lord Voldermort (Ralph Finnees) before the end of the movie which is quite a surprise, because after the first three films, the first two were apprentices in the body of Voldermort; in the third film, it was revealed that another apprentice ""Worm-Tail"" Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) was responsible for the death of James and Lily Potter; and now the monster is met, incomplete, with the face of the mechanical droid from the movie ""I, Robot"" where Voldermort's eyes are small, his nose small and his body very alive.<br/><br/>This is the first Harry Potter movie to be Rated PG-13, because of dark elements and scary violence. It does a job of staying true to what it means. Not to mention coming along with a storyline that people can follow. Overall, this is one hell of a movie, and as Hermione says to Ron and Harry, ""Everything is going to change."" <br/><br/>Indeed, for the better.<br/><br/>Acting: A+ Plot:A+ Directing:A+<br/><br/>This is a must see for every wizard and muggle."

"Billylkbrooke","7","2","9","21 June 2018"," The Goblet of Fire: Story Focus and the Dangers of Book Adaptation
","Preface: 
Having just finished the finals to my undergraduate degree I decided to re-watch all the Harry Potter films together, and it was relaxing in front of these classic films that I noticed a problem. The Goblet of Fire follows the Prisoner of Azkaban, arguably the best of the films second only to the grand finale, and pales in comparison. Many of the complaints concerning the film focus on its closeness to the books, noticing that a great many details were dropped for time reasons. Changing aspects of the book is not always an issue; the third film omitted much of the backstory of Harry's father, and heavily condensed the emphasis on Hermione's impossible timetable that made the time-turner plot twist seem more sudden. Goblet by comparison appears to be one of the closest and most faithful films of the series, yet its issues lay with the more essential aspects that it omitted. This in turn created a slight identity issue in the narrative exemplified by severe pacing issues at its start. This highlights that its issue lay in how close it wanted to be to the book, which cased it to fall short. This is not to say that Goblet is a bad film; it is very enjoyable and does what it does very well. It simply falls short narratively for the issues it faced in adaptation.<br/><br/>Review Proper: 
The Goblet of Fire's pacing problem is tantalisingly clear from the very start, with a first act that hurtles forward. We are introduced to the villain, Barty Crouch Junior, in the first scene, and then the Quidditch World Cup, and then to a Death Eater riot that disrupts it, all within 12 minutes. The speed of which this occurs almost causes whiplash as I was left wandering why we were taken to the Quidditch World Cup if all we saw of it was the two teams flying towards each other before a quick cut. The riot afterwards similarly lasts a mere minute as we see a flash of chaos before Harry is quickly knocked out for the important plot point that follows. Hogwarts becomes the stage of the story after 15 minutes of story, which is far earlier than other films and comparatively feels like the film wanted to be in Hogwarts as quickly as it could.<br/><br/>We can infer fairly clearly from this rush to Hogwarts what the narrative of the film wants to do. This rush into Hogwarts suggests that the meat of the narrative, the story of the film, lies in Hogwarts. As the bulk of the Hogwarts plotline is the Triwizard tournament, implicitly the film shows that it wants to tell the story of the Triwizard cup more than who put up the dark mark and why. The introduction of the schools in the great hall sequence is longer than Barty Crouches' appearance at the camp riot, which is odd considering the finale of the film is Harry's showdown with Voldemort rather than the final task in the tournament. Issues such as this highlight that more run-time was devoted to the Triwizard cup than to flesh out Barty Crouches' past and motivations, which is odd considering the former is really just a plot catalyst and highly developed side story. The film, after all, is called Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, not Harry Potter and the Triwizard Tournament. It is this issue that permeates the narrative of this film.<br/><br/>That said, the film finally settles down when the tournament story leads the plot, having many character driven scenes as Harry is forced into the tournament and the dangers to his life mount in ever more dangerous tasks. This is where the film shines a bit more because the film finds focus. It keeps to the telling of the tournament, regaling plot points and action set pieces to ramp up interest and tension. We also are given hints towards the grand reveal of the tournament itself; Mad-Eye is fantastically played by Brendan Gleeson, who delivers a masterful act as the menacing but seemingly trusting Defence-Against-the-dark-arts teacher who is not who he seems. There is enough of Barty Junior to add weight to his reveal, and Voldemort's reveal is the true highlight of the film as it is the one time the film stops and takes in the gravity of story taking place.<br/><br/>The second act onwards demonstrates that this is a good film. It is riveting, engaging, and the ending is superb emotionally and visually. However, the opening highlights an issue that prevents this from being a great film, which is story focus. The first act sets up the importance of Barty Crouch Junior to the story but omits most of Crouch Senior until his death and pensive appearance, omitting entirely the story of how he placed the imperius curse on his son to stop him re-joining Voldemort. Seemingly irrelevant material except until we consider that this ""side plot"" is central to the story. To explain what I mean, I refer primarily to the general story arcs of the book and particularly to what its story is about.<br/><br/>So the Goblet of Fire focuses on two consecutive issues: the Triwizard tournament, and the return of Voldemort. The book is about the return of Voldemort, and this is demonstratively clear because the story concludes with Voldemort's return, for which the tournament is only the story's catalyst. The tournament ensures, by means of a timely portkey, that Harry arrives to bring about Voldemort's return. The tournament is a plot catalyst rather than the subject of the story. The mystery that drives the true story is ""who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire?"". This question causes the story to progress as we learn about Barty Crouch Junior, learn of his troubled family relationships, and discover why he is aiding Voldemort and why therefore Harry is led on an inexorable path towards a showdown with Voldemort. Crouch Junior is central to this story arc, and thus he needed to be fully fleshed out as a character, and his motivations made clear. This was established in the books with resounding depth by Rowling but lacks depth in the film because his story arc was distilled, and Crouch Junior was reduced to a ""loyal servant of Voldemort"".<br/><br/>As such, the book is exceptional for providing two concurrent plot threads, one of which dominates the story (the tournament) despite being, effectively, a red herring deceiving us on what the story is truly about. The book overtly tells the story of the tournament but provides a constant stream of clues about Crouch's story arc that moves the true story forward. The film by comparison omits many of the clues that drive the book's narrative, providing a mere 4 scenes for David Tennant. Too much focuses is placed on the tournament. This highlights a key issue in book adaptation, namely that details must be omitted to provide a coherent story but not to the detriment of the narrative. <br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire is no failure on this part, because it expertly adapts the tournament side of the narrative. However, most of the set up for the story's cathartic reveal comes from the first act, with the Quidditch World Cup and Crouch's introduction. Too much of this was skimmed through so that the story could get into Hogwarts as quickly as it could, rushing to the lesser of the two stories.<br/><br/>Conclusion: 
I have been perhaps unduly harsh against the Goblet of Fire, because it is a good story, and had to deal with a huge problem: how do you adapt a book that has potentially 5 hours' worth of cohesive film material in it? The answer the film presents is focus; emphasise the story points of one of the two main story arcs to provide a coherent narrative for the audience to follow for two hours. Where the Goblet of Fire fell short of being a great film was it simply, to my mind, focused on the lesser of the two stories. The Triwizard tournament is a distraction in the books from the more important mystery of who put Harry Potter's name in the Goblet of Fire, who Barty Crouch Junior was, and why did he want so desperately to bring about Voldemort's return. The film answered only the most basic of these questions while delivering on all the action for the tournament, succumbing to the distraction this action provided. The confused first act of the film demonstrates this issue; the first act of the book's story was dedicated to setting up Crouch Junior, establishing Crouch Senior's controlling character and introducing Winkie the house elf. With this cut down, the first act had little to stand on and wobbled.<br/><br/>I'd like to conclude here by asserting that this shows not that the Goblet of Fire was a poor adaptation, but instead illustrates the danger long books pose to story telling in film. The solution the Goblet of Fire poses makes the film good but pulls it short of being great."

"filipemanuelneto","7","1","3","5 September 2015"," New director, franchise improved.
","This film is the adaptation of the fourth book in the saga of Harry Potter, written by J. K. Rowling. Alfonso Cuaron, who directed the previous film, leaves the franchise and gives way for Mike Newell, which comes almost as a contingency solution for the place. However, it was an excellent bet and gave fairly good results, with the film to show a marked improvement and the first use of massive and impressive special and computerized effects. It's also the first film where we see Harry Potter and his friends as teenagers they already are, a brand that comes up, very quietly, in the book, but Newell explores in this film, where the action and fight scenes also become more intense. The actors remain basically the same and fidelity to detail and descriptions of the original book is still evident. This film was one breath of fresh air in the franchise."
"barbagvido","9","1","3","1 September 2015"," Not really faithful as an adaptation but good on it's own
","The book was one of the best and most intense in the series and while I think they left out too much the movie was still epic. Dumbledore bothered me the most. I mean, what? When did Dumbledore get so hyperactive? Where did that wise, calm Dumbledore go? But, about the ending, they totally nailed it! This ending is a big game-changer in the series and when you see why, you'll be shocked. After that, nothing is going to be the same again. It's gut-punching and also terrifying for children. But enough about the ending, you'll see it for yourself. CGI is great and now it really looks realistic. The dragon and underwater scenes were spectacular! And don't get me started on the maze. There are also some teen problems in this movie. Obviously, they are not kids anymore but it's really fun to see them grow up. The Yulle Ball part shows that the most. About the actors, I can only say something about the new ones because the others are great as usual (except Gambon who wasn't bad but over the top). Brendan Gleeson is great as Mad-Eye Moody. And David Tennat was scary in a good way. John Williams isn't the composer anymore but Patrick Doyle did such a great job in this one. While Williams' score was more magical, Doyle's was pure epicness and makes everything more intense. And Mike Newell, as a first British director in the franchise was great. While it could've been more faithful to the book (but then it would be really long) it's still awesome and epic."
"willcundallreview","7","1","3","10 July 2015"," Harry gets even darker and deeper
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire see's our young friend In his fourth year at Hogwarts, and very much in danger yet again. The movie is dark, slick and all together a new kind of Harry Potter which seems to take us in a new direction when it comes to Potter and wants us to feel much more dark but also more emotion. The film has thrills everywhere and the plot is pretty fun, it's not every film you get Dragons, huge hedges and Ron Weasley all rolled in one but this one makes us laugh or it did for me, and here below are my thoughts on the adventure.<br/><br/>The plot isn't necessarily unique but still captures a certain imagination of thrilling chases, battles and teenage angst in which there is quite a bit. Yes this is truly the movie where Harry, Ron and Hermione start to realise they are becoming more mature and with that comes relationships etc which kind of intertwines with the more serious nature of the plot. On that point the serious side of the story, it is much darker than before, now Prisoner of Azkaban was possibly darker in the whole set up of the plot but this is a little darker throughout, gossip of Lord Voldemort growing in power and his gang of ""Death eaters"" stoke fear in our characters and even new additions to the teaching staff make Neville Longbottom wince. <br/><br/>The film is pretty well cast, new additions a plenty especially with all the new schools we get to see. But for me the one best new face is Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody who just makes the film funny and not necessarily in a fun way, his mannerisms are second to none and his speedy eye makes the plot a little more interesting. Among the new young actors is Robert Pattinson who as new boy Cedric Diggory is good and appears alongside others such as Stanislav Ianevski(Victor Krum) and Clemence Poesy(Fleur Delacour) who make the cast a big one but a good one. <br/><br/>Mike Newell is drafted in to direct this and although he isn't bad, I didn't like the way in which he did it. I just felt he sets it up in a way in which the actors can seem awkward and although he deals with the massive scenes involved, he doesn't get the dramatic side out until right at the end. With source material so huge, this is really the first big challenge that the series gets when adapting but I felt Steve Kloves adapts it well and Newell does it well enough to make this a very worthy addition to the franchise. <br/><br/>Going into more technical terms it is filmed well, the design is nice and the entire look and feel is one the best of the movies now four in. With John Williams not scoring this movie you might not expect it to be as epic and although it does sound a little different to before, new man Patrick Doyle thumps this one out and in the process creates a really good score, that isn't afraid of going all blockbuster on the whole show. I felt even the special effects get driven up slightly from before, they improve in a way only hundreds of millions can do but in any case, good work.<br/><br/>So Goblet of Fire keeps Harry Potter going on and really keeps it steady, not a better film than the previous instalment for me but oh so close though. Yes Daniel Radcliffe and co just have no signs of slowing down, and with the backing this franchise has there is no wonder people love these movies and the series as a whole, me included."

","Overall, I thought this was definitely the worst of series so far. Everything in it just seemed so crammed and rushed for time. Nothing in the movie really seemed to capture many of the exciting or interesting parts of the book. Things like the Qudditch match were just horribly short, and not even appealing to watch. As for the maze, many of the interesting tasks from the book were just thrown aside. If things like this are going to be included, I would think that it would at least be done right. I would have definitely sat through an extra half hour or more to see these things done well. The acting didn't impress me much either, but what added to painfulness of watching the movie the most was Dumbledore, whose acting I thought was just terrible at points in the film (mainly near the end). Judging by the quality of the Order of the Phoenix, I can tell that the movies will get better, and hopefully no more books will be this badly portrayed again."

","This is the best movie ever!!! It had a lot of action, was approx 2 hr 30 minutes long (with no credits),and the acting was superb. Sure it could've been at least 3 hours, and Dumbledore could've been nicer, but nothing else is bad! Did you ever read reviews? If a movie's even over 130 minutes, they say it's too long! And this is (the whole thing) is approx 2 hr 40 minutes! You know what some critics called this? ""Overlong"", they called it.<br/><br/>The special effects were awesome!!! Some parts were funny, and Voldemort was creepy! The violence was cool and the third task, Death Eater Attack, and the finale was pretty intense and long (there is half an hour worth of action in this whole movie ). Oh yeah, and someone better change the parental advisory for violence and gore for this film. (I can't, I'm new here)."
"liberalgems","1","1","3","19 February 2008"," Tired Of All The Brutal Violence! Tired Of The Poor Screen writing & Acting!
","My favorite genre is fantasy & science fiction. While I have never been a big fan of the Harry Potter storyline, I like to keep an open mind. I have to say the cinematography and special effects are absolutely magnificent, and the creatures from ancient mythology are always a treat. There are also moments with a wonderful sense of humor, which is especially appreciated. But, when all is said and done, I found this particular Harry Potter episode alternating too often between boring and disturbing.<br/><br/>First, the disturbing. An amputation, the brutal murder of a young man, an act of torture, and the wailing of a grieving father, in quick succession, was rather demoralizing, to put it mildly. One thing is for sure: This movie is certainly not made with young children in mind.<br/><br/>Was all this intense violence really necessary for what is essentially a movie series for children and teens? In my opinion, it's a sign of poor writing, or worse, pandering to the audience. I can appreciate the need to be edgy and sensational, and the desire to maximize one's profits. But does everything have to be so black and white in the Harry Potter universe? After a while it's starts to become a cliché, and that's boring! The screen writing had a lot to be desired. The editing was terrible. There was a lot of meaningless or annoying dialog. Some of the acting was very weak and shrill.<br/><br/>With all the money this film rakes in the Director should be getting the best teen actors in the world, even for minor, or cameo roles. I just can't believe how predictable much of the acting is! At times, it's like a broken record! Then on the other hand, you have some top adult talent that barely gets to say a word, like the Maggie Smith character.<br/><br/>I guess I'm expecting way too much from a formula-type film. Something which clearly reflects the dualism in our Judeo-Christian tradition, and our Capitalist system of putting profits first, and everything else, like art, second!"

","With all our favourite characters well established and the actors all truly into their respective roles, Harry's fourth outing, sees some new introductions (Mad-eye Moody is brilliant) and some really interesting story revelations that unfold within the main theme, which is very imaginative and strongly written.<br/><br/>The tri-wizard tournament has come to Howarts and one 17 year old entry from each of the three schools is chosen to represent their school, when Harry's name is picked at the age of 14, everyone is left bemused as to how and why this could have happened; but he has to abide by the magical contract and compete along side the other three champions nonetheless.<br/><br/>The four champions have to fight dragons, solve the mystery of the black lake and survive the terror of the final task within a huge maze.<br/><br/>This outing is definitely the darkest so far, and the truth behind Harry's shock entry into the tournament is nothing short of astounding, the closing scenes are deeply atmospheric and very graphic for a movie that is rated '12 - UK/PG13 - US' <br/><br/>9/10 I'm simply dying to see the next instalment, the magic just keeps getting stronger."

AND Voldemort did not explain himself, as he did in the book, sure that speech took a while, but, man, it explained a lot of things, like why he survived, and what not, they address that, but so briefly you can miss it.<br/><br/>Also, when being held by the gravestone, it's obvious, he could've easily gotten out of it.

","After the horrible part-3 of the series, which was highly embarrassing, made no sense and pure garbage when compared to Part-1 and Part-2, the fourth film makes a sincere attempt to put the franchise back on its feet. While this film certainly views as too abridged when compared to the actual events that happened in the book, the overall effort was quite decent. The acting has certainly become worse in some areas here and there. Ralphe Fiennes does'nt really seem to be sincere as he looks unthreatening and pathetic when playing Voldemort. Not scary at all. Even so, the overall effect of this movie was very good. Although it must be said that Part-4 itself is nothing compared to Part 1 and 2."
"mehta-nishank","8","1","3","5 June 2006"," The best of the four Potter flicks!
","Finally we have got a Potter flick that somewhat meets our high expectations! Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire captures the drama of the book and makes for gripping, flashy cinema. While some goof-ups are apparent in the film and some important sections of the story have been omitted, the film , on the whole is quite good to see. With the III instalment of the story been a pain to watch, the IV movie restores back the good quality that must be associated to every Potter flick. As this is the flick where The Dark Lord returns, it is certainly a very eagerly awaited one. I must say that the Dark Lord's resurrection is splendidly shown and does give due respect to JKR's visualization.<br/><br/>In the acting arena, the three lead stars, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) give damn good performances and have certainly matured as actors. Emma Watson, in particular, impressed me for her admirable acting and breathtaking beauty. In fact, Watson has such a powerful impact on the film that the other two female characters - Cho Chang (Yuck!) and Fleur Delacour(OK, but certainly not Ooh!) are eclipsed. Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort is great and it will be interesting to see how his character develops in the next 3 movies. Finally, a plea to the film-makers, please please please find a suitable actor to play Albus Dumbledore - Michael Gambon is a pain to watch"

"candydevil666","6","1","3","10 December 2005"," Disappointing and Unexpected
","Some find it fantastic, others not so fantastic. I am not the only person to find this film quite disappointing. Many fans of J.K. Rowling would consider it rushed and not true to the book. The first two films were great. Hogwarts looked the same and so did the uniforms. Suddenly Hogwarts looked different in the third film. The courtyard changed, a bridge appeared, The Whomping Willow changed positions (and size), the Fat Lady changed actresses, Hagrid's hut changed position and the uniforms appeared in a different design. In the first film, Hermione's hair was true to the book - big and bushy. In the second film, it was still long, but no longer bushy and instead in crimps. By the third film, her hair had been cut short and was in messy curls. But by The Goblet of Fire, the films have changed completely. The Quidditch pitch is on a rocky cliff, and Hogwarts is built on the side of a mountain. Some major characters and elements were cut from the film. What happened to Dobby and Hermione's SPEW obsession? What happened to Ludo Bagman? The whole film was rushed to a halt at the graveyard in the third task. The dreadful screenplay hides the good acting, of Emma Watson in particular. If a book such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is to be made into a film, it should be done to its best. If making two films was necessary in order to end up with a good result, it should have been done. People expect so much work to go into the Harry Potter films. Staying true to the book is so important. I hope the fifth film can live up to fans' expectations."

","I beg you to replace Michael Gambon or to modify his character because his acting is ridiculous and it humiliates the figure of Dumbledore at the same time. He has NOTHING in common with the character of the book and I don't understand why it was needed to change his features. It does not influence the length of the movie and I don't think it would require more money to be faithful and consequent to the original character. Why was it necessary then? Please, explain, why did they turn Dumbledore into a clown!!! As opposed to the first actor I mentioned in my opinion Ralph .. was the perfect choice to represent the unique character of The Dark Lord. His acting abilities made him absolutely appropriate to provide the audience with the characteristic features of the original figure of the book. In the question of authenticity I would highlight the performance of Alan Rickman ,Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Ralph Fiennes. I believe they personalized the characters of the book in the most ""loyal"" manner"
"dbbuddha","6","1","3","6 December 2005"," disappointing, for different reasons
","Many reviewers and message board users have mentioned that this movie was disappointing to avid fans of the books, and the defendants claim that the book had to be cut and we fans shouldn't expect for every little subplot to be mentioned. I felt, however, that the movie was disappointing *not* for what it left out, but for what it put into the film.<br/><br/>Newell can be excused for cutting many things, especially since he really did a laudable job of altering the plot in most places to fit the edits. What bothered me was the addition of longer sequences. The first task is beyond drawn out, especially since the whole idea in the book (and somehow also in the movie) was that he performed so ludicrously well on it that he wasn't worried about the second task until later.<br/><br/>Then there was the campiness. This should not have been a campy film.<br/><br/>But worst of all the offenses were the changes in characters' personalities. Dumbledore, like it or not, comes off as mean-spirited in this film, and pushes the line between roughness and assault. Ron comes off more as an idiot than just deeply jealous. Professor McGonagall is made a mockery. Then again, Professor Snape is almost... likable. There is something severely wrong with this.<br/><br/>Additionally, it lacks clarity of vision. Where the director chooses to leave out some minor bits of dialogue that would have made other parts of the movie more clearly relevant and understandable, he leaves in other parts that could have easily been removed, leaving the film feeling disjointed and, inexplicably given its running time, hurried.<br/><br/>My list of gripes goes on further, but these were the worst grievances done to fans, not only of the books but also of the movies. Far from the best movie of the series, it was still a decent enough movie if you avoid reading the book beforehand and can get over the fact that your eyes remain dry at the end."
"Nikhil-3","8","1","3","6 December 2005"," One book-One movie. Good idea?
","Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie. But there is just too much in Book 4 to cover. On the contrary, there isn't much in book 5, or it is possible to cut out more from Book 5. Book 4 has more commercial movie making material. I remember the plot had not gone *anywhere* for the first 150 pages or so in Book 5.<br/><br/>Frankly, I would have preferred Book 4 spilling into the next movie for about a 3rd of the movie. Movie4 could end at Task 1 with Harry's Dragon fight as the finale. In spite of some comments here, I liked that part. You need not follow the book to every last sentence. You can take some creative freedom.<br/><br/>They could have released the movies within 7-8 months of each other, that would have kept people interested. Frankly, I am not sure how good movie-5 would be given the content in the book."

This new film comes to me as renewed faith in the Harry Potter series after what I considered a horrible turn by Alfonso Cuaron in Prisoner of Askaban. I know fans were divided on ""POA"" and I was definitely in the ""hated it"" camp with the reason being how many important elements were left out, and not just nitpicking little items but key ingredients. <br/><br/>Enough reviewers here have told you about the plot and my, my how the kids have grown but what I would like to add is that this latest Harry Potter film really captures the humor of the books. JK Rowling's humor is one of the key ingredients to the success of Harry Potter and it's nice to see it fully demonstrated here. <br/><br/>This is a truly wonderful film. Can't bless it enough!"

","There is a saying that the books are always better than the films based on these books. I beg to differ. Only a few years ago, around the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", I got caught in the magic created by an amazing woman, J.K.Rowling. I wanted to read the book first before seeing the story on screen. After that, I knew I would be addicted for the rest of my life, though never experienced anything like that before. I suppose Lord of the Ring fans know what I'm talking about. I've read all the books, several times, seen all the films, several times, and just can't get enough of this wizard and his friends. Is there a difference between the books and the films? Of course, since these are two totally different media. It's almost impossible to film the whole book and therefore necessary to leave certain details out. The authenticity is however, thanks to the author herself, because of this, remarkable. If the first three were jewels, this one is a diamond. And diamonds are this girl's best friend. The film is a roller-coaster ride filled with excitement, humor (thank you Weasleys), tension, amazing acting performances, friendship, terror and even romance. If I had to describe the film in one word, it would be impossible. Although ""magical"" kind of sums it up."
"Moonlit_Sorcery","7","1","3","5 December 2005"," The best since Sorcerer's Stone
","Goblet Of Fire is the fourth installment in the popular Harry Potter series, about a British boy wizard named (what else?) Harry Potter who attends the Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.<br/><br/>This time around, in his fourth year, Harry's been plagued by a terrible recurring nightmare of the Dark Lord Voldemort, his mousy, cowardly servant Peter ""Wormtail"" Pettigrew, and a mysterious young man whom Harry has never met, all gathered in an abandoned old house, plotting the downfall of ""The Boy Who Lived"".<br/><br/>But these dreams are not all that Harry has to contend with. A fierce competition known as The Triwizard Tournament is being held at Hogwarts, with students from two other magical schools visiting. One student from each school over seventeen has the option to submit their name to the Goblet Of Fire, which will choose the competitors who will compete in a series of terrifying, potentially lethal magical tasks. Harry is more than happy to sit back and let others be the hero for a change, but someone else apparently has other plans. Harry is shocked and terrified when his name, which he had NEVER submitted in the first place, is selected by the Goblet as the FOURTH Triwizard Champion. The Goblet Of Fire, however, constitutes a binding magical contract, and Harry is forced to compete, despite being three years underage, and far less experienced than his opponents. While many of his classmates think Harry is just trying to get more fame and glory, Harry doesn't want any of this, and must rely on his closest friends and talents if he is to survive. Little does Harry know that a shocking twist of events will lead him straight into Voldemort's trap for the showdown of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Many new characters show up this year, including Harry's first crush, Cho Chang, the troublesome yellow journalist Rita Skeeter, the mysterious Durmstrang Headmaster, Igor Karkaroff, the absolutely gigantic Headmistress of Bueaxbatons and Hagrid's love interest, Madame Maxine, Hogwart's creepy, but lovable new Defense Against The Dark arts teacher Alastor Moody, and the cold as stone politician who is said to have once sent his own son to Azkaban, Barty Crouch. We also have the other three Triwizard Champions, Hogwarts own Cedric Diggory, the french heart breaker Fleur Delacour, and the young Bulgarian Quidditch Champion, Victor Krum.<br/><br/>Returning characters include the terminally-depressed girl ghost who lives in a toilet, Moaning Myrtle, Hogwarts sinister potions teacher who loathes Harry, Severus Snape, the stern but kindly Deputy Headmistress, Professor McGonagall, and Hogwarts Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, who is beginning to show his human side in his obvious terror for Harry's safety.<br/><br/>The trio has all improved greatly since the original film, and Daniel Radcliffe in particular does a fantastic job crying in one very emotional scene near the end. He is also very believable as a boy who is sick of being the hero and just wants to relax and be a normal kid. You see his stress and anxiety as he struggles to cope with the Tournament, which he never wanted any part of in the first place. He is only fourteen, yet you see him try to cope with his emotions and get through the tasks unscathed.<br/><br/>The adult actors are all terrific as well, with Ralph Fiennes and Jason Isaacs as villains, Timothy Spall as a cowardly servant of the Dark Lord, and David Tennant as a crazed madman. Alan Rickman is wonderful as always as the detestable Professor Snape. Brendan Gleeson turns in the best performance of all, however, as the paranoid, intimidating, but lovable new professor who devotes his time to helping Harry survive the perils of the Tournament.<br/><br/>Overall, Goblet Of Fire is the BEST Harry Potter movie since Sorcerer's Stone. Sure, there are quite a few things cut out, but you have to face that the book is HUGE and in order to make a movie of acceptable length, certain things had to go. It doesn't make the movie confusing. Even a non-reader will understand what's going on if he/she PAYS ATTENTION. But I do suggest a second viewing to grasp all of the subtle clues that you may have missed the first time around. Each Harry Potter movie, is, in a sense, a brilliant adventure/mystery with clues strewn through the movie for you to pick up on."
"andreja-stojkovski","9","1","3","5 December 2005"," It was definitely worth waiting for!
","Well I might over-reacted with the voting but, it is due to the fact that I am such a big fan, and also under the strength of the impressions of just returning from the movies, after taking the whole exposure to magic.<br/><br/>I can not say that the Goblet of fire is the best book of the series, it somehow lacks the strength and the activity of the characters of the Order of the Phoenix, but still exposes to the best of light my favorite two characters. The first one of course being Harry Potter and the second as always, and for me naturally, Minerva McGonagall. Having the three previous movie adaptations of the books for hundreds of times, since I have the DVDs at home, I can say that I consider this as the best, although there were somethings that I lacked.<br/><br/>The first two films were necessarily adapted to suite to the children, as they were considered as the primary audience, and they were, but as the characters grow and develop the audience changes and the actual happenings in the story develop to a different level more likely followed with the film as such.<br/><br/>As of the very beginning up to the very end I enjoyed this film (Mike Newel brought something more adequate for the story - British, and finally he turned it to the stream it should have taken instead of the one that Cuaron wanted to lead it to). The first two, although a bit to much adapted to the younger audience and with more innocent approach, were definitely better in the sense of adaptation, since the third brought it to much into modern times and left the all British issues like school robes, rules and discipline that the students are supposed to have in a school such as Hogwarts being a proper English boarding school. There is an extreme quantity of effects that were conceded although the film was not made darker in any sense as it was with the previous one. The scene with the dragon was according to my taste a bit to exaggerated and thus made less attractive, unlike the second task which was offered to the viewers as reality. However I lack the difficulties and the dangers of the third task since the film offered us no more then the maze it self.<br/><br/>The actors on the adult side were more or less up to the challenge, of course, knowing that we speak of the most talented bunch of British actors that we have seen, while the strangers were very bad. Pedja Bjelac, I am sorry to say, was to stiff, and was like reading the lines from a card and speaking them in front of camera, while Stanislav Ianevski, although from the youngsters, with the three words said into the film does not deserve the efforts by the producers to go casting in Bulgaria. All the praise goes to Maggie Smith since she was the best in picturing the character of McGonagall as she really is described in the books. We saw Alan Rickman and Michel Gambon, possibly in bringing to us the worst of Dumbledore and Snape, but if this is a school then we should definitely see some more professors. Gleason looked to me like some oaf and although got the character right I think that Moody should be played by someone more agile who could prove to be up to the job of dark-wizard catcher not only by his magic abilities but by appearance to.<br/><br/>The younger cast are improving by the minute, but in this movie I so somethings which I shouldn't have like Ginny with no words at all, and Nevile at the most marvelous of his. Dan is the best and acts as a sponge by acquiring the most of positive experience from the grown-ups.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film did lose some points on a few issues. First, the Dursleys and the arriving of the Weasleys. The accommodation in the boxes during the Quidditch finals, and the finals themselves, if they were supposed to be omitted then they should have been omitted fully, and finally Molly Weasley should not have, I repeat, should not have been omitted since she plays a vital role for the emotional part of the movie and the upbringing of Harry. Her presence on the final task should have been most awarding for this side of the film. I personally being a cry baby at films, was on the verge of crying but there was a simple lack of emotions and a person dies, or worst was killed.<br/><br/>I do recommend to every movie lover to see it, in all the artistic senses it is worth seeing it, it is not just a part of the series. For the book lovers as I am I recommend that they accept the ""film"", not necessarily the adaptation.<br/><br/>Finally, thanks to the whole team for the Christmas present."

","First of all, I thought Mike Newell totally f**ck-ed up a great story like Harry Potter. Of course, if you aren't someone original like me who read the book before the movie was released, of course you're going to think, ""WOW! That was great!"" Wel f*ck that.. This movie wasn't great this time at all! Mike Newell excluded plenty of big parts from this movie that were written by JK Rowling herself. A part such as where in the end, they were supposed to be shown leaving for the summer and at the train station, where Hermione was supposed to kiss Harry on the cheek and such. Well, thanks Mike Newell for screwing up Harry Potter's true story. But other than that, thanks, because for those who hadn't read the book before, it still was a great movie overall!"
"marttisarkia","9","1","3","5 December 2005"," Probably the best Harry Potter movie so far
","I've read the first five Harry Potter books and I liked probably the most this 4th one. First I thought that this movie can't be good, because the book is so long and a guy like Mike Newell was supposed to direct it. I personally hadn't any objections against him, but I was prepared to the worst after having read these forums.<br/><br/>Now, when I have seen the movie, I can say that this one is definitely the best Harry Potter movie. Steven Kloves did a great job again in screenplay, Mike Newell succeeded to make probably the best direction of Harry Potter movies so far (I hope you get the point) and the main actors (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron, Emma Watson as Hermione, Bonnie Wright as Ginny and Matthew Lewis as Neville) have become pretty talented actors. Of course the interest of the plot affects to my opinion about this film also.<br/><br/>Newell had collected the movie very wisely. All the most important scenes had been included to the movie and they had been made in more entertaining and interesting way than in the early Potter movies. The side actors had been chosen very well also. Katie Leung as Cho is as beautiful as I had imagined, and Stanislav Ianevski and Robert Pattinson are almost made to act Victor Krum and Cedric Diggory. Now I'm just waiting for the DVD release with a massive collection of deleted scenes and some other documentaries.<br/><br/>So even though you didn't like the early Potter movies very much but you liked the books you should see this movie. I think it's pity that Mike Newell won't direct the following Harry Potter movies, but I hope that David Yates would make The Order of the Phoenix as good as this became or even better."
"AlanJ2","6","1","3","5 December 2005"," Grossly overrated and needlessly long this is only good in parts
","Judging by some of the reviews here you'd think this was a masterpiece though to be fair others tell it like it is. And I am coming to it cold without having read the book. There are good moments, especially the first half hour and the first contest but then the film flags dreadfully and never really recovers. Not only is each contest less exciting than the one before but there is an interminable sequence around the school ball which hammers the same point time after time after time: yes teenagers suffer social embarrassment and yes so do older folk but we don't need huge swathes of repetitive screen time to learn this again and again plus endless scenes of clichéd whimsy. This whole section could have come down to 10 minutes max (it feels like five time that length) and left more time for the story which is often confused and suffers weird time jumps.<br/><br/>Also while the children/teens are good, some of the elderly British cast should be ashamed of themselves. Michael Gambon gives an utterly lifeless performance as Dumbledore ('Dumblebore' more like). It sounds like he doesn't believe a word of it. The report card for him as for the film? Could Do Better!"
"nmatest","3","1","3","29 November 2005"," a horrible movie with some nice parts
","The first half hour of the movie was paced like a video clip, in which many parts had the only purpose to cite small excerpts of the first hundred-some pages of the book. The clips themselves had no connection, no harmony and, worst, they failed their sole purpose in deviating A LOT from the novel, interpreting some scenes in a, IMHO, doubtful way.<br/><br/>Later the movie improved because the pacing got better. However, the girls of Beaubaton are nothing short of awkward. The interplay between the three main characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron) was reduced to small scenes which lacked credibility (not blaming the actors but the script instead), there was almost no hint that the story takes place at a school, Fleur had no charisma, Krum was depicted a dumb sports-hero (which is wrong), etc.<br/><br/>Most of the special effects were just there for the effects not for the plot. Actually, they interrupted the plot several times instead of supporting it.<br/><br/>Prof. Dumbledore is completely misinterpreted. He lacks an aura of authority, he loses his temper, he seems even desperate in the scene in his office. I cannot get the slightest idea why this person should be the greatest wizard of his time.<br/><br/>Voldemort was quite OK, as was the scene at the cemetery, though even there the ""great director"" had to put in some artistic (mis)interpretations.<br/><br/>The movie had some strengths, however. There was some humor, the special effects were almost flawless (despite being used without sense), some acting was great (Radcliffe, Grint, Rickman, D. Smith), certain stretches had its harmony and made sense (even without knowing the novel).<br/><br/>All in all, I cannot see that the movie lives up to its hype, and if there was not the GREAT novel by J.K.Rowling, I guess it would not earn its production costs. However, they could produce anything remotely resembling the book and the people would still crowd the cinemas.<br/><br/>Conclusio: Script 1/10 stars, Directing 0/10 stars (please get rid of the director for the 5th movie)."
"aircorwin","5","1","3","29 November 2005"," Harry's A Pothead
","I just saw the latest installment of the Harry Potter saga on the big screen yesterday, and much as I want to give a good review for you Potter-heads out there, I just can't. Why? Well, let me put it this way...<br/><br/>The story - after three tries, it gets to be too boring already. I haven't read the book - but remember, we're talking about the film here. Harry goes back for another year at Hogwarts, gets embroiled in a spectacular snafu of some sort, comes out victorious in the end, all the while adding another chapter to his ultimate showdown with the evil Voldemort. Yes, you can actually use that as a summary for all four films. To just give a proper perspective, here's what actually transpired: I was more excited at the minute-or-so-length trailer of the new Superman movie than the whole three-hour length of the featured film.<br/><br/>The cinematography - Well, it's just probably again because I haven't read the book (but then again, what's the point in making the movie?), but I can't shake the feeling that they were cramming too much into one movie. A scene abruptly ends and shifts into another scene, creating too many whys and whoas. An example, in the opening scenes, they were in some sort of a Quidditch Super owl, and then suddenly they were back at their magical tent (who won?), and then suddenly there's bad guys blasting the whole place up (why?), and then Harry Pothead (I swear he looks like he's into marijuana or something, with his sunken eyes and unwashed hair) gets knocked out (he miraculously remains unscathed even as the whole place burns) and then the bad guys are all gone (what the...?) and then suddenly they were on a train for Hogwarts with all these new chicks (I didn't even know that the Chinese girl's character was named Cho Chang, I just read it in the papers) with them.<br/><br/>To top it off, there's always this flaw that most writers commit when writing an unplanned series, there's always a new character introduced in a new sequel who would turn out to be pivotal to the sequel's story. In this one, there's that bug-eyed ""new professor"" and the magistrate's son, who became the major psycho villain in this story (shades of Sorcerer's Stone?). This happens because J.K. Rowling hadn't banked on his first book making it that big, and hadn't therefore planned ahead on making the entire series a seamless plot.<br/><br/>And seriously, how could they have stayed in Hogwarts for four years (more for some) and not have heard of such a thing as the Tri-Wizards Tournament? That is certainly an inexcusable major plot flaw by Rowling. Ditto for them not knowing about the Yule Ball. What, it's just held every four years, like the Olympics maybe? Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Casting was also suspect, especially after they were forced to replace the original Dumbledore (who has since died) with the latest version (since part 3), who not only pales in comparison with the original guy, but acts like a juiced-up, excitable version of the supposedly ""stern"" and ""esteemed"" head wizard. Now he's acting like a wacky witch, complete with high-pitched squeals even! And I'm not the only one who has noticed this. Even the prim Professor Mc-something (played by the usually straight-faced Maggie Smith) was unusually (and most likely unintentionally) comical in this one.<br/><br/>And there's always a limit to how you can put the blame on ""not reading the book."" I read the full LOTR series at least ten years before the film and I still enjoyed the film. I didn't read the Bourne series but I also enjoyed the films. I think the Narnia book sucked, but I think I would like the film. And so on.<br/><br/>Thus, I was again ripped off of my hard-earned money to watch this embarrassment. I guess anything that has witchcraft and magic in it (watch out, Narnia) doesn't always come out LOTR-caliber."
"Proscriptus","3","1","3","25 November 2005"," The filmmakers should be ashamed.
","I suppose making a film strictly for the 12-14 crowd is fine, but then how can you justify including such disturbing imagery? An adult certainly won't enjoy it; there's no plot as such, and anyone with an attention span of more than a few minutes will be dreadfully disappointed.<br/><br/>My neighbor's eight-year-old was tremendously anticipating it, but I had to recommend in the strongest possible terms that, if they didn't want her to have nightmares for a month, that they keep her away from it. And here's the rub: A lot of parents won't think twice, and they really should. If you have a child who can take this sort of thing in their stride, you should be spending your money on child psychologists, not film tickets. You'd have to be as desensitized as an Eritrean child soldier not to freak out. The filmmakers should be ashamed. Go see March of the Penguins again, instead."

"bonne07","4","1","3","22 November 2005"," Not a huge fan of HP4 movie/don't read if you haven't seen it!
","I loved all of the H. Potter books and was enthusiastic about seeing HP4 so I was extremely disappointed to see many of the fun parts of the book not represented in the movie. I do NOT understand how anyone could understand this movie if they hadn't read the book because it leaves so many details out (to be such a long movie) and how anyone could enjoy it if they'd read the book because so much WAS left out. I never heard where it explained about B. Crouch being killed in the woods (for the people who haven't read the books) or how B. Crouch, JR. got out of Azkaban. Not starting at Privet Dr. seemed like a serious let down, as was missing a depiction of ton-tongue toffees, not meeting Bill Weasley or the excellent way the Intl. Quidditch Cup was depicted in the books,along with Winky, and the maze was just boring compared to the book, and well I could go on and on. The direction seemed lacking to me along with the script to go with the emotions, but I am just a viewer. Does anyone else think maybe too much was left on the editing room floor or possibly the director should've been? Very little that made the book great seemed represented here - I guess I just needed a 6 hr. movie with substance instead of a 3 hr. movie with just action without explanation. By the way, could anyone enlighten me as to how come the directors keep changing (albeit I'm thankful for the next change)?"
"Stars8685","3","1","3","22 November 2005"," Some thoughts
","Overall, I thought the movie to be okay. While far from the best of the Harry Potter Series, the movie is a worthwhile watch for H.P. fans just on principle. One thing that bothered me about the movie was the acting. While the adult actors hold their own, the (now) young teen actors leave a lot to be desired. Granger is not really playing a role as much as she is looking nice for the camera and Potter seems to be tiring of his role. Grint on the other hand (who played Ron) really impressed me with his maturing talent as an actor. Well done, Grint! The special effects are fantastic and well integrated into the action of the film. Also, there are few continuity errors that I noticed. I was, however, upset at the lack of attention given to the rest of the school year (You know, the part that DOESN'T involve the tournament), and some events of the film weren't fully explained. Also, WAY too long!"
"tovao-1","1","1","3","21 November 2005"," terrible!
","nothing to spoil, i joined just to tell you to save your money and go see ANYTHING else. i am sad i spent the money. wow and i thought #3 was bad, this makes it look Oscar worthy. the movie was poorly edited and characters were removed. if you are going to change things in the interest of time, at least cut the whole thing or character! and if things don't make it shorter, why change them? also way overboard on the CG effects, maybe 2 movies would have been a good idea. the girls were not very pretty. I don't know how they can possibly continue after removing essential plot elements, like the plot. the film sor of jumped from one scene to the next with little transition and dumbledore can suck it. he has no grasp on the sprightly wise kindly character in the book. Hermione is way to pretty and confidant, in the books she is awkward and gangly and a know it all, but by the second movie she was all cute little popular girl looking. The ghosts seem to have disappeared from the plot all together as well as house elves and the maurauders map, which was sort of ditched in film 3. also they could use a haircut, all of them. and since when do they wear muggle clothes?"
"bountyseeker2003","8","1","3","21 November 2005"," Overall its a good movie worth seeing
","Well overall I think that it was rushed I mean personally I think it should have been 3 - 3 1/2 hours instead of 2:37 minutes. anyways I gave it and 8/10 because I thought the special effects were really good, the actors/actresses did a good job acting in most of it (just a few places I thought to be overacted), and because I looked at from more than one point of view which gave a little understanding as to why they left certain parts out. Although I do think that they did leave out a few very important parts and changed a few parts in ways they shouldn't have. But for the sake of not spoiling the movie for others I wont reveal parts that they should not have changed or parts they did.<br/><br/>All in all to summarize I would say its a movies worth getting on DVD and seeing in theaters at least once. Also to note I read all the harry potter books so far."

"rooney_34","10","1","3","20 November 2005"," Amazing movie. Brilliantly done.
","This movie was brilliantly done and displays an extreme amount of realize and characters that anyone should be able to relate to in some way. Wonderful special effects and the dragon especially is really wonderful on the big screen.<br/><br/>The acting (especially of the trio) progresses even more, and by now is just...amazing. They bring out their characters, rather than, as it used to be, as a boy playing the part of Harry Potter, but as Harry Potter himself, a window into his 14 year old life (personally, I think he's lucky to be alive at 14.) <br/><br/>See this movie on the big screen if you can, it'll be better there than anywhere else.<br/><br/>Double thumbs up."
"douglascook-1","9","1","3","20 November 2005"," Why no John Williams?
","Greatly enjoyed the film but could not at first understand why the quality of the music was so poor. I assumed that John Williams had been suffering from Potter overload, so unimaginative and repetitive was the score, until eventually the credits revealed the explanation, he didn't actually write the music for this episode of the saga, although a Williams theme from previous episodes was used endlessly and, apart from moving it into a minor key, almost without variation. For me, so much of the special impact made by the screen images and action in the first three films was enhanced and intensified by Williams' magical (literally) melodies and scoring, that the lack of those vital elements in the Goblet of Fire were deeply and disappointedly missed. Does anyone know why he didn't work on this latest film?"
"WinterSorrow35","10","1","3","20 November 2005"," HP4 : Absolutely Epic
","Y'know how from the beginning of a film you KNOW its going to be great? This movie wasn't just great it was epic in the HP series.<br/><br/>The World Qudditich Cup went beyond anything I could of imagined when I read the Goblet of Fire for the 1st time. Fred & George (played by the wonderfully hilarious James & Oliver Phelps)often stole the limelight but they were in their element and deserved the additional screen time they were granted. Sprouting beards after they tried to slip their names into the goblet and tackling each other afterward. Orchestrating Bets on the Quidditch cup & the Triwizard tournament. Did anyone else noticed how hot they got or Arthur Weasely :-) But just exactly WHERE was Charlie Weasely? He's only mentioned not introduced.<br/><br/>All the Triwizard Tournament tasks are well done, realistic and in my personal opinion don't look computer generated. I loved them all in this order: Voldemort's Resurrection, the underwater rescue & the dragons.<br/><br/>The trio were fantastic. I especially liked that they included the scenes where Ron & Hermione have their heated argument (same dialogs as the book)after the Yule Ball. Its about time they brought out the sexual tension between the two. Hermione knows how she feels and Ron's too scared and in denial to admit it.<br/><br/>Now is it just me but doesn't seem like Daniel has a crush on Emma Watson? I loved the Don't Mess With US introduction of the Durmstrang crew when they entered the Great Hall. Beauxbatons girls were funny upon their arrival.<br/><br/>The maze was unsurpassable and Cedric Diggory's death left you feeling shaken and haunted. It happened too suddenly. It was heartwarming when you saw Harry's parents come shooting out of Voldemort's wand and they assisted Harry you couldn't help but feel the tears streaming down your face. Time to name the hottest guys in the movie (in NO order of course): Arthur Weasely, Fred & George Weasely, Ron is definitely getting there, Cedric wasn't bad, Neville (I was so happy for him when he took Ginny to the Yule Ball - it was cute to see him being caught practicing waltzing alone in his room in preparation for the ball)and Barty Crouch Jr.<br/><br/>Anyone who hasn't seen it you're missing out on the best movie of the year. Especially when you see Moaning Murtle scoping out Harry in the Prefect tub, joining him and checking out his assets. Mad Eye Moody impostor really held his own and grabbed your attention.<br/><br/>I HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS AGAIN NEXT WEEKEND."
"deo1954","9","1","3","20 November 2005"," Longer may have been better
","First, imagine the task of trying to fit this book into a 157 minute movie. People were chosen to condense this book into a movie with a time frame in mind. That is where I believe they were wrong. This was a great movie, however to do the book justice and give credit to the actors abilities to bring life to the story... another 30 minutes or so I believe would have given this movie the depth and strength that it needed. Leaving characters out completely and not giving more intense interactions between Ron and Harry may have just made this movie not be one of the great ones. Don't get me wrong, what there was, WAS GREAT, yet I as a fan wanted more. I am a huge fan and love the books and I truly hope that the last several movies will give this wonderful series justice."

","After watching this on its UK opening weekend, I have to say that the special effects team have done one of the best jobs I have ever seen. Its no wonder it took 18 months to tick all the boxes. The film was great although for me didn't get past an eight simply cos of the length of the film. I know to some, this represents value for money, but any film that lasts longer than it takes to fill your bladder is a definite no-no for me on the big screen, simply cos you are going to miss something and whats the point of that. Short of being dehydrated and drinking nothing for the best part of three hours you will need a bathroom break. Will be a superb film just like the others on DVD, this is cos there's a pause button at home if only there was one for the big screen lol! The bit that sticks in my mind, is during the first challenge when harry falls off his wand broom and the dragon claws its way across the castle roof, absolutely stunning graphics and a great all round film. Just don't watch it at 11pm like we did, didn't phone a taxi till 2am, a bit of a killer!"
"crazydude811","10","1","3","20 November 2005"," My views
","I thought it was the best Harry Potter movie yet. I was a little annoyed that they didn't put somethings from the book in but if they did it would be like 6 hours long!!! I thought the actors were incredible and the media saying that the actors will get too old for the rolls don't know nothing! Really enjoyed and will buy the DVD! Definitely in my top five movies of this year and my top ten of the 21st century! Love the Yule Ball and think Hermione is so hot! Think Ron the comedian is awesome too! The tasks and special effects are the best I have seen since LOTR and overall the film is excellently put together and cleverly directed! 5 Star!"
"thebeard11","10","1","3","20 November 2005"," The best Harry Potter film so far
","I watched this film last night and I was awestruck by how brilliant it was. I was worried after comments on the film that they were going to leave out a lot of the important bits of the book but I think they did the book justice. There was so much emotion in the film and not once did I think 'oh my god they have left an important part out'. They include all the teenage feelings with Harry, Ron & Hermione and the ending was the real climax of the film. I was annoyed to see that a report in a paper I read said that 'Daniel Radcliffe's acting is still as wooden as his broomstick'. That I can assure you is not true. He has grown on the films and has made the character his own. I will say that he has done a marvelous job in all of the films and especially GOF. As for Emma Watson, she is a pleasure to watch on the screen and she gets better every time you see her. Rupert Grint is another charm to this movie. His quirky comments and reactions are enjoyable to watch. I would like to see these three complete all the Harry Potter films as I do not think that the films would be the same without them. One good side is that as the actors get older and the stories get darker, it will bring more of the adults to the cinema. I'm 21 and I love reading the books and watching the films. I think JK Rowling has created a brilliant world of imagination for adults and children to enter into and the film makers have done a great job of making the films from this. My overall verdict is that this is one film that you do not want to miss. Even if you have not read the books, you will understand the film with no problem. My congrats to the cast and crew on making this spectacular, thrillingly enjoyable film."

","Harry Potter's 4th year at hogwarts is about to begin unbeknown to him this will be his hardest to date with the tri-wizard tournament coming to hogwarts where two schools visit the school and a champion is chosen to compete from each of the three schools by the goblet of fire. All three of the champions must compete in a series of magical contests each as deadly and as demanding as the next.Everything is fine until harry's name comes out of the goblet of fire as the mysterious 4th competitor at the age of 14 when the entry age is 17.Its certain that something is going on as harry competes and has the most eventful and hardest year of his life...<br/><br/>This is the best of the series so far without a doubt.I loved all of the others previous to this Harry Potter.But G.O.F is without a doubt the darkest,most exciting,most breathtaking and best directed of them all.<br/><br/>I've been keenly anticipating this since the end credits of P.O.A all the acting has been improved the trio have all matured well in their roles as Harry,Hermione & Ron(Rupert Grint- still brilliant as ever) death eaters were genuinely scary.Beauxbatons and Durmstrang entrance to the great hall was excellent although i wish that Hagrid(Robert Coltraine)had a bit more dialog as he is brilliant in all the movies.The yule ball was visually amazing.Duel with Voldemort at the end was excellent.Voldemort who was played by Ralph Fiennes was excellent and Ralph Fiennes sucked everything he could out of the character.Expect only aces in special effects and action in this 4th installment of J.k. Rowling's magnificent series of books.I give this 10/10 absolutely brilliant!!!! Go see this movie this is the best movie of 2005 along with star wars episode III and king Kong.Its true that a lot of material was cut from this book but that will always happen when someone is asked to adapt a 500 or so page book into a movie that keeps you entertained and watching.If everything from the book was put in we would be watching a sixteen hour long movie.I think the books are brilliant but the movies are different from the books its a fact so to all those die hard Potter fans who will nit pick at every detail and say its an awful movie just accept it for what it is an enjoyable,exciting,action packed adaption of a marvellous book. This is my opinion please go and watch it."

","I admit, I've only seen one of the other HP movies and have read none of the books. After seeing this movie, I'm glad I haven't wasted my time with any of the other movies/books. First of all, the filming was poor at best. Too many shots directly into the sun and hard-to-follow motion scenes distracted viewers from the pathetic plot. The story was missing crucial elements, and even though I forced myself to sleep through the second half I'm glad I couldn't understand the first part. For example, the movie starts with what you assume is a dream, and then all of a sudden six or seven people are touching a boot and flying. Why? No one really knows. The fun doesn't stop there. Moments later the city of tents is burned down by someone after a game no one bothered explaining and soon the wizards are competing in some contest with a bunch of people that haven't been introduced. C'mon, I know a little about the series, but some sort of introduction would have been nice. I award this movie no points, and may the director never find work again."
"Branoic23","9","1","3","20 November 2005"," Sometimes not knowing is better....
","I've never written a review (or anything like it), nor have I ever written a comment about a movie, so bear with me a moment. I feel I have a point to make, and it may change how you see this movie, and yes, it all depends on if you've read the books or not. I'll be honest, I only read the first book, didn't really feel an overwhelming need to read the second. Good story, good premise, just no desire. To tell you the honest truth, I am very grateful that I stopped at the first. Why? Because by reading the book, perhaps I would not have liked this movie as much as I did. You know the fans, you hear them all the time, they are not happy with the adaptation. They read the book, and are mad that a few things were left out, or this didn't get enough time, and you can't blame them. They fell in love with a story that gave precise details. What I fear has happened is that although they know the story inside and out, it has made it so they could not fully enjoy a truly masterful film. You know what I speak of, during the dragon trail, the book readers all remember what happened in the book, and it put a filter on how much they can enjoy what is on screen. It could never be done good enough. However, I did not read the book, and as I said, I am forever grateful of this. If I had, it would have taken away from the unknowingness I had going in. This movie is unbelievably tense, dark and full of poignant themes. It shows what true evil can be, it takes us back to when we were slightly younger and it lets us actually feel for the main character by ourselves. What I mean by that is, we know the characters so well, we understand them, we no longer need to have it explained. And we finally understand that by the end of this series, Harry will need to lean on those around him, because no matter how great he may be, he is nothing without those that care. I feel bad for those who come home from this picture and can't help but be disappointed. It's really not their fault; one's adaptation is another's disappointment. Yet believe me on this, this is a great film. As I put before, this is the Potter film that makes you want to see the next movie, right away. The true dark tone is finally here, the evil has finally come, and the characters are reaching the breaking point. And if you let it, this film will make you care. I don't know where the series goes from here, I didn't read the books. <br/><br/>And I wont, I wouldn't want it to ruin the next movie."
"ponyanne48","10","1","3","19 November 2005"," Wonderful
","I found this movie to use the perfect amount of darkness and lightness to set the mood. This was the funniest out of all the movies yet the comedy did not overshadow the plot. The new characters were so properly cast. It didn't follow the book as well as the others but who says it had to. Emma Watsons acting wasn't her best but hey she's only sixteen. When Cedric dies it is very tragic and almost makes you want to cry because the acting at that point by Daniel Radcliff was excellent! The only reason it is PG-13 is because the dragons might scare little kids, but honestly, tell your kids to cover their eyes and they should be fine. Overall the movie was great and I think J.K Rowling would be proud to be associated with the movie!"

","It would have been better if Dumbledore was played by Max Von Sydow, and if Fleur was played by Heather Burns. They would have done much better in the roles, as they could easily play the part the way it was written in the book. I think Max Von Sydow has the perfect speech, and look to make Dumbledore come alive. Richard Harris had it down pat, but I don't think this guy can play it right. Other than that, it was great...the guy who played Mad Eye Moody was perfect....he really brought the role to life. Also the guy who played Krum did an excellent job. The special effects were very good too. <br/><br/>I wish they would have stayed closer to the book, but I guess somethings get sacrificed due to time. I think everyone who loves Harry Potter would sit through a 4-5 hour movie. I hope they bring out extended versions on DVD like Lord of the Rings did. I would happily buy them."

I had my nine year old grandson with me and he was thrilled with it. While he hasn't read the book, he has listened to it on tape. The art work was wonderful, capturing the characters of the book the way I had already pictured them. This film's special effects are as well done as the Lord of the Ring Trilogy and the previous Potter movies. The film shows the emotional changes the three heroes go through even though every part of the book was not included in the film.I can't wait to see how the fifth book is done. If it is done with the same loving care as this and the other three films were done, it will be fantastic."

There's so much room for more. I'd of been happy if the movie'd been twice as long. Also, Fleur wasn't nearly pretty enough and her hair wasn't white. All in all it was great, funny and touching. Not for young children though, the ending especially is kind of scary and the rest of the movie has some adult themes. I kind of wish I hadn't read the book before hand, just because I'm a little biased due to how much I loved the book. At any rate, ""Mad-Eye"" Moody is still an awesome character. I can't wait for the next one! I did wish Winky and Dobby had shown back up, and that Hermoine had introduced SPEW."

","Of all the Harry Potter books, Goblet was by far my favorite. Having Enjoyed the previous 3 films I had extremely high expectations of this one. The actors had stellar performances while still maintaining a lighthearted mood at moments. The movie stays very loyal to the book and the Special effects were also some of the best I have yet seen in any film. This is clearly the best film of the 4 as my second favorite was Prisoner of Azkaban which i would give an 8, so this one is clearly an improvement on the last 3. There are still 3 more left so it is undoubted that once the 7th film is released Potter fans all over will be extremely content with the work of the actors and directors. I must say some of the movie was a little bit of for me, but I guess it is just the creative license of the crew and screenwriters."
"BJHunnicut","9","1","3","19 November 2005"," The best Harry Potter film and one of the best of the year
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best films of the year and the best Harry Potter movie. As I fan of the books, I knew I had high hopes that this movie would great despite all the changes. I was not disappointed. Newell and Kloves do an excellent job translating the 734 page novel into a two and a half hour movie. The theme, despite being the darkest yet, has some humorous parts that balance the movie well. The performances by the three young leads Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson was amazing and captured the teen angst of the movie, as were the performances of the other young actors. The adult performances were done well, especially Brenden Gleeson who was amazing as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Mad Eye Moody. As great as the performances were, the special effects are equally amazing. The three tasks and the epic climax will leave people in awe at not only how well done they are, but for fans of the book, how well they are translated. If there was one disappointment in the movie, if you could call it a disappointment, was the music. Patrick Doyle's score was good, but it was no John Williams. All in all, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an amazing movie that is a contender for best film of the year."
"Anaksunamen","8","1","3","19 November 2005"," A Different Style, I Loved it! Easily the Best so Far!!!
","I've just come from seeing Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire. I Love'd it!!! I have a few nitpicks though. Firstly, The Weasley's were cut! I was looking forward to seeing for the first time Bill and Charlie, it would at least make sense that Charlie meet Harry because of the Draggons being shipped. but no. I wished also that they had shown The Quiditch World Cup! because I think it would have added to the film. I know it would have made it longer, but who the hex cares!!! It would have been great to see some Quiditch!! I was glad the twins had more screen time in this film, they were hilarious!! I wished though, that Harry giving them the money for their joke shop had been shown, not to mention Rita Skeeter and Draco's team up was cut! I liked how this film dealt with teenage Romance, going through the motions, and it got a lot darker. The Re-birth of Voldemort was a key moment, it is one of the great moments in Cinema History I must say. I thought Ralph Fiennes was amazing and completely encompassed the character. One of my favorite parts was when Harry's parents came to him in Spirit form and spoke to him, I was waiting for that and it came out perfect! the actors were wonderful as always. I especially loved Robiie Coltrane as Hagrid, He had a little romance in this film it was so funny when he was dancing with Madame Maxine, and she was taller than him! lol Great moment! I loved Daniel, Rupert, and Hermione as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The Yule Ballwas Great! I loved seeing Viktor Krum with Hermione! They were great in this film as always. I Loved Neville!!! he was awesome and really funny! I was glad he got more screen time this is more like Nevilles movie! I also liked seeing Draco but I wish he had more screen time, this is why I liked Chamber Of Secrets more, More Draco and it was more thorough, Christopher Colombus may have been a bit boring, but at least he was thorough and there wasn't much cut out of the films, Wheather or not there would have been as much cut out of this film if he had stayed on? We will never know. However Great Story, great Special effects, great actors this is a great film in the series."

","By far this movie is one of the best of the Saga... OK... Maybe Cauron's view of HP world was a little better (3rd movie), but, Mike Newell gives this movie a great touch... the British touch.<br/><br/>This was a very hard movie just by knowing that in 2:45, the writter and director would have shorten a HUGE book (one of the biggest).<br/><br/>Although many scenes where deleted (The infirmary, the Dursleys, the game in the Quidditch world cup, the creation of SPEW...) the scenes chosen for the movie, where absolutely brilliant. The cementery was just as I imagined it would be, and when Harry returned... it was just breathtaking!!<br/><br/>The whole movie was in a much darker light all the time, even more than the 3rd one, the photography was just brilliant... <br/><br/>GREAT MOVIE! A Definitely MUST SEE!!"
"LikePink","10","1","3","19 November 2005"," Movies never compare to books, but this one came close.
","The first thing you have to remember before going to see this movie is that it will not even compare to the book. Technology, personal interpretation... whatever. It'll never be the same. That being said, of all the Potter movies this was probably my favorite. I was a little skeptical going into it, wondering how it was possible that GoF was such a long novel and here it was in a 2 1/2 hour movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't the same as the book, but as far as movies go it was amazing. The special effects, the script... they covered the basics and more. There were parts I bawled, parts I laughed so hard that I spilled my popcorn (it really was a tragedy...) and parts that are just so utterly amazing that I felt like I was there.<br/><br/>Yeah, some stuff was a little off and there were other things that could have been left out and something better put in, but all I have to say is go into this movie with an open mind and you will most definitely enjoy it."
"terihu","8","1","3","19 November 2005"," David Tennant/Griffin Dunne
","I don't know what all the complainers expected. You take a 800 page book, cram it into 154 minutes, did you really think they'd be able to get all of it in there?<br/><br/>My kids asked me why they didn't just make a couple of movies, or a mini-series, instead of trying to get it all into one feature length movie...all I could say was it's all about the money. It would've been most likely too expensive to do it right, so they did the best they could. Yeah, it's far from perfect, but if you honestly expected perfection, you haven't seen a lot of movies lately.<br/><br/>I have one burning question for all of you obsessive HP fans, though...I'm amazed no one else has mentioned it so far:<br/><br/>Barty Crouch Jr. is played by Griffin Dunne in the Pensieve courtroom scene when he is arrested and brought before his father.<br/><br/>David Tennant plays him in every other scene, including the one where he tries to sneak out of the courtroom before Karkaroff gives him up, but for some reason, they used a totally different actor in that one short sequence.<br/><br/>Anyone know why? <br/><br/>Did anyone else even noticed the change?<br/><br/>It's driving me nuts, I can't find ANY information on it on the web, and I can't imagine it's something that some trivia site hasn't picked up on already."

I was funny, scary, jaw dropping and action packed.<br/><br/>The special effects were very good. Although my friends mom had said they left a part out, though I will not specify which part :).<br/><br/>Harry has matured more, as did Hermoine and Ron, which makes a big impact on the story line itself. New characters come and go. I was also surprised to see Ron's brothers in the movie a little more.<br/><br/>I think whether you are a HP fan or not, you are bound to like this movie, I already started reading the fifth book, hope to finish before it comes out. :P"

","I like the books, the CDs and the movies - saying all that - GOF is like taking the book and thumbing through it, or listening to the CDs on fast forward - good story, but way too fast. I would swear everyone was actually speaking extremely fast even during the important scenes. There was plenty of good material for 2 movies (may be that is just too expensive? I am not here to discuss the good and bad of Hollywood)...<br/><br/>Also Michael Gambon has re-made Dumbledore his own. I am not a fan of his version but I understand the he could not do it the same way as Richard Harris (who played the part exactly as I pictured it when I read the books)...<br/><br/>All in all - definitely see the movie...better than POA if not quite up to bar with the first two."
"ctizon","10","1","3","19 November 2005"," Not only the best Harry Potter film ever made, also one of the best FILMS ever made
","Okay. To start off, I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise...I read the first three books while in the third grade and the fourth one in the fourth grade, then had to wait until the 5th book until the 6th grade. When finally the ""Half Blood Prince"" came out in the summer before eighth grade, it took three ""fateful"" (LOL!) days to read, and I was totally speechless afterwards (almost traumatized, it was so depressing).<br/><br/>Now, I have been waiting for this most recent film for a long time, hoping they didn't screw it up. It looked really good from the trailers, but I didn't think it looked very faithful at all to the actual source (novel).<br/><br/>Oh man, was I wrong!<br/><br/>It turned out to be the most faithful thus far in the entire series to have been translated from text to big screen. Yes, they did have to cut out a few of the interesting but nonetheless irrelevant subplots, but did this deter at all away from the actual score? Psh, heck no it didn't! It captured the dark and brooding atmosphere from the novel to a T, maybe a U haha. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this film, and I severely hope that the next one turns out to be this good.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>P.S.--I wasn't at all disappointed with the previous three films, but this one almost makes them look bad. :-O"
"The_Orenda","9","1","3","19 November 2005"," The best Potter yet.
","Everyone, this is the best Harry Potter yet. Everything you want, there's more of. You have to be focused to understand some of the narrative, but it all pays off. The Goblet of Fire is easily the most intense and most involving of all the films yet and I, personally, do not envy the director of the next film. What makes this film greater than the others is that Harry tackles everything in this film. From his friends, to relationships, and to his greatest fears, Harry's screwed at from all sides. I would be surprised if you, as a Harry Potter fan, did not enjoy this excellent film.<br/><br/>We begin at the Weasley's home, where Harry and his adopted family go to the World Cup of Qudditch where everyone's greatest fears are soon to be realized.<br/><br/>From the beginning, you notice this film is much more British than the rest of the series. I love how they handled the World Cup, the Tri-Wizard Tounament, the Yule Ball and the return of Harry's greatest foe. Everything is realistic and near exceptional. Excellent job on the parts of 'MadEye' Moody and Voldemort. After four films, the series has not had one let-down yet. By all means, you must watch this movie. I look forward to the next."
"lovinthishow","10","1","3","19 November 2005"," The Best Harry Potter Film by Far!!!
","As a avid Harry Potter reader, I always look forward to the seeing how the books will be adapted on the big screen. I've seen them all now and I have to say that the Goblet of Fire is definitely the best film out of all of them thus far, by far!!! Because the book is so long, the filmmakers obviously needed to leave some things out (Dobby and Winky for instance) However, the changes they made worked great with the story! The film was exciting, dramatic, and incredibly emotional. The adult actors are spectaculor, the children still need a little work, but they are getting better with age. The Yule ball is unforgettable and the Triwizard Tasks leave you dreaming that you too could get through Platform 9 3/4 hop on the Hogwarts Express enter your name in the Goblet of Fire and have the chance of eternal glory!

All the actors did great in the film, they are really starting to show their talents. The special effects are right on point, with rich details, colors, and an amazing scenery. The new director did an outstanding job, it was very much worth the wait. I only wish they would have included a few more of the details from the book to add to the story and to set it up better for the Fifth movie. I do recommend this film to everyone, although there are a few scarier part that might not be suitable for the very young."
"jrgudac","8","1","3","18 November 2005"," Not a great movie.
","I just got back, from the theater an hour ago, and I can't stop thinking about how this movie let me down. First off, let me say that from a chaste movie only stand point, this movie would appear much inferior than to someone who have read the book. It is almost a prerequisite to read the book and exercise the movie more as visual companion. There are numerous plot holes, inadequate story telling and the pacing was horrendous. <br/><br/>That brings me to the second point I would like to make, the pacing. The first 45 minutes of this movie is crammed with entirely too much information. It is as though the creators wanted to stuff as much information that was in any one of the three previous movies into that first 45 minutes. Then after what they made the first major action sequence in the film, it slows to what seems like a snails tempo. I say they made because there where numerous other parts in the book that were skimmed over. As for this period in the film, it was the most enjoyable. Much more of the story was developed and the actors themselves were furnished with a chance to shine. This built up to the second major action sequence and from this point on the movie once again moves at a rapid pace. The brake between the second and third action sequence may be 10 minutes at most. Once this is under way the movie is over quicker than it needed to be.<br/><br/>The big question I am sure everyone wants to know however is did the movie hold up to the books? It short, not at all. If you take the book and cut out all sub-plots, most of the foreshadowing for future incarnations and limit the characters outside of the major story to as little screen time as possible (many times not even that) you get what this movie turn out to be.<br/><br/>The last item I would like to bring up is cinematography. This movie, like the last, is very dark and gloomy. This works well until major action on the screen begins, and then it just becomes a blurred mess. Much of the movie's key scenes were hard to see and often it seems like the special effects were often substituted for these burred scenes of confusion.<br/><br/>In closing I know that this movie is going to have a huge backing no matter what happens in the movie. I also know that many critics have already given this movie their blessing. That being said, as a Harry Potter fan (both of all six books and the first and third movies) I will state this is not a great movie. It should have been broken into two separate movies and given the proper amount of screen time to present this narrative.<br/><br/>(Also note that this is NOT a movie for young children, parents should heed the PG-13 rating.)"
"gumer86","10","1","3","18 November 2005"," Bravo Mike Newell
","I give credit to both Alfonso Cuaron and Chris Columbus because what they did helped build the story. Best movie yet. Personally this is my favorite book of all the series and obviously some of it had to be cut out. I think that Mike Newell did an exceptionally good job. He cut off parts of the book but made it so that it would be understandable for people who have not read the book. I loved the movie. Very sad, yes, but that's Harry's life in general. Its the first time a movie gets me as emotionally involved as Goblet did. Ever since it started until it ended.<br/><br/>For those of you that have not read the 5th and 6th book and thought this movie was sad, get ready...<br/><br/>Good Luck David Yates..."

","Hmm, normally I do not write reviews of movies but once in a while I feel that I need to comment on movies.<br/><br/>Luckily I am at this moment in a country where they started showing movie 4 today!<br/><br/>If you are a fantasy freak you know the feeling of a book series. They start great and get you hooked, then as time progresses and the books continue the story gets dragged out in order for the writer or publisher to get more money. This is the case with Harry Potter both the books and the movies. <br/><br/>My opinion is that the first movie was quite nice, the second a bit less, the third I won't talk about it and the fourth, well you have to see for yourself but I think that it is a bit less than its predecessors. Unfortunately you keep on reading since you have to know how the story ends, do you?<br/><br/>This is part first of all because of directing and acting (we've done this before) and part of the story. Of course not everything in the book can be filmed that is not possible from a cost/revenue perspective. So corners need to be cut. Second the books themselves, as admitted by the writer herself some material got moved around the books which makes them less interesting as they progress (especially the last book which looks less like a story than something to tie loose ends with). This has its influence on the film.<br/><br/>I give it a 6 out of ten. The movie is OK if you have nothing better to do otherwise there are better movies out there, try firefly for example. I suspect that with the imminent release of King Kong the studio decided to make some quick bucks since I believe that when Mr. Jackson's latest effort comes out, Harry Potter and Co. do not stand a chance."
"The_Blu_Ray_Penguin","5","1","3","18 November 2005"," What is going on with these movies?
","Meh, these movies just don't do it for me, nor the older kids I took to see it. I sure have tried and wanted to like them, each and every time. But one viewing and I'm barely staying awake. I mean there are a few cute scenes here and there but nothing terribly outstanding. Nobody will look back in 50 years and say ""wow that was excellent writing and film-making"" unlike Lord Of The Rings trilogy or the early Star Wars movies. But just my opinion, and a few I went with. For the young kids though, probably a good time I'm sure. Just too scattered, rushed at times and slow at others. Pacing is off for sure. Overrated reading, and Definitely overrated films I think. Could of used a 20+ minute time cut for pace reasons as well. But it's all a matter of opinion. Peace 'n chicken grease."
"Sparrowmaniac","9","1","3","18 November 2005"," HP Books finally come alive through the movies...
","Goblet Of Fire, the fourth movie of the ongoing Harry Potter series is finally a movie that the hardcore fans of the books would appreciate. It has been a mammoth task for Mike Newell and his crew to put together a 500 page book into a 2.5 hrs long movie. And he performed the task admirably. Whereas the first movie, was pretty good, the second disastrous, the third being a good once but kept the hardcore book fans wanting for more, this one would surely fulfill everyone's needs. All the important parts including some well invited comic relief is included.<br/><br/>This movie is likewise, the third, where it is set in a much serious tone. Plus, it is much dark and for the first time we see Lord Voldemort, the nemesis of Harry Potter. It sets off just like in the books, and Mike Newell very subtly clips some unnecessary portions of the books. Although the hardest of the hardcore fans may complain that the quidditch World Cup could have lingered a bit more, but for your information fellas, the quidditch world cup was cut from the original script, just because it caused a massive uproar, Steve Kloves decided to put it in for a few minutes. Also the maze wasn't quite up to the mark, there wasn't any fanciful/dangerous creatures that Dumbledore (Gambon) warns the champions about.<br/><br/>The special effects is state of the art, so is the camera direction. As I stated previously, the acting is way better, particularly because it is a much mature movie, now that all the guys are 16. The music, and score was good, but frankly Harry potter scores aren't the same without John Williams.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10, a must see for all Potter fans..."
"mark-1452","10","1","3","18 November 2005"," 'The Empire Strikes Back' of the Harry Potter world
","I went to the cinema, a bit wary about seeing this movie.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of the first and second movies, and being so utterly disappointed with the third (yeah it was dark, but so disjointed!), forcing me to go and actually read all the books (you should never have to read a book to understand the movie!).<br/><br/>Anyway, I needn't have worried, the movie was awesome, yeah, on the plus side we could go on about the stunning special effects, the fast paced, but easy to follow story (very little of the movie left any questions to be answered). On the minus side, we could go on about what was left out of the book. From my point of view, a lot needed to be left out. Although the core story in the book was excellent, it was fleshed out with tons of 'crap' (sorry JKR).<br/><br/>But, in actual fact, what you need to know is that it is dark, occasionally scary, very exciting, fast paced and often funny, and comes to a satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is actually the interaction with all the supporting characters, with each other, and with Harry. The Weasley twins are easily the most entertaining, Harrys strained relationship with Ron, Hermiones strained relationship with Ron, and so much more... This was probably my main problem with Azkaban, it really did ignore the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>There are many scene stealing moments from Mad-Eye Moody, especially when he has a go at Draco.<br/><br/>I think the oddest part of the whole movie is how 'open' Dumbledore has suddenly seemed to become with Harry. I might have to look at the books again, but certainly, in the previous movies, he seemed more mysterious.<br/><br/>There are so many moments in this movie that similar to 'The Empire Strikes Back'. This is no bad thing, and I am not going into it, if you know the movie, you will see what I am on about. Suffice to say, by the end of both movies, you are shocked at how the good-guys have ended up, and leaves you yearning to see what happens next.<br/><br/>This movie is an all-round winner, though, if you take some younger children to see it, prepare to leave early, there are some moments that they might find truly terrifying!"
"emcfluff","10","1","3","17 November 2005"," wow, well worth the wait
","Wow! In my opinion its the best Harry Potter film so far. Its funny, well written and all the actors were very good. Mad Eye Moody was brilliant in the film. The eye was very well done (i was expecting it to be poor). Michael Gambon gave a good performance as Dumbledore (again i was expecting him to be awful). The Yule Ball was brilliant, everyone was really pretty & handsome in their dress robes. Rupert Grint played Ron Weasley to perfection and was really funny. The maze was very eerie and so was the 2nd task. Ralph Fiennes was superb as Voldemort and his appearance was very similar to what i imagined it would be. Very creepy, pretty scary too, (i wouldn't want to meet him alone on a dark night). I'm glad that his appearance wasn't spoilt in all the hype before the film. The music for the film was excellent too and really made the film.<br/><br/>I would have gave it 10 out of 10 but there was a few minor things that prevented me from doing so. I thought the film was very rushed and could have been made longer. Certain scenes could of been explained better although if you haven't read the book you would understand it no problem. I would've liked to seen more of Sirius Black too as he was only in one scene and i like his character.<br/><br/>Apart from the few minor faults it is a brilliant film which i recommend for everybody to watch. Don't be prejudice because its a Harry Potter film, give it a chance. Again, wow!"
"jadedseed","7","1","3","16 November 2005"," just not the same
","I suppose it's my own fault for not liking this movie. It's not an awful movie, just diverts from the authentic story line way too often, deleting completely those little clues that stump you at the end after reading, leaving you wondering ""why didn't I realize that sooner."" One of Rowling's quirks that make her books so imaginative are those little details that transport you into the world of Harry Potter as a third part perspective. But this movie totally eliminated that for me.<br/><br/>So yes, if you haven't read the books, you'd probably rant on about how much you loved it, how much you adore Harry, Hermione, and Ron, when in actuality, you adore Daniel, Emma, and Rupert. I'll admit I adore Rupert in his gawky portal, but probably would think he's adorable in any role, because that's the kind of person he is. What I'm trying to say it, the acting is flat the innocent romance that J.K spent trying to develop, falls short in this movie, and is instead replaced with sexual innuendos that are not appropriate for a movie derived from a book credited ""Age Range: 9 to 12."" But instead seem to appeal to the age range of 16  60, heavily male oriented, perverts that have nothing better to do than drool over actors no where near legal age.<br/><br/>The intensity of the supposed story romance of Hermione and Ron seem to be lost in the real life attraction between Emma and Daniel. I suppose you'll have to see what I mean by this.<br/><br/>The CG seems to be lacking as well, considering the break through of recent movie blockbuster, the magical creatures seem so blatantly unreal. Not even bothering to return Dobby to form.<br/><br/>The one thing is did love in the movie was the panoramic shots of the school and its surroundings, but who wouldn't fall in love with a snow scene in a mountainous plain or a castle atop a cliff. Visually stunning backgrounds and extravagantly designed decor seem to be the only thing truly Harry Potter."

The first movie was great, the second was even better(although usually the second movie s*cks big time). The third movie did not had a lot of plot, but there was more action, it was better than the second movie.<br/><br/>For what i have seen of the forth movie, i can say that it has action, plot, mixxed up (teenage)feelings, special effects and humor. I think this movie will be one of the best for 2005.<br/><br/>The story itself is about Harry Potters 4th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, this year they will have a dangerous TriWizard Tournament where other young wizards compete against each other. Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe),Viktor Krum(Stanislav Ianevski),Fleur Delacour(Clémence Poésy)are the only one which survive the contest( although there are only 4 competitors)<br/><br/>For what i can say is ""Watch it, even if you are not a Harry Potter fan!<br/><br/>(ps: for the ppl who said that it was "" rushed"" it has to be, a hole year in just one movie is not easy, exspecialy not when you have such a big book with good stuff.)"

","An improvement over the third part. HPATGOF is more dynamic, and the humour works better. Not surprisingly, there's more excellent photography and many new gimmicks, some of which remind very much of the LOTR trilogy - Tolkien's books being an endless source of ideas for Rowling.<br/><br/>I would like to say that the lead kid trio have all grown into their roles, but I can't. While marginally better overall than in previous installments, it's only Emma Watson who has a pretty good grip on what she's doing. The kid playing Ron, though ideally cast as far as charisma and the way he looks, seems a little lost in certain scenes, while Radcliffe still cannot shake off the the blandness that is in his nature.<br/><br/>Radcliffe has been cast through some serious connections (his father is a literary agent (what a coincidence!) and his mother a casting agent (another coincidence - amazing!)). Nepotism is NOT the way to go when you're spending something in the order of a billion dollars on making seven movies based on hugely popular kiddie books. However, nowadays the masses are totally uncritical, would watch/accept ANYONE playing Harry Potter (even Paris Hilton, I guess), so from the commercial standpoint I guess it didn't really matter much. I guess in an age when even David Arquette (give me a barf-bag...) can be a star there is nothing to prevent ANY person with influential parents from stardom - no matter how limited or non-existent their talent.<br/><br/>Or maybe talent isn't really required to pass off as an average actor?<br/><br/>As for the casting of other new faces, the guy playing Viktor was a good choice, same goes for Cedric, but I wasn't sure about the French girl; she wasn't attractive enough. But then again, she DOES have a dad who is a theater director, and that as we all know (at least the ones who care) certainly can't hurt when hunting for movie stardom.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, no Thewlis and Oldman this time, but there are still Rickman, Gambon and the charming Richardson to provide for some good stuff, from the adult side of the cast.<br/><br/>If you want to have look at my Hollywood Nepotism List, with over 400 photos/entries, contact me by e-mail."

","When viewing Harry Potter, it is with three different views. There is that of the naive, 'new to the story' cinema goer, the Harry Potter fan, and the Movie Critic. Unfortunately, the movie falls short in every region-To be good, a film would require a good script, good acting, and good direction, and unfortunately the film has none of these. The condensing of the book, a far harder task this time around for the largest book thus far of the series.<br/><br/>It is clear from the first moments of the film that many things have been cut out, changed and switched, cutting out entirely any story lines including The Dursleys, House Elves, Dementors, Tri Wizard Money, School, or any of the more detailed parts of the book. The richness of world which JK Rowling prides herself on has been taken away completely, and we are instead left with a product which feels very rushed, as well as being played in a very hasty style. The quick movement on the plot is frustrating at times, and I am sure that I was not alone in wishing that there was more opportunity to linger over the quidditch world cup, or at least seeing some of the match. By the time we are half way through the movie we feel that we have had a great deal of information to take in, but no time to process it.<br/><br/>This, however, cannot be entirely the movie makers fault-After all, the movie had to be cut down to fit into one film, rather than being cut into two films, as originally planned. So we go on to the Acting. The kids, bless them, are all competent actors, and throw a great deal into the roles, however their emotions are implausible at best, almost as implausible, in fact as the idea that they are now fourteen years old. You can almost see them struggling with the fast paced screen time, and no one is given any moments to develop any real characters. You can see their faces trying to show fear/anger/joy and a whole range of other emotions.The movie is saved by Great performances by Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson,Roger Lloyd Pack, and Maggie Smith, however, again you get the feeling that they are struggling with performing their roles in such a script.<br/><br/>Finally, the direction, which shows the world in a much darker light, but does not recreate the world already created by Chris Columbus. The film suffers from the same problem as another recent book-to-film conversion, the Hitchhikers Guide to The Glaxy, another book which required serious change to accommodate all the elements. Both films seem to rely too much on the audience knowing what is going on, and move far too quickly, giving an unrealistic air of cause and effect, making the film seem more like the next scene is inevitable, not a natural event.<br/><br/>Ultimately, therefore, the film lacks the direction script, or ability to turn a good film into an adequate one, and while looks very good, and has the desired impact, too little is made of what the book is."
"artofpossibility","1","1","4","20 November 2005"," Just awful......
","I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time, especially back in the day when USA used to show late night trash movies that were so bad that they had a comical entertaining value. Unfortunately for the Goblet of Fire, it has little value at all. Yes, the special effects were nice but were really not spectacular, rather sub par actually. The movie droned on for ever and ever and ever, without a climax, without good character development, and without anything to really keep your attention. I felt like I was watching a 2 and a half hour intro(like many of us may feel when listening the full version of Metallica songs). I know a lot of people will give me evil looks for this review but please, just because it is Harry Potter, does not mean it is so great. After about the first 30 to 45 min of the movie, I probably checked my watch every 20 minutes wondering when the movie would end. So I understand if you have to see the movie because you simply have to see Harry Potter but all I can say is that you will be wasting your money for a movie that just made to my top 10 worst movies of all time list and I don't say this lightly. If you must be entertained, just stick with the book."
"jluis1984","8","1","4","19 November 2005"," Flawed, but still very good movie
","OK. I'm a Harry Potter fan, nevertheless, I'm a fan of good cinema, so unlike most of the reviews here(who are either biased pro-Harry or biased against it) I will be as merciless & objective as I can. Here we go.<br/><br/>The plot in a few words: In Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts, an important celebration will take place in his school. The Tri-Wizard Tournament, an international competition between England, France and Bulgaria in which the representatives are chosen by the Goblet of Fire. Harry is chosen as a fourth champion by unknown reasons and meanwhile he has begun to face the troubles of being a teenager, he must discover the mystery surrounding his election and the consequences of it.<br/><br/>Well, the movie keeps the dark lighting & mood used previously in the third movie. Nice touch, considering that it is here where Harry Potter's story turns darker and his troubles really begin. Nevertheless, meanwhile Alfonso Cuaron kept a fantastic(almost Burtonian) feeling in the movie, while here it's a more realistic approach. It's a good change, the kids are growing, they see the world with a different eyes, and even in the wacky world of wizards & witches, they get serious.<br/><br/>The direction is solid, Mike Newell does a great job in exploring the three main characters emotions, just like he has done in the past with romantic dramas/comedies like his famous ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" or ""Mona Lisa Smile"". He seems to be the perfect choice for this movie.<br/><br/>The bad thing is that meanwhile we get a HUGE development of the three main characters, support cast is not that lucky. New characters Fleur, Krum, and their teachers do have development, but it's limited, while old time favorites like Snape or Hagrid appears almost as cameos. Maybe this is a flaw in the development of the script, but we have to consider that they had a hard time adapting it to the screen.<br/><br/>I have always thought that Daniel Radcliffe was the worst actor in the previous movies, nevertheless, he shows an advance here and manages to put a performance that shows more promise than his acting in the previous movies. Rupert Grin displays his increasing talent for comedy, but it's miss Emma Watson who steals the movie. Every scene she is in it's pure gold. I see a bright future for this young actress. Her acting is a tour de force that shows how she has improved as an actress, she is ready for different roles.<br/><br/>The SFX are awesome most of the time. The movie has probably the best art-direction of the series and has a good pace. Edition, something that most fans have complained, does a great work making an enjoyable film by keeping a good rhythm.<br/><br/>In the end it is a very enjoyable experience by both fans of the movies, fans of the books, and the casual movie-goer. After the third movie, this is probably the best of the series.<br/><br/>Solid 8/10. Very recommended."
"lil_munchkin_gurl","8","1","4","19 November 2005"," Very good, but yet a little disappointing
","I saw the movie today and I was a little disappointed. They left out so many good parts and left out some characters in the story. I also think they should have exceeded the scenes when Cedric dies. I'm usually always crying when somebody dies, and I thought for sure I would be bawling when Cedric dies, but I didn't. He died within a second, and that was basically the end of that. It was a very good movie and all, love the special effects, but I think it could have been better. I also think they should have more scenes with Malfoy in it. In the past three movies he's shown up a lot, but in this one he only had around three scenes! And what happened to Sirius and Buckbeak? They should have taken the scene with Sirius in the fire out because it doesn't really fit in there. I know it's hard to fit everything in a movie, but they should have arranged it better. Now on the positive side, the dragon scene and the underwater scene and the maze scene was awesome. The maze part was a little freaky, had made me jump a few times. I love how they also did the dragon part. I also think it was hilarious when Madame Maxine and Hagrid were dancing at the Yule Ball, very funny. Over all, I would give it 8 out of 10 stars."

Well I didn't the two and a half hours went very quickly.<br/><br/>I read the books last year when ill and have been listening to the Stephen Fry audiobooks this year, so you do notice the holes where the book takes you further into the story. Some bits that I was hoping to be included were not, but I guess they had to make cuts or I still would of been in there watching the film hours later. With any luck the DVD will be extended.<br/><br/>Fantastic special effects the boom ride with the dragon was fantastic.

"rotcmaverick","8","1","4","18 November 2005"," The best so far
","Well, courtesy of Bayer I got to see the latest adaptation of the incredibly popular (and dare I say trendy) series by J.K. Rowling a few hours before its official release. Screenwriter Steve Kloves as well as director Mike Newell and producer David Heyman certainly had their work cut out for them condensing this 700-plus page book into 150 minutes, and they delivered marvelously.<br/><br/>**WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD** <br/><br/>From the opening moments, it is easy to tell that this film is indeed, as the lovely and talented Emma Watson put it, ""Bang, bang, bang, adventure to next adventure."" From the time know-it-all Hermione Granger (Watson) wakes up her best mates Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) to the time the Quidditch World Cup campsite is burned down, about 5 minutes has passed. We then follow, in rapid succession, the announcement of the Tri-Wizard Tournament (of which Harry gets his name mysteriously submitted), the fall-out between him and Ron, a lesson with Mad-Eye Moody, the first task (which has a twist not seen in the book), the make-up scene, and before you know it, Hermione is coming down looking stunningly beautiful for the Yule Ball. We then shoot into a rather suggestive scene where we see a topless Harry being hit on by Moaning Myrtle, the second task, Harry and Snape loathing each other, and finally into the third task and the Graveyard scene.<br/><br/>This is where Dan truly shines as an actor. His emotional performance with being tortured and watching a classmate murdered, and seeing his arch-nemesis being re-born, is a drastic improvement from the dismal ""HE WAS THEIR FRIEND!!"" in the third movie. As for the big V... well, the special effects on him are rather noticeable, cheapening the evil that he represents. However, Ralph Fiennes more than compensates for this by his outstanding talent. Him torturing Harry at a single touch makes you shiver in terror, and it is this scene that gives the movie it's PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>As for the others, Grint puts up a convincing performance (his murderous look when Harry is selected is very scary indeed), and Watson herself makes a real effort, however due to the quirkiness of the script her character is very forced. This movie also shows how well the three (especially Dan and Emma) get along with each other. Michael Gambon leaves much to be desired, however, and Alan Rickman's performance does not fit the unkindly Professor Snape very well at all. David Tennant will have you thinking he is a mad-man, and Brendan Gleeson hints that he is a little too evil for a dark-wizard catcher. Miranda Richardson is your quintessential tabloid reporter, although her character is not well-defined as it is in the books.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is worth your money, however those not familiar with the books might consider reading at least the 700-some-odd pages that is Goblet of Fire, otherwise you will be very confused at times. Consider it a companion piece.<br/><br/>Overall: 8/10"
"maybe_ed_should_drive","9","1","4","12 November 2005"," Great Film, best yet!
","Well I must say I was really impressed. I'm really loving the fact that the movies all but two, were done by different directors. It makes everything feel so fresh because every director has a different way of looking and seeing things.<br/><br/>the port key to the tournament was really well done, everyone grabbed the boot and was warped up and it looked awesome Quwitdich cup was good, but not enough qwitdich at all! The death eaters were creepy, and had really tall pointy hats on which was cool the ""dark Mark"" was kind of lame, it was like a skull with this snake growing out of it and a big cloud.. and they changed it and made Barty Crouch Jr. let off the dark mark instead of Luscious Malfoy... they totally left the other house elf out... because she was supposed to have stolen harry potters wand to let off the mark so they thought harry had let it off... but that didn't happen Fred and George played a much bigger part then usual in the movie and I LOVED it... the script really let their characters show through more, and had them selling their tricks at all the tri-wizard tournament games. They were hilarious and it was awesome.<br/><br/>another interesting part of ""upping"" a character was Neville, the movie totally expanded on the fact that he was really great at Herbology. And instead of DOBBY giving Harry the Gillyweed for the 2nd challenge it was Neville who found it out and gave it to him. But I liked that to because I know it's building up towards other things that are going to happen in the book and....<br/><br/>****Book 6 spoiler if you haven't read it don't read*** I guess J. K Rowling and the director wanted to show the importance of Neville more NOW so that when they reach that movie the fact that Neville and Harry are connected and that either one of them could have become the 'chosen one' in the prophesy won't be as weird...<br/><br/>******************************* there was no kiss!!! and I thought there would be, but some really cute tension between Ron and Herminone.... who by the way looked stunning at the Yue ball! Cho Chang.... randomly IRISH?!?! what!! I mean still Chinese, but with a harsh Irish Accent No Oliver Wood makes me Sad.. :( Fleur, and Krum hardly spoke in the movie at all, i think Krum had like 3 lines, and so did Fleur, I would have liked them to talk more.<br/><br/>The CGI was actually GOOD in this movie, which made me happy... cuz god the CGI has been pretty terrible in the series (see back to the first harry potter and the mountain troll) the final challenge was kind of disappointing. No riddles or anything, just the forest attacking, and krum going crazy.<br/><br/>OK resurrection of Voldermort... it was creepy and when Cedric Died it was really sad.... Voldermort looked really funny... he really reminded me of a monk or something. He didn't seem scary enough. When Harry and Voldermort battle and their wands clash it is AMAZING, when all the ghosts come out and Harry sees his parents and they talk to him it made me cry, it was a really nice scene...<br/><br/>Harry coming back with Cedric after escaping was also really good, you can see how Danille Radcliffe has improved his acting GREATLY since the first film... he was crying over Cedric's body and then Cedrir's dad came over, and it was pretty emotional....<br/><br/>ummm.......... Fluer wasn't hot enough in my opinion, and they never mentioned she was half-harpy.... maybe that's why.<br/><br/>OH and RITA SKEETER!!.. OK REALLY good casting, she did an AWESOME job.. but they only really mentioned that she was writing annoying stories twice, and they never said she was an Anitmagus, or that she was really THAT sneaky and got information by turning into a bug... which was sad... but she was pretty sleazy and there is a hilarious scene with her and Harry in a broom cupboard....<br/><br/>I can't think of much else that was changed right now but all in all it was really good! Again... so everyone should go see it next week!!"
"DICK STEEL","9","2","13","16 November 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
","Just to get it straight, I have not read a single line in a Harry Potter Book. Not that I don't want to, but because I don't have the time. Probably when I finally watched all the movies would I consider and find time to read what JK Rowling had originally intended. So, at least you know that my review is solely based on the cinematic franchise.<br/><br/>And I'm glad to say that this movie had lived up to its hype of being darker and more adult. Gone are the muggles (hardly see any now) which opened each HP movie before (with added comedy, now thrown out), and you're plunged straight into the thick of action with the Quidditch World Cup. Which turns into a massacre of sorts, signaling the inevitable of the evil Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>Not that the muggles are left out on purpose, but if you had taken a look at this book's length, it's no surprise that unnecessary subplots need not get translated to screen. Stick with the main plot, and trim it down to a more palatable 2hr 45min movie. But with so much going on screen, you will hardly realize the length of time in which you butt is on a cinema seat.<br/><br/>So what's the main plot you say? It's the Tri-Wizards tournament, a potentially deadly series of 3 games which pit the skills of the wizards from 3 schools against each other. The winner will be crowned with eternal glory. But something seemed strange when Harry Potter somehow got nominated by the Goblet of Fire to participate, thus bringing the number of contestants to 4, and breaking the age limit set in this tournament. As usual, there is always a major mystery that runs throughout the movie - the motive behind his nomination and taking part in the Tri-Wizards tournament, which gets solved in the end with the introduction of a twist (which may not be a twist for those who've read the books).<br/><br/>So while Harry is surprised and becomes the reluctant hero, he has to grapple with first loves and crushes, while trying to convince best friend Ron that it wasn't his intention to gain eternal glory and therefore rigged his nomination for the tournament.<br/><br/>Great care is given to make the tournament come alive with its special effects, and to that, it's faultless. While we didn't see the other dragons in action, the Hungarian species (no dragons were harmed in the making of this movie, says the end credits) which challenged Potter could be one of the best action sequences in Goblet of Fire. However, with the intense focus on this, something's gotta give way, and sadly, it's the relationship between Harry, Ron and Hermione. Not that they don't get to interact, but the camaraderie and the bickering these folks endeared themselves to are somehow sorely missed. Goblet of Fire seemed more like a one-man show (Harry Potter's), while the other two become peripheral characters. Quite a pity.<br/><br/>But the actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint still delivered, and with them growing up in real time, adds a dimension of maturity to the cult characters they play. So much is said about Radcliffe's half nude scene (with a character from a past movie), and of Cho Chang, but what probably iced the cake was Ralph Fiennes' appearance as Lord Voldemort. One word - chilling! One scene did irk me though, and that is the careless editing at the prom/ball scene. One minute Harry and Ron were sulking at the table, with Hermione obviously in cloud nine with the company of Viktor Krum, the next minute they're bickering and she's crying. While I know what they are trying to get at, and hint at a possible jealousy between Ron and Hermione, the editing was poorly done and was just jarring, disrupting the pace and flow. I didn't figure why they would want to scrimp on that scene, what's a few minutes more in a long movie, or they could take it out altogether.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I dare say this is the best Harry Potter movie to date, though some would disagree with my opinion that the movies have seemed to better itself with each sequel. Bring on the Order of the Phoenix!"
"funkyfry","5","1","5","5 December 2005"," Ho-hum Harry returns series to previous tedium
","After a brief respite of cinematic respectability with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", the Harry Potter series is back squarely in the well-traversed realm of pointless over-the-top special effects and achingly obvious character development. The third film in the series had lifted it from the drek, had made something special out of this series. I have to admit I have not read the books, I don't know if the quality of the books follows the quality of the films in any way. But I do think with this story, ""Goblet of Fire"" could have been much better, more substantial in some ways. For instance, it doesn't seem to know what to do with Ron and Hermione. They pop up every once in a while mainly as distractions to Harry's quest. There is a too lengthy sequence involving a ball-room dance (yes, there really is) and then we don't see them for what seems like a half hour.<br/><br/>Fiennes' sorcerer is a bit under-whelming. I kept waiting for the makeup transformation to finish, couldn't believe that was their final concept. He plays it straight evil, which means there's not much to grab onto here.<br/><br/>I heard that the same director is working on the 5th film. That would be a mistake. This film's magic feels decidedly.... unmagical. It feels like one special effects shot after another. They don't even capture the magic as well as Chris Columbus' stale Christmas dinner sequence in the first film, for bog's sake. Every time they went to do one of their challenges, I thought it was a final boss in a video game. Too much frenetic effects, not enough feeling behind it.<br/><br/>For all of that, it was watchable, and probably will delight the hardcore Harry Potter fan-base. But for those of us who are dragged to the films by our children or significant others, this film does not offer up the kind of unexpected joys that the third film did. For fans only IMHO."

","At last! Now I know where to tell smug people to go when they moan about adults reading the Harry Potter series: the cinema! After the beautifully made third movie, I didn't think this one would live up to expectation. The trailer looked like it was stuffed with too many large scale, numbing effects; I thought that the warm, intimate feeling of the third film would be lost. But how wrong I was. I never thought I'd say it, but this film was even better than Alfonso Cuaron's. <br/><br/>The director, Mike Newell apparently said beforehand that that he was to shoot it like an adults' thriller. Harry Potter is no longer children's make-believe. It is a full throttle scary film. Key to this new found depth is the fact that Lord Voldemort is actually scary in this film! I was never that convinced by the scariness of He-Who-Shouldn't-Be-Named in the books (Sorry JK Rowling). But this film plunges to hidden depths of darkness, bringing JK Rowling's forth book to life magnificently. I was dumbfounded at the end of the experience and just thought ""it's fantastic!"" and it's very rare for one to watch a film without finding something to criticise."

After what I considered a bad choice of direction in the third movie, HP4 bounced back with amazing graphics, sound, acting talent. Though some scenes moved faster than they probably should have, this movie stuck to the books, which as a Harry Potter buff, was exciting to me. The shot in every scene were extremely well done and I won't lie; I nearly cried in the end when Wormtail killed Cedric. The movie somehow managed to keep me on the edge of my seat even though I read the book and knew who lived and who died. The movie was absolutely amazing, and I never want this series to end."
"Pods_Mouse","3","1","5","18 November 2005"," By itself: Great. Part of a series: Bad
","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire""...yeah, right. I don't know if it was mistake on Rowling's part (I didn't read the book) or if it was the makers of the movie that botched this one up, but I was all excited about going to the midnight showing of this...I left very disappointed. I actually wanted to leave after the first half hour...I was bored - BORED! With Harry Potter! I LOVE Harry Potter, and this one was awful in comparison to the other three. I went to this movie with the expectation of being mystified and taken aback by the wondrous magical things in this world in which everyone, child or adult, likes to get sucked into for a couple hours and pretend that they are a part of. It's such a fantastical world. Well, the only magical thing in this movie is that they had their wands out a couple of times, I think. That was about it. Everything else was just the magic of the bad evil powers coming after them...no mysticism or awe to it...just the bad guys around every turn. In short, it was an action movie - sexual innuendos included - with a slight magical twist.<br/><br/>Voldemort...where do I begin? Is it just me, or should one NOT do something so crass as to completely resolve and reveal all about the underling thread to the series in the middle...we've got four more to go, kids...and here, half-way through, is Voldemort in the flesh with it completely revealed what he looks like, who his followers were/are, where Tom Riddle's grave is...etc. So, I think I can pretty much guess what's going to happen in the fifth one...I'll bet it's anything BUT Voldemort trying to kill Harry...yup. Wow...that's a mystery, I must say. Since they ENDED the movie like everything was just fine 'n' dandy, what with Voldemort OFFICIALLY on the loose now and all, was - pardon my word, but - retarded.<br/><br/>Now, I hadn't read the book, and I've seen where other people have said that not reading the book and seeing this movie will make you completely lost...they're right! Good thing my husband had read it, because I had to lean over every 10 seconds and whisper, ""What's going on?"" They give names on things, and don't explain them...the beginning - where the heck where they??? Very bad form.<br/><br/>The sexual innuendos...they do NOT belong in something that is children's book-based. Again, I don't know if Rowling is to blame, or the money-hungry movie makers trying to get more guys in to see the film with all the tit for tat in this one...but I'm only 21 and I was offended. I can just see it now...an eight year old girl sitting next to her mother at this movie, ""Mommy? Why is Harry moving the bubbles around in the tub? What's he trying to keep Myrtle from seeing? Why's he doing that? What's he hiding?"" Yeah...that's real good there...a reference to Harry Potter's penis...just wonderful. And I absolutely LOVED the orgasmic entrance of the...whatever the heck they were called...the girls in the blue things. Just wonderful. Why did the focus go completely off of the main characters and onto these sex-objects? Isn't that kind of a mundane thing, yet they put it into a ""magical"" story? Terrible.<br/><br/>Where was Malfoy??? The only time I remember seeing him was when the guy with the weird eyeball turned him into a ferret...which wasn't even that funny. A cute little ferret...what a horrible punishment for being mouthy! I love Malfoy, and I was very disappointed to see him basically left out of this film, only to be replaced by a skinny, foreign blond that was put there clearly only to get a ""rise"" out of the now 15-year old boys that have been fans of Harry Potter since the get-go. I just can't wait until the 8th one...what is there going to be...a sex scene? I wouldn't doubt it.<br/><br/>On it's own, maybe it could pass for a decent movie...but trying to link it to the other three marvelous films...no way. There is absolutely no connection whatsoever. Terrible."

Ralph Finnes is perfect for the Role of Voldemort. The movie is also much more grown up than the other 3 Movies. This is my favorite Harry Potter movie Yet. Some fans may be disappointed for how fast it rushes through the story-line but the redeeming qualities are the amount of work they put in to the entire film. This film also is more comical and has more joke than the other movies. Prepare to be sitting for a long time because of the length of the movie. Other than that I highly recommend going to see this movie!"
"bob the moo","Null","1","6","19 April 2006"," Enjoyably dark entry in the series that counteracts the long running time with a good (and consistent) pace and exciting set pieces
","Despite strange and violent appearances during the Quidditch World Cup, Hogwarths are selected to host the Legendary Triwizard Tournament. Three representatives are to be selected from the magical goblet of fire, but students under the age of 17 are barred from being put forward. So three are picked but a fourth name is brought out of the cup  that of Harry Potter. Claiming he never put it in or even wanted to take part, Harry is told that rules are rules and that he must take part in the dangerous tasks. Meanwhile, aside from the tasks, a dark force continues to grow around Hogwarths; one that has a Having quite enjoyed the darker tone of the last film, I did want to take a look at this one despite not caring about the books or being that impressed with the film series in truth. However, due to my experience in the cinema last time (what idiots think that 4 year old kids will be able to sit still in a cinema for almost 3 hours?) I decided to get it on video this time. Although I was a bit unsure as to the relevance of the opening Quidditch scene (it just seemed to jump right into it then move on) it did mark the start to what was an enjoyably dark film with a good pace and enough substance to hold my interest. The story is a rather long winded way of getting us closer to the conclusion of the story and, I suppose, looking back on the narrative it does play like just a load of set pieces with the elephant constantly stood in the dark corner of the room. That said though, the script has enough to it to be more than just a load of noise, with sufficient story in it to stand as a solid tale as well as a link in a series.<br/><br/>The dark tone will be too much for some younger viewers, although personally I don't think a bit of darkness will hurt them in the longterm. However my advice would be to not take a young child to the cinema  you'll spoil it for everyone else. The effects are impressive without being the whole show  in other words, during the dragon scene I was into the excitement of the scene rather than just staring at the effects. Newell's direction is part of this as he gives the whole film a feeling of foreboding doom, a feeling greatly helped by the grim but attractive cinematography and wonderful attention to detail in sets and costumes.<br/><br/>The cast is full of famous faces but it feels a bit more focused than earlier films. Radcliffe is good value for the vast majority of the film and it is only really when the script asks him to dig deeper that he is exposed and found wanting (you'll know the scene I mean). Grint and Watson have a bit more to them than in the last films  still very much support characters but interesting in their own rights. Gleeson makes a menacing addition to the cast and hams it up just enough without doing it too much. Tennant is good in a side role, although he is a bit hard to view with the Dr Who hindsight. The rest of the cast all turn in good performances in very small parts without making the film feel cluttered (although it is hard to always accept that some famous people do very little). Rickman is a case in point but he is a nice presence, as are Williams, Sykes (!), Spall, Coltrane, Gambon, Davis, de la Tour (!), Smith, Oldman and a few others.<br/><br/>Overall then, this is an enjoyable film that benefits from a solid story, dark and mean content and generally good performances. It probably isn't suitable for the same age group that the first films were, but it is a better all round film for it. Hopefully the later films can keep this dark, mean tone while continuing to deepen and strength the story and characters."

","""Goblet of Fire"" is my favorite of the Harry Potter books, so I was particularly looking forward to this movie. It did not disappoint.<br/><br/>The main reason why I like ""Goblet"" is that it kicks the major storyline - the second coming of Lord Voldemort - into high gear. No longer is the Dark Lord a bogeyman villain, hiding in the shadows and merely threatening to return. Here, we get to see him in all his malevolent glory. Ralph Fiennes plays him in a suitably suave, sadistic and extremely memorable fashion. His resurrection is, as I expected, a great scene, and it's also genuinely scary.<br/><br/>Equally exciting are the dragon duel and the underwater sequence, both of which are beautifully realized on the big screen. Unlike the previous Harry Potter films, ""Goblet of Fire"" boasts blockbuster-level spectacle; the special effects, for the first time, are epic and amazing instead of merely lovely and quirky. The trademark Harry Potter quirkiness is still present in this movie, of course, but it's blended very smoothly with big-time action and arresting imagery. In other words, it looks cool.<br/><br/>Of course, the book's plot has been edited down somewhat here, and I see a lot of users on this site are bugging out about that. I understand that, if you love the source material, it's hard to see it chopped down so much. But that's what adaptation is all about, folks. A film is not - can never be - a book. Movies are, by their very nature, shorter. Material must be excised. In this case, I think screenwriter Steve Kloves did a good job. He cut out quirky little subplots, like the house elf business, because they weren't necessary to the main action, and because they'd pad out the movie to a heinous length. To be honest, I didn't miss anything he removed. All the essential stuff is retained.<br/><br/>One day, maybe, a forty-hour Harry Potter miniseries will be filmed that'll cover every last event in the books. Until then, I'm fine with the edited-down movies.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm ecstatic about the movies. The casting continues to be great, with some fun new faces joining the already-awesome series regulars. The seemingly ageless Miranda Richardson does well, with just a few scenes, as the oily reporter Rita Skeeter, and new Doctor Who David Tennant is gloriously OTT as the panting lunatic Barty Crouch Jr. And finally, the semi-new Albus Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, really gets a chance to shine. I've heard some criticism of his performance, which really mystifies me, since I think he captures both the whimsy and the gravity of the character perfectly. He's like a scatterbrained Merlin in wizard pyjamas with bread-twisties in his beard - what's not to love?<br/><br/>Another newcomer to the series, director Mike Newell, also acquits himself well. I've enjoyed Newell's work for years - particularly ""Enchanted April,"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" and the sublime ""Donnie Brasco,"" all of which are great films in very different genres. Here, he successfully tackles the fantasy genre, striking a nice balance between Chris Columbus' nuts-and-bolts directing style and the arty-farty (but really quite superb) work of Alfonso Cuaron.<br/><br/>Newell proves particularly adept at romance scenes. There's definitely a strong scent of hormones about this movie, but thankfully the teenage angst never gets too overwhelming. The scene when Moaning Myrtle tries to sneak a look at Harry in the bathtub is very strangely sexy. It works.<br/><br/>Speaking of Harry, Radcliffe gives his best performance here. He's turning out to be a good actor. <br/><br/>All I can say is...bring on the next one. I'm game."
"jboothmillard","8","1","7","12 December 2005"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
","This was the first Harry Potter film to be rated 12, it is certainly much darker than the previous three films as well, so the adults will be just as captivated as the younger audience members. Basically the fourth year at Hogwarts is going to start, but before this Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson), and the rest of the Weasley family, go to the Quidditch World Cup, but of course Harry is not safe there as dark forces are nearby. When the three friends return to school, they find out that it has been chosen to hold and host the The Triwizard Tournament, a big event tournament where three magic schools compete against each other, Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. All contestants who take part must be over seventeen years old, and it is usually three names that are spewed out, chosen from all the names in the Goblet of Fire, but Harry is shocked to have been chosen as a fourth champion. Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) says he has no choice but to take part regardless of his age, facing the three difficult challenges to play, Ron thinks he wants the attention the tournament brings so refuses to talk to him. The first tasks sees the players facing a chosen fire breathing dragon in a rocky arena, and they must retrieve an egg it is protecting, this egg will also contain a clue for the next challenge. In amongst the tasks, meeting new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher Professor Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Ron knowing his jealousy was wrong and apologising to Harry, the three friends and the other three champions, including Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) and Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), attend the annual Triwizard Yule Ball held on Christmas Eve. The second task sees the players have to swim is the Black Lake to save ""something precious"" submerged under the water, Harry gets some Gillyweed to breathe and grow fins underwater, he comes second in this game. The final task sees the players have to travel through a giant hedge maze, many of the walls collapsing around them, and the person who gets to the middle has to retrieve and win the Triwizard Cup. However when Harry gets there, he encounters not just the cup, but he faces with old enemies Peter Pettigrew aka Wormtail (Timothy Spall) and Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), but also a baby creature grows into an adult Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), and kills Cedric Diggory. In the end, Harry escapes Voldermort and near death, and he is really upset to have his friend Diggory dead, and have to announce to everyone that the Dark Lord is back, so there will be dark times ahead. Also starring Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape, Dame Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, The Vicar of Dibley's Roger Lloyd-Pack as Bartemius 'Barty' Crouch, Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, David Tennant as Bartemius 'Barty' Crouch Jr., Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle, Robert Hardy as Corenlius Fudge, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Warwick Davis as Professor Filius Flitwick, Jarvis Cocker as Band Lead Singer, Adrian Rawlins as James Potter, Geraldine Somerville as Lily Potter, Eric Sykes as Frank Bryce, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley and The X Factor's Paije Richardson as DA member / extra. The acting as before is good and reliable, the story is near enough straight forward, and of course the biggest star, the special effects and action, is fantastic, I said once that this was the darkest film of the lot, I still sort of stick by that, but it is an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Art Direction, and it won the BAFTA for Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Make Up/Hair. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!"
"lalwaniamyn","6","1","7","15 November 2005"," On the book and movies
","The one major aspect about these movies is that if you do NOT read the books, you will enjoy the series. So I will comment it on these aspects. First and foremost, the acting skills of these actors have truly progressed in the years. However, the scene transitions seemed to be rushed. In the first 10 minutes, it progressed to a nightmare, to a portkey, to a one minute tournament, and then a riot, and then a completely obliterated camp, and then a train, and then hogwarts.....SLOW DOWN! Getting rid of the Dursley beginning kind of ruins the pattern we are used to. Also, the graveyard scene was much too short and these sudden transitions ruin the feel of the movies. It seems they are just pushing all the scenes together and it wasn't edited well enough. So for all this, I give the movie 7 out of 10 ON A NON-BOOK Comparison.<br/><br/>Comparing the book to the movies is like comparing Silence of the Lambs to Friday the 13th VII. I have NO idea why they aren't following the books. I mean, the script has already been made, DUH! It isn't hard to cut out the parts. Shoot, give me 10 grand and I can give you the script for the 5th and 6th book in a MONTH. They completely ruined the beginning because of one thing...NO QUIDDITCH! What were they thinking?! No house elves, NO DRUNK HOUSE ELVES?! That's the only reason I wanted to see this movie. But another major thing was the graveyard scene...How can you not SCREAM! when you cut out your own FRIGGING HAND?! And there were many MANY more death eaters. The confrontation between Cornelius Fudge and Dumbledore concerning Voldemort's return. And the maze's creatures, like the skrewts, the spider that broke Harry's leg...NEVER HAPPENED? WHY? And the maze changing suddenly. How Harry had to stop Krum from torturing Cedric and how Cedric and Harry WEREN'T beating each other up to get the cup. I can go on for paragraphs and paragraphs. Simply put, if you read the books, you will HATE this movie. From a book reading aspect, I give this movie 5 out of ten.<br/><br/>So my average is 6 out of 10. If you read the books, Don't SEE IT. If you didn't read the books, have fun."
"rbverhoef","7","1","8","30 November 2005"," Terrific, more mature, although a little rushed
","The fourth installment of the 'Harry Potter'-series is probably the most entertaining of them all for it's wall to wall action and comedy. For some this can also be a problem. The story is a little rushed. It is like a road trip where you only do the attractions on the way, but never travel from one attraction to another. Of course that is an entertaining way to do a road trip but it can be good to catch your breath from time to time, enjoy the world around you.<br/><br/>This counts especially for a world as beautifully visualized as Harry Potter's. Art direction, set decoration, costumes and visual effects are once again terrific, creating a feast for the eye. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) inhabit this world as if they have lived there their entire lives; not only the movie but also the actors are more mature. The story has grown darker with every new film and here it deserves its PG-13 rating. Death and destruction are pretty present in 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.<br/><br/>I could go into the story, which deals with a deadly tri-wizard tournament that Harry enters even though he is too young and the first real appearance of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), but it does not really matter. The story is a nice framework to show us everything in the movie, also including brilliant performances by Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Miranda Richardson as journalist Rita Skeeter and returning actors like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and a great Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.<br/><br/>'The Sorcerer's Stone' and 'The Chamber of Secrets' gave the series its magical touch, it was a little lost in 'The Prisoner of Azkaban', for me still the best, but director Alfonso Cuarón made up for that with especially the cinematography. Now we have 'The Goblet of Fire' where magical touches have changed mostly into darkness, maturity and some great action and comedy scenes. It seems to me this is the right approach to the series."
"Spike-Washington","7","1","9","10 June 2018"," The weakest of the Harry Potter films but still entertaining
","I thought the original novel to Goblet of Fire was a little underwhelming but it was still fun. That Quidditch match at the beginning of the novel seemed unnecessary and the film cut out the Dursley scenes completely. But here we get the comeback of a certain wizard and Harry's role in the battles to come. The special effects were well done and there was a lot cut out but it did its job. Some might like this better than the novel because it's more condensed. But you be the judge. As for me, I can't decide which is better; they're both good, the novel and the movie."
"stormhawk2019","5","1","12","14 August 2018"," The international terrorism arrives to Hogwarts
","One of the greatest successes of the series (a term that I think is more appropriate than Harry Potter's hackneyed and bombastic saga) is that it ""grows"" along with its potential readers. That is to say, a supposed model reader who with 10 years old read the first book in 1997, would read the last one with 20 years. And that tender infant that vibrated with the antics of Potter and his friends has grown up and has learned that in the world there is terrorism and war, love and sex, differences and injustices; therefore, one of the great merits of J. K. Rowling is that his series moves from the carelessness of childhood to increasingly mature and rugged issues.<br/><br/>For the first time in the series, in GOF the fantastic universe expands, and new cultures appear, even if they are more picturesque groups than anything else, like the Durmstrangs school from Bulgaria (and that supposedly ""comes from the north"", from the north of where ?, please, someone bought a world atlas to J.K. Rowling), dressed like Russians and rough as hell, and the Beauxbatons school from France, more corny than imagine. However, the Death Eaters, acolytes of Lord Voldemort, whose acts of unusual violence sow terror among the magician community and demand the arrival of a new world order, make their appearance. Nor are there any classic features that play so much in each episode: the laurels are here for Alastor Moody; without forgetting the ultimate attraction, Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>The film is structured around the Triwizard Tournament and the three tests that compose it; three crazy tests that Harry Potter must face to show everyone that he is a guy capable of breaking the rules to achieve his goals; three tests whose filming, editing and editing leave much to be desired. While the former has its own, it gives the feeling that the fight against the dragon was for more emotions. The second one, was so-so. But the third ... suffers from emotion on all four sides, is an overwhelming relief. Fortunately, it is the scene that precedes the resurrection of Lord Voldemort. In a spooky and ornate decor (which seems to want to show off its status as a set) Lord Voldemort finally acquires corporeal consistency and the camera does not have to fall in love with its ugliness. This scene even gets one to forget the plubbed teenage intrigues that he has been forced to witness."
"MGPT80","5","0","1","14 April 2020"," The best so far, but still deeply flawed
","There is certainly a lot to like about Goblet of Fire. The special effects are significantly better than in the previous films and the performances of the lead characters are vastly improved. Daniel Radcliffe is finally finding his feet as Harry and actually displays some genuine depth and emotion, while Rupert Grint is a lot more convincing and works well with Radcliffe and Watson. I also enjoyed the introduction of the other magic schools, which really freshened up the story by introducing many interesting new characters.<br/><br/>However, despite being over two and a half hours long, the film felt extremely rushed, with many elements of the story completely omitted. This should certainly have been extended to a double feature as for non-book readers, the storyline is extremely patchy and confusing and for Potter fanatics, the omission of important scenes is close to sacrilege. Presumably this was a result of rushing to get the film finished in time for the holiday period, which is a huge shame when working with a series as popular as this."

"HotToastyRag","6","0","2","17 June 2019"," The first of the dark ones
","So far, in the wizarding world of Hogwarts, an evil wizard has tried to kill children, an escaped convict has snuck on campus undetected, three teachers have been fired from the same position, a giant snake attacked people, and the harmless school sport has resulted in serious injuries that couldn't instantly be fixed by magic and required an extended stay in the hospital. Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire came out in theaters. Folks, if you thought the first three films were as dark as you'd like a children's movie to be, turn back now. The fourth story is very dark, and the series only gets darker from here on out.<br/><br/>Those of you who have decided to brave the fourth Harry Potter movie will be treated to a brand new event: the Tri-Wizard Tournament. In this new plot point never mentioned in the previous books or movies, two other wizarding schools from France and Russia travel to Hogwarts to compete in an enormously dangerous series of contests with hopes of taking a trophy back home. Why would anyone do that? Brave, and arguably stupid, contestants are supposed to write their names down on a piece of paper, stick it in the titular goblet, and then get selected by the goblet to be their school's one and only representative. France chooses Clémence Poésy, Russia chooses Stanislav Yanevski, and Hogwarts chooses a pre-Twilight, very handsome Robert Pattison. Of course, since this is a Harry Potter movie, the goblet spews out a fourth name and orders that Harry become a fourth contestant, even though he was too young to be allowed to put his name in. Headmaster Michael Gambon declares that they have to follow the rules and let Harry risk his life; yes, yes, the plot itself makes no sense, but if you're sitting down to watch it, you'll just have to accept that.<br/><br/>So, as Harry prepares for the contest, his fellow fourteen-year-old students all discover their hormones. The school also hosts a ball during the tournament, and as Maggie Smith brings out a record player and teaches her students how to waltz-yes, yes, this makes no sense-all the young boys and girls giggle and blush and try their very awkward hands at flirting. The moment everyone's been waiting for finally arrives, and Emma Watson gives herself a makeover. No one knew at the time she was cast four years earlier that she'd grow up to be a knock-out, but thankfully, when she makes her grand entrance, no one has to pretend to drop his jaw.<br/><br/>The new teacher this year is Brendan Gleeson, and while his very creepy appearance is unsettling, it's not nearly as unsettling as the direction the plot takes. You can tell from the nearly constant fog and dark color scheme of the film that it's going to be heavy, and even with the comic relief thrown in about the dance, it's not an uplifting movie. At the beginning, Harry attends a Quidditch game with the lovable Weasley family, but the fun is quickly cut short by a host of bad guys. The steadfast friendship between Ron and Harry gets interrupted by jealousy, and both boys spend the entire movie in dire need of a haircut. A harmless visit to Hagrid's hut winds up being a site-seeing tour of dangerous dragons, and opening what looks like a Fabergé egg results in an ear-splitting noise. Everything in this movie is far darker than it first appears to be, from the littlest details to the grand contest itself.<br/><br/>To keep you occupied during the very long movie that's sorely missing John Williams's iconic music, you'll still see all the old standbys: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Tom Felton, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Mark Williams, Warwick Davis, the new regular Michael Gambon, and a repeat appearance by Shirley Henderson. A few new faces make an appearance in this movie, Katie Leung as Harry's love interest Cho Chang, Gary Oldman, David Tennant, Timothy Spall, Miranda Richardson, and Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>One of the great things about the Harry Potter movies was that an entire generation of kids got to grow up at the same time the actors did, and when upsetting things happened, they felt better prepared to handle watching it since the actors were watching the same things. A good rule of thumb is if you're watching these movies with kids who are younger than the actors, either make them wait a year or two or give them a warning that something bad or scary is going to happen.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary scenes involving children, I'd wait until my kids were pre-teens before letting them watch it."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","9","0","1","30 April 2018"," The true transitional period of the series, this is thematically rich and visually splendid.
","Serving as a sort of transitional period both thematically and in terms of story, re-introducing the 'big bad' of the series in a big way, this darker feature doesn't pull its punches and is all the more successful for it. The score isn't as iconic in 'Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire (2005)' and not all of its emotional beats hit quite the way they're intended to (although most do). However, its interesting twists and successful set-pieces amplify the dangerous aspects of this 'wizarding world' while changing the franchise forever. It balances its tone pretty much perfectly; it's perhaps the funniest film in the franchise but it's also properly grim, even somewhat scary. Its finale, in particular, is surprisingly ballsy and emotionally affecting. As a whole, this is an enjoyable and genuinely thrilling adventure that gets properly tense, too. 9/10"

I despise the opening to the movie with the Qudditch world cup and could be much better if it was better wrote and perhaps a tad bit longer, thus replacing some scenes later on.<br/><br/>4. {SPOILERS}: The Death of Barty Crouch feels like it goes nowhere and makes you wonder how their wasn't more security and defence to stop this from happening.<br/><br/>7/10"

","After the magnificent Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire is just a horrible downgrade. Yes, the book is long and there's no way every scene would be in it, but so much has been left behind. The beginning is butchered, so is the school year. Now it seems like nothing else happened except for the Triwizard Tournament. The main characters had like one class during the entire year. They should've made the movie longer. Three hours may be a long movie, but it's better to make it long than make it seem like all this happened in few months instead of one school year. Seasons barely changed!<br/><br/>This film includes the one change everyone hates: Dumbledore was supposed to calmly ask Harry if he put his name in the goblet of fire, but for some reason Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is furious 24/7 and even violent. It makes no sense. Of course Dumbledore is quite a reckless headmaster, but with Richard Harris he seemed gentle, just the right way. If Michael Gambon can't pull of that kind of gentleness, they should've cast someone else. Everyone loved Harris, he was the perfect Dumbledore. After he died, did the people in charge of casting just think, ""Ah, f@#k it, let's choose someone completely different"". <br/><br/>One thing I like is how dark the ending is. It's a good prelude to how dark the last movies are going to be. Of course now it seems like the movies are starting to be too scary for kids. It's hard for me to watch few scenes because of how gruesome they are, so how do they except children to watch them? <br/><br/>All the charm Prisoner of Azkaban is gone.

","The next harry potter film I'm reviewing is the goblet of fire, and I really enjoyed watching this film. The premise sees harry in his fourth year at Hogwarts where he is mysteriously selected for the tri wizard tournament. Daniel Radcliffe is a little older as harry and I thought he did a really good job in this film. You see his character getting a little darker but he also keeps that innocent undertone to his character that makes him pretty relatable. Rupert grint does his best job as Ron in this film because he is given a lot more to do then just be comic relief and he does it well. Emma Watson as hermione is a little annoying in this film but that has been what her character has been like and I think she works well with the other two lead actors. Michael gambon is back as Dumbledore and I really like him as the character, I feel he brings the spectacle to the character but I also actually believe the relationship he has with harry in this film. Newcomer to the franchise Brendan gleeson plays mad eye moody and I though he was the best character in this film. He is very eccentric and unnerving to harry but you sense he wants to help him through the journey. The story has a decent twist too it with the sporting wizard challenges that I did find really interesting. However, this film does try a bit too much and I feel it would have been a bit better with a more tight simple plot and some side plots either expanded or totally forgotten about. The script has allot of great drama in it that really allows you to buy the situation that is going on. The humour is better placed in this film too and feels more natural. The style is allot darker then the previous films and I actually really like this turn and thought it added allot to the film. However, like the other harry potter films I feel like this film has pacing issues and could have done with being a bit shorter then it is. Overall I really enjoyed this film as probably my favourite so far in the franchise."

","This film eliminates a major flaw of the previous films. The narrative shouldn't be a tool to tell the Wizarding World, the Wizarding World should be there as a tool to tell the narrative of the CURRENT entry. This entry has its own, self-contained storyline; its own unique concepts are explored rather than further exploration of the bigger picture. The problem with some film series is the first film is the beginning, the next film is the middle, and the last film is the end to one story rather than being three stories with their own beginnings, middles, and ends. <br/><br/>This is not how it should be. This series started out very much the same, with ""Sorcerer's Stone"" being the exposition and ""Chamber Of Secrets"" being the beginning. Only ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" has its own beginning, middle, and end of its narrative. But still, at this point the films serve more as set-up for the future rather than their own stories.<br/><br/>""The Goblet Of Fire"" doesn't steer away from its main plot for the sake of talking about the Wizarding World. It uses elements from the rest of the Wizarding World, but only to talk about the story of THIS film. The Wizarding schools from around the world are a piece in this film's story, a complete flip of the previous entries being pieces to tell the story of the Wizarding World. <br/><br/>The only problem I have with this film is at its finale. Once they complete the Triwizard tournament, the plot of this film (being that someone once loyal to The Dark Lord has been manipulating this tournament and is hiding in the school) is interrupted to show us what is currently going on with the larger scale bad guy of Voldemort. I feel like I'm suddenly watching a different movie, not related to the narrative of the Triwizard tournament being manipulated. While this interruption has great material and is very interesting, it's a complete 180 on the focus of the plot. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie (once Harry gets back from the Graveyard) feels incomplete, as suddenly the movie shifts its focus to setting up what's going on with Voldemort for the later movies, then ends on the note of the characters wondering what they have to do next. A movie that has so far had its own beginning, middle, and end has gone back to the purpose of being just a beginning or just a middle or just an end. This movie reaches its own climax, and even its own falling action, but is stopped just short of landing its own ending and instead ends on what feels like an incomplete plot-thread. The movie goes from being its own unique entry to being just a climax in a story still yet to be complete.<br/><br/>But that doesn't change the fact the self-contained story of this film is truly wonderful, and this films rises as the Tri-Wizard Champion of the series thus-far."

","It's long gone when fourth installment of harry potter was released.

Up to a certain point in life we are brought up under protective cover. Also we are not exposed much, to blooming love at initial stages in our lives.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","2","11 March 2016"," To Date the Best in the Series
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself entered into a dangerous tournament where he's not only underage but also doesn't yet have the powers to really compete. He begins the deadly game and soon finally comes face to face with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>I was rather disappointed in the third film in the series but this fourth film manages to be the best of the series to date. I say that because I was frankly quite shocked to see how well-made and wonderfully entertaining this film was even though it clocks in at 157 minutes. The movie is visually quite exciting but it also manages to have a wonderfully entertaining story that grabs your attention and holds it throughout the running time.<br/><br/>What was so entertaining about this entry is that we're really cranking up the energy, the magic and of course the action. It's worth noting that this episode is a lot darker than previous entries, which is probably why this one was rated PG-13. There are some wonderfully creative action scenes on display including the three games that are played. There's a terrific underwater sequence that is full of imaginative charm and then there's the maze sequence, which turns into a terrific meeting with Voldemort.<br/><br/>Another thing that works extremely well are the performances with Radcliffe turning in his best performance to date. This Harry Potter is the same that we saw in previous films as there's a lot more drama and a lot more character development. Even the stuff dealing with girl issues was wonderfully done. Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Miranda Richardson and even Robert Pattinson are all good in their parts. It's Brendan Gleeson although who steals the picture with his crazy eyed Moody character. The actor really brought this role to life and added so much fun to the picture.<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is a major step up from the previous movie but also takes what made the first two so good and improves on them."
"cowmanviolin","9","0","2","29 January 2016"," Perfectly captures the shift in tone.
","In this review I'm focusing on Character Portrayal, Differences from the book, and Mood.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the books and the story, in general, is how the characters grow and deal with their adversaries as children. They experience hormones and puberty in the background behind the main story and it never has to actually be brought up--it's just subtly recognized by the audience. The actors all capture this so well--whether it's Ron and Harry dealing with emotions of jealousy and becoming interested in girls or Hermoine growing as a friend and as an individual who also starts to become interested in boys. I entirely believe all of the relationships between the characters and how they develop in this movie, even if there are glaring differences from the book.<br/><br/>Now I think we can all agree that there are many great parts left out from the book, such as Ludo Bagman, Winky, the Crouchs' full story, S.P.E.W., blast-ended skrewts, crazy wizards at the World Cup, and loads more, but what the movie chose to include they did an amazing job with. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort remains today amazingly iconic and they captured his resurrection, Priori Incantatem, and Cedric's death beautifully and painfully (much better than Deathly Hallows Pt. 2's unnecessarily drawn out ""The Flaw in the Plan"" chapter). The other thing is that unlike many other of the adaptations is that they didn't really change anything, they just left things out. What I hate is when people rewrite parts of the story that worked perfectly fine in the book for seemingly no reason. That's why I'm fine with the edits in this one--it's just cut down and not tampered with.<br/><br/>What makes this one of my favorites out of the 8 is its mood. The atmosphere created by the soundtrack and the pacing is the most unique out of any of the others. The only other 2 I found that matched its success and consistency in this regard were The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Deathly Hallows Pt. 1. I may be alone here, but I like this soundtrack in particular because of the incredibly sweet moments where the strings take over and play sweeping melodies that capture the grandeur of this installment especially in the Priori Incantantem and return from the graveyard scenes (""Death of Cedric"" track). Not to mention the Tri-Wizard Tournament motifs (Played in all Task scenes starting with ""Golden Egg"") and the Hogwarts band with it's comic relief (""Hogwarts' March).<br/><br/>By the end of the movie you've expertly experienced the subtle shift from lightness to darkness and you understand how everything really has changed for the characters. The Wizarding World is no longer going to be the beautiful, novel, safe haven it was before (Shoutout to JK Rowling for perfectly contrasting that with the fact that the international schools and Hogwarts form a bond over an amazing year and a group understanding of the tragedy behind them, the danger ahead of them, and the importance of friendship and cooperation despite differences between each other).<br/><br/>This installment really is the bridge between the light-heartedness of the first 3 and the seriousness of the last 3 and I'll always love how well it captured that."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005): Dir: Mike Newell / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robert Pattinson, Michael Gambon: Fourth film in the series regards achievement in a plot about wizard schools competing in a tournament. Although one wizard per school can compete, Potter's name is revealed to much controversy. He is the youngest to compete in a tournament that involves dragons, an underwater sea world, and an overwhelming maze. Director Mike Newell handles the material well as the third director to tackle the series. The special effects are breathtaking with flying horses, dragons, ghosts, mermaids, and other images that spark the imagination. Daniel Radcliffe returns again as Harry who undertakes perhaps his most difficult task. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger may be discovering romance. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley is given humorous moments involving a dance. Robert Pattinson is added as one of the tournament finalist who has clothes ties with Potter that lead to an electrifying climax. Michael Gambon provides the wisdom and authority of wizard Dombledore. The films exist to bring the J.K. Rowling books to life. Perhaps discernment should be given to young children before viewing its creepy atmosphere. Otherwise this is a pointless exercise in imagery is what keeps the goblet's fire burning bright.

"lesleyharris30","9","0","2","31 December 2015"," Darker than the Previous Three, Jam Packed with Suspense,
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's much more complex than the previous three were, it has a very different story that takes the characters beyond the floors of Hogwarts, the last hour of the film kept me at th edge of my seat and had more suspense than the other three films combined. Another aspect that makes it stand out is how much the characters mature and grow, we see different relationships develop between them and also some changing, the dynamics between Harry, Ron and Hermione are significantly different, they now have a more complicated friendship that they struggle to hold together, which makes the audience support them even more. The only thing I felt this movie was missing was more time for the supporting characters to shine, the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, who have been terrific in the past and still shine here, feel very underused, whenever we see them we feel as if there is more to come, but there never is, even Michael Gambon's screen time as Dumbledore felt very limited, I couldn't help but feel there was a little too much focus on Harry. As we see the characters grow we also get the same from the performances, all the actors shine even more than they did in the first three, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson truly understand their characters and deliver their roles with pure class, and are joined by a fantastic supporting cast that includes Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Timothy Spall, David Tennant and, of course, Ralph Fiennes, portraying Lord Voldermort, this series Darth Vader, for his first time, and after being teased for three films we are not one bit disappointed by the first stand off between the lead protagonist and antagonist of the series, it was a pure delight. Fun, suspenseful and very thrilling, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the finest in the series and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or fantasy film. <br/><br/>Harry Potter is surprised to be picked in a life risking tournament during his fourth year at Hogwarts. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe"

"schroeder-gustavo","8","0","3","7 August 2015"," Darker, but definitely not better
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire gets many things right, which we have come to expect from Potter films. Unfortunately, it gets many things wrong, and is the first Harry Potter film, in my opinion, that is not a masterpiece. It sounds bad, but it isn't. Not every filmmaker can achieve the highest heights in film. That said, this one is still pretty damn good.<br/><br/>The problems I have with this movie is that it feels really sappy at times, like when Harry says ""I love magic"" or when Cedric, his dad and Ron's dad land perfectly after using the portkey, just the look on their faces; other moments were Fred and George trying to be funny, and others. It's just cringe-worthy moments like that that make me a bit mad cause the movie could have been better. The dialogue feels a bit rushed at times, the pacing isn't as fast and intriguing as in the first Harry Potter movies, mainly because of the spacing in between the Tri Wizard tests. Some things that are explained in the book aren't explained at all here, like the Priori Incantatem.<br/><br/>Other than all of that, this is a very entertaining film, the effects are great and it is still, surprisingly much darker than the first three. It is a very important chapter in the Harry Potter world, I would say the most important one of the first four films, which makes it a shame for me to say that it's not nearly as good as the first three."
"jake-law123","7","0","2","2 April 2015"," Finally showing some balls in the Harry Potter franchise.
","The series is finally willing to take risks in the Harry Potter franchise. Being the first PG-13 film, I was ready to see what it was going for. With dark storytelling and crazy psychotic characters, this one definitely took a step forward in the series. <br/><br/>As the wizards of the Triwizard tournament are being chosen, Harry's name rises as one, forcing him to compete in three life or death situations to prove himself while trying to figure out who wants him dead.<br/><br/>The story is a bit more interesting because the events don't just center around Harry, Hermione, and Ron's mischief. It's an event that involves everybody in Hogwarts. We get a decent amount of backstory, but manage to stay focused on the events in the present as well. It builds up the suspicion quite well with flashbacks, dream sequences and so on.<br/><br/>All the characters have an enjoyable moment at some point. Ron and Hermione are much more supportive in this one, and their relationship even gets some decent development. Even Malfoy is pretty entertaining. Then there are characters that are just ridiculously out of the blue psychotic: Mad Eye Moody, Kakaroff, Barty Crouch Jr, and even Dumbledore has some insane moments.<br/><br/>The film is definitely trying to go deeper, and it does quite well. As the books got more intense, the movies do a good job of following along. Not saying Prisoner of Azkaban wasn't pretty thrilling, but not on this level. It's just got a dark and edgy vibe that most films did in that era. Though it followed it up well with creepy imagery and intense scenes."

","I'm watching the Harry Potter films for the first time obviously way after they came out , I have just finished watching the first four, and I thought I would give my word on this one. I have never read the books, so I'm not going to be one of those people who are just ranting on whether it was or wasn't accurate to the books. I'm just giving my opinion after watching the first three, then watching this one. Here we go, well something gigantic happens in this movie, Voldemort returns. Although this is a huge event, it felt shadowed by all the others things that happen in the movie. The tournament of the three schools and the competitions seems to take up the whole movie. Which leaves barely any time for something so huge to happen, I mean I just felt that something like that should almost have an entire movie of it own (and I know that they have to follow the books, so they can't do that but come one). I just felt that lord Voldemort's return should be a gigantic part of the story, but it just felt like it was somewhat minor. Other than that I did like this movie, and found it enjoyable. And I honestly can't wait to see the rest in the coming days."
"msloane1","8","0","1","8 January 2015"," Goblet of Fire Burns Brightly
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantastic movie and a more than worthy addition to the Harry Potter movie series. Ironically Goblet has always been my least favorite Harry Potter book. This movie isn't the most faithful to the book but in this case that benefits the movie. The book contains too much recap of previous stories, too many trivial details, and too many unnecessary subplots. The movie is much better paced than the book thanks to the removal of much unnecessary content. The filmmakers mostly made the right choices about what to include in the movie and what to omit. The main parts of the book are about the Triwizard Tournament and Voldemort's return. All three Triwizard Tasks and Voldemort's return are included so we're in good shape already. Other important scenes such as Moody's first class, the opening chapter, and Dumbledore's speech about Cedric are included. The only thing I would have done differently is that I would have omitted the Yule Ball and instead included more of Barty Crouch Jr's backstory. The Yule Ball is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the plot or the story. On the other hand it would have been nice to have seen the movie explain more of Barty Crouch Jr's backstory such as how he was smuggled from Azkaban, how he came to return to Voldemort, and how he came to be at Hogwarts. Barty Crouch Jr is an important character who is underdeveloped in the movie. Overall I think this movie was well structured. The casting and acting are outstanding as is always the case in Harry Potter. Amongst the newbies Ralph Fiennes gives an awesome portrayal of Voldemort. That graveyard scene really captured the darker tone the series is starting to take. Voldemort truly feels scary here. And Brendon Gleeson's Mad Eye Moody is so goddamn entertaining. So the new cast members fit right in with the high quality actors in this series. The special effects and visuals are awesome. Obviously the production quality is top notch. But there's more to it than that. The way this movie was made really captures the venture into darker territory Harry Potter is starting to take at this point in the series with its darker colors and cinematography compared with the previous Harry Potter movies. The settings and environments also help capture this. This movie knows what it is and where it is going and brings that out well. Andi really enjoyed how they made Voldemort. Patrick Doyle's score is good but nowhere near as good as John Williams. It's a shame that Williams couldn't score all 8 Harry Potter movies. The score heard here is good but a noticeable step down from John Williams classic scores on the previous Harry Potter movies. The pacing is mostly good. However the Yule Ball scene really drags on. When I watch this movie on DVD I skip ahead from Harry and Ron making up in the aftermath of the First Task to the part where Voldemort says ""Let me see it again."" and the movie has a much better and more enjoyable pace without the Yule Ball. This movie should only be viewed by people in middle school or older. The emotional intensity of Cedric's death, the entire graveyard scene, Harry having to carry Cedric's body back through the maze, and Dumbledore's speech about Cedric are too much for elementary school children to handle. Faithfulness to the book: 5 out of 10. Casting and acting: 10 out of 10. Music: 7 out of 10. Pacing: 8 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 10 out of 10. Overall: 8 out of 10."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire This past weekend , I saw the movie Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire the third time . As part of the popular Harry Potter book and movie series, it was definitely one to remember. This movie is mainly about a larger-scale competition between wizards that takes place at Hogwarts over the course of the school year . Harry has been entered into the contest , which is known as the triwizard tournament, and many twists and turns make for quite the adventurous challenges , and mysterious behavior that they are forced to decode . New characters were introduced in this film ,which was an enjoyable aspect and added a new element of intrigue that the previous Harry Potter films did not possess . Although my favorite was still the same Harry Potter ( Daniel ) because of his outstanding performance . Furthermore , this installment of the series seemed to follow its literary counterpart the most closely and accurately . Also, a great aspect of the film was the special effects,particularly with regard to all of the scenes featuring the dragons. This movie was also different from the rest because it had more story concerning the characters' love lives. In one particular scene , there was a dance that all of the tournament contestants were to attend. The characters went to the ball , and it was so much fun to watch . First of all , the scenery of the ball was exquisite, and it was so cool to actually feel like you were there ! This was definitely one of the highlights of the movie. On the contrary , the school looks dreary and dark , sometimes rather bland . Dark can be good ,but it is not very magical. The movie is too long too, perhaps no longer than the others, but it feels longer. It drags , jumping between sections it seems as though there's three movie in here instead of one . After watching the movie I learned that "" Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery. "" . If you are a Harry Potter fan you're going to love it but those who are not should consider to go to watch twice ! It's too long in places , and drags when it should soar. It's rated PG- 13. Instead goblet of fire kind of lives between PG and PG-13, one not-so-grizzly death less and it probably would have been PG . Overall, this is a good movie a fun movie , with the addition of new characters,the fast paced natural of the film, and the added romantic aspects ! Rating : ****"

","I saw Harry Potter around early December when normally I would've seen it on opening day or weekend and the first half of the movie I thought it was okay but now that I look back on the overall film I thought it was good. The book was amazing so the movie should've been to. After the third HP greatly disappointed me (I still liked it but it could've been SO much better)this really made me get excited for the rest of the movies. Why did everyone make a big deal over the visual effects? They were nothing compared to Star Wars 3 or even War of the Worlds. They certainly weren't worthy of being nominated at the Oscars. Although I can't imagine how War of the Worlds was and Star Wars wasn't. Anyway it was a great Harry Potter film with some decent acting here and there from Brendan Gleeson (shouldn't have played Mad-Eye Moody), Alan Rickman (has a much more brief series of appearances in this one), and even Daniel Radcliffe. An excellent film. I think I'll buy it. It's worth it but rent it first because you never know you may hate it. Overall this film has it all. Romance, a journey that seems to never end, the test of a friendship and much much more!"
"jeffreyhillen-364-945381","8","0","1","6 September 2014"," Where was the original story ?
","Goblet of Fire is the 4th movie in the Harry Potter Film Franchise. As enthusiastic I was with the first three movies, how disappointed I was with the 4th. For the second time we fans had a different director and it was only waiting if that would be good.<br/><br/>The 4th film is more like a thriller, at least if you read the book. The weak point of this film is the storyline. How longer you read Harry Potter how bigger the books become. It looks like the Director and especially the screenwriter found it very difficult to be true to the story of the 4th book. If you look at the book you get a very clear view of Barty Crouch Sr. but in the movie he only has a view scenes. and when the Death eaters arrive at the Quidditch World Cup in the book it really is something serious but in the movie it looked like a Halloween joke. So looking at the storyline I think we failed with this film.<br/><br/>Mike Newell was also responsible for good things in this film. Again some actors had to be cast. Cedric Diggory played a quite important part in this part and I think Robbert Pattinso represented Cedric very good. But what about Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort. The scene where Voldemort come back to life again was a very great scene. It was a scene where fans have waited for since the first book. Although you don't expect it, you expect he will return some time. Ralph Fiennes played the role with moments of madness but also moments of rage and moments of calm. I was very satisfied with the way Ralph Fiennes did the role of Voldemort. The look was very important to make Voldemort really scary. And the good thing is Ralph Fiennes wanted it to be good. So I think they did a beautiful job on creating Voldemort. And Mike Newell was also responsible for that. We can as fans complain about the failure of this movie but we can also talk about the great things he did with this movie In this movie it is nice to see some development. You really see the characters are developing. Things are getting darker and there are coming more adult themes in it, why it is the reason Harry Potter is not 100 % a children's story. I love the dialogue between Harry Ron and Hermione in this movie you really see they are growing to be more mature. You see it starts developing they are not children anymore. So eventually I rate this film 8/10 : The good casting, the performance of the actors , the development of the series and characters, the growing darkness in the film."

","SPOILERS! for the movie ahead. Read at your own risk.<br/><br/>Now this where the film series really took hold of me. So much so, I finally began to start reading the books ahead of the movies release dates.<br/><br/>Starting off really dark and creepy, we are then whisked off to the vibrant Quidditch world cup. Suddenly ""Death Eaters"" (Voldemort's followers) strike, proving that no where is safe in the wizarding world. Essentially ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", is a dark/high school/sports movie. The Tri-Wizard tournament is upon Hogwarts, meaning that foreign students are also joining the school this year, along with the tradition of the Yule Ball.<br/><br/>Everything looks stunning, every competition takes a phobia and makes it so tense it challenges all the contenders senses. For Harry especially, not only does he have to deal with premonitions but also life and death (Against the Dragon), compassion and selflessness (In the Waters) and right and wrong (In the Maze). Finally culminating with the resurrection of Voldemort. I walked into the movie without having any prior knowledge how events would turn out, I was surprised to finally see everything not tidy and happily wrapped up. For the first time ever, the future of Harry's life looked incredibly uncertain.<br/><br/>Cedirc Diggory is added to the mix and to be honest, I really enjoyed Robert Pattison's performance. Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody was absurdly fun and let's face it, Ralph Fiennes plays a chilling Voldemort.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""Everything is about to change"". The films original tag-line lives to its statement and so much more. 8.5/10. Well done Mike Newell."

","Talk about magic! Dan Radcliffe's progression is amazing in this film. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. This is another level of film. The film is dark, brooding, intense. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and magic. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The urge to just walk away almost got me a couple of times. But, in the end, this is an excellent character study. Indeed the characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times."

","The phenomenal success of J. K. Rowling's series of novels for children about a boy in a school of wizardry has been augmented by the enormous box office grosses of the film adaptations. Left with the daunting task of maintaining the standards and quality of the previous instalments, Director Mike Newell has fashioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a marvellous, visual treat that matches the series' previous highs.<br/><br/>A new year at Hogwarts brings old faces and some new ones as the school for witchcraft and wizardry is primed for great change and a growing threat. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shaken by a recurring nightmare as the presence of Lord Voldemort looms ominously, and he summons Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) for advice. Soon a mysterious man, ""Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), arrives to help Harry against the dark forces. The school is preparing for a special gathering of two other schools to compete in a special Tri-Wizard Tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition in which only one older student from each respective school may enter via the Goblet of Fire. Harry becomes involved in the competition to the surprise of everyone including himself. As he and the other students find, the games are immensely formidable with dragons, underwater traps, and an endless maze of hedges. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are experiencing the joys and pain of adolescence as the wonders of high school crushes and the anxiety of the school dance wreak havoc. Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) catches the romantic bug. Mistrust and accusations complicate matters for Harry, and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) expresses his concerns about the future. Before long, Harry, Ron and Hermione bicker amongst themselves as their friendship is severely tested. When the tournament concludes, another set of tragic circumstances opens the way for new evil and betrayal. As the elder wizards (Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman) close ranks to protect the students especially Harry, the future remains uncertain at best.<br/><br/>Ironically, Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is the first British director of the series, and, while he had the difficult challenge of continuing the series, he has added some nice wrinkles and touches by delving deeper into the emotional conflicts of these students. In fact, the maturation and changes these teens must encounter richly add to the already exciting story. We root for these heroes and feel their discomfort and pain because we have in a sense grown up with them. As with any Harry Potter storyline, not all the characters are good and, conversely, not all the suspicious ones are bad. Several plot lines are carried over from the previous films and new ones are primed for future sequels. Screenwriter Steven Kloves, the keeper of the flame, has done a herculean job of distilling the essence of Rowling's novels into each film thus far.<br/><br/>As always, the trio of young actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, own these roles, and the thought of replacing any of them due to age concerns was unnecessary. All three look great as they are now a little older and wiser. Of course, Gambon, Smith, Rickman, and Coltrane are the old pros who are the constants at Hogwarts. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly suited for his villainous turn in the startling climax. Brendan Gleeson does a fine job as the menacing, yet benevolent 'Mad Eye' Moody who supposedly watches over Harry during the tournament. It also seems that the most recent Harry Potter film is becoming quite an international event as the cast of students is even more ethnically diverse than ever before.<br/><br/>As usual, the production values are outstanding with lavish sets and costumes imaginatively photographed by Roger Pratt. The special effects are quite impressive although nothing that you haven't already seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the Star Wars sextet. Just the generous details and little touches throughout the film like the animated paintings add to the overall care that still goes into these films. Make no mistake, this is a lengthy film, but the pacing is good as a large number of scenes are strung back to back to contain as much of the book as possible into roughly two and a half hours. It feels a bit episodic but never loses sight of the main story and the emotional state of the characters.<br/><br/>There are creepy images and a foreboding atmosphere through much of the film. This adaptation does contain more risqué scenes such as Harry's bathtub scene or the terrifying menace of Voldemort, in which the tone gets downright mean-spirited. The students are not so innocent anymore as they curse, and in one climactic scene come face to face with the pain of loss. A PG13 rating signals that the Potter adventures are growing up fast.<br/><br/>It does require that the audience have a background in the series of books or films to fully appreciate the significance of critical events, although the film can stand on its own as pure entertainment and a coming of age. In some ways Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a classic bridge episode similar to The Empire Strikes Back. Not only is it a strong entry in the series with the most open ended finale yet, it proves a good setup for some potentially exciting things to come. Harry's next adventure couldn't have come soon enough!"

","As we all remember, turning 14 comes with as many strange new emotions as it does the need to rebel against everything resembling authority, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), fresh off his experiences battling ghostly Dementors and a werewolf, faces a brand new threat - women. Goblet of Fire, with a new director in Mike Newell, continues Alfonso Cuaron's darker and and more sinister tone, pitching Harry against a whole new range of beasts and dark wizards, but it's the section around the middle of the film - where Harry and his ever-present friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must find dates and attend formal dance the Yule Ball - that delights the most and brings the very best out of it's still-young actors.<br/><br/>After a Death Eater attack at the Quidditch World Cup that leaves the 'Dark Mark' - the sigil of Lord Voldemort's followers - lighting up the smoky sky, Harry returns to Hogwarts for another year. This year however, they are being joined by overseas schools Beauxbatons of France, and Durmstrang of Bulgaria, as Hogwarts is playing host to the Triwizard Tournament, a collection of dangerous feats that pitches one pupil from each school against each other for the prize. After the champions are selected - Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy) for Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) for Durmstrang, and Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) for Hogwarts - a fourth name is spat out - Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Harry swears to Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) that he did not cheat and enter his own name (as he's underage), and, being bound by a magical contract, the schools have no option but to allow him to compete. New Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) - a half-crazed ex-Auror with one magical eye that is independent of his other and which can see through the back of his own head - sets about preparing Harry for the perilous tournament. He must face dragons, sea- monsters and a seemingly endless maze to find the prize, but where Harry is, the threat of Lord Voldemort's return is always lurking.<br/><br/>Mike Newell and returning screenwriter Steve Kloves do an excellent job in condensing a mammoth book (about twice as large as Prisoner of Azkaban) into a coherent film. For a film so rich in action and whizz- bang CGI, it thankfully doesn't neglect the drama. Harry's friendship with Ron and Hermione is stretched, with hormones and jealousy creeping into Ron's personality, and Hermione's struggle to deal with the idiot. But it's hardly melodrama, and the Yule Ball provides the most amusing set-piece in the series, and a welcome distraction from the darkness that lurks outside.<br/><br/>It's the point in the series where disarming spells and defensive tricks start to prove ineffective, and people begin to die. The opening scene, which depicts an elderly muggle (played by Eric Sykes) stumbling upon Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) and an undeveloped Voldemort, sees the first time the dreaded killing curse is used, and therefore sets the tone. It's also bookmarked by a thrilling climax in which (spoilers!) Voldemort finally returns in the form of a noseless Ralph Fiennes, who puts in a suitably creepy performance. It doesn't beat Azkaban as the series best entry, it's far too long and sometimes rushed for that, but it's certainly the most entertaining."

","An incredibly dark premise in comparison to its predecessors, the 4th chapter of Harry Potter film franchise wasn't just burdened with the daunting task of adapting the then-longest novel by J.K. Rowling into a single film but also had to live up to the benchmark set by the previous chapter. And even though it trims down or skips over far too many events of the book, what it eventually puts on the table is still a damn good movie, even if it's no match to Alfonso Cuarón's Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire covers Potter's 4th year at Hogwarts that's unlike any other year as this time the school of magic plays host to a legendary event, The Triwizard Tournament; in which a champion from each of the 3 schools is chosen to compete in a series of dangerous contests for eternal glory. However, when Harry is chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete despite being an underage contestant, he is left with no choice but to go through with it while the devil patiently waits to make his return.<br/><br/>As Cuarón decided against returning for this sequel, the director's chair this time passes on to Mike Newell at which he does a wonderful job as this movie retains the dark atmosphere of the book and is smoothly narrated from start to finish. Screenplay is sure to divide fans of the book but considering the runtime restriction of a movie, it is deftly adapted. The camera-work is exquisitely handled, editing keeps the tension alive & the background score by Patrick Doyle is darkly fascinating.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the supporting cast gets even stronger as Brendan Gleeson comes aboard as Alastor ""MadEye"" Moody; Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, while Ralph Fiennes takes the coveted role of The Dark Lord Voldemort. The 3 leads chip in with fine performances once again but it's Radcliffe who shows most improvement. VFX is excellently carried out & the stunning rendition of the Hungarian Horntail is its highpoint as the dragon is a sight to behold.<br/><br/>The one major disappointment I have with this film is that I really wanted the depiction of You- Know-Who as per the book but it sucks to find that wish unfulfilled. On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire offers loads of entertainment, excitement & enjoyment from its opening moments and is a worthy addition to the franchise that manages to make most things work in its favour. Expertly crafted, swiftly paced, intensely fun & possessing a magical touch in its presentation, this dark chapter in the life of The Boy Who Lived is worth your time & money."

","like everyone else of my generation I was a huge fan of the books, but as they fade from my memory it's easier to enjoy the films on their merits alone. I'll say this for the harry potter series: they're entertaining. of course, so were the books; jk rowling's success is all the more extraordinary when one considers what a thing of the past reading has become; even in the 90s I remember the majority of my friends being more interested in the Disney channel.<br/><br/>but I digress. this is a film which stands on its own merits: the characters are fully-fleshed; exposition is done efficiently and skillfully; there's an excellent balance of (actual, real, old-fashioned) acting, suspense, and humor. the visuals are done tastefully and care is taken not to bring undue attention to obvious cgi work; the camera lingers long enough to let of enjoy those exotic shots which undoubtedly required hundreds of hours of manpower all for a few seconds of screen time, then quickly brings our focus back to bear on the that which is most important: the characters, and their story.<br/><br/>I remember seeing this film in theaters as a teen and being frustrated with my peers for actually being able to sit all the way thru, but that's what I get for having grown up with the great American cinema classics. several years of dark knight clones later, I'm beginning to feel a little spoiled.<br/><br/>and of course I appreciate seeing maggie smith, alan rickman, and others.

","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the fourth movie of the Harry Potter series and in this one Hogwarts hosts 'The Triwizard Tournament', which is a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. In this tournament Harry Potter takes part so Hogwarts has two competitors and from one competitive have the two other schools.<br/><br/>I liked this movie more than all the previous movies of Harry Potter because I think that in this one the suspense was in the most out and because of this tournament which combined the skills of the competitors and their abilities to finally win with their passion of doing this right and with honor.<br/><br/>Finally I think that this movie is so much more interesting than the previous and this is something that it regained our interest as viewers to continue watching the rest Harry Potter movies."
"axel-koch","4","0","1","2 January 2014"," The series' best film up to that point
","Childhood is over for Harry Potter. With Goblet of Fire, the series turns PG-13 and the reason for that becomes clear as the very first scene of the film already includes a murder – and it won't be the last one, in a perfect compound of permanent peril, tear-inducing drama, and the romance problems a teenage boy faces.<br/><br/>In the octalogy's fourth instalment, the Triwizard Tournament plays the major role, and next to Harry, a not sparkling Edward Cullen, a French beauty, and a famous Bulgarian Quidditch player that attends school in Scandinavia (that's racist, J.K. Rowling!) are vying in this possibly lethal competition. I'm not going to spoil the three tasks, so suffice it to say that they are quite entertaining and include marvellous special effects with instantly believable CGI creatures, despite the first one being a bit over the top, in my opinion. <br/><br/>However, just as there are four wizards participating in a TRI-wizard Tournament, there's also an unintended fourth task coming up – a showdown more goosebumps-inducing than the source material's. It marks the first appearance of the real Lord Voldemort (not wizened baby Voldemort from Philosopher's Stone) and the realisation of this pivotal character is done consummately, the result being easily the most frightening character in any PG-13 film and also the best acting performance in Ralph Fiennes' already splendid career.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire is more than twice the length of all three preceding novels on their own and since these 635 pages aren't filled with vivid descriptions of landscape or particularised insights into characters' emotions but an actual story, there was difficulty arising for screenwriter Steve Kloves as in how to compact this into a single film of acceptable length. The result, while omitting some details that may have delighted the book aficionados, is an understandable cinematic adaption of J.K. Rowling's work that finds a place for all important details and revelations, leaving no further questions to ask for attentive viewers. <br/><br/>What a film about teenagers, for better or worse, has to include as well is romance and, thankfully, the ""kid"" actors get more and more believable, especially as a gratuitously jealous Ron, an annoyingly angry Hermione, and a socially awkward Harry are portrayed so genuinely that their relationship problems cannot be dwarfed by the evil things happening on a much broader scale in Goblet of Fire. And last but not least, despite abating in numbers, director Mike Newell doesn't entirely forget about the humour and includes good laughs, such as Dame Maggie Smith dancing with an overtly embarrassed Rupert Grint, the dress robe of the latter of these two, or Daniel Radcliffe's hilarious, mumbling way of asking a crush of his out for the ball.<br/><br/>All of this makes for the best Harry Potter film up to that point and two and a half hours that refuse to get boring on any occasion. Goblet of Fire is nothing but wonderful, as it combines a fantastic story with masterful visuals, not only in the action scenes, but also with the minute attention to detail in the decoration of the Yule Ball."
"purplelua","9","0","1","23 December 2013"," Doesn't Top Prisoner of Azkaban but Still A Great Film
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire again exceeds the first two films, but unfortunately doesn't top the excellent Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>I personally think this film should've been called Harry Potter and the Triwizard Tournament but as this film does revolve around who put Harry Potter's name in the Goblet of Fire (which led him to competing in a very dangerous series of tasks), I will let it lie.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter (who clearly hasn't visited his hairdressers since Prisoner of Azkaban) shines. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley (who, again, clearly hasn't seen his hairdressers either) makes good work out of his character, including some very funny moments. Emma Watson is brilliant as Hermione Granger, and looks beautiful in the Yule Ball scene. Also, James and Oliver Phelps as troublesome twins Fred and George Weasley are great to watch, and are now my new favourite characters.<br/><br/>The appearances of Brendan Gleeson as a crazy Mad Eye Moody, Edward Cullen (I mean Robert Patterson) as a slightly cocky Cedric Diggory and David Tennant as a scary Barty Crouch Jr also make this movie a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The three trials Harry and the other contestants face are exciting and in excellent CGI form. Also, the Goblet of Fire mystery also has a few shocks in store, and reveals that Mad Eye Moody is not really Mad Eye Moody at all.<br/><br/>Overall, a very gripping movie but doesn't rise to the high level of Prisoner of Azkaban."

","This is the fourth in the Harry Potter franchise, and it's under new management once again. This time the director is Mike Newell who did 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. There is a lot of material to stuff into this one. One of the problem is that the books are getting thicker and thicker. The fourth book is almost three times as long as the first book. A lot of it seems rushed and skipped over.<br/><br/>Lord Voldemort supporters called 'Death Eaters' are bolder than ever. They disrupt the Quidditch World Cup Final. When school restarts, Hogwarts holds the Triwizard Tournament pitting three schools against each other.<br/><br/>The tournament action is compelling and exciting. That's the heart of this movie. There is more teenage love drama. It's awkward and not in an appealing way. And Ron is downright bipolar in this one. There is a lot of awkward acting going on. It is extremely distressing. I feel whiplashed by the emotional 180s. There are also a lot of side stories trying to be crammed into this. The teenage drama mess aside, this is a good compelling movie."

","Since I got into the Harry Potter series a few months ago, I've been asking people what they think of it. To my surprise, most of them said they stopped after the Prisoner of Azkaban. Personally, I think Azkaban was the best one so far, so why not continue? The unanimous answer was that they didn't really want to see the kids grow up. In the Goblet of Fire, they aren't quite there yet, as in their 4th year at Hogwarts, the kids are 14. The story this time isn't centered around some mysterious artifact or person, but rather a world wide competition of student wizards. The Goblet of Fire decides who the best of the best are, allowing only one student from each school to participate. This film was special, but also lacked some of the intrigue that got us addicted to Harry Potter in the first place. Finally, a Harry Potter film focuses entirely on Harry and we get to see some of the great things that he is supposedly capable of. In fact, Ron and Hairmony's roles amount to little more than bit parts, where as in the other three films, they were all on equal ground. The fact that this was a competition takes something major away from the film. In the Goblet of Fire we aren't introduced to any new artifacts, games, or spells, there really isn't anything here that will amaze you. While it's a small thing, it's an expected thing, that does take something away from the film. What makes up for it is a terrific ending, that has to be seen in order to continue on with the series. For years, I thought Harry Potter was just overrated, pop culture, bull, but once I sat down to actually watch it, I came to realize that this series is as magically as the world it portrays. Every one of the first four films has been fantastic and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for the wizards of Hogwarts."

"chimaru98","7","0","1","30 September 2013"," It could have been so much more.
","Ah, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The film marking the beginning of a new era of Harry Potter films. We see the series take a turn into darker territory. Harry Potter is still played by Daniel Radcliffe, Ron's still got red hair, Malfoy is still being a horrible person (or should I say ferret?) and there's a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for the fourth year running. All in all, it's a pretty normal year apart from the tournament. Yes, the Triwizard Tournament. With a name like tri-wizard you'd expect three wizards, but no, they've thrown you off and given you four. It should be such a memorable film. We have the grand Yule Ball, the huge Quidditch World Cup, and the dramatic ending with Voldemort being reborn once more and fighting Harry, and losing (again!) But is it as memorable as it should be? No, it's just forgettable. I remember the first film, when Harry is introduced. I remember the second, when he's still a good character. But it's becoming less about the main character as it goes on.<br/><br/>Dumbledore performs well, as expected, and the delivery of Alan Rickman's lines as Severus Snape are spot on yet again, but it's not enough to make me want to return to watching the film again, unlike others in the Harry Potter series. As a film, it's good. As a HP film? It's below average. It should be so much more than it is, but it's in an awkward middle ground where the film isn't so filled with special effects that it's aesthetically stunning, but it's got too much so it seems forced. Last film we caught a glimpse of the member of Hufflepuff house, Cedric Diggory. In this near-three-hour acting showcase we're really introduced to him as a character. When he dies, we are meant to feel sadness and pain, but he's not shown as an important enough character for a viewer to feel much of it. Granted, we've known him for one and a half hours, but in a series with around 20 hours running time total? Why are we meant to feel bad for him? Is it because he's a *sparkly vampire*? No, Robert Pattinson, your character could have been better, and to be honest so could your acting.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because the film wasn't split into two parts like Deathly Hallows was. There was a lot more plot in the book that could have been expanded upon, but it wasn't used. The Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare? You may love him or hate him, but I'm sure many would have been pleased to see him in another film. Hagrid's embarrassment about being revealed as a ""half-giant""? Would have been another reason for the audience to hate Rita Skeeter, the lime-green-jacket wearing paparazzi. Draco Malfoy being turned into a ferret by his dad's co-worker? Yes, we got that, but there was so much left out we felt sad and depressed for quite a bit of the film. Harry's name gets pulled out of the Goblet of Fire, and no one likes him because they don't think that he did it. Then we find out he's going to be facing tasks that could kill him, which makes us feel worse. And then later on we have the Yule Ball, and Harry can't find a partner because his love interest Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw, has already been taken by a *sparkly vampire*. Then in the third task he almost gets killed (several times), and then he goes to a creepy graveyard where Cedric dies. (He's not killed by Voldemort, as Harry will repeatedly claim for the next two or three years, but by Peter Pettigrew, the servant of Voldemort. Remember him?) The two rivals of Harry and Voldemort then proceed to face off with an electronic light show to the death and when Harry arrives with Cedric's body it makes us feel even worse than we already felt. The film ends on a sad note, and it doesn't seem like a particularly satisfying viewing experience. It makes you think about how much better the film would have been if it had been split in two. Regardless, it still has some well-directed moments that I admittedly did enjoy while watching, which applies for most of the film, but looking back it doesn't inspire the same warm feeling inside the audience that we had for the first film. It can only get better from here, Harry."
"KaDaWe","9","0","1","20 August 2013"," I Don't Get The Critics ...
","I was really surprised when I first read the critics about this movie. In my opinion this film is just great - nothing else. The story is really interesting and different this time, because two other magical schools, Beauxbatons from France and Durmstrang from East Europe, are visiting Hogwarts. The three institutes organize the Triwizard Tournament. There's one champion from each school who fights for the win. Of course, somehow, Harry is a champion, too, even though Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff is chosen before. The result is that there are four champions. All have to withstand three tasks. That's the beginning of the plot.<br/><br/>The tasks are shown just beautifully, maybe there's more action than in the books, but it's still great. The effects are particularly in this film amazing. New characters like Mad-Eye Moody, Victor Krum or Fleur Delacour are mostly like I imagined them.<br/><br/>Though the new style of the film is great, it's maybe the weakest of the first four movies. And, I'm a little disappointed because of it, for the first time important scenes from the books are missing or are changed. Just a few examples (these are not spoilers, as they are only included in the books!): <br/><br/>The Quidditch World Cup at the very beginning is way too short. In the book everything's described very detailed, also the finale, which isn't even shown in the film.<br/><br/>Ludo Bagman, who for me was one of my favorite characters in all books, is missing entirely.<br/><br/>From the fourth book on Hermione has some sort of desire to help the house elves, which is a very funny part. This is also missing completely.<br/><br/>I can't remember that Dumbledore has been angry or furious ever in the books. Sadly he has this somehow cold personality from the fourth movie going on to the sixth. <br/><br/>It's very sad that scenes like these aren't included, but on the other hand I also understand it, because if you take everything from the book you'd have a four to five hour movie. <br/><br/>Because of that, I give the film nine out of ten points. Sadly, it's the last adequate Potter until ""The Deathly Hallows: Part 2""."
"thewillt08","9","0","1","10 June 2013"," Best in the Series
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite Harry Potter movie. There I said it. The reason is simple; it is the transition from a light magical adventure to a dark and serious fight. The first two were colorful and adventurous with a touch of evil. The third was different and a fresh twist to the plot. The fourth is the middle man and most important in the series. It is the first movie rated PG-13 in the series and you can tell it gets serious. This is The Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>By the release of the 4th movie Harry Potter had exploded into a phenomenon. Every man women and child knows the story and the series continued to get better and better. It is another year at Hogwarts and it is a special one. The Triwizard Tournament is occurring at Hogwarts and three champions from three different schools compete for the grand prize. Of course Harry gets involved and becomes the fourth member and what starts as a dangerous competition turns into a tournament filled with questions and conspiracy. <br/><br/>Harry is now 14 and he understands the magical world but at the same time he has a lot more to learn. It was nice seeing him know a lot but still not be an expert. He is introduced to the port key, the three unforgivable curses, and of course the dark mark. I loved the Quidditch World Cup. I loved reading it in the book. It introduced Viktor Krum's character really well and it was Quidditch, which is awesome. In the movie it cuts it short and as disappointed as I was I understood it took away from the story. The point of the Cup was to introduce the Death Eaters and the dark mark. This scene was intense and it set a tone for the rest of the movie. This is no longer a little kid's movie. <br/><br/>Harry is growing up and he deals with new problems that every teen manages to struggle with. Every director put his own spin onto the movie and this one was the teenage problems Harry struggles with. Harry is 14 and he has an interest in girls and you would think it would be easy for him giving his reputation, but he doesn't and that makes him more human. I liked how he was scared to ask a girl to the Yule Ball and I loved the idea of the Ball. I liked his love interest in Cho Chang. In this movie it worked because he showed his awkwardness and a weakness in a way. I also loved the idea of the Yule Ball and it meshed well with the tournament. <br/><br/>Let's take a moment to discuss the tournament itself. I love the idea of the tournament and I love how we are introduced to different cultures of the wizarding world. I like how it's not just Hogwarts and there are other things out there. So we have Fleur and Krum representing their schools. Then we have Cedric Diggory and Harry form Hogwarts. Each character is unique and brings different personalities to the stage. The tournament itself has three challenges each different and more dangerous from the last. It lasts the entire year and I think the second was my favorite because it took mental strength along with physical. Besides the tournament we have many things happening. There is this dark force lingering and something not right in the world. There is a different attitude in year four so in a way the tournament is a major and minor factor to the story. <br/><br/>We are also introduced to Mad-Eye Moody and he is a character you will never forget. He is also a man surrounded with questions. I mean he is the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher so he is obviously not what he seems to be. The difference is the big question and confusion isn't as obvious. The director and writers did a fantastic job in making this character come to life. He is really important but does a really good job at hiding his intentions. If you have seen the movie you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>Easily the best part of this movie is the ending. I don't know why but I didn't see it coming whatsoever. I won't spoil it but if you haven't seen the movies then why are you reading this? Go see the movie and come back. Nevertheless, this movie changes the world of Harry Potter forever. It gets real and it gets serious. The entire movie is kind of like heave clouds starting to block out the sun and by the end of the climax scene there is no sun and the storm is coming. It blew me away, it is epic, and I remember sitting in the theater amazed by what I had just seen. <br/><br/>Overall, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best book and movie in the series. I loved everything about it from the directing to the acting to the lighting. Yes I said the lighting. I will go deeper into detail in the next review as it turns more relevant. This movie sets up the rest of the series and the tone for the rest of the movies. It is a small taste of what is to come and is a great tease. I love how relatable the characters continue to be. I love how they develop and we dive deep into their emotions and get another small taste of the rest of the series. I was getting a little bored with the series but this movie tuned me in and got me so excited for the end. Harry Potter 4 proudly gets the WillyT Seal of Approval."

","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.<br/><br/>At the time of writing I have now watched the whole series of Harry Potter films in a single week and this is probably my favourite because it seems to have more flair and more fun than the rest. The tri-wizard contest which is the heart of this film gives a good structure to the story and the opportunity for a series of exciting set pieces. The introduction of teams from the wonderfully named Beauxbaton and Durmstrang schools adds more colour and a great sense of the absurd.<br/><br/>It doesn't start well however. Very early on we find ourselves at the Quidditch World Cup and my heart sinks at the thought of more broomsticks and balls. Thankfully though, the dark forces share my view that Quidditch is an insufferable bore and just a rugby match by proxy and send dementors to punish and kill participants. The battle with the dragon which becomes the first task of the tri-wizard tournament gives us a real arena for aerial combat and reinforces the pointlessness of Quidditch.<br/><br/>There's a bit of a dip near the end with an attack of killer hedges reminiscent of the end of the Shining but the revival of Voldemort and subsequent battle livens things up. (Think, Dracula Has Risen from the Grave followed by a light sabre battle from Star Wars).<br/><br/>It's difficult not to make fun of how the Harry Potter films cannibalise lots of other films and books but this is a great film to watch especially if you don't take it too seriously."

Soon however, the Weasley's, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Harry are whisked away to the Quidditch World Cup Final before being interrupted by an untimely attack on the grounds by followers of the deceased dark lord Voldermort. Compile this on top of the fact that Harry is unwittingly selected for the 'Triwizard Tournament' and the fact that he is in need of a female partner for the Yule ball and you have an overworked wizard - and an action packed movie!<br/><br/>For the most part, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is a fabulous spectacle which is the most thrilling Potter film of the first four by some distance. The action scenes have beautiful CGI rendered with excellent cinematography however, the overall story is more predictable than its predecessor's. However, this is only a minor complaint in what is a solidly excellent sequel. <br/><br/>Although the certificate is now a 12, I wouldn't call this any darker in atmosphere and ambiance than predecessor the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' which was only rated at PG. <br/><br/>Again, there is always room for improvement - nothing can be declared perfect. However, Newell cannot have asked for much more on his rule over his only Potter movie."
"mush_disaster","7","0","1","17 December 2012"," Well done, though with some unforgivable flaws
","Before watching this movie, I was absolutely terrified it would turn out like Prisoner of Azkaban - probably the most disappointing film EVER - but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I want to start out by saying that this is the first film that takes a darker feel to it, one that is definitely enjoyable. The special effects were amazing and generally speaking I enjoyed it tremendously! There are some problems when it comes to scene cuts and many scenes are left hanging. One example is the Quiddich World Cup scene: one moment we're watching the presentation of the playing teams; the next Harry and the rest are back in their tent and the Death Eaters are about to create chaos among the campers. When I watched the film in the theater, it took me a few long confusing seconds to understand what had really happened and what scene of the book was being portrayed. My first thought was ""Is this really all we're getting to see from the World Cup?"" - Disappointing, yet it is understandable that in a movie adaption, many scenes if not most have to go.<br/><br/>But many important parts were not even mentioned: Winky, the house elf; Hermione discovering Rita Skeeter as an animagus; Harry's money prize and how he gave it to Fred and George for them to use in their shop (which should have been mentioned as well), Ludo Bagman and more. None of these scenes may not have been crucial to plot development, but by not mentioning them the movie has turned into a very chopped up version of the book. As an adaption of such a huge book, the film is way too short. I think, for example, that instead of exaggerating the dragon scene, they could have kept it closer to the book and dedicate those wasted minutes to something more interesting and important."

"parallel_projection","7","0","1","19 August 2012"," Great movie, but some poor choices were made
","This is a great movie overall, even though it does waver quite a bit from the book. The three tasks were done very well, and the whole atmosphere of the film matches that of the book, which I always think is important. Also, Mike Newell does a very good job at directing--there are some really fantastic close-ups as well as wide, seeping shots, and shots from interesting perspectives.<br/><br/>However, some of the choices made during or for the filming of this movie weren't very good. For instance, I believe the director wanted all the male actors to grow out their hair, but it simply looks ridiculous, especially Rupert Grint. Also, sometimes characters act in ways that doesn't seem very natural according to who they are, such a Dumbledore and, occasionally, Cedric Diggory.<br/><br/>Overall, though, the acting is top-notch. The trio seems to have improved even more, including Emma Watson, whom I didn't think could improve. Some other stand-out roles were Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort and Brendan Gleason interpreting Mad-Eye Moody. Also, Miranda Richardson does a fantastic job with Rita Skeeter, although her role is rather small.<br/><br/>Although probably being my least-favorite Harry Potter movie, this movie is definitely very good, especially when you take it as a movie and not a recreation of the book. Some things could definitely have been improved upon, but nonetheless, everyone involved did a great job."
"Bruce722","8","0","1","1 June 2012"," Good but not great.
","This movie easily has the most changes in terms of book-to-movie out of the four movies thus far. However, while there were many changes, this is also based on an incredibly long book so I totally expected it. Out of the changes, however, only one really bugged me. I hated what they did with Dumbledore's character. After Harry's name gets called by the goblet, he goes absolutely berserk in the movie and even shoves Harry. This never even almost happens in the book and is so outside of the character established already that it felt wrong. Nonetheless, if I try and look at it strictly from a moviegoer's perspective, it was probably the best of the movies so far. The acting was better than in the prior three, the plot progressed more smoothly, and the effects seemed better... especially the dragon sequence. While I wish they would've stuck more closely to the great book, they did do it justice. I would say I only deducted 2 points from the 10/10 maximum for the change to Dumbledore's character and for the fact that there seemed to be a couple of points in the movie where I would've missed what was happening if not for having read the book already. It's easy to get ahead of the movie somewhat if you already know the entire story so I might be exaggerating this effect somewhat but I thought it stood out. Still, this was a very good movie and I look forward to finishing the series."
"classicsoncall","8","0","1","12 May 2012"," ""What's life without a few dragons?""
","I find myself prefacing these reviews by saying that I haven't read the Potter books, so my approach to how I write them is strictly as a viewer of the movies. I found 'Goblet of Fire' to be quite entertaining even if more to the dark side than the first three films, however I was struck by a fair amount of inconsistencies in the story telling that kept raising question marks as the story progressed. The first would have been the abrupt end to the Quidditch World Cup when the Death Eaters made their appearance and transformed the landscape to Armageddon. That happened so quickly that I was left scratching my head, wondering what just happened and why the transition was done that way.<br/><br/>With the first challenge, the thing that struck me was that there was no way that anyone in the stadium could have possibly seen what was going on with Harry against the horntail dragon. Prior to that, the viewer never gets to see what happened with the other three contestants against their dragon foes. That just seemed odd to me, but not as odd as the the way the story handled the next set of challenges. With all the buildup as to the dangerous nature of the Triwizard Tournament and how it had to follow a strict set of rules, it made no sense to me that Fleur Delacour would have been allowed to participate in the third challenge after having given up in the second. Did that bother anyone else? <br/><br/>Then there's the question of You-Know-Who, or the dreaded Valdemort. The previous stories made a fairly big deal of not mentioning the name of Valdemort outright, but it was thrown around here rather handily. Then, when he finally made his first appearance in the series, Harry managed to get by him without too much trouble. I don't know, I just thought that their first meeting would have been given to more epic proportion, but there's a few more chapters in this story, so I can wait.<br/><br/>Now I don't know anything about J.K. Rowling's political ideology or world view, but with the Triwizard Tournament, I couldn't help but consider how the participants were represented. Hogwarts would have been the stand-in for England, that's pretty obvious. Oddly, the Russian team was called Durmstrang, the word apparently a composite of the German expression 'sturm und drang' which translates fairly literally to 'storm and stress', which for the teens of the competing academies would have accurately reflected their own emotional stress as students and as young men and women contemplating the angst of their formative years. But what about Beaubaxton? Do they represent France or the larger European Union, now under considerable turmoil, though that wouldn't have been the case when Rowling initially wrote her novels? In hindsight though, I think it's an interesting speculation.<br/><br/>Anyway, I probably put more thought into this apart from the main story line than is necessary. In general I liked the film well enough, and at this point in the series it could be my favorite, but that could be because the characters are older and the story elements come across as more mature. I look forward to watching the remaining chapters in the series."
"trixie-k-88","7","0","1","4 April 2012"," Weaker of the series--but still Harry Potter!
","It's year four at Hogwarts for Harry and his friends, and things are starting to go downhill, for both the film and the characters. Mike Newell is now director, and he brings more changes to the series.<br/><br/>It's the summer before his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry is having recurring dreams of Voldemort and Wormtail (Timothy Spall). But he is temporarily distracted when he goes to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, the Weasleys, family friend Mr. Diggory, and his son Cedric (Robert Pattinson). Everyone enjoys the match, Ron especially, who is a big fan of the young, Bulgarian seeker Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski). But the match is interrupted by Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters, terrorizing the fans, causing chaos and casting ""the dark mark"" in the sky. Everyone is shaken from the events at the World Cup, but the kids go to school and hear some exciting news. Hogwarts will be home to the TriWizard Tournament, a competition between three young wizards from three different schools. According to Dumbledore, the prize will include the TriWizard cup and eternal glory. So, a group of beautiful French girls from the Beauxbatons Acadamy and tough Eastern European young men from Durmstrang Institute arrive at Hogwarts. Dumbledore establishes the rules that no students under age seventeen can apply to the contest by placing their names in the Goblet of Fire. The Goblet then chooses the Tournament's competitors: Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) from Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum from Durmstrang andHarry?! Poor Harry is shocked and confused at this revelation, and the entire school (all three really) are furious at him for ""cheating"". He quickly becomes a media sensation and struggles to get through the dangerous competitions. Luckily though, Harry is helped by the new (and somewhat frightening) Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ""Mad Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson). On top of putting his life on the line for a competition he doesn't want to be in, Ron isn't speaking with him, and Hermione is also fighting with Ron. Everything is a mess, and Harry must compete in life threatening games, make up with his friends, find a date for the Yule ball, and figure out why he's having so many dreams of Voldemort.<br/><br/>This is probably the weakest (or second weakest) of all eight movies. First of all, the direction for this series has become a game of musical chairs. Newell was at a disadvantage following Cuarón, who most fans consider the best HP director. Not only that, the fourth book is the second longest book with so much information that the plot was absolutely butchered. The book was so long that the film makers considered splitting the fourth installment into two movies. That might have been better, because this film is extremely rushed and still leaves a huge amount out. Ironically, this film is shorter than the first two films whose source material was barely half the length of the fourth book. It must be said that this film focuses almost completely on Harry. While he may be the main character, any fans of the books or movies knows that Ron, Hermione and other side characters have just as much to do with the plot as he does. Not only that, but the other competitors, Fleur and Viktor barely have ANY lines or screen time. I don't even remember hearing Fleur say anything except for screaming and one line in French! I also want to know who did the editing in this movie. There are a few scenes where Harry's hair is at least two inches longer/shorter than in the previous scene. Really, did no one have the hindsight to keep his hair a similar length during filming? Even so, didn't anyone think to film things in a way that would look like his hair grew during the year? And while we're on the subject of hair...Radcliffe (and Grint's) hair is absolutely dreadful in this film! I'm usually not one to comment on those things but...wow. But I digress, this film is not ALL bad. It has some great scenes of Harry fighting a dragon and swimming in the Black Lake. The scene in the graveyard with Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) return is probably the best written and acted in the film. Fiennes does a fantastic job as the scary, creepy and power hungry Dark Lord. Luckily they didn't leave out the parts that have to do with his return to power, thus confusing the viewers on later events. As for the other goings on in this film, it does establish that rising adolescent tension between Ron and Hermione the times they are on screen, and even has some sexual innuendos. It's kind of fascinating how the films age with the characters and even audience, as I don't think I've really seen that with any other franchise. While I have criticized this film a lot, that's only because Harry Potter films and books are held in such high regard. It butchered the source material, as well as created a sub-par film—in comparison to the seven others. However, the film itself is not bad in comparison to other films or fantasies. While probably the weakest of the HP franchise, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is still definitely worth watching for Harry Potter fans."
"ZalmanAran","Null","0","1","24 March 2012"," The Best Harry Potter Movie of them All!!!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite of all the eight movies, because it's full of excitement. The movie starts with Dumbeldor, who tells the Hogwarts students about a big tournament that happens every four years, and is geared towards 16 to 18 year old students. Unexpectedly, Harry gets chosen to compete there, even though he is too young. He goes out on the missions, and it is very interesting to watch his progress during the movie.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is the main character of all the movies. Because he grew up in a small closet under the staircase, he knew nothing about the life of magic that is waiting for him. I like him because he is great in Quidditch. He plays as the seeker, and thanks to him, Griffindor wins every single game. We can see that he is very talented, and that he can do things that no one his age can do.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars, because it is full of adventures and makes you fall in love with the movie. In my opinion, this movie is for all ages, and is very fun to watch together as a family or with friends."

The two most captivating features of this film were the Yule Ball and the re-birth of Lord Voldemort, both perfectly shot, the outcome, simply amazing. No one can replace Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, his acting was so apt for his character. Though some chapters from the book were eliminated/ shortened, it didn't deviate from the main story. The effects, to create the duel scene were so cool! It has created a craze among all HP fanatics, and in comparison to the previous three films, it was the best!

"illbebackreviews","7","0","1","9 January 2012"," A Very Good HP Film
","The first three HP films have all lived up to my expectations and I was hoping this would too. Yes, it was a success in my opinion, yet it can't be the best of the four. Mike Newell did a decent job with this film.<br/><br/>The novel was one of the better JK Rowling books in my opinion, and I was hoping this would too. This film succeeds in many ways. The acting is great, the effects and the story moves along well. All the actors are great...(wait, I spoke a little too soon) all but Michael Gambon are great. My beliefs are that Michael Gambon's Dumbledore wrecked the legendary character. This actor had to shout at students, especially Harry and at one point attacked him. In the novel, Dumbledore calmly asks Harry if he put his name in the Goblet of Fire, yet this Dumbledore pushes him to a trophy cabinet and grabs him. REALLY!!!???! Is that the Dumbledore we knew. I don't think so. Many would later argue that Richard Harris (who passed away) would never be able to act the scene where duelling Voldemort in No.5, but he could. Gambon's Dumbledore was stressed too much, yet Dumbledore in the book was calm.<br/><br/>Even though Gambon's Dumbledore (in this film) totally wrecked our beloved character, this film was still well done. One more thing is that the maze sequence was disappointing as it only contained the maze moving around. In the book, dementors and boggarts all pop out and things were more tense. Yet all three of the tasks were done very well, and mostly all was well."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) is a movie based on the successful novel written by J.K.Rowling, directed by Mike Newell. The movie is the fourth installment of the Harry Potter franchise known worldwide. Harry Potter, the protagonist continues his studies at Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches, but this year, the school is participating in a wizarding competition called the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry is accidentally chosen to participate in the tournament, only to be revealed in the end that his enemy the Dark Lord Voldemort put his name in the Cup, just so he can be able to kill Harry.<br/><br/>In an objective evaluation, Mike Newell was able to make this movie a success. It gives us fun-packed action, mixed with romance and jealousy, new magical spells, and a feeling of who we really are and who we can become. Elements that make the strongest contribution are the scenes where the characters are competing in the three obstacles. This gives the audience a sense of what the character is capable of. The characters have grown up, but Hermione still seems to have that childish, melodramatic-ness. The interaction of the characters, coming together for a great event shows how much the director wanted to cooperate the idea of coming together.<br/><br/>The film continues at a good pace, although condensing a 400- page book into a two hour movie seems too much. The film does seem too rushed, but it still has a great feel to it. The scenes of where the tournaments take place are amazing. It gives the feeling of things that actually come out of books can happen! I enjoyed watching this movie, and it's personally my favorite out of the entire series."
"kdnor2011","8","0","1","9 August 2011"," Entertaining, but the plot needed more from the book
","Plot: After the Dark Mark appears at the Quittich World Cup, Harry is selected to take part in the twiwizard tournament. Except for one problem, Harry never entered. And with his scar burning more than ever, and teenage hormones starting to kick in, Harry learns that his fourth year at Hogwarts, is going to be his hardest. <br/><br/>Review: Before we start, let me just say this, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite book of all time. It has action, suspense, and has finally taken a dark enough turn. The movie adaptation just wasn't as good. Oh don't get me wrong, I think this movie is ridiculously entertaining, but in terms of an adaptation it just isn't as strong. <br/><br/>For example, Hermiones S.P.E.W. campaign is never mentioned, and since we don't know that elves work in the kitchen, some people will be confused when the elves attack in the last movie. Also the whole Rita Skeeter can turn into a beetle is gone, there's literally only one class in the whole film, and there are literally only three scenes between the second and third tasks. The second task was in mid February and the third was in late June. Yet in the movie the second task ends, they find Crouch's body, Harry goes into Dumbledore's office and finds the penesive, and Snape interrogates Harry about his potion ingredients. Also Winky doesn't make an appearance.<br/><br/>After that last paragraph, you may think I think this is a horrible adaptation, but it isn't, it's actually quite good. There are some things that I thought they might cut out that they didn't, such as Fred and George trying to enter the tournament. But since the fourth is my favorite book, I guess this film would disappoint in the story department. But it doesn't disappoint in the action, the first task was so well done, and one change from the book that was a major improvement. I'm sorry, but Harry just flying around the dragon arena, a little boring. The special effects are amazing is some places, and the acting just keeps getting better. Also I like the whole romantic elements, Cho and Harry's works, even if it is a little rushed. And this is when Ron and Hermione are really starting to get it on, the buckbeak snapped at Harry part in POA started it, but now it's kicking into high gear.<br/><br/>Overall Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a pretty good adaptation, but it could have been better. But as a film it's awesome. It's extremely entertaining, it's dark, funny, and has a really good romantic elements. But it is one of the weaker entries, at least in terms of an adaptation."

"sarah-969-896500","10","0","1","5 February 2011"," Review on the themes and techniques used in the film
","In the film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson star as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their fourth year. This time, the school hosts the legendary Triwizard tournament, introducing new friends and foes, as our main characters face another year of trials and hardships. Like the Potter films before, this film's theme focuses on the importance of family and friendship and the forces of good versus evil. In the early stages of the film, we see the students of Hogwarts not getting along. Ron is jealous that Harry is getting attention for competing in the tournament, Cedric Diggory is pitted against Harry despite them being from the same school, and Ron is jealous of Hermione's relationship with Viktor Krum. But soon the students realize there is more at stake than their arguments and winning the tournament. Something is not right and it seems that the dark forces are setting the stage for a major catastrophe. We see the friends ban together to help each other out. Cedric, Harry, Ron, and Hermione work together to figure out the tournament tasks. The events of the film's theme remind me a bit of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The four siblings in this film are often competitive and jealous of one another. The younger brother even sells out his siblings so he can become a prince. In the end, the siblings unite and fight for the greater good which is the safety and freedom of Narnians. They win battle against the White Witch and her followers with the help of their friend Aslan and good triumphs over evil. The themes good versus evil and the importance of family and friends and shows through this film as it does for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, several techniques are used to help enhance the theme. The lighting makes it clear whether the characters are in a laid back, peaceful setting or if they are in a dark, scary place, not knowing what is lurking around the corner. Good characters are seen in a white light, where followers of the dark lord, Voldemort, are often seen in dark, dim lit rooms or grave yards. Symbolism is also used in the film. Voldemort is portrayed as snake-like. In most cultures, serpents symbolize something that is considered creepy and deceitful. Wormtail, Voldemort's follower, is portrayed as rat-like. Wormtail had betrayed his friends for his own good by ratting them out. Though the film ends with a tragic event, we see the students of Hogwarts use the tragedy to pull closer together and strengthen their friendship, determined to stand and fight against the evil forces of Voldemort. The themes of good versus evil, friendship and family, rings throughout the film, to the very end."

","(Credit IMDb)<br/><br/>Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts is about to start and he is enjoying the summer vacation with his friends. They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 'Death Eaters' set a fire to all the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the 'Dark Mark' in the sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard Tournament', a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire. On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire remains the weakest of the series in my opinion, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film, in fact it's a very good one. There is still plenty of excitement, and action scenes that took my breath away, there was just something about it that felt off to me. Maybe it was just me, but I wasn't into it like I was the others. Though I've been treated to so many amazing Harry Potter films, my selfish side comes out. Criticism aside, it still does a lot right. Harry is entering darker territory now with each passing film, and it's a treat to watch. New relationships are formed, and we even get to see two of the most popular franchises team up. Edward Cullen from Twilight (I mean Cedric Diggory) and Harry. The ending itself is pretty effective, and made a lasting impact on me to be sure. I felt they didn't go far enough with the lingering conflict between Ron and Harry though, I'd have like to seen them carry it a bit further. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives.<br/><br/>Performances. Daniel Radcliffe is clearly into darker territory now and he's at the maturity stage to pull it off. He's getting better with each film. Emma Watson is feisty and charismatic as usual. Rupert Grint plays a snotty type for the better part of the first half or so, and did it effectively. He was good. Robert Pattinson is OK here, but his part isn't as big as it seems until the end. Jason Isaacs's wig is a bit of a shame but he plays menacing to a T, and had a presence. Tom Felton is decent as Draco, he plays his role well. The rest perform well.<br/><br/>Bottom line. My least favorite, but I still enjoy it very much. It's got all the ingredients to make your experience extremely enjoyable. If you're a Potter fan, and haven't checked out, I suggest you do so. Highly recommended<br/><br/>8 ½ /10"

"fridaynightdestination","9","0","1","6 November 2010"," The Dark Lord Returns, and gives us a PG-13!
","This is the first out of four Harry Potter films that are PG-13. Yeah, we don't know the rating of the 8th and last one yet, but it's obvious it will be PG-13. Anyway, the 4th Harry Potter film is a good movie. It gives us new charters, and a competition! You'll see it when you watch the movie. But this movie does have good humor, action, terror, etc. This movie has a PG-13 rating, and it does deserve it. It has I believe 6 swear words which may make your young ones uncomfortable. The last fight scene I think is the scariest and your little ones may be traumatized by Voldemort's new look and The Death Eaters. It will scare them seeing some one die, (this is the first Harry Potter film were someone dies) and seeing one of The Death Eaters cut his hand off and cut Harry Potter which does show a lot of blood, will most likely scare your young ones. I would recommend this film to children 10 and older. Younger ones may be able to handle it, but most definitely not 6 and younger. I have a 6 year old, and this movie gave him nightmares. But, I do think this is a good movie with lots of good fun. This film does end pretty much Part 1 of Harry Potter. I take the Harry Potter series as a two parter. The first four films Part 1 and the last four films Part 2. The end of this movie is the beginning of some of the darker Harry Potter films that little ones will find scary. SO, you have watched 4 out of 8 Harry Potter films. The first half. Now get ready for the epic climax that is the last 4 films! Now go out and get the 5th one!"
"wolverinesforever","9","0","1","31 October 2010"," Loose adaptation, but still a very fine film
","It took me a while to like this film. Five years and four viewings to be exact. When I first saw the film, like many other ""Harry Potter"" fans, I held it very accountable to its source material, so, naturally, the film did not hold up in my view. However, thanks to a few years of time and a push from a couple of friends who felt they considered this the best of the ""Harry Potter"" films, I decided to give ""The Goblet of Fire"" a clean slate and rewatch it. Lo and behold, I was surprised how much better the film played out.<br/><br/>I do want to establish first, however, that this is a loose adaptation. Do not expect the same experience you had with the book. There are no Dursleys, no mention of ""Weasleys Wizard Wheezes"" (although Fred and George do get more screen time here than they did in the previous three films combined, which James and Oliver Phelps use with mischievous glee), no Ludo Bagman, and no house-elves. I'm not saying these cuts have hurt the film (unlike some other reviewers), I'm simply saying that anyone who has only read the book or maybe held the film extremely accountable to the book should step back and accept that some changes are inevitable in the transition from book to film. <br/><br/>That being said, if you're willing to take the film for what it is, you may find yourself quite impressed with the results. Mike Newell, taking over from Alfonso Cuaron, does more than indicate something wicked is coming. Something wicked is HERE, hovering over Harry and his world like a black cloud. Klansman-like Death Eaters (Voldemort's supporters) are attacking citizens. A muggle caretaker is murdered by Lord Voldemort. And Harry is forced to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous series of tasks designed for students far more advanced and mature than he.<br/><br/>When thinking about what makes ""The Goblet of Fire"" work as a whole, I keep on thinking of what Dumbledore says near the end: ""Soon we must all face the choice, between what is right, and what is easy."" The tragedy of this story is, arguably, that too often, those above Harry choose the latter over the former. Despite all warnings, the Triwizard Tournament is continued, no one acknowledges Voldemort's potential return, and Harry is thrust into the thick of events despite his young age. What is lost at the end is more than just Cedric Diggory. I think what director Mike Newell and writer Steve Kloves try to emphasize is that the illusion of security, the belief that terrible events can be avoided, has been broken. Harry is starting to leave his childhood behind, and take on the adult responsibility of fending off an older, superior foe. By emphasizing the tragedy of the story and how that impacts Harry as he grows up, both Newell and Kloves demonstrate a good understanding of the darker emotional subtext.<br/><br/>It's not all doom and gloom though. Romance becomes an important subplot for the first time in Harry's life. We feel Harry's awkwardness as he asks a girl out for a new school dance (the Yule Ball). We also get to laugh as Ron handles his insecurities around women by acting like a prat (for lack of a better word). These scenes further strengthen the emotional subtext of the film, and put the onus squarely on the characters.<br/><br/>I think this is the first time Daniel Radcliffe truly holds his own as Harry Potter. He draws out the desperation Harry feels when he wants out of the tournament, and his reaction after his encounter with Lord Voldemort in the graveyard is near- perfect. Speaking of Voldemort, Ralph Fiennes expertly displays his calculated evil. Rupert Grint is used for more than comic relief, as he develops jealousy toward Harry after the actions of the Goblet of Fire. Likewise, Emma Watson continues to hold her own as Hermione. The other major supporting character, Dumbledore, is sometimes played with heart by Michael Gambon, but I did find him abrasive at times.<br/><br/>Fresh talent once again benefits a ""Harry Potter"" film. Along with Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson and Brendan Gleeson join the party as the gossip-whore Rita Skeeter and the clearly unstable Mad-Eye Moody (respectively). I wished we could have seen more of Tom Felton and Alan Rickman as Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape, but then again, they are not integral to the plot.<br/><br/>I'd also like to credit the film's composer, Patrick Doyle. One of my friends commented that, during the opening overture, you hear ""Hedwig's Theme"" in a minor key. It's ironic he'd say this, because ""Hedwig's Theme"" was composed in a minor key, the key of E minor. But because he opens with it in C minor, it sounds more ominous. Some other great themes he composes include ""Harry in Winter,"" ""The Hogwarts March,"" and ""The Hogwarts Hymn.""<br/><br/>Even when separating the film from the book, are there some weaknesses? In short, yes. Some of the action scenes, such as the Harry's standoff with a dragon, go on too long. Some plot questions aren't resolved, such as how Barty Crouch Jr. got out of Azkaban and what became of Ron and Hermione's relationship after the Yule Ball. I have already mentioned Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Still, those are small in comparison to the many positive traits this film holds. Newell keeps the story character-centered, and the cast continues to hold there own. The story serves as both a good tragedy and good coming-of-age tale. I also forgot to mention how funny the film can be, particularly with the buildup to the Yule Ball, but unfortunately, I'm bordering the 1,000 word limit. I'll admit I'm kind of surprised how differently I feel about this film now compared to my initial reaction, but when looking at it more closely, I find myself liking it more and more."
"kneiss1","9","0","2","16 October 2010"," On pretty much the same level like the other parts
","This movie is on an equal level compared to most of the other Harry potter movies. It is the most comparable to the 3rd part. There is a very similar feeling connected to it. Probably because they are only separated by 1 year from each other. The 3rd and 4th part are more mature, but less funny. In the 5th and 6th part, the movies change even more in that way.<br/><br/>In this part, Madeye has been introduced as a character. A greatly played and interesting character. You also see Voldemort again. And I have to say, this has been the biggest disappointment for me. Voldemort did't look, nor act scary. He jumped around like a 3 years old kid, that wants to fight his buddy Harry Potter. And he looked totally animated, and plain bad with his missing nose. I can't express how much Voldemorts appearance disappointed me. The dark lord, a computer animated clown. It's a complete miracle to me, how this was possible to happen."
"asydlow","8","0","1","12 October 2010"," A Very Enjoyable film, but recognize cultural bias
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was one of the most popular Hollywood films of the year. While the film is extremely enjoyable, it is important to take into account the cultural issues that the movie creates. HPGPF is a Hollywood film made with British actors, and therefore creates many of the same cultural biases that American film does with foreign nations. For example, we can see prevalent stereotypes of foreign nations that often appear in American made film. The French and Bulgarians are portrayed as beautiful, well build, or attractive, but are also generally taken to be stuck up or arrogant. Our hero, as well as most of the British characters, are portrayed as relatable and genuine. This bias seems to contradict the recent film trend of using more foreign actors, directors, and producers to make film. If there are so many outsiders in the film making world, why do these biases still appear? The answer lies in the simplicity of what we are viewers enjoy. Seeing these stereotypes that we are used to and understand make the movies easier for us to process. When we are American's watch foreign made film, we might be confused by the differences in film making, including, but not limited to, how indirect the messages might be, and how characters may not fall into the simple categories that we are used to.<br/><br/>In order to overcome these biases, we as viewers have to become more aware of our own media bias and what Hollywood wants us to see. If we watch a movie like Goblet of Fire, we have to acknowledge and discuss how characters and plot lines are being simplified to make them easier to process. We then need to expose ourselves to different types of media, be it Hollywood films that we would not normally watch, or foreign films that do not fir the general outline for film in America.<br/><br/>Despite all of the prevalent bias, Goblet of Fire is a highly enjoyable action movie which will leave most fans of the book satisfied."

The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess.

","You know, maybe after all this review will be neutral. On the one hand - in the film has everything to please, especially fans series, for which any occurrence of four-eyes with a scar - a holiday. On the other hand - in the film have been alarming trends that are unfortunately only amplified in the following films. And because he was obviously weaker than the Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>Still, try to adhere to objectivity.<br/><br/>Book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Rowling has traditionally been longer than the previous books. Do not just longer - it covers far more events, new characters, locations. Actually, in my opinion, it was an order of magnitude more difficult. Through the whole book is the idea of growing up - Harry and his friends are no longer children, teenagers and solve problems. This is the eternal themes of love and friendship - in the context of approximation of terrible evil.<br/><br/>New film was directed by Michael Newell.<br/><br/>Plot.<br/><br/>Already in the process of working on the film Newell repeated the obvious many fans - the book is too large for one film adaptation of one, so that the ""superfluous plot lines will be cut out.<br/><br/>In fact, the problem of course was a titanic. It was necessary to meet the exact Dynamics of between action-scenes (on the Quidditch World Cup, Triwizard Tournament) and a lot of ""boring"" (philosophical, intelligent) scenes where the characters reveal the characters and their motivations.<br/><br/>And I love potter kill me, I can not say that Newell handled. Pomo, chasing after two hares, Michael was unable to catch even one. The film is a shooter - but he is a lame (I do not know whether it is special effects, or just my personal delusion). But ""boring"" scenes cut a lot. As a result, motivation for the characters is unconvincing, and some plot lines were removed in principle.<br/><br/>For example, the film is essentially no relationship with Hermione Kramov on the ball ... But Ron was jealous of her, and that is what has caused the emergence of Lavender. And so - in the Cup of Fire is not romantic line with Kram, therefore it is not clear where in the mixed-bloods taken lavender.<br/><br/>From kino Harry Potter disappeared Percy Weasley. Of course he glimpsed in the episodes, but all writers have killed yet another excellent line. Percy - the prodigal son, a careerist who makes a career in the Ministry and worship of their superiors (starting with Crouch) all further moves away from his beloved family. It is interesting and very instructive line - but it is almost erased from kino potter.<br/><br/>Cut out a good part of the atrocities and explanations Barty Kraus ml. As a result, it appears an ordinary associate of Voldemort, but not crazy murderer of his father.<br/><br/>The result is somehow. And most importantly - someone not familiar with the books it would be really easy to get lost in what is happening on the screen. Heroes of the new lot, but distinct actions they have little.<br/><br/>Cast.<br/><br/>And then the movie looks good, only because once again, the key role entrusted to play an excellent actor.<br/><br/>One of the key roles was Brendan Gleeson (Alastor Grumiaux). I personally liked it. Fans certainly write, saying he was stout. Oh, and that - really aurora on pensions can not grow fat. But the image of a little insane veteran, having seen in his lifetime, almost all - were excellent.<br/><br/>Miranda Richardson in my opinion perfectly played local yellow journalist - Rita Skeeter. Pretty good casting for the role of champions - Pattison, Janevski and Posey (Diggory, Cram, Delacour) generally coped, although in my opinion Diggory lacks that aura of popularity, which is in the book. But maybe - this miscalculation writers, rather than acting.<br/><br/>Roger Lloyd Park and Pedzha Belak convincingly played Crouch and Karkarova respectively. Too bad their characters largely took much less time than it should.<br/><br/>David Tinnant generally good in the role of Barty Crouch Jr.. Not his fault that the writers have reduced his role to the level of small Voldemort follower.<br/><br/>Finally, in this movie the first time we saw another one, without a doubt the main character. Ralph Fiennes has shown us looks like Lord Voldemort, the man whom all feared, and not even pronounce his name.<br/><br/>Ahem ... honest its image leaves questions. Wash Voldemort trying to make a terrible terrible expense of the same appearance and voice. But he was not afraid of it. He is afraid of its own affairs, which he does without any emotion on his face, with a cold voice.<br/><br/>As always excellent Rickman and Gambon. Absolutely not understand the charge that Dumbledore's ""made eccentric. Dumbledore just play more screen time than in the first part. And he is not just a mentor, who simply threw in the characters on the right decisions, and also gave moral at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I myself am from Russia, Sochi, we have the popularity of Harry Potter's different, but its site - http://www.potter-style.ru I am developing the popularity of Harry Potter. In general, based on the findings above, we can say that the movie is not bad.

","This is the first ""Harry Potter"" film that is going to be significantly more powerful if you're familiar with the earlier movies. It's an exciting, beautifully produced film, of course, with wondrous visuals and an intelligent storyline. But, the relationships between Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) are richer when you consider their ongoing film friendships. And, most importantly, the appearance of the film's major villain is a climatic moment that elevates the entire series; it gives this entry the sweeping epic quality so longed for, and so rarely found.<br/><br/>Mike Newell takes over as director, from Alfonso Cuaron; it would have been nice to see Mr. Cuaron direct ""Goblet of Fire"" due to the storyline becoming more obviously romantic, but Mr. Newell's handling of the adventure is not merely adequate, it's exhilarating. One of the best things about the ""Potter"" films was the age appropriate casting. Yet, due to production scheduling, the young actors have gotten older than their roles; Radcliffe is supposed to be a young-looking fourteen. It's also apparent, by now, that however much they trim from Ms. Rowling's novels, these films are going to remain dense.<br/><br/>From the novel, enough was left out to make this film an alternate reality, which should always have been the filmmakers' objective.<br/><br/>Sagely Maggie Smith (as Minerva McGonagall) has a few things to say, this time around (but not as much as in the first two films), and Michael Gambon (as Albus Dumbledore) really grows into the role originated by Richard Harris. Newcomers making the most out of their parts are eyeful Brendan Gleeson (as Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody) and handsome Robert Pattinson (as Cedric Diggory).

"hte-trasme","8","0","1","31 January 2010"," Goblet up
","I've been watching the Harry Potter films in order without having read the books, and this has been my favorite by far, synthesizing and and adding to elements from its three predecessors to make a very satisfying film -- there's an easy-to-follow and clear but suspenseful story all the way through surrounding Harry's mysterious appointment to fight in the tournament and his travails in trying to compete in it, which drives the film very well; there's always somewhere to go and it never drags at its length of over two and a half hours.<br/><br/>The principles are getting old enough to explore early adulthood and this is handled very well and emphasized without bludgeoning -- we have reached a point where they now have legitimate character conflicts, which are the soul of drama. That means the interest doesn't just have to come from supernatural dangers that accost Harry and his friends, but is effective if not more when it comes from personal dangers between them. There's a whole subplot involving a kind of wizard prom that illustrates this -- it could have been the worst transplanted soap opera, but instead it's charming and involving.<br/><br/>There's a new character in ""MadEye"" Moody who I think is fantastic -- he's highly entertaining and off-the-wall unusual while still being somehow totally believable. Michael Gambon gets more to do as the wizard Dumbledore and plays the part with the same absolute conviction he always seems to summon. As a Doctor Who fan, I got some novelty from seeing a future Doctor, David Tennant, in a very different kind of role here.<br/><br/>The humor here is very good, and of a very human kind; it's woven with seamless integration into the unfolding of the story. The production design is up to the impossibly high standards of the previous films, and there is a new fantastical spookiness to the lavish film-making that works wonderfully.<br/><br/>On the whole this film seemed willing to go in a lot more subtle directions than the first three often wanted to, and by grounding its wild fantasy in a solid foundation on the good old fashioned elements of sound drama and a cracking good story came up with an extremely enjoyable movie."
"freemantle_uk","8","0","1","27 November 2009"," Action Packed Potter Film
","In terms of the books, Goblet of Fire is my favourite in the series, in the film series its around 3 or 4. The book was a well-written, well-built novel with a lot of subplots and full of surprises. The film is entertaining, action packed, but does have some faults.<br/><br/>Set in Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) fourth year at Hogwarts, dark times are starting to come with the Quidditch World Cup being raided by Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters, and Harry himself is suffering from a recurring nightmare involving Voldemort, Peter Pettigrew aka Wormtail (Timothy Spall) and a man being given a task to bring Harry to Voldemort (David Tennett before his Doctor Who fame). When Harry returns to Hogwarts the students learn that the school is going to host the Tri-Wizard tournament between 3 magic schools. The rules that Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) lays out is that no one under 17 could enter. That doesn't stop someone entering Harry for him, and he ends up having to compete in dangerous tasks against Hogwarts' champion, Cedric Diggory (Roger Patterson, pre-Twilight fame), Bulgarian wizard and Quidditich star Vickor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) and the beautiful French witch Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy). Hogwarts also gains a new Defence Against the Dark Art teacher, the nearly insane Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who aids Harry along the tasks with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson) and groundskeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). As well as the main story, there are sub-plots involving Harry and Ron's first falling out, Harry and Ron's quest to find a date to the Yule Ball, Harry's first crush with the lovely Cho Chang (Katie Leung) and hints of romantic involving between Harry and Hermione.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire is one of the longest books in the series, and it was inevitable that some elements were going to be shorten or be cut altogether. The Dursley's are cut altogether, so is most of the Quidditch World Cup and so is Hermione's quest to bring about equal rights to House Elves and pretty much becomes a witch version of a hippy. Some elements could have been spared and others could have be cut in their place. But I'm a purest and that is my curse. There are good additions to the cast, Brendan Gleeson and David Tennett are fine actors and add to the film. Robert Pattinson and Clémence Poésy are perfectly decent, whilst Katie Leung is lovely. Timothy Spall is excellent at Peter Pettigrew, continuing where he left off in Prisoner of Azkaban. But it is Ralph Fiennes who steals the show as Lord Voldemort. He is only in the film briefly, but he was really excellent as the force of evil. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all continue to improve as actors. Alan Rickman is a little underused and Maggie Smith was very underused.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron was ordinarily offered the director's chair, but he had to decline because he had to focus on post-production work on Prisoner of Azkaban. The producers turned to Mike Newell, a director with a decent reputation as a drama director, making films like Donnie Brasco. But he had no experience as a blockbuster director, and the marketing department made a big deal out of the first he was the first British director to direct a very British icon. Newell throws himself straight into the CGI special effects. He does direct some good action sequences, such as the dragon sequence and the fight with Voldemort. The scene involving Voldemort's resurrection is one of the best in the series. There are some decent moments of light comedy, though nothing really humorous. It's also good to see some big actors like Gary Oldman return for a cameo. There are some problems, Newell is not Cuaron, he doesn't have his visual flair nor as good at handling comedy or strong emotions. Some scenes like when Harry returns with Cedric's body are too overacted. I would have also like to have seen more involving the bad days of Minstry of Magic repression.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire is a bridging story between the innocent story arc of the first three books, to the darker stories afterwards and the major arc involving Harry's destiny against Voldemort. Goblet of Fire is important in the series showing Voldemort's return and has the first major death. It came a surprise when I first read the book. There are also elements like the fact that Cedric and Victor were actually pretty decent people, you could care about them in the book. However, one element that I didn't like in both the film and the book is showing two 17-year-old men going out with two 14-year-old girls; it's not a positive message.<br/><br/>Enjoyable fantasy."
"nerdeliciousbabe","8","0","1","26 August 2009"," The really complicated, romantic, reality Potter
","This Harry Potter was maybe my second or third favorite movie and my second favorite book. The tasks are a little rushed, like the dragon task and the maze task. I think our main wizards are starting to peak in puberty, when they start, you know, like-liking other wizards in the movie. Ron likes Fleur, one of the Beaubatons students, Hermione kinda, sorta likes Viktor Krum, but the movie doesn't make it obvious. And last, Harry likes Cho, who rejects his offer to the Yule Ball, and the camera is pointing at her for quite a bit of the film. The Yule Ball is not what I expected and the movie down-sized it a lot from the book. I especially liked the part of this scene when Fred(or is it George?) threw the paper wad at Angelina to ask her to the Ball. But those two had really long hair. But, I may be the only one thinking this, Cedric Diggory, played by Robert Pattinson(EEP!!)was so massively HOT. His looks in this movie were 100 times better, because he actually looked like he had blood inside his body. But overall, this movie was and 7 and a half stars, which rounds to 8. thanks bye"

","I have three favorite Harry Potter films. Ever since The Prisoner of Azkaban, the Harry Potter films lost their cute. They turned over to the dark side. In this Potter film, Harry, Ron, and Hermione return for their fourth year. Harry has been having dark dreams about THe Dark Lord(who is finally in this film and he doesn't disappoint. He is played by the fantastic Ralph Fienes). Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is entered into a tournament that he can't compete in. It's called THe Triwizard Tournament. He's underage. But he has to compete in it because the rules say he has to. Two other schools, from Beaxbatons and Bulgaria, will compete against Hogwarts. Robert Pattinson from Twilight makes his debut as Cedric Diggory, who is also representing Hogwarts. Also this year, they will be having The Yule Ball, a dance of some sort. Harry also has feelings for Cho(Katie Leung), who returns in the Order of the Phoenix. Of the three kids, Hermione is the only one to get lucky. No people i'm not talking about sex.Who do you think I am Sue? THe Goblet of Fire fits in my three way tie because it's so awesome. I had chills in the last half hour of the film. THe last half hour was evil and creepy, and I liked it. No i'm not a freak. I left out Brendan Gleeson. Every year, a new teacher comes to Hogwarts. This year, Mad Eye Moody(Brendan Gleeson) is the teacher and he is really weird. Harry potter and the Goblet of Fire will remain in my tie forever. None of the Potter films are disappointing."
"kai_h138","7","0","1","31 July 2009"," A good entry in the series
","Goblet of Fire is better than than first two films, as well as the fifth, but worse than Prisoner of Azkaban. I must admit that this film was better than I expected, but parts of it feels like a TV movie. Perhaps it's because of the weird cinematography, which is the main downfall of the movie.<br/><br/>In Goblet of Fire, the cinematography is slightly inconsistent. Some are grand and film-like, with wonderful tracking, dolly-ins and dolly-outs, while others are strangely static. Static oblique shots are also overused and come off as weird. Moreover, there's a wonderful shot that leads up to a shoe. In a field of static shots, it's one that feels out of place because of its shakiness. Had the preceding shots been hand-held, this great shot would've felt great too. It seems like it was trying to channel the exceptional cinematography of the third movie without fully copying it. However, this hurts the film as it feels disjointed. Some shots, like the establishing shot of the bridge are imitated. However, the director or cinematographer doesn't know how to use the shot. <br/><br/>In Prisoner of Azkaban, the bridge was a place for Harry to express his emotions and vent to Professor Lupin. They were both comfortable there because, not only were they misfits, but the bridge was a misfit as well, differing from the other bridges constructed out of stone. The composition and framing with the windows are exceptional as well, as it meant looking through a window to a person's deepest, innermost feelings. Goblet of Fire is different.<br/><br/>In this film, the bridge turns to a hang-out place, and the conversation that takes place could've taken place anywhere else. There was nothing particularly special about the bridge. This is the case with many of the scenes. Another example is with the introduction. There is a somewhat long take, showing the snake, Tom Riddle's grave, the title and the gardener's house. It was definitely promising; yet immediately after, the shots are static, and the long take then seems out of place. There's another part in the graveyard, where Voldemort was dumped in the pot. Slow motion bodies dropping in water looks incredibly cheesy! Another problem with the film is Emma Watson's acting.<br/><br/>Eyebrow acting is frowned about when acting for film, and if no one thought that it was bad, just look at Emma Watson. Her eyebrows move non-stop, becoming extremely distracting, invoking humor instead of seriousness. More disturbing is the hair.<br/><br/>In this case, it's not the hair of Hermione, who looks increasingly beautiful, but of the others. Harry's hair is extremely shaggy. At times, it's manageable, but there are parts where his hair doubles the size of his head. Also, the male Weasleys (not including the father) have hair suited for girls.However, there are many redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting of most other cast members have improved greatly. Whereas Harry's crying scene in Prisoner of Azkaban was slightly awkward, it was improved in Goblet of Fire. Unfortunately, the cries of the father had me chuckling for quite a while. Also, Dumbledore seems to be consistently angry, yelling every chance he talks. The acting of others are much better, though, allowing emotions to transfer on-screen to the audience. Another positive quality is the score.<br/><br/>Patrick Doyle is a wonderful composer - his score for Great Expectations was amazing, as is his score for Goblet of Fire. ""Harry in Winter"" is an amazing piece, and Doyle's adaptation of Hedwig's Theme with strings (instead of trumpets) works well. My only problem is how the music was presented in the film. It was either too loud, too quite or underutilized. By itself, the music rivals that of the third. In the movie, it was good, but not great. The addition of the ""rock band"" during the Yule Ball hurts Goblet of Fire as well. However, action and dialog are handled well enough.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is good, but with a different director, it could've been as good or better than the current pinnacle of the series, Prisoner of Azkaban (arguably)."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Reviewed by Terry ""Java Man"" Meehan Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2005.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW <br/><br/>The film opens in a large stadium where the Quidditch World Cup is in progress, and Ireland and Bulgaria are about to take to their brooms. As Harry and his pals (Radcliffe, Grint & Watson) are about to enjoy the spectacle, the stadium is attacked by a hoard of Klan-like pointy heads known as the Death Eaters -- minions of the feared Lord Voldemort (Fiennes), the arch-fiend who will be Potter's likely nemesis for the balance of the series. The Death Eaters are repelled, for now, and so its back to Hogwarts for the film's main storyline... the Triwizard Tournament. The other two competing schools are the husky, pumped-up boys from Durmstrang and the lithe and lovely girls from Beauxbaton. The imaginative arrival of the visiting teams sets the exciting tone for the rest of the film. The Goblet of Fire chooses the finalists -- one from each school -- each of whom must be at least 17 years old. As wide-eyed, 14-year old Harry looks on, he is astonished that the Goblet spits out an unprecedented fourth name... his. As Harry battles dragons and Death Eaters through mazes and lagoons, he must face up to the most daunting challenge of all... getting a date to the Triwizard Ball.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 1/2 Java Mugs out of 4 <br/><br/>If Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry were located anywhere in the real world, it would be forced to close its doors by protesting parents and outraged lawmakers. But,thankfully, the paranormal prep school exists in the imagination of author J.K. Rowling, and in our own collective imagination, thanks to Klove's bewitching screen writing and Newell's wizardly direction.<br/><br/>Though some of the miniature sets are given away by hasty camera moves, the film's production design more than adequately creates a wondrous world where witches and warlocks can live and work. England and Scotland provide stunning exteriors, while an endless supply of British prep schools contribute fascinating interiors.<br/><br/>The spine of the story, the Triwizard competition, is compelling and easy to follow, even for those unfamiliar with Rowling's rambling prose. Some younger viewers, however, may cringe at the scarier scenes, and thus the PG-13 rating. Subplots abound, and add immensely to the film's entertainment value... Coltrane's giant Hagrid finally finds romance with the even taller headmistress of Beauxbaton; and the 14-year-old leads agonize over how to get dates for the Triwizard Ball.<br/><br/>Radcliffe gives his best performance yet, and Watson continues to blossom into a sexy-smart scene stealer. The supporting cast is once again a who's who of a seemingly never-ending pool of Irish-English master actors and actresses. Especially welcome is the addition of Gleeson as ""Mad Eye"" Moody, the professor who teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts. His quick-pan, zoom-lens eye can spot a student goof-off from across the commons. Though Smith has fewer scenes this go-around, her Jean Brodie-esquire comment to a fellow faculty member is one of the funniest lines in the film.<br/><br/>This is a cinematic treat for anyone, young or old. And, you'll be happy to know, according to the credits that ""no dragons were harmed during the filming of this movie."""
"Red_Identity","Null","0","1","6 July 2009"," A thrilling, spectacularly epic film!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is perhaps the most complex of the Harry Potter films. There is a lot going on, and as an adaptation, it works for the most part. There are a few things changed, and some differences and flaws that I had trouble with, but overall, it is a great film. It has spectacular action sequences, amazing visual effects, and great set designs. The music score, while not as good as the score in prisoner of Azkaban, is still very pleasant. Daniel Radcliffe definitely shows an improvement over Prisoner, but still has some problems. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint play their character exactly how they are supposed to be, and I found that Hermione seemed much more bossy and over-protective in this film than the 3rd, which is more Hermione-ish from the books. Brenda Gleeson was perfect for this role! Some of the characters could have been further developed, like Fleur or Krum, but overall, a hugely entertaining and magical Potter film. The pacing, although fast, does not have the fluent steady tone of Prisoner's pace, or the wonderful cinematography or visuals. Prisoner's storytelling was much more developed and more interested with getting ideas across instead of rushing everything, and I think that is what makes it the best Potter film. But Goblet is still a great film"
"Stampsfightclub","8","0","1","20 March 2009"," A New darker world but at a cost
","Harry Potter (Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts for his forth year where he is mysteriously entered into the legendary Triwizard Tournament.<br/><br/>The forth instalment into the series and fans expectations were higher than ever after Prisoner of Azkaban broke minds with a darker promotion than the previous two and with established new director Mike Newell the franchise took on an even bigger hit with a more dismal but equally more entertaining look into the magical world ofmagic.<br/><br/>Opening with a strange montage we see a stranger enter a house where traitor Wormtail and a mystery man are conversing with some unknown man in a chair. Blinding green light later and we are in Ron Weasley's bedroom. This opening is dark and mysterious and whereas not appreciative of the opening chapter (a mere two or three minutes covering around 20 pages) will engage any Potter fan.<br/><br/>If, like me, you enjoyed J.K Rowling's forth instalment the most, then you will have looked for adrenaline soaked action sequences, a heap of mystery and some interesting new sequences then you are rewarded. But does this do justice to the book? Not really.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire was easily the longest book at the time of release. Filled with multitudes of mystery, main and sub plots, it engaged me into a world I thought did not exist. Dragons, underwater adventures, the return of a certain villain creating a big soap like story and the growing up guys like girls factor spells one entertaining film. What Newell's picture offers is all these elements but in a finely cut manner. Sharp and sophisticated it is great family entertainment with dark mystery and stunning visuals, but are extremely cut down. For example scenes which take four chapters to decode take ten minutes on screen (The Graveyard scene) and cutting so much out of the book makes you feel unappreciated for your patience. This is the case with most Potter films but this one most of all.<br/><br/>However despite the too quick scenes what makes Goblet of Fire special is what J.K Rowling created. The Dragon, the love and the hate are all still there and are handled in a stunning way, particularly the dragon sequence.<br/><br/>The actors all deliver with Ralph Fiennes in special sophistication form. Set designs are impressive though the fact Hogwarts changes so frequently throughout each film will undoubtedly annoy die hard fans.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire therefore is a good action packed sequel that still casts spells over fans but though enjoyably long, still misses so many important facts."

The plot revolves around a wizarding tournament and there are some good action set-pieces, most notably involving a deadly fire-breathing dragon. The script is hugely simplified to maintain the film's length. However, scenes dealing with Harry's first date and his inability to ask a girl out are retained, adding a touch of humor to the story.

","My Take: The Harry Potter series is growing up with its audience. This is a visually-stunning, but above all a witty and mature adventure. <br/><br/>In his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, our young Mr. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is faced with the new challenge: He is ""accidentally"" included in the dangerous and competitive Tri-Wizard Tournament, a dangerous competition in which students from other schools will challenge each other in order to win the legendary Tri-Wizard cup and eternal glory. Harry, who is too young to be appointed in the competition, is thrown into perilous situations, whether it's retrieving a golden egg from a dragon's lair or saving his friends from the clutches of mere-people. But the danger is far more dangerous than the competition itself. Who put Harry's name in the fabled Goblet of Fire? Is Lord Voldemort at the brink of resurrection now that his loyal servant, the double-crossing Petegrew (Timothy Spall) is exposed and awakening Voldemort's minions? Is Harry getting his first kiss in this movie? <br/><br/>By the time the series hit its fourth chapter, the series has moved from director to director to director. First was director Chris Colombus who has given us a sometimes dark, yet mostly heartwarming fantasy adventures. Then it's passed on to director Alfonso Cauron, a brilliant visionary, who crafts a deeper and more interesting adventure than Colombus' already wondrous dimensions. Now, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, is appointed to the loving hands of Brit director Mike Newell, who has great British films as FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and ENCHANTED APRIL to his credit. Since the POTTER films are usually associated with British actors, the director and material fit. On the unfortunate side however, Newell didn't top neither Cauron's AZKABAN nor Colombus' CHAMBER (Both my favorite movies in the series). But there's one thing in Newell's take that they lacked, and that's the show of maturity in its characters. AZKABAN only hinted that our characters are growing up, but GOBLET confirms it. The effects and action sequences are good and all, but perhaps my favorite scene in GOBLET is the Yule Ball sequence where we not only see are characters all grown up, but set aside magical goings-on for a little young love. After all, since the kids are growing up (and the audience is growing up with them), the series needs to catch up. <br/><br/>The action still sustains the audience, whether it's being chased by a dragon, battling with gruesome mere-people or passing through a perilous hedge maze, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is wild roller-coaster ride populated by clever special effects and fast pacing, but moving not too fast enough to disregard some of the tender moments.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

"robert_montana","9","0","1","21 September 2008"," A darker and better Harry Potter film; As good as Azkaban
","Year 4 turned into movie is more satisfying than Chris Columbus's version of year 1 and 2. Prisoner of Azkaban, year 3 is where the story gets darker and more realistic. Prisoner of Azkaban had a ground hog day touch to it. I found that Harry Potter has stopped being a kiddy adventure from year 3 onwards in the sense that it has got more adultish and realistic. This is due to the fact that the characters are growing up allowing them for more mature and logical actions . Chris Columbus made the 1 and 2 movies very cheerful in tone, bright and just apt for the kiddies. The story at that time (year1 and 2) had the gang as little kiddies (which is what they were back then). Azkaban changed the trend. And in here Mike Newell (from Four Weddings and a funeral fame) creates a realistic movie in so far as the stunts and violence goes. Harry suffers bruises, people die ,and real death looms. This in part also because the story is writtent that way and also because the director chooses to emphasize that the movie and adventure is entering a darker tone. The cinematographys uses a dark charcoalish shade informing us of the impeding doom to come. The cinematography is as Gothic, operatic and grand in scale as Azkaban was. The Yule ball is a nice interlude from the tri-wizard tournament and is reminiscent of high school proms. Lovely book and a lovely movie. The complaint that movie is not true to the book is utterly stupid as you cannot faithfully translate a 700 odd page book into a movie. So you compress, and these guys have got it right. They compressed the right bits. At the end the 700 pg book has to work as a piece of film seen in over 2.5 hrs. And it works just right."
"fearfulofspiders","7","0","1","11 September 2008"," Pretty Good...
","Despite the numerous flaws this series is becoming accustomed to, The Goblet of Fire is somewhat good. The acting isn't all there, though Brendan Gleeson pretty much steals the show, as well as Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. However, Michael Gambon was only half of what he was in The Prisoner of Azkaban, and his return is a little stale -- a fault also can be credited to Steve Kloves who made Dumbledore seem unlike the previous personalities from the first three films. Radcliffe and Grint are slightly weaker than the previous films as well, though Emma Watson has got to be the best of the teenage stars, as she convincingly portrays Hermione Granger unlike her earlier ones.<br/><br/>The special effects are vastly superior to The Order of the Phoenix and the previous three. The Hungarian Horntail is surprisingly great looking, though similarities can be seen between this beast and Buckbeak, as well as Voldemort's transformation. Other elements like the Merpeople and the flying horses were a tad phony -- a few touch-ups would've made room for more believability.<br/><br/>The script is pretty faithful. The subplot with the house-elves is left out, which basically obliterates any character development between Hermione and Ron. The gradual relationship between Harry and Ginny is absent as well, and there were a few scenes where they could've had an intimate moment or two -- especially with the Yule Ball, though it would've strayed from the source material, the writer(s) don't seem to care too much. The scene in the graveyard with Voldemort's recreation is almost exactly how I imagined it and was very well done; Harry's mother and father gave some stale performances when they reappeared briefly.<br/><br/>The music is not nearly as complex as Williams' previous scores, and Patrick Doyle is quite the unrealistic replacement for such an orchestral genius.<br/><br/>All in all, The Goblet of Fire is only as faithful to the source material as the series is as a whole, to which it fails in. The magic and vision is completely different, and more akin to the way I would've imagined the Potter universe, unlike Cuaron and Columbus'. I'd recommend a family to watch this, no matter how disappointed a fan (like myself) may be at the lack of continuity (especially for what lies ahead in the series) or charm amongst the characters. Equally disappointing as the rest, only slightly better thanks to a better vision."

","Yes, this was a beautiful adaptation. And you can clearly observe the fact that the director was English. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a bit too Mexican, while the first two films were simply American-like blockbusters. Though all of them were good. The main actors are giving a more mature interpretation of their characters, unlike Alfonso CuarÃ³n's version where they were more rebellious and ""cool"".<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe impressed by expressing Harry's original emotions from the book, through the movie. You can clearly see he is having so much fun playing Harry, while he is capable of more. He is showing more in every movie he does.<br/><br/>I spent a lot of times thinking whether Ralph Fiennes was the best Voldemort. I came to the conclusion that he probably wasn't, but I remembered the first time I saw ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" at the cinema, I was amazed, my first thought on Ralph was that he is the true Voldemort.<br/><br/>All the deaths in the movie specially Cedric's are so painful to Harry because he witnessed them all.<br/><br/>The screenplay was amazingly done to fit into a single movie, though I would have love the return of Dobbie.<br/><br/>My opinion is that Mike Newell gave an accurate Potter world, but I cannot say he was the best. I don't believe in the best when it comes to this movie franchise. Every director yet made a good movie, amazingly done, every each of them.

","Okay, I love Harry Potter. That's a given. But, the thing is, I don't like the fourth book so much.

Nothing really big. Actually, I think that PoA was more pivotal than this one. However, the movie was actually pretty good. I did like Goblet of Fire, but it's my least favorite entry in the series. But, I liked the way the movie was quite a bit. If the actors could just freeze time, and stay looking this way until the last one is released, I'd like it. They look great in this movie, and their acting is at the top of their game. Ralph Fiennes is scary, noseless, and awesome as Lord Voldemort. The whole graveyard scene was awesome, and I think it's better that they stayed on the ground when Priori Incantatem takes place. The special effects are great, and the movie is all around wonderful.

","I write this shortly after The Order of the Phoenix came out on DVD, so I'm going to dispense with commenting too much on the film itself because chances are most people already know what they think as far as this film goes.<br/><br/>I put this writing here because this is the first of the Harry Potter films for which John Williams has not done the music. He has also apparently bowed out from film #5 too. I wonder if he'll ever be back.<br/><br/>When I first saw this film, I actually stayed a long way through the end credits. A friend I went with asked why I was sitting around. I said, ""I've got to know who did the music because it couldn't possibly be Williams."" I was, of course, right.<br/><br/>I don't know why he's not doing it anymore. Maybe he overpriced himself. Maybe he's not getting along with the producers. Maybe he's too busy. Maybe he doesn't feel like it. Maybe he retired. It's as noticeable an absence as Richard Harris' Dumbledore, though. Williams has created a great deal of memorable film music which nearly everybody knows even if they don't know who wrote it.<br/><br/>He has always had a superb sense of what to do with an orchestra within the framework of films. The new people doing the soundtracks are adequate I suppose, but they lack the marvelous subtlety that Williams seems to pull off so effortlessly. I wish they'd get him back."

","Only because I have seen the Fifth movie. I loved the Goblet of Fire in it's paper backed form. And I loved what they did with the movie adaptation.<br/><br/>I knew going in that they were going to have to take a lot out of the story. So going in knowing that, really helped. I didn't hate that they cut Sirius' part down, but I was displeased that they chopped Voldamort's return speech so much. But even that couldn't make me hate the movie. The scenes in the grave yard were nice and chilling. I also liked how they use more cool colors. The red's were deepened the gold's dulled down. It was just a good effect.<br/><br/>The young actors stepped up their game, as they have for all the movies, to a new level. And all the older actors gave some great performances. Most notably Alan Rickman as Severus Snape. You really loath the guy, but I love to watch him work. So that just shows you how great an actor he is.<br/><br/>The only inconsistent actor is Michal Gambon. He did a wonderful job in the Prisoner of Azkaban, but this is a totally different person and it's not Dumbledore. They said that they wanted to show that he was frazzled but they could have done that without him shaking Harry around.<br/><br/>The Ron/Hermione relationship or whatever deepens and shows that Ron has a soft spot for her.<br/><br/>In the end. It's just a great story no matter if it's a movie or book."

","I must confess that I never read a Harry Potter Book, am not even very interested much in those fantasy things. But thanks to my sister, who is an H.P. addict I was forced to watch the Potter movies. While all other parts of the series so far only bored me quite a bit, this one ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the best in my opinion.<br/><br/>I can recommend it to just anyone, not only H.P. insiders. Compared to the other parts, the visual effects are very good, the movie has dense action throughout and is not only condensed into a two minute showdown while the two hours before are an ""sleeping aid"". <br/><br/>So even if you do not comprehend every aspect of what happens in case you did not read the book, it still entertains you very much. Now my only hope is that the successor of ""Order of the Phoenix"" namely ""The Half Blood Prince"" will be along the same lines as G.o.F."

","This movie was probably one of the worst Harry Potter movies. The movie seemed too quick and didn't seem like it was a whole movie that told the story of the full year at Hogwarts. There were major time gaps in the movie and it felt like the three events at the Tri-Wizard tournament made up the entire movie. More time should of been spent during the events that occurred between the challenges. On a positive side, the scenes of the tasks were very well done and I enjoyed them.

","Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, which is hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a noted test of magical strength. Harry is mysteriously entered in the competition and must battle it out through dangerous trials. Worse still, he is having dark dreams which forewarn him that his old nemesis, Lord Voldemort, is close at hand and gaining strength ...<br/><br/>The fourth Harry Potter film is both better and worse than its predecessors. It's better in that it's a more self-contained story which it plunges straight into, but it's worse for the same reason - it ditches all the introductions and a lot of the previous characters and it doesn't really have a beginning or an end; the competition is really just a backdrop for the overarching story of Voldemort's return. It's still bags of fun though, with all the brilliant imagination of J.K. Rowling's writing - a duel with a dragon, a spell that turns Harry into a webby fish-boy, three Unforgivable Curses, a mind-maze - and the consistent quality of film-making is as high as before, with excellent photography, production design and visual effects. The score this time is by Christopher Doyle, and he pulls off the tricky feat of incorporating the existing themes within a much darker, growling symphonic sound that brings out the grim direction of the plot. As with all the previous films there is an incredible extended cast of wonderful players with one outstanding - here it's Brendan Gleeson as the one-eyed, one-legged, potion-swigging, barmy Dark Arts teacher Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, the pivotal character. Gleeson gets it right on the money - physically he plays it as mad as march-hare, but dramatically completely straight, exactly the way good fantasy should be. There are also good turns from Richardson as the unpalatable tabloid hack Rita Skeeter, De La Tour as an unlikely giantess, Oldman as a special-effect in a fireplace and Fiennes as the serpentine uber-villain You Know Who. Overall, I think the law of diminishing returns applies to this series, as it usually does in movies, but it still has more than enough good ideas and intriguing characters to justify itself. Good fun. Dedicated to casting director Mary Selway, a key figure in the British film industry, who worked on about a hundred films since the sixties."
"Pilsung89","10","0","1","17 August 2007"," Leave childhood behind forever
","It's year four at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weaseley. In the third movie, they were showing signs of leaving childhood. In this fourth film, childhood is completely left behind and our trio of young heroes enter the world of teen-hood, with no turning back.<br/><br/>The acting is better than Prisoner of Azkaban, especially from Emma Watson. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson all do exceptionally well in transforming their characters from the young children in the first two films, to maturing teenagers. That transition was sort of rusty in Prisoner of Azkaban. Alan Rickman continues his great performance as Severus Snape. Having seen Rickman in other movies, I know that only he can portray professor Snape in that harsh, mean, but actually caring way. Sirius Black has a brief appearance. Peter Pettigrew also returns to help revive he-who-must-not-be-named. Yet another defense against the dark arts teacher comes to town as well. They seem to have trouble keeping dark arts defense teachers. By this film Harry, Hermione, and Ron treat the world of magic like a normal place completely.<br/><br/>Heres the plot: Hogwarts this year is hosting the triwizard tournament, a competition where 3 students, each from a different magic school, compete in a series of magical contests. Due to the complexity and very dangerous nature the events often come with, the ministry has decided only students 17 and older can enter their name for the tournament. However, despite the best magical barriers protecting the Goblet of fire, Harry's name appears and he becomes a contestant. Even though he didn't enter his name, and none of the professors want to put him in danger, the rules bind him to compete. Now he must compete against three other wizards, all older and therefore better trained, in a series of dangerous tasks. Through these tasks Harry resorts to nerve, cunning, and courage to succeed and survive. MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!! In the final event, Harry and Cedric Diggory, another competitor, are lured to a trap from dark followers, and Cedric is murdered as sacrifice to bring Voldermort to full health, and the dark lord returns, with Harry barely escaping thanks to his parents. END MAJOR SPOILER!!! <br/><br/>The subplots show how Harry, Ron, and Hermione are growing up. Harry and Ron actually have their first real fight. This is because Ron thinks Harry used magic to place his own name in the Goblet of fire, leading to a temporary silent period between the two. The eventual spark of love to come between Ron and Hermione becomes more evident when Ron is jealous Hermione is asked by another boy from a another school to a dance. It clearly becomes evident how much Hermione cares for Harry as a friend as well, without there being romance. It's clear in two scenes: When Hermione hugs Harry before the first event, obviously afraid for him. Also when Hermione talks to Harry after the second event. Hermione is now my favorite character, and I love her friendship and loyalty with Harry. She's always by his side, even when Ron is mad at him.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. Emma Watson delivers a much better performance than in Prisoner of Azkaban. She's one of my favorite actresses. There's plenty of drama and action. Just be ready. They're not kids anymore. They're teenagers with teenage problems and attitudes. I give this a 10/10."

The plot is easily to follow (a not inconsiderable feat as the book is very long) and there are some fantastic set-pieces as Harry takes on dragons, vicious mermaids eventually, The Enemy.<br/><br/>Acting is great, with Brendon Gleeson on fine form as new teacher Moody. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, as Ron and Hermione, get to really flex their acting chops in a well played romantic sub-plot. Emma Watson has got an unfair drubbing from some critics, but she does herself proud here.

","I love the Harry Potter series, I own all of the books and the movies. This being said I would like to say that I enjoyed the movie, i thought that all in all it did a good job. I do wish that it had a little more than just the Triwizard Tournament. Because the movie centered around the tournament it seemed rushed. Having read the book I felt that I didn't even know what was going on at the beginning of the movie because it was so chaotic. The best part of the movie was the graveyard scene, although it was a too short and Voldemort has more mood swings than a pregnant woman, Ralph Fiennes does a good job. The graveyard scene was satisfactory. The absolute WORST part of the movie was the inclusion of Barty Crouch Jr. at the beginning and his face at the world cup. It was completely unnecessary and ruined the big reveal."

","If you have read my reviews to this point, you know I was disappointed with the 3rd film. My disappointment was replaced with enthusiasm here with Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>Dumbledore is better represented as the headmaster this go around. In my opinion, he was turned into a kindly old man in the 3rd film. This time around we actually are given more inclination that he really is in charge.<br/><br/>All of the kids have stepped up their performances once again and that remains the one continual improvement with each film. Again, this goes back to them being cast excellently in the first film and that is paying off in spades with each subsequent film.<br/><br/>I still feel the Malfoy's and Snape continue to be lost in the continuing new character carousel, but that was tempered this go around with an excellent story.<br/><br/>The score is the only thing lacking in this 4th entry. John Williams is no longer at the helm and it is VERY evident. The score is a competent entries, but it lacks the style, magic and atmosphere that Williams created in the first 3 films. At least the main Potter theme is still there, but the franchise is the lessor without Williams' contribution to the scores.<br/><br/>After a disappointing 3rd entry, Goblet of Fire got me excited about the franchise again."
"Quinoa1984","7","0","2","15 July 2007"," not the best of the 'Potter' movies, but it's got some captivating sights and even extraordinary scenes
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire pushes the franchise into the PG-13 level, and for good reason: Lord Voldermort, played to a chillingly Gothic T by Ralph Fiennes, is much more present not just as an ominous, unnamed presence, but as a vindictive, murderous threat from the grave. He's the Nosferatu of the ""Potter"" series, but with a further sense of dread that is the unwavering sense of pure evil in such a world of wizards and magic. But Goblet of Fire isn't just about the evil, or just put-on evil by way of a curse or other dark forces at work, though it's in this that the film works usually at its strongest and most surreal points. There's a whole section dedicated to a new form of competition: get the dragon's egg in the Triwizard tournament. Some of this is compelling, mostly involving the actual under-water part of the tournament, where the suspense level isn't very high but it's highly watchable for its interesting look. How does one see ""magic"" happen underwater? <br/><br/>If there perhaps is any significant problem, or perhaps just big gripe, to have with Goblet of Fire it's that as an emotional experience of the conventional kind it works much better on a first viewing, in the theater, where the big crescendo happens (murder is a key factor here, of a character I won't mention), and one gets caught up in the first truly significant tragedy in the series, if not the film. But on a repeat viewing, somehow, this is lessened in impact, and if anything there's certain flaws in some of the performances (a father's wailing cries, to not spoil too much for those who haven't seen the movie or read the book, are pretty poorly delivered), and even what seemed like really riveting scenes of competition- and some of the quasi-teen drama developments involving Harry's friends- seem a little more contrived or just not as interesting as before. But on the other hand, director Mike Newell finds ways to make his entry in the franchise watchable in many tight areas. Brendan Gleeson was a great choice for Professor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, who has a look about him where, as with Rickman's Snape, you can't totally be sure what his intentions or alliances side. And there's some moments of levity thrown in in good levels of measure.<br/><br/>But, if for nothing else, the aspect of the strange, violent and, as far as a series like this can go at this point as the mid-way movie, incredibly dark presence of Voldemort, with Fiennes's physical prowess going past the fact that he's under lots of make-up (or CGI) and pitting to the most effective villains in contemporary big-budget big-studio movie-making. To put it another way, if the last half hour or so pops up again on TV, I'll be sure to watch it all the way to the end. 7.5/10"

","Harry's fourth summer and the following year at Hogwarts are marked by the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament, in which student representatives from three different wizarding schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. However, Voldemort's Death Eaters are gaining strength and even creating the Dark Mark giving evidence that the Dark Lord is ready to rise again.<br/><br/>In the unsuspecting lives of the young wizard and witches at Hogwarts the competitors are selected by the goblet of fire, which this year makes a very surprising announcement: Hogwarts will have two representatives in the tournament, including Harry Potter! Will Harry be able to rise to the challenge for the Tri Wizard Tournament while keeping up with school or will the challenges along with Voldemort's rebirth be too much for the young hero?<br/><br/>This movie is the best entry in the Harry Potter series yet! It's weird. Each film gets better and better. For regular folks (who never read the books), you will enjoy this film immensely. For Harry Potter fans (like me), it'll depend. Unlike the first two films, this (and the third) focuses more on the story, instead of making a 15 hour movie. No doubt this film is the darkest yet, receiving a PG-13. Parents need to take that as caution because there are things too scary for little children.<br/><br/>Yeah, I was quite disappointed they cut out and revised so many thing in the movie but you know what? Who cares? I loved every moment in this film. I really didn't mind the revisions and editing. You got to hand it to Steve Kloves who does a hell of a job writing the scripts and J.K. Rowling writing the books.<br/><br/>Like I said in the past three films, this film isn't all about the action and special effects. It contains more mature roles on the three main cast and it has a plot, unlike many dumb popcorn movie. The performances by the main cast (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) are better and their interaction is still great. You'll find them engaging.<br/><br/>The special effects (which gets better in every film) is terrific. There are even more action scenes in here, some which are mind blowing and keeps you to the edge of your seats. The set designs are even better and the whole ""teen romance"" is a bit exaggerated but it's fantastic! The music is different in here, and it's better. The cinematography is also good.<br/><br/>I think Mike Newell does a terrific job on delivering this book to the screen. Although some fans will not like it for the huge cuts, some will love it for that very reason. Average movie goers will also love this. This, not only the best entry so far, this is one of the best movies of 2005!"
"Will52","10","0","1","12 July 2007"," Could Have Been Better in some parts
","I am a fan of the books and for me this movie was a bit disappointing in some parts. First the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was a terrible decision. Especially the scene after Harry is selected as the fourth Triwizard champion is badly done, when Dumbledore walks in, he does not handle the situation calmly and carefully as in the book, in the movie he seems rash and by shaking and shouting at Harry he makes the situation seem far from the one portrayed in the book. Richard Harris was much better in the role of Dumbledore, when he was in a scene you knew that this is a very wise and cautious wizard with a calm and majestic presence as is portrayed in the books. Apart from the change in actors, Dumbledore's wardrobe seems to have also gone downhill from the second movie, in Goblet of Fire just like in the Prisoner of Azkaban Dumbledore looks like he is dressed in rags compared to the robes Richard Harris was wearing in the first two movies. Another badly done part of the movie was the maze. For those who have not read the books the maze probably looked amazing and I agree it had some good special effects nonetheless compared with the book it was a bit boring. The maze was meant to test different abilities of the champions, like the sphinx Harry had to overcome in the book or the upside-down charm. The maze in the movie had none of these elements and I think this was one part that could have definitely been improved with some work. Despite its flaws Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire had some spectacular special effects, I especially liked the Dragon scene, it also had a good flow and it was never boring. The Yule Ball scenes were also excellent. Maybe someday someone will take on the task to create a Harry Potter Series which will follow the books 100%, I am sure there are a lot of Harry Potter fans out there that would like to see the things they read about to come to life. I would highly recommend everyone to go and see this movie, however my advice is to first read the books and create your own ideas of what it should look like before seeing someone else's images on the screen."

","I am a HUGE fan of the books, which can either be a good or bad thing when it comes to the movies.<br/><br/>Now, I am going to be a bit critical, but not because it's a bad movie. Just expressing some of my frustrations with it.<br/><br/>It is always very interesting to see a movie of a book you have read, just to see how each scene and character is adapted and see it played out as it did in your head. That is the fun part. But it can also be frustrating when the movie leaves out a lot of the plot. In this particular movie, some big plot points and even a few characters that have crucial parts in the books are left out.<br/><br/>That said, it was still a wonderful movie. I think people could enjoy this whether they have read the book or not. It explains everything it needs to in order for the viewer to understand what is going on and has a fast pace. This is also much more engaging than the last ones, some of the scenes are just fantastic.<br/><br/>The acting is great and it is so fun to see all of the characters grow up.<br/><br/>But just a few points of the movie that weren't my favorite: 1) It seemed a little ""dark"" to me. Not the story, because I know the story is supposed to be dark, but actually just the lighting and the filming. Sometimes it was just to hard to see stuff, and was kind of depressing.<br/><br/>2) I didn't like that they don't develop the character of Harry as much as they do in the book. I wish they could have a way of showing what he is thinking. To me, it kind of seemed like he was just this happy-go-lucky guy for most of the movie, just smiling and having some fun. But this isn't how it is in the book at all. Harry is a very troubled character, and I wish they could show this in the movie better.<br/><br/>3) Dumbledore is not at all how he is in the book. In the book Dumbledore is a very calm wizard and never raises his voice or anything, but several times in the movie he yells and even grabs and shakes Harry. It is just so completely opposite of the character in the book.<br/><br/>But really, despite my frustrations it is an amazing movie and certainly worth watching."

","Going into Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire I was very excited,seeing as how it was my favorite book,and plus all of the trailers leading up to the film looked to be very promising.Upon seeing the film I must say I enjoyed it, it was a tad different from the book in a few areas, but it was a solid entry in this already classic franchise.<br/><br/>The film begins with Harry(Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends going to the Quidditch World Cup,where after the match the Death Eaters(Voldermort's followers) arrive and attack all that were at the match.During the mass panic and confusion Harry finds himself knocked out to only awaken later to find the campsite empty and destroyed,but he sees a man fire the Dark Mark(Voldermort's sign) into the sky.Shortly thereafter Harry regroups with his friends and they return to school to learn that this year Hogwarts will play host to the Triwizard Tournament,a competition between two other wizarding schools where all students wishing to compete will enter their names into the Goblet of Fire,and those chosen must face three very deadly tasks,the only catch is you must be 17 years of age or older.Naturally the three champions are selected,but one more name pops out after those three and it is 14 year old Harry(who didn't put his name in the goblet).Now Harry must compete in this deadly tournament where he must face a deadly fire-breathing dragon,dive into the depths of the Black Lake,and journey through an endless maze.In the midst of these tasks Harry must rekindle his friendship with Ron(Rupert Grint),discover who put his name in the goblet,and he has to tackle his most challenging task to date:girls,all of this leads up to the return of Lord Voldermort.<br/><br/>As usual the film excelled in practically all areas. The cinematography and production design were just as great and stunning as in previous films in the series,as well the score is quite good, not as memorable as the John Williams scores from the first three films, but still good and performs the job that a film score is supposed to perform.They also changed directors once more,the new guy Mike Newell does a very good job with his source material being able to maintain much of the look and tone of the first three,and when working in a franchise that is a pretty big deal.The two show stealer's though this time around is the acting,great performances all around,and the special effects, which are just downright superb.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier our teens are now discovering members of the opposite sex,and these scenes in particular are just downright hilarious and gives any teen comedy a run for its money.Plus the better special effects go hand-in-hand with the great action this film has to offer,being quite possibly the most action packed Potter film to date.As well the emotional climax at the end of the film is very sad and can even possibly make you shed a tear leading to the first sad ending to a Harry Potter film.<br/><br/>All in all it is another great entry in the Harry Potter series. There are tons of laughs to be had,more action,and just as much emotion as the first three to make this one a very satisfying addition to the Potter franchise.<br/><br/>An entertaining: 10/10!!!!"
"kelc_mishthegreat_02","9","0","1","24 June 2007"," Step up from the last installment
","Each new Potter installment out does it's predecessor.<br/><br/>This is particularly evident with this film. While Alfonso Cuaron brought Gothic visuals to the third film, Mike Newell (director) brings great vigour to this installment.<br/><br/>While I believe that Azkaban came closer to conveying the book, this film is still a little better than the last. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a much darker installment, the darkness mixed with the light, humorous and romantic events of the Yule Ball (a ball that takes place at Hogwarts because of the Triwizard Tournament, which Harry has been unwillingly chosen to compete in).<br/><br/>The Yule Ball sequence is one of the most memorable and enjoyable sequences of the film; the cast get spiffed up in their ball gowns and tuxedos except Rupert Grint (whom plays Ron Weasley) who has to wear a ragged, horrible looking thing.<br/><br/>Love is in the air at the Yule Ball, Harry proves he is hopeless when it comes to conversing with the opposite sex, getting tongue-tied and standing there looking like an absolute tool.<br/><br/>It's all very awkward, giddy and British. But I love it.<br/><br/>The special effects are really something to marvel at, if you believe that they are special effects at all.<br/><br/>The Hungararian Horntail (dragon) which Harry faces looks so real that I did not even question that it was a special effect; I was just sitting in the cinema utterly engrossed in the film. The whole dragon sequence is overblown but thrilling.<br/><br/>The film becomes even more darker (if that is possible) when Harry's enemy Lord Voldemort makes a much anticipated appearance. He's pasty, skeletal and has no nose. It's freaky.<br/><br/>The actors are definitely improving; Emma Watson as Hermione is still the best out of the trio (watch out for her shining moments at the Yule Ball), Daniel Radcliffe rises to the occasion and delivers his best performance in the Graveyard scene.<br/><br/>The one performance I really feel that should be acknowledged is Rupert Grint's performance. He's seen as the third wheel in the trio in the films, but in this film he delivers a much more nuanced performance, playing a delightfully jealous Ron. We finally get to see Grint's acting chops.<br/><br/>Yes, there are deep cuts in in the material from the book in this film, but I believe that (and I say this as a book fan) it's about staying true to the STORY, not necessarily the book.<br/><br/>As long as the important stuff that foreshadows the future is not left out, which it hasn't been.<br/><br/>Besides, the whole film has been crammed full of knowledge already so much that I feel sorry for the people who haven't read the books; the cogs in their brains must be in some serious need of re-oiling.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film is one thrilling adventure of highs and lows, funny moments and sad and frightening moments.

"jacky121993","7","0","1","13 June 2007"," Reflections of the movie
","After seeing the movie, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I am enchanted by the special effects and amazing magic power in the movie. However, it is still full of friendship, love, justice, which always touches my heart. Among so many characters, Ron impresses me a lot.<br/><br/>An old saying goes ""friend in need, a friend indeed."" Ron is absolutely this kind of friend. No matter what trouble Harry encounters. Ron always stands by him and helps him overcome it to the best of his ability. In this movie, nevertheless, their friendship faces a tough test. He is angry with Harry for no telling him how to put the name into the Goblet of Fire. Besides, Ron is jealous about Harry for being one of the champions. To my delight, they apologize to each other and become good friends again. Furthermore, if I were to be a Girl, I would dance with him to encourage him. I will tell him not to care about what he wears. In fact he is the most handsome in the crowd.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Lord Voldemort, a villain in this movie is the one I hate most. He is brutal and merciless and kills persons at random. For instance, he kills Cedric Diggory just because he is the witness on the spot where he shouldn't be. How innocent Diggory is! How evil Voldemort is! This is why I hate him. In my opinion, Voldemort will pay for it someday."

","I didn't start enjoying the Harry Potter series until movie three came out . The first two movies were good, but not fantastic. The third movie was the first one in the series to be fantastic. Azkaban set the bar for the next movies in the series to be amazing and that's what the Goblet of Fire is; it's amazing. The suspense and fear you feel for Harry when watching him preform the three tasks captures the mood of the novel perfectly. Also, the final scene with Harry in the graveyard is by far the best ending scene in any Harry Potter movie to date. The actors are maturing along with the movies and I can't wait to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix after watching this. The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a perfect score would have to be the Yule Ball scene (drags on a tad too long). Other than that, Go Harry!"

","When I heard that the next movie will be coming out in a few weeks, I was really excited. I'd wait week by week until the movie came. And finally, I was going to watch it! While I was watching the movie, i understood it fairly well, but my friends who haven't read the book kept on asking me questions.<br/><br/>The only things I could say about this movie is that it is truly awesome on the visuals. Honestly, i was really waiting for this movie for months, and I felt that the waiting was worth while anyway.<br/><br/>I must say, I was really impressed with the movie. This movie has got the nice humorous part that brings the little laughs in the theater. I just feel that this movie has got everything that could have been thought of. It's a good weekend movie to begin with.<br/><br/>However, the content of the movie makes the book look bad! I mean i love the books, but this one is the most disappointing on the story part of it. If you haven't read the book, you will not understand what on earth they are talking about. For example, people would know what a gryndilow is!!! I think the script was a bit flawed.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that Daniel Radcliffe looks absolutely older than the original harry potter. The hair was absolutely terrible! I would suggest he kept it like the one in the third movie because it fits best for the scruffy hair. I'm also wondering why they do not wear their uniforms anymore? well, they hardly wore it anyway. Plus, the long hair really made them look older that what they were supposed to look like. I also don't know how Harry had that muscles when in the book, they said he looked really ""peaky""? Unless Uncle Vernon actually made him work out in summer, there's no way he could achieve those. I guess Daniel Radcliffe just worked out, but it really shows.<br/><br/>How come they kept on cutting the good parts of the book? Like all the teasing and stuff? Like how cho chang was actually important in the book when in the movie, she looked like this small time girl who harry likes? I believe they should have made more of an impact with this character than the rest of the extra sorts (like viktor, digory)? Cho Chang was the crush of harry potter! and in the next movie, they are going to make out! And in the 6th movie, they are supposed to break up! If they couldn't build up the foundation of Cho Chang, all hopes will be lost for the desired Cho Chang because the people who haven't read the book hardly even remembered her!!!"
"walsh-22","9","0","1","15 May 2007"," A lot more scarier
","I don't think the film is any darker than the others in the series. The overall story was dark to begin with, Harry's parents being killed by Voldemort and then Voldemort trying to kill Harry, who was a baby at the time. The film is a lot more scarier and I found myself jumping a lot in this film, unlike the other gentler movies.<br/><br/>One of the key differences is that we see a popular student die at the end and we have watched him from the beginning and it is shocking the manner in which he is killed, very quickly and without any remorse. Another difference is the film ends on a cliffhanger, where Voldemort becomes powerful again and is now back to lead his followers. In the past films, there has been a resolution to the story and the audience has gone away happy but in this one, it is a very unhappy ending and we have to wait to the next one to see if Voldemort is defeated. Lucky for me, I have heard the books so I know there will be no happy conclusion for another few movies.<br/><br/>I have to agree with one of the reviewers that the scene where Dumbledore grabs Harry violently is totally out of character for him, as up to this point, we have see him as a kindly old grandfather figure who has always been gentle with Harry. It just doesn't sit right with what the audience have seen in the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore in the past.<br/><br/>The new character introduced in the film, Mad eye Moody played by Brendan Gleeson is brilliant, it was good casting and he works really well with how I pictured Mad eye Moody from reading the book.<br/><br/>The film explores what its like for the younger characters in their teens. One is the awkwardness of fancing someone and having to ask them out and either being accepted or rejected. Harry has a crush on Cho Chang but is rejected by the girl of his dreams for the popular Diggory and has to settle for one of his classmates. Ron and Hermione's relationship develops from one of friendship to something a lot deeper. This film explores more about how they feel uncomfortable around one another because of their feelings but won't admit to each other how much they care. In the last two films, this was only hinted at. The other problem that plaques teens is appearance. Case in point, Ron wearing an old fashioned wizard cloak and feeling embarrassment that he is the only one to be dressed this way.<br/><br/>There is also an appearance from the future Doctor Who David Tennant, he plays a nasty piece of work in this.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next film to see how it differs from the book."

","If there's one movie that a person can go crazy for, it's gotta be Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. So far I've seen it three times, and the movie is just so breathtaking. It's interesting, and with so many topics in it, Harry Potter attracts just about any kind of audience. For those who love thrillers, suspense, and a little horror, Lord Voldemorts' rebirth will make you hang on to the edge of your seat, praying that nothing's going to happen to poor Harry. For the die-hard Harry Potter fans (like me), they will be so deep into the movie, you can barely get them back to life. Unless you've decided to be anti-potter, this movie will take you to another world, and let you feel like you're part of a certain character. To sum it all up, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one roller coaster ride that will take you through some truly magical scenes, but the movie is so good... it's just like magic."

","Symbolism<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire exhibits imaginary, fantasy, and life-like visuals in all scenes of this adventurous film. Producers take aspects from J.K Rowlings Harry Potter series and equips them into the movie. Special Effects artists use symbolism to represent the general mood and personality traits of each character. The graveyard is the site where Voldemort and Harry Potter battle. Voldemorts appearance can be described as dirty, unkempt and atrocious. The outline of his veins are very distinct on his scalp and his nostrils are introduced as small, tiny slits. As the two rivals battle special effects come into play expressing specific colors for each character according to personality. Harry Potter produces red sparks out of his wand when he bravely shouts a disarming charm at Voldemort. Red is very strong and vibrate expressing that Harry Potter is brave, intelligent and fearless. Voldemort releases a strand of green out of his wand. Green was the same color of the Dark Mark in the beginning of the film. Similar examples of symbolism can be found in the rest of the motion picture.<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>The main characters of this motion picture demonstrated the ability and talent needed to make this film a success. The three main characters Harry, Ron, and Hermione have changed completely over the years they have been working together on this project. All three young stars started out scarred and meek. There performance was unsatisfactory. They have budded into beautiful flowers knowing the business inside and out. They can produce different voices throughout the film and can easily portray these roles in all situations. The only character that needs work is Albus Dumbledore. Richard Harris had a twinkle in his eye behind his half moon speck-tics that came teenagers the illusion of not knowing what this wise man is thinking and not thinking. Richard has a wit and charm that makes all his words come to life. His morals and interesting view of life made the first two movies most memorable. Michael Gambon has said clever metaphors and similes but he desperately does not know how and when to deliver these lines.<br/><br/>In Closing<br/><br/>The Harry Potter films have improved over the years. As technology gets discovered, matures, and grows the movies are better and better. Year 5 is around the corner and we will see the secrets that lie inside this future motion picture in do time."
"Dream_seeker","9","0","1","30 April 2007"," Still a great movie but a bit rushed in some areas
","Having reading mostly all the Harry potter books (except the final story) I've come to realize that these are definitely the definitive adventure stories of a boy coming of age and dealing with a huge weight on his shoulders of saving the world...typical you think but not so typical when you are Harry potter and this is another feat his in task.<br/><br/>Harry potter and the goblet of fire is the Fourth story of a seven part adventure and believe me it gets darker and darker with each story and this is of no exception; the very upcoming talent of Daniel Radcliff returns once again as the still learning Harry potter the only difference now is that he is coming out of his own as he faces a new school year, a few new friends, as well as adolescence as he has a new crush of the very attractive cho chang (Katie Leung) but there's more to it than meets the eye and of course something wicked is growing beneath the shadows and a new danger awaits potter and his friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and the comical Ronald Weesley (Rupert Grint) but this is nothing new for the boy who lived as this is natural for him and his team.<br/><br/>The movie don't get me wrong is another great adaptation of the book itself; it simplistic approach keeps the pace good and still brings the feel of the book to life on film...the characters are good and still funny and at times you know they have grown up when you realized the jokes are more grown up as well and in a way I'm sure that's what J.K. Rowling's wanted from the book and movie after all. The people are fleshed out from its childish nature of the previous movies so what you get is a more deeper tone to the movie which puts the movie in a serious category so expect more darker areas to be dealt with like the feeling of death and torture cause the time of childish play is over and this movie seemed to put that and make it known to the viewers that watch it as well but still adds the comical feel from the previous movies and that's still good.<br/><br/>So when there's good there's also bad to this as well. Even though the characters were growing and more detailed they were also too dramatic as well. It sometimes felt that each of the characters overplayed the part and you can tell as the movie progresses you often would wonder or even say to yourself, ""that's a bit OVERDONE"" or, ""okay it's not that serious calm down!"" Dumbledore (played by Michael Gambon) in the book you find him as a very calm, intelligent, and a man that is one step ahead of the game than most people and no matter what you think he very rarely shows anger and if he does the book describe him as a man that can just look at you and you can tell if he's upset or otherwise....again this goes back to being overplayed and that's what happen it didn't really feel like the Dumbledore that you read about more like the man that had a big anger chip on his shoulder which that made me laugh at bit cause I thought it was funny how it was acted out.<br/><br/>Also, the movie was a bit too rushed...director Mike Newell knew what he was doing and of course being that the actual book is nearly almost 300+ pages one can't cover all of the visions on a grand scale which is understandable but don't watch the movie expecting stuff that you read in the book cause unlike the previous movies you're not going to get it...in fact, you will ask yourself, ""wait...there was a part missing here"" or, ""where's this character he was suppose to be here"" or even, ""They completely took that out"" in fact there are a lot of missing scenes that didn't cover nor explain completely...the DVD version has no deleted scenes unlike the other ones so a Harry potter fan would be somewhat disappointed at the fact that some scenes are gone to sacrifice for a much shorter film which can be a good or bad thing depending on your take but for me personally it was a bad move.<br/><br/>All in all, despite of all of what it lacks this movie still held the end of its bargain in being an all time great movie not just for kids alone but for adults as well; and as HP grows so does the content and this is of no exception there is a dark cloud coming and its dealt with greatly in this movie...special effects are great as usual, and the connections between the characters are very good in some part and Ralph finnens as Voldemort was a very good choice cause he played the part very well...but don't go expecting the full book version cause that's not what you will get sadly...but expect a good ride of adventure, peril, as well as tragedy and all that put together makes a good movie and Harry potter and the goblet of fire is still that damn good! 9/10"
"ScarletSwimmer","7","0","1","14 April 2007"," The Best Story So Far
","This was the longest book of the series so far, so consequently several subplots were left out from the books, but I thought it was still done well. This was also the darkest, and so of course we are finding out more about Harry and his past, as well as his future. This was also must more accurate with the first two than the third one, but the care-free, trouble making days are long gone(though to be fair, they're still trouble makers).<br/><br/>I also feel a strong connection to this movie because this is what got me hooked on Harry Potter. I had not read any of the books or watched any of the movies prior, but watching it in the theaters peaked my interest. Once I picked up that first book, I didn't put it down till I had finished book six.<br/><br/>This movie gave me much hope of what to expect next summer with The Order of the Pheonix. The movies are headed in the right direction, and this one is not one to be missed."

","Young wizard Harry Potter is deeply troubled by a recurring dream in which something terrifying occurs. Once re-enrolled at Hogwarts, he's selected for inexplicable reasons to be a representative in the annual Triwizard Tournament, an intense competition in which the best wizards prove themselves by completing a series of rigorous challenges. To make matters worse, the evil Lord Voldemort returns to try and claim revenge against the heroic young wizard. Imperfect but very entertaining entry loses some momentum in the middle as it gets sidetracked by a distracting subplot, but other than that it's a visual smörgåsbord of magic and craftsmanship, and has an exciting, edge of your seat climax. Never quite as rousing or awe-inspiring as the Prisoner of Azkaban, but a fun-filled adventure just the same, with enough joy for young children, and enough edge and sophistication for adults. ***"

","Wow, this movie...no this series, is so completely amazing. J.K. Rowling is a genius to write such wonderful books and the movie is spectacular. It just has a way of opening the kid in all of us, the part that still believes in magic. There were a few things that I think could have been changed. I would have like if the movie were more like the book. I really don't like it when some directors decide to practically change the whole story from its original book, like Ella Enchanted. I loved that book but the movie wasn't nearly as good. You know what I mean? Any way, Daniel Radcliffe looks fabulous. I mean he's a really good Harry Potter, i cant imagine anyone else being Harry Potter."
"NotAnotherMovieCritic","7","0","1","4 March 2007"," Not The Best But It's Better Than 'Prisoner of Azkaban'
","I was very worried about this film being made considering that this is my favorite Harry Potter book so far (and I've read them all). At first I heard they were wanting to take this film and put it into two parts, which would have been a great idea but would have been weird.<br/><br/>I went into this film with the worry left over from 'Prisoner of Azkaban', but came out with less worry. I wasn't completely letdown like I was in the previous film, but I was still letdown. However, I know how hard it is to make a film based upon such a thick book, but I have seen better before.<br/><br/>I did love this movie however, but there were many things I disliked about the film. Like the previous one it wouldn't matter for people who hadn't read the books. Not as many plot holes like the previous film, but there are still some that only avid fans like me would notice.<br/><br/>I recommend it to both readers and non-readers. However, I need to say to the readers of the books who haven't seen this film to just know that its not as great as the book (which is probably a DUH considering most films based upon books are not ever close to the books).<br/><br/>That is why I give it a 7/10.<br/><br/>Love Always & Blessed Be, Xander Trotter"
"film_am_03","7","0","1","20 February 2007"," Better than I thought after the first viewing, though that doesn't say a whole lot!
","The most disappointing of the first four movies for a number of reasons, GoF is a good movie though significantly different from the books. I wouldn't be bothered too much by the differences with the book, but it is important to recognize that there are some crucial aspects to the story that one can't change or ignore. In any story of the genres associated with this story (coming of age and fantasy), until the end of the story, the young and growing hero learns from a mentor who is the intellectual fulcrum of the story just as the hero is the emotional fulcrum. We experience the growth and the emotional upheaval of the story with the hero but are comforted (just as the hero is) in the guidance of his/her mentor. This setup allows the focus to dwell on learning about the world the hero inhabits and the various tools needed to survive in that world. The mentor represents the storehouse of all knowledge about the world that we enter, inhabit and learn about (along with the hero). Thus the mentor also represents a sense of stability of the world. Only when the hero is ""ready"" is this stability removed and this is done usually by the loss of mentor or loss of contact with the mentor. For those who are not into fantasy and/or coming of age genres, consider the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings. (LoTR messed it up a bit as well, especially in the 3rd movie, but nothing so major.) The most disappointing feature of GoF was that both the emotional and the intellectual fulcrums are muddled. This results chiefly from the characterization of Dumbledore. Gambon gets the lion's share of the blame. Kloves and Newell are also to blame, Newell in particular for not restraining Gambon at all. It looks like they were all cheering for Dumbledore to lose all his marbles. Dumbledore in this movie is haunted, confused, scared, lost and so on - all that Harry is supposed to be! So, all sorts of dynamics in the movie are misplaced and there's a sense of chaos. May be they wanted to convey chaos, but we are supposed to feel Harry's sense of chaos, not that the entire wizarding world is lost. That happens in the future. Besides, as long as Dumbledore is around, there ought to be hope. That's the general idea. Here it's confusion galore! This weakness is major, because it shows that the people behind the scenes possibly don't understand the genre as much. That does not bode well for the rest of the movies.<br/><br/>The second biggest weakness of the movie is that everyone, including the death eaters started calling Voldemort by name! After establishing the You-Know-Who theme so heavily in the first three movies, hearing his name so often really undercut the terror he's supposed to project. Yeah, You-Know-Who is a really cheesy name, I'll grant that. But the whole point is that Voldemort's name shouldn't be used, except by a select few. If not, he becomes a regular-issue villain. Besides, who in the world imagined Ralph Fiennes' look? They really, really need to be fired. Voldemort is supposed to have RED eyes, no nose, is supposed to be bony like a clothed skeleton. Ralph Fiennes camped it up unrestrainedly (much like Gambon did) and that severely undercut the power of the movie. Frankly, I wouldn't have minded Voldemort being computer generated with motion capture (like a cross of Sauron's look and Gollum's filming technique in LoTR). Having an identifiable actor, however much his face was distorted, provided a human quality to Voldemort, significantly reducing his menace. Once again, fantasy villains are supposed to be really, really creepy. Why is Darth Vader, Sauron and every other fantasy villain cloaked and hidden? Revealing who they are makes them pedestrian. Once again, this doesn't bode very well for the rest of the series.<br/><br/>Other than that, I'll not complain too much. Special effects are fairly brilliant, though the changes made from the book were not all good or even necessary. Performances, except that of Michael Gambon, are good. Quidditch world cup was a sore tease. They could've shown two minutes of the game! I always imagined a certain class to death eaters. Mostly, they looked like amateurs. The first task with the dragon was done well. The third task was mostly disaster for anyone who has read the book, but those who haven't won't feel much of a loss. The movie looks fabulous, score's good and overall it's a good entry. Just much, much short of the greatness the book is. So far GoF is the second best book in the series for me (closely behind OotP). This movie is the worst of the adaptations. That summarizes it all."

","I'm a big 'Harry Potter' fan. I have read all the books and know are re-reading them because of the summer release of the seventh book and I also have all four of the movies, however the fourth one was not as great as I thought it would be. I know they can't put everything in the movie because the books were so long. I was hoping they would put in the house elves again, I loved Dobby in the second book and film. I was also hoping they would show Bill and Charlie Weasley joining there family to the Quidditch game. I was hoping to see Oliver Wood again, I loved him in the first two movies. Overall it still was good. The directer and the producers did a great job keeping to the book. However, my favorite book so far is the 'Order of Pheniox' and my favorite movie out of all four for know is the 'Chamber of Secrets'. Christian Coulson did a great job as the young evil Voldermort."
"AndyP2609","9","0","2","20 January 2007"," Excellent but 'different'
","I've now watched the film several times, and although a number of the scenes are different to those in the book, they certainly do not spoil the enjoyment of the film. The different slant on the way the maze was done, and the extra added scenes (the dance lesson with McGonagall and Ron is particularly good - I think Rupert Grint has a real future in comedic roles) were great. The three main actors are definitely growing into their roles, and the speculation after the first couple of films, as to whether they would not stay to do all seven, is proving to be false. I'm glad, as I would now find it hard to imagine anyone else in the roles! The only disappointments for me were the lack of Quidditch World Cup action, and that some of the characters from the book (Ludo Bagman, Amos Diggory) were either completely different from how they were described, or missing completely. My one hope now is that, like the LoTR trilogy, that they think about releasing a 'director's cut' version of each of the films, as they must have LOADS of extra scenes!"
"SincerelyMichael","Null","0","1","18 December 2006"," Well made, another classic!
","All Harry Potter films made so far, like the novels on which they are based are instant classics as soon as they are released, with excellent performances from most of the cast, even the younger actors. They also have amazing digital and CG effects. Perhaps the best things about HP films is that each one seems more amazing than the next, and the films have the same magical lustre as the novels, despite minor plot trimming.<br/><br/>Like it's 3 predecessors, The Goblet of Fire is an extraordinary epic fantasy movie, and of course was a big hit at the box office, and will undoubtedly go on to sell millions of copies of the DVD.<br/><br/>This film shows the perkier, more feminine side of Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and an even more mature Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). Ron (Rupert Grint) is just as hilarious as ever, and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton)just as deviously nasty. I won't reveal any plot details for anyone who hasn't seen the film or read the book yet, though.<br/><br/>Let me tell you there are as many, if not more, twists and turns in the plot as the last film, Prisonner of Azkaban. There is enough adventure, magic, emotion, and laughs to last until The Order of the Pheonix comes out! So, I must say, this movie is a must see!"

I think that if they didn't have such phenomenal actors and actresses this movie wouldn't be half as good as it is! This is a really good sequel to the third book!

","In the whole I thought ""Goblet if Fire"" was better than ""Chamber of Secrets"" and ""Prisoner of Azkhaban"". However, I was very disappointed by the scene in the cemetery. The Deatheaters,especially Luscious Malfoy and Wormtail didn't seem to be at all afraid of Voldemort. It seemed they were just a bit apprehensive. Wormtail wasn't even in pain when he cut off his own arm. Voldemort himself did not project that sense of power and dread that readers of JK Rowling have come to expect from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. There wasn't enough suspense. I thought that instead of putting the effort into the dragon scenes they should've enhanced the cemetery scene. The book is so much better!!!!!"

(to say the least) but overall i was fascinated and i'm all excited about the next film - Order of the Phoenix. Daniel Radcliffe was again amazing!!!!!!!! unbelievable. my favourite scene was the dragon scene i loved it to pieces!!!!!!! legend film and Daniel Radcliffe - what a fit hot guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love him so much. i mean i am so harry potter's number 1 fan!!!!!!!! they've been great and i don't want them to stop. i was very sad and on the verge of tears when Cedric died and even more so when his dad started crying - that was awful. love you Dan Radcliffe and the gang you were magnificent!!!!!"
"lordzedd-3","9","0","1","11 November 2006"," Seems like the series is getting darker and darker
","But that doesn't really bother me, this is the first Harry Potter movie to be rated PG-13, which is a little harsh considering what happens. I've seen more violence in a plan PG movies in the old days. The rating board is too strict, it's time to reform of dissolve the rating system. Other countries don't blind fold children from he very world around us. that's just stupid. Anyway, about the movie, the characters are all there, I like the new character of Madeye. Now Harry has to face something more terrifying then giant three headed dogs, men with two faces, giant spiders, giant snakes that kill by looking at you or even fire breathing dragons, asking a girl out on a date. That's one terror he may not be able to face. Anyway, I didn't like the fight between Harry and Ron, good friends shouldn't fight over stupid things."

"senortuffy","7","0","1","5 November 2006"," The fire grows dim
","This is the fourth film in the Harry Potter series, and the franchise seems to be running out of steam. Not as fresh as the others, this one seems repetitive in its story line and almost tedious. At a running time of over two and a half hours, it drags at times.<br/><br/>The threesome of Harry, Hermione, and Weasley are now in their mid-teens and beginning to show interest in the opposite sex. The story line about Harry facing up to the dark forces that killed his parents is advanced some, though a final resolution is obviously being left for a future film. Some well-done computer imaging almost makes up for the lack of a good plot.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is pretty amazing. The best actors in British film play a variety of roles. Ralph Fiennes shows up near the end as the evil one, Lord Voldemort. Miranda Richardson plays a ditzy gossip columnist, Rita Skeeter. Brendan Gleeson is introduced as a crazy one-eyed professor. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, and Jason Isaacs all return in roles played in previous Potter films.<br/><br/>I think the director tried to cram too much into the film, but overall, it's good entertainment. Future films will certainly deal with the confrontation with Voldemort and the question of any love interest between Harry and Hermione, but I hope the next director eases off on the special effects and gets a good scriptwriter instead."
"liquido_dex","10","0","2","2 November 2006"," The best movie so far in the series
","Harry potter and the goblet of fire is by far the best move from the Harry potter series. It not only talks a bout common teenage issues like, dating, asking a girl out for a dance, but also the magic and dark side comes to a climax. Lord Voldermort reappears as a vile, mutation of snake and human, full of hate towards Harry.<br/><br/>This movie even thought was tough at least in the beginning for kids, is scary, and dark. The movie also includes a titian size production. The creation of the Hungarian dragon was a big challenge when trying to attach to the author s details. The enormous water tank that had to be created to film the underwater tasks in the lake of the deep was one of this moves best features. The actors had to learn how to dive and control her breath in each shoot since no essence was more than 7 seconds long.<br/><br/>Over all this move is full of excitement, love, magic and it also comes with a live maze. I can't wait to see the next movie, but at the same time it graves me some nostalgia the fact that I know there is only one book left and 3 moves to go. One thing is for sure, to overthrown the goblet of fire with the order of the phoenix is not going to be an easy job"

","Once again, the Harry Potter books receive a hugely successful film adaptation - with beautiful effects, good acting, gripping plots and situations and the great John Williams score. (However, this film was not composed by John Williams - but the score still was good.) But this film is probably Potter's best adventure yet - the film's 12A certificate is justified, and shows that the Potter films do not need to keep within limits. The ending is powerfully done, the underwater scenes in the middle are done eerily and with no flaws, the film once again stays loyal to the book, and the scene in which the Quidditch World Cup was attacked was not only done action-packed, but also harrowingly. This was probably the least forgettable of all the Harry Potter films - I sure do hope that number 5 will live up to the reputations set by this and the others, and that Sirius' death will be done in a way that is greater than anything in this film. The DVD release was worthy of this great film. The Goblet of Fire had a sharp script, beautifully done action sequences and effects, good acting (which proves that Richard Harris' death has not destroyed the film), and good direction - another huge success for the boy wizard. A stunning job! 10/10"

","This film 'Goblet Of Fire' is the best film of Harry Potter series in my view.I am a fan of Harry Potter myself.The specialty of this film is that no scene is irrelevant.Every scene has its importance and relevance of its own now or little later.This makes it even more exciting and interesting.The suspense, thrill and horror keeps the viewers stick to the film till the end.The choice of characters is superb, specially Prof. Moory,Dumbledore And Offcourse Lord Voldemort.Their entry captures the screen.This film is also a transition period for a child Harry who is transforming into an adult magician.Everything happening in the screen has a dual purpose;one for the entire world of people and the other for..............To put in a nutshell,I had never seen a film like this before which could satisfy me completely.I wish to salute the JK Rowling And director of this film."
"kjreiter","7","0","1","24 October 2006"," Great Action, Terrible Character Managment
","This fourth Harry Potter movie did a decent job of condensing such a large book. As mentioned in many of the previous reviews, several plot lines and characters were left out. Most notably, no house elves, Dursleys, Veela, Rita Skeeter the Beetle, Hagrid's blast ended skrewts, and the Barty Crouch story. The movie crushes the first 150 pages of the book into about 10 minutes and after a very short International Quidditch match finds itself at Hogwarts in which students from other wizarding schools are also arriving for an extended stay and a chance to compete in the Tri-Wizarding Cup.<br/><br/>This movie focused mainly on the Tournament and its challenges. I thought these parts were all handled very well. They were exciting and kept the viewers attention. I also enjoyed the Yule Ball, and Professor Mad Eye Moody's lesson on the unforgivable curses. A special treat was Harry's bathtub scene with ghost, Moaning Myrtle. I didn't care for Moaning Myrtle's portrayal in the 2nd movie but this one makes me hope we see her again.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with this movie is how the writers and director messed up some of the most important characters. To start, there was not nearly enough Snape. He is one of the most engaging characters to watch. The parts we did see of him did not convey that he is one of Harry's biggest antagonist. No late night encounters in the hallways. No potions class. And no discussions between Karkroff and Snape. I think we saw him for about 5 minutes at best.<br/><br/>Fleur's character was also handled poorly. In the book she is described as a beautiful girl who is part Veela. Her hair is long, blond and pretty. She speaks with a French accent that adds to her sexiness. In the movie, we hear very little from her as she has few lines. For the entire movie, her hair is tide up in an unbecoming ponytail. I'm at a complete loss as to why they treated her character the way they did and can only conclude that they either did not read the book or did not want to show up Hermoine. Moaning Myrtal was more engaging than this portrayal of Fleur.<br/><br/>Of all of the character flaws, my biggest gripe is Gamdon's portrayal of Albus Dumbledore. I understand he may have a different acting style than the late Richard Harris but he is wrecking the character. Dumbledore is thoughtful, powerful, wise, and in total control of Hogwarts. He is the most powerful wizard of his time and is the only one Voldemort ever feared. This Dumbledore is no more ready to take on Voldemort or the Ministry of Magic than he is two students cheating on an exam. The Dumbledore I saw was confused and frightened. It's time for the screen writers and directors to pay attention to the books and the first two movies to obtain a better example of who Dumbledore is and how he behaves.<br/><br/>This movie was overall, enjoyable to watch, however, I considered the book to be one of the most important. It would have been far better to have made this large, complex and enjoyable book into 2 two hour movies as opposed to 1 three hour movie. The movies treatment of the tournament and Voldemort's return was good, however, it felt like it was a filler for something better and more important to happen in the future. So much was left out that it makes me wonder how they will deal will things in the 5th movie. Good Saturday afternoon viewing."

","I am a complete and utter die hard fan of the Harry Potter series and i have to say that this is the best movie yet. Although i adore the other 3, this one is in a different class of its own, with the acting and special effects. I have to point out some bad things as well. The one thing i was genuinely disappointed about was the fact that only one classroom scene was in the whole movie. that is what i liked about the other films, we got to see them in actual school surroundings. Anyway i definitely wasn't disappointed with the action scene particularly the 3 tasks and Voldemort's reappearance. wow was i scared when i first saw Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. and even though i have read the book and i knew what was going to happen i did shed a tear when Cedric was murdered. Although things went a bit too fast and for non-readers of the series they will be confused at times, Mike Newell did very well for such a long book. Of course i went and pre-ordered the DVD as soon as i could and watch it at least 3 times a week!"

"bachwiz18","9","0","1","21 October 2006"," Very good
","Overall, this movie was better than the previous three, and ALMOST perfect. There were many mistakes/goofs in the movies that, believe me, are nearly impossible to notice, and it seemed far too short. I understand that they had to edit some parts out, but I think a 2 1/2 hour movie doesn't do a 730-page book justice. I can only hope that the 5th movie will be longer...<br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way, I can get to the compliments. First of all, I applaud the realistic shots of the Second Task, which were actually filmed in a giant water tank. The First Task was also very spectacular through and through, and the build-up with Harry in the tent is very intense. However, the Third Task could've been a bit longer, as it is the most crucial and was longer reading in the book.<br/><br/>I have nothing bad to say about the graveyard scene with Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes does an incredible job with the Dark Lord's character, and I don't think any other actor could have done him justice. The Priori Incantatem was spectacular, and I watched it several times when I got the DVD. The emotional bit when Harry returned to Hogwarts with Cedric['s body] was a bit stretched, though, as Harry's initial reaction when Wormatail killed Cedric wasn't as...well...sob-inducing. It was a bit embarrassing to see almost everyone in my theater crying at the scene, as it is a fictional character and I didn't find it moving at all. Professor Moody's character was also very well-done.<br/><br/>However, the few mistakes are made up for with the humor, from Filch's repeated early firing of the cannon to Ron waltzing with McGonagall. I think that this movie might have gotten a lower rating if it weren't for the humor, which wasn't as desperate for laughs as I found Movie 3's humor to be at times. I highly recommend the IMAX version of this movie, although probably not available anymore, but I would've given it a 10 for sure. If there was a 3-D version of the movie, I would've given it an 11.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to everyone, Potter fan or not. Definitely the best in the movie series so far."

Now, i'm not letting this movie down. I think they did a good job in making it. We see a darker side of harry potter in this movie. But how could they take a 756 page book, and turn it into a two and a half hour movie. If i was the one writing the screenplay, i would have made it longer. This movie is a whole lot better then the first three, although the third one remains my fav. <br/><br/>I give this movie a 9/10. It's a whole lot better then the first movies."
"sushi0208","10","0","2","12 October 2006"," Bravo from Grolkisdon (II)!
","I believe that this wonderful Harry Potter film was very nearly, as we say in the town of Grolkisdon, ""Sehr Blauschmut"". However, I would like to point out a few trifling details I spotted while I was lustily watching this exhibit. Firstly, I must point out that the 234th hair on the left hemisphere of Miss Emma Watson's head was at an angle of 2.5 degrees, when it should really have been at 2.6 degrees. Very disappointing, I say. Secondly, at 22 minutes and 43 seconds, the wrist movement of the spell, ""Poco Rallentando"" was not quite at the correct tempo and enunciation. The result of this would have theoretically produced a flying elephant, instead of the flying mouse intended. Thirdly, I am quite sure that Mr. Rupert Grint's hair tint was of the colour ""Raddish Red 23.4 + Carrot Orange 2.5 + Ginger Ginger 456.4"" and not, as it should have been, ""Raddish Red 23.4 + Carrot Orange 2.5 + Ginger Ginger 457.4."" As you should know, a difference of one extra Ginger Ginger tint can make a ""Grossengross"" difference. As for Mr. Daniel Radcliffe, there are simply too many incorrect movements and characteristics to mention them all. However, one of the most obvious and noticeable was that of his incorrectly positioned nose  his nose should really be of a length of 2.45 inches, when it happened to actually be 2.58 cm. This was rather alarming, and ""Munchküntin,"" as the population of Grolkisdon would have said. Another glaring mistake was that the pronunciation of the name, ""Professor McGonagall"" at 120 minutes and 3 seconds, was at a pitch of 212 Hz, and as you should know, the proper pitch for such a word is in fact 424 Hz. When I heard this improper speech, I was so disturbed that I actually shouted, ""Lëntauschaumt!"" as we say in Grolkisdon. However, aside from these mistakes, I must say that I highly enjoyed this movie and would most certainly recommend this for all species of cat."

","I believe that they were doing a great movie until they started to add all of the cussing into it. I believe that you can make a movie and have it rated G in the language and have a great movie. They did it in all the other movies except for Ron now and then and they were all hits. So I think it could have been a 10 but they blew it with the cussing. I am a new watcher of the Harry Potter movies and I love the movies. It was just disappointing when they started to add all the cussing. I'm not big on ruining a movie with cussing and that makes my vote on it lower a lot. I am eagerly awaiting for the next movie to come out but I hope that they will try to go back to the G rated language."

","This contains spoilers: I object to The Princess Hermione being scripted as a nag. <br/><br/>I have only read the five most recent pages of comments. <br/><br/>Magic. What I have read is for and against. Some see massive flaws in loved stories. To others these are brilliant and true to the feel of good stories as they know good to be. <br/><br/>To me, these are captivating films, but also captured works. I understand these stories and my perception to have been tied up by something akin to He Who Must Not Be Michael Gerber. That is the only explanation that I have for the flaws. <br/><br/>Disaster. How Dumbledore's ways feel tied up in HP 4, TGOF, not in TPOA, so as to have the music taken away, a Bumble-door prune. How Princess Hermione The Great is scripted as an old nag and Emma liking it so. How the scenes between the lake and the maze miss out on a build up of plot. How the final curtains talk makes me think that Vol-De-Morgue has already won. How I got scared of HP 5 before it appears. Has J K been imprisoned too? <br/><br/>I understand that the feminist revolution was effective for that sort of situation, women having been tied up for thousands of years. However I understand the solution to have been effective for effective women, men too, but criminalising for the weak or dented. Used to be I had qualms re witchcraft stories. <br/><br/>For me to openly and effectively say that I feel the need for some sort of SPEW, I am living dangerously. When faced with a fool there are many who start slithering. I am also at risk of big trouble from the cures. <br/><br/>Then I read the book. I like it that the films never wobble the same as the book. My first viewing of 4 after that was wow. That happened as I drafted this as well. Magic. <br/><br/>The books read as by someone with reasonable skills in knowing sensible and practical ways to live life, effective legs. For me the films are maybe by people who are more down to earth, living in worlds with different rules. I obviously guess things wrong a lot, I am from a different world, but that explains the differences to me. <br/><br/>The paperback I have has cover blurb that this is a darker story than the others. Advertising words now true for the film but I cannot accept them of the book. HP 4 sets a tone of why this is a path that Harry and co need to follow for the Vol-De-Mod situation to be properly appeased. It shines as the most optimistic of these four. <br/><br/>I would really like it if Columbus returned for HP 7. For 7 to be two or three or four films, a Beat-Oven finale. My hope partly comes from his treatment of The One Who Flows, Hermione Nose. Ron had his Scabbers, I show error correction symptoms by knowing that I would like the role of a trans lesbian Crookshanks for the Granger of HP 1 and 2, even 3. One of many Hippogryff dances, curse or blessing. <br/><br/>Crookshanks can mean many different things. Bent lower legs. Bent as a natural for Slytherin. Having been bent and trying to get by. <br/><br/>This leads to Dumbledore 4 and physical contact: A Vol-die view, an inept old woman, not an inept pet. I assume a New Ell statement. Dumbledore 3's physical contact with Ron was not Old Woman and Cuarón revelled in a potentially lethal approach to contact by Her with Malfoy. The New Ell petrifies Harry in his bath, transforms Dumb and Gran-her and creates a Who Done It. Who would notice? <br/><br/>Will there be alternative versions available from the cutting room floor? <br/><br/>New Ell is day to day reality. I notice hints of this triggering some sort of war; against Newell, against some of the actors. I like the concept of an alternate version as it could work to try to calm this. I am likely being unreal. <br/><br/>The HP series has had such as Cuarón and Doyle willing to take part. To me, SPEW is wondering what is needed to be supportive to making their works fly. Put like that a fan can feel powerless, but a fan can note what happens when these fly. If it is an impossible question then at least there is a fan question there. A need to be in tune with SPEW that points in the right direction, in an okay way. Hippogriff dances need not be fire gobs. <br/><br/>With Tinker Belle it was simply stated: I Do Believe In Fairies, I Do I Do. Would that Leavesden Castle was just full of wannabe fairies in need of a safe world for making their films in. But this is a world where many are happy to express a disbelief in the fairy worlds. Or only to express belief for the deserving. <br/><br/>My last posting, for Nearly No Christmas, had a problem re automatic error correction of spelling mistakes. I wrote p re-school and what came out on the IMDb comment page is Prue-school. I had hoped to put some non standard smelling into this wannabe SPEW. At least the automatics should recognise Hogwarts. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>While I do not agree with these, they stood out for me:<br/><br/>Poor omnium-gatherum of bad directing-work, 27 August 2006 <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, this review will HELP you decide., 9 August 2006 <br/><br/>Utterly fantastic!!, 16 July 2006 <br/><br/>Pretty good, 11 July 2006 <br/><br/>Very Good, 4 July 2006 <br/><br/>A great story was killed...Wanted for murder:Mike Newell, 28 June 2006 <br/><br/>Captivatingly visual, 9 June 2006"

","Book four has always been my favorite of the books, and now I'm glad to say that this is my favorite of the films. Mike Newell did an excellent job with this movie. Ralph Fiennes is perfect as Voldemort, and I thought Michael Gambon did a very good job (I don't get why everyone hates him. Is it because he's not Richard Harris? Get over it!) I was surprised by all the negative reviews on here. Whenever you watch a movie that's based on a book, you need to remember two things. 1. This is a movie that's based on a book. 2. This is not the book, it's a movie, so enjoy it for what it is, not everything it's not. Enjoy the exciting action and adventure without the sometimes absurd subplots such as Bagman owing money to the Weasley twins and Hermione's house elf support group. This is an excellent film, and I think Mike Newell is the best of all the directors so far."

","OK I have been reading what most people who did not like the movie have to say and all they are doing is moaning and whining about how good the book is and how much the movie sucked. OK before you start talking trash about a movie that was adapted from a book learn what it is like to try and adapted that said book to a movie. It is a major effort to adapt something, anything to a movie. Not to mention Goblet is one of the thicker books lets keep that in mind. That is the reason why the first 2 were more true to the books because that wasn't as much material to adapted duh, it has nothing to do with the directors, just because people have never heard of a director doesn't mean that he/she is a bad director (I would think that being old enough to write a review that people would be old enough not to hold such child-like concepts of directors/movie making.) It being so thick and long they did not have time to worry about such minor characters like the ghosts. I like the ghosts, I think they are a nice comic relief in the movies , but they do not drive the plot. Not the mention when you read you read at you own pace you control the pacing of the story, so therefore you think things are going to happen a different time then the screenwriter and/or the director does. People who are fans of the books before the movie have to understand that the movie cannot and I mean cannot be a word for, carbon copy of the book when it is a long piece of work like Goblet. The movie and book are two different things. You also have YOUR idea what it is and that is different for what the screenwriter can or should do. In addition with what the reader thinks the movie should be concerning characters, once again that is what the actor thinks the character should be not you so stop whining! <br/><br/>If you want the movie to be your way you raise several millions of dollars, spend a few years writing and rewriting it, casting the actors, directing the actors the way ""they were in the book"" and negotiate with the theaters to play your movie and then you can complain all you want about how it isn't like the book. Until that said time shut-up and understand it is a movie and they did the best they can trying to make a GOOD MOVIE. A good movie that is BASED on the book. Like screenwriter Jay Wolpert(Count of Monte Cristo) said when he was asked what would he'd say to the people who said he wasn't true the book version of The Count of Monte Cristo he said ""Thank you."", he continued ""It wasn't my job to write a book it was my job to write a movie, you want the book read the book it is a good book."" The same applies here so stop whining about stupid little stuff!<br/><br/>Enough frustrated rantings. The movie is fun and great to watch, all the seasoned actors(ie Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes)loved playing their characters, and really get into them. The SFX where good I mean nothing different just run of the mill but still good. Let's face it was a good, fun fantasy adventure and that is all we want the Harry Potter movies to be. We just want to be taken away to place that isn't real and escape reality for a few hours, and Harry Potter 4 does that in spades. You get to know and like the characters, you care about them and you have fun while watching it. It has everything you want from a fantasy adventure movie dragons, magic,psychotic bad guys, a little bit of comic relief and you leave the theater happy. They are also starting to go into the back story of different characters, which makes the Harry Potter world more real and interesting. I would say if you like fantasy give this one a look. In addition to the fact that it is fun the story of young Mr. Potter is starting to get dark and more violent, so if you thought this was just a kid story not anymore. So just enjoy it for what it is a good fantasy movie, that is getting better and darker with every movie."

","I am a big fan of the harry potter books and have read all the books at least twice as well I have been following the movies. Anyways Chris Columbus did a mediocre job with the first 2 that would appeal to all ages but mainly kids under 15. When I saw the Prizoner of Azkaban I was more impressed with the movie itself but less impressed with how accuratley Alfonso followed the book. Nevertheless the acting and even the the whole tone of the movie was darker this darkness in TPOA was passed on to the Goblet of Fire. I personally was very impressed with this movie and felt it had a much better flow then movie number 3. Unfortunately the Goblet of fire was my favourite book and I was looking forward to seeing some of my most anticipated parts from the book. For people who have read the book I think that most people who would agree with me that it was vital for the movie to show the scene in the book in the Hospital wing with Cornelius Fudge deniying that Voldemort is back considering that is so important in book number 5 god knows how they'll play that one out. Also many people I talked to were mad about not putting the house elves in but I disagree. If winkee cast the dark mark in the movie it would ruin the whole darkness theme. What I thought was more important was not putting the Dursley's in or not showing Harry giving his Triwizard winnings to Fred and George to start their joke shop. Anyways I've said enough about the book. The movie was great otherwise all the kids have vastly improved in their acting we finally got to see the Ron is not just a comical character and Dan's acting in the graveyard was fantastic. Like most people I agree that Allen Rickman is Proffeser Snape exactley. I just don't quite agree with giving Michael Gambon the part for Albus Dumbledore. He just dosen't have the Dumbledore touch that Richard Harris had. Anyways I give Harry Potter and the goblet of fire 8/10."

","I thought it was one the best movie out of all the harry potter movies. Although they weren't as faithful to the book as the first and second movies were. It was always exciting, a good adventure film. But I would like to say that most people who will like this movie have to be fans of the books, and have saw the first three films, otherwise its pretty confusing. At some points the movie was very dark, at times. One section that I wouldn't really recommend for young viewers is after the Quidditch World Cup. Also at the end of the movie. Very entertaining though, the actors have really grown; even from the third movie, I thought that Daniel Radcliffe has improved so much. From his crying scene in the third and in the fourth, you can definitely see the improvement; it was much more believable. All in all, an excellent, compelling story; just one of the reasons why Harry Potter has kept going."
"FilmSchoolWriter","10","0","1","31 July 2006"," Not my favorite of the HP movies, but enjoyable nonetheless
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is not my favorite of the Harry Potter movies, but it is very good nonetheless.<br/><br/>It's fun to see how Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have grown as actors since the first film. Not to say that they were bad when they were younger, but they are far better in this film, than in any of the others. Emma Watson's performance in particular was very good, and I at least think that she is the best actor of the 3 of them. I loved Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody. He was perfect! Insane and totally wacko, I loved his performance. Another performance I loved was Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. Brilliant! He definitely captured the essence of the character. I did have problem with Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory. Granted, he looks the part, but he doesn't act it  at least not as I envisioned the character while reading the book. The only major character disappointment was the lack of Sirius Black. I really wish that he had been included more, but oh well.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire is stunningly shot. Definitely deserved the nomination for Best Achievement in Art Direction at the Oscars.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with The Goblet of Fire I blame entirely on Mike Newell. Perhaps I am wrong to lay the blame on him and instead it should be laid upon the producers, so correct me if I'm wrong. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire runs at 157 minutes. Longer than most films, but shorter than some. In their effort to keep the movie going at a snappy pace, the filmmakers have neglected all transitions except for the snappy cut. This is a huge irritance. You're watching the beginning of the movie and you think, ""Cool! They're at the Quidditch Cup! Oh! The Cup is over. Oh! Now they're at Hogwarts."" There's nothing to tell you that anytime has passed. I think that the audience would sacrifice a few seconds of their time for a well placed dissolve/fade out or two. Another place where they may have moved things to quickly is in the Graveyard. It's absolutely crucial to not only the plot of this movie, but the plots of all the Harry Potter movies to come, and I feel that it could have been lengthened a fair amount. The Yule Ball isn't incredibly important for the plot, but it takes up a fair space of time in the movie. Though beautifully shot, I believe they could have axed a large amount of that off and used that time in the Graveyard instead. And my last problem is just something that as a huge Harry Potter fan, I really wanted to see on film, the Quidditch World Cup. I think that would have been a ton of fun to watch, but it too was axed from the plot. Again, I would have given up most of the Yule Ball even for a small amount of the Quidditch Cup.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Though not my favorite of the Harry Potter movies, I thought that the acting was the best yet, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 9/10"
"winky_500","7","0","1","27 July 2006"," Lacked the heart of the first three
","I walked into this movie, expecting very little. And that's what I got. The acting was fine, the affects where magnificent, but it lacked the heart of the first three films.<br/><br/>A lot of the story was left out, so I was left with the duty of explaining to my parents for hours what REALLY happened. They kept a very thin story line to this movie.<br/><br/>The fourth book always leaves me with the feeling of ""ooh! The plot thickens!"" The movie was quite different. It only showed half of what happened and it left you wondering what was going on. I was confused, had to go back and read the book.<br/><br/>I was even more disappointed when the beginning music started, I was thinking ""What the crap!? Am I in the right movie??"" I realized right off the bat that John Williams had not done the music for this film, and that disappointed me greatly. It disappointed me even more when The Weird Sisters started playing ""Do the Hippogriff"". <br/><br/>The artistic aspect was taken away from this film, it was all action and when it wasn't it was boring and slow. It put in scenes that weren't in the book and left out scenes in the book that should have been in the movie!<br/><br/>The entrance of the two visiting schools was ridiculous. It didn't show enough of Cedric, so his death is just like ""Oh, okay... Why's Harry flipping out? He had like... 5 lines..."". Hermione's dress was supposed to be blue. They think the fans don't pay attention? We do, I'm sorry, it wasn't a pink tango dress! It was blue dress robes! This is what I have to say to Mike Newell; Kill the beast!<br/><br/>I hated the Dumbledore flipping out on Harry scene. It was completely out of character and uncalled for. Dumbledore would never do something so ridiculous and shake Harry when in ""Order of the Phoenix"" he clearly tells Umbridge to ""Not man handle my students"". Yeah, just hope they leave that line out or they'll make Dumbledore look the idiot even more than they already have.<br/><br/>This movie was a real let down, Voldamort was awful, I couldn't believe his character at all. I always imagined him more... Scary? Lets just hope they don't ruin the next Harry Potter film. But I won't get my hopes up."
"dervalmccormack","7","0","1","26 July 2006"," The darkest Potter movie yet as Voldemort strengthens once more
","I hate hearing people say things like ""I am without doubt THE BIGGEST fan"" or ""Nobody likes it as much as I do"". Therefore, I try as hard as I can not to stoop to saying things like this but I must say when it comes to J.K.Rowling's series of magical tales about Harry Potter, the boy who lived, I find stopping myself from saying irritating boasts like this increasingly difficult. Obviously I cannot possibly be the biggest fan of Harry Potter in the world but I do find myself questioning this possibility in my head and saying things like ""I can't live without it"" or ""I feel as if I am Harry's best friend myself!"" But, then the realistic part of my head tells me that I am not the only fan of the books. Half of my friends are fanatics and the whole world wait with baited breath at the release of each new film. If J.K's books were not loved like I love them by so many people worldwide, then the Harry Potter films would not have made the millions that they do not deserve. Well, maybe films one and two would have made a bit of a profit but I thought film three was a complete disaster with nothing but a good book behind it to draw in the crowds. I know how hard it is for films to live up to books, especially when they are as good as Harry Potter. But in the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, okay it might not be near as good as the book but, well it is in its own right a very good film. The usual line up are in the cast fourth time round as Harry and his friends prepare for their what will be their darkest year of their wizarding years so far at Hogwarts. This year, the Triwizard Tournament is being held in the school. This rare and major event brings students from two other wizarding schools to Hogwarts to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire to see if they can become one of the three champions to take part in the challenging tournament. The film flows very well and tells the story logically in an easy-to-follow manner(even if you haven't read the book)which its predecessors lacked. I went to see this film hoping it would bring the book to life and it did. In fact, I thought the movie was a lot better than my expectations. The acting of the young cast has improved. Radcliffe in the main role will probably never be Oscar material but he gives a brave performance in his most challenging film yet. Overall, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an enjoyable film for all ages and I would actually recommend it to the book lovers because it does in fact bring the story to life. I may not be running out stating that I am ""THE BIGGEST fan"" but like I said before you can never compare a film to a book. Especially when the book is quite simply epic."
"Khansaab","10","0","1","25 July 2006"," Goblet of Fire Takes the Harry Potter Movie Crown
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantastic film for any age at all. It has comedy, action, and a great storyline. This film is a must see. We start off with Voldemort himself, but not really AS himself. This particular volume of the series is about his return, and the addition to some very vital characters. The basic plot is that after an odd mishap in a tournament of the wizard world, Harry must endure himself in three very hard and mature tasks.<br/><br/>The Pros: This is the first Harry Potter movie that has done a great job on following the story, and cutting out all the unnecessary crap that filled the fourth book. The first one did a great job of following the book as well; almost exactly, but that book was a lot smaller as opposed to the fourth book which is the 2nd largest in the series of 1-6 (page wise). The special effects and audio is fantastic, especially when watching it in a home theater.<br/><br/>The Cons: If you have read the book, you will know that the story gets a bit more depressing from here. The Goblet of Fire is also now available on DVD, but does not have the nice paper and plastic casing as the first and second Harry Potter movies did. Again, there isn't much wrong with this film, since it was butchered very well.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10. The actors, the visual effects, the surround sound, and all of the bonus features are fantastic, and can be enjoyed by anyone. Best Harry Potter movie that has come out by far. We'll see how they do on the next three."

Although I am not a fan of Mike Newell and his directing, he has turned this movie into something I was not expecting at all: a thriller. I was very impressed with how they handled the editing of this film. Each scene in the film was necessary and they didn't add anything silly or pointless. They left out the right things and kept the right things. These movies keep growing as they progress, and I can only hope that the next film is even better. The movie also kept its darkness, which I am very happy about, and I hope the films continue to appeal to an older audience. Bravo!"

","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is back in a new year, new attitude of anger, ""BIG"" surprises and the one we all hate Lord Voldemort (Ralph Phines) has come back himself, stronger than before and waiting to kill Harry with his anger of revenge. Harry's (Radcliffe) life becomes a little more complicated with a new crush and strange happenings. This all starts when Harry had a dream about Voldemort (Phines) getting stronger. He then discovered along with his 2 best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) that not only was Voldemort getting stronger, but also had a way of killing Harry when his name was mysteriously put into the Goblet of Fire and then was also picked to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. At the last tournament Harry was to have met his ""doom"".<br/><br/>I found this movie GREAT, I LOVE all the Harry Potter books and movies, they just keep you going and going. I couldn't put down the book at all it was just so interesting. This one I have to say is my favorite HP movie out of the 4. Why?, because you get to see the Triwizard Tournament happening as if you were there, get to see Voldemort with a ""body"" and all so get to see Harry shy around his crush Cho Chang.

Can't wait for the ministry battle scene and how that is going to look on film. Wondering about how much they will have to cut out of the movie if not it might be like 5 hours long.

"etsm92","10","0","1","4 July 2006"," Not as good as the first three but still wonderfully imaginative and dark!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/2005/***1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Robert Pattinson Clémence Poésy Stanislav Ianevski Michael Gambon<br/><br/>This film is great and wonderfully imaginative but is probably my least favorite of the Harry Potter movie series. I had a feeling this would be greater than expected after seeing the preview a dozen times. Yet I was not exactly correct. The thing is the composer was not John Williams (as it was in the other three Harry Potter movies). It was Patrick Doyle whom I have never heard of. The direction was by Mike Newell whom also I have never heard of. So there are quite a few people that are new to me but there still is Steve Kloves (the screenwriter for the whole series so far). I have heard of him so there's one. I um It's heard to explain this movie because there are too many things going on at once. Basically it is a great film but yet not as good as the first and second which were astounding. Let me try to define; Harry is in yet another adventure of almost getting killed. There. Okay. Okay. Yes, there is a lot more to the story than that. Harry finds that his crush is going to the Yule Ball (the dance) at the school with someone else named Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson). Harry's crush is named Cho Chang. Having read half of the book already, I knew about most of the beginning and knew what was going to happen. The thing is they cut a lot of the information (the details) from the book out in the movie because (obviously) you can't fit a whole amount of detail from a 700-page book in a 2-½ hour movie. You just can't. But to me it was still great and extremely dark and I can tell it took a lot of effort to make this film (especially for the visual/special effects coordinators). This film probably had more special effects than any of the Harry Potter movies out there. Now in this movie not only does Hogwarts house the Hogwarts students but also houses the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Those two words I mentioned are names of different schools of magic besides Hogwarts. They are housed at Hogwarts because they consist of a champion of The Triwizard Tournament. There is a champion of Hogwarts named Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), a champion of Beauxbatons named Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy), and a champion of Durmstrang named Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), but Harry Potter also is included in that because of a magical goblet that spit out his name on a burning piece of parchment (along with the other three champions). Now you notice that it's called The Triwizard Tounament; meaning that there should only be three wizard/witches that are in it. In this case it should be called The Quadrawizard Tournament since there is a member of Hogwarts that is joined but Harry is also in there. So there are really two people from Hogwarts and one person from the other two competing schools. Now, this so-called goblet is the main thing in this book and film because that goblet tells whom the champion will be from each school that competes in The Triwizard Tournament (That's obviously where they get the title of the book/film). Whoever those champions consist will be the ones who are assigned three tasks that are very difficult. Whoever wins will win the cup. 'Wiz' is emblazoned on the cup and whoever wins will be the 'Wiz' of The Triwizard Tournament. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) was obviously not as good as Richard Harris (the one prior to Gambon) because he had was too gruff and too loud and not as wise as Harris was. Richard was a tough guy though because he still played Dumledore even though he was very sick while on the set of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and then soon passed away. There also is a teacher that shows up in this movie and teaches the Defense against the Dark Arts class (a new teacher) named Mad-Eye Moody. At the end is a shock though and it involves this character so watch closely. Other than that you have your usual other characters: Hermione, Ron, and Draco Malfoy who didn't have a huge part in this movie (Draco I mean) nor did his comrades. Movie directed by Mike Newell. Oh! By the way, this is also the film where you see Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) in person! Very awesome!"

Potter keeps growing and his adventures become more adult, many details about his ultra-enemy Lord Voldemort are revealed. The special effects are just awesome, but the movie is a little too long (2 hours and a half!!), with some sequences that look like they're there just to pad the movie out (the one with the dance and all that). <br/><br/>Like it or not Harry Poter's saga will become a thing of the past like one of the greatest adventures from the big screen, along with ""Indiana Jones"", ""Back to the future"", etc.<br/><br/>*My rate: 7/10"

But when seeing this, I couldn't wait to see the fifth movie.<br/><br/>The Movie starts with A man making coffee and then sees a light light up in the riddle house. He walks to the house and looks into a room with villains talking then one of them notices the man from a snake, then he gets killed by a spell.<br/><br/>At the end, Cedric Diggory, one of the Tri-Wizard Tournament contestants which is a game where 3 people complete in 3 games, who ever wins gets Eternal Glory, But Mysteriously, Harry is picked by some one. Anyway, Cedric is killed by that spell and Harry and Voldemort duel to the death. Priori Incantatem, Avada Kadavra V.S. Expelliarmous and then the ghost's of Harry's parents, the man, and Cedric. Harry's dad's ghost tells him when it is ready to let go of the spell because the spells are connecting then his mom says let go and all the ghost hit Voldemort and Harry Escapes with Cedric body.<br/><br/>Mad-Eye Moody, Harry's defense against the dark arts teacher turns out to be one of Voldemort's minions and The real Mad-Eye is trapped in a large box. No one wins the tournament but the ending has a happy/sad ending.<br/><br/>This movie rocks!, anyone who is a fan of action, adventure, sport, fantasy, romance, comedy, drama, or thriller, You must see this movie!!"
"lati","7","0","1","27 June 2006"," The best of the Potter movies but not perfect
","Three first Potter movies were disappointments. The first two were just boring and the third one was imbalanced. So, I didn't expect much of the Goblet of Fire. Surprisingly it appeared to be a quite good movie.<br/><br/>The best thing about TGOF is that it's a coherent and straightforward picture. The story just doesn't jump from scene to scene without even trying to make a complete and logical movie. That was a problem with the three first picture. But in TGOF story moves on easily and it's well-built and understandable. Of course they have had to delete many of the characters and story lines, but I think is a good thing. The world of Harry Potter may now seem more limited than in books but the movie works better when there are no too more subplots and filmmakers can concentrate to the main story.<br/><br/>The movie is action-packed and there are none boring moments. Although it's over 150 minutes long, it never felt too long and that's a good thing about movies that are as long. The critical points of the story are made well and effectively. Especially I like the Yule Ball scene. It captives funny and understandably the first steps on relations between teenager boys and girls, when their hormones are running and the opposite gender are beginning to be interested in but they're still too inexperienced to handle this.<br/><br/>Of course, TGOF has its flaws.It's still too superficial view to the world of Harry Potter. It also suppose that viewers have read the book so it does not explain well some very important moments. The ones, who have not read the novel, may be very lost when watching picture. I was also disappointed about ending. It was just too easy. In the book, end was dark and it makes you shiver. In the movie, you just felt that nothing important really happened. Also characters act like everything that happened really meant nothing.<br/><br/>I am very unsatisfied the young actors. Radcliffe is still monotonous as Harry, and Watson and Grint overact. The adult actors instead are good in their roles. Two of them deserves a special mention: Gleason is hilarious as Moody and Fiennes is a marvelous Voldemort. He apparently scares the hell out of kids.<br/><br/>In conclusion, TGOF is the best Potter movie but not the perfect one. The book is, again, much much better."

None are mentioned in this movie; all are essential in the next. As an element, the ball (and its preparations) are irrelevant to the series, but eat up at some 15% of the film's running time.

"Buddy-51","7","0","1","22 May 2006"," another fine installment
","In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" the fourth installment in the perennially popular series by J. K. Rowling, the young wizards seem to have a bit more on their minds than just flying around on broomsticks and casting spells. For along with puberty come activated hormones and a sudden burgeoning interest in the opposite sex. This brings a nice grown-up dimension to a series that continues to enchant young and old alike with its constantly renewing creativity and imagination.<br/><br/>All, however, is not puppy love romance and fancy dress balls, for there is still the serious business of wizardry to be done at Hogwarts Academy. In this edition, Harry is compelled to take part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a sort of Olympic Games for magicians that is so intense that it has resulted in the deaths of a few of the participants in the past. In order to win the prize of the goblet of fire, the contestant must face three challenges - a battle with dragons, an underwater rescue of some kidnapped friends, and a trip through an elaborate maze, with the goal in each case being the capturing of a mysterious giant egg. At the base of the contest lies the evil Lord Voldemort (a creepy Ralph Fiennes), who is, as always, trying to eliminate young Mr. Potter by any means necessary.<br/><br/>Although a bit long at two hours and thirty-six minutes, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" still manages to breathe new life into a franchise that should by all rights be turning pretty stale by now. It does so partly through some really fine set pieces - i.e. the challenges - partly through the high flying imaginativeness of so much of the storyline, partly through the endearing relationships among the various characters, and partly through the performance of Daniel Radcliffe, who keeps Harry Potter lifelike, compelling and interesting as an everyman hero. The tone is also remarkably dark in the later stretches of the film, as is befitting the advancing ages of the characters, although very young children might find some of the scenes a trifle disturbing, so be forewarned.<br/><br/>Filled with beautiful images and dazzling special effects, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is another worthy addition to a series that is fast becoming a modern day classic in its own right."

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an excellent movie. The acting is impressive giving that the actors who play students have never acted in anything before this series ever (few exceptions). It has a good mix of action and special effects and living life as a teenager. I was however disappointed on the quantity of content left out that was in the book: The Dursly's, Dobby, The Quidditch World Cup (they never actually showed the game), Karkarof's Fleeing at the end, Hagrid's Blast Ended Screwts, and probably many more things that I can't remember. The maze sequence was a little messed up cuz they didn't have the 30 foot spider or any creatures or spells to test the contestants skills, they simply had the maze try to eat them or something, I dunno. The climatic grave yard scene wasn't exactly as I expected it, but still extremely good, exciting, and suspenseful. I'm glad they decided to go all out and make this installment PG-13 because if they hadn't, the grave yard scene would have been pretty crappy. I think they should have made it longer, or even into 2 parts to extend and add some scenes like with the Dursly's, the World Cup, and the Veritiserum scene with Crouch Jr./Moody. I saw it in IMAX which made it better than it probably was (big ass screen, and 12,000 watt surround sound system).

","well, i think harry potter and the goblet of fire is the best movie so far!! it has a wonderful content and besides all the actors have done soo well. boo to all the hp haters. it is better than the other harry potter movies because the kids are mature in this movie. they are no more kids. all the tasks have been shown in a wonderful way. the first task, the underwater scene and the maze. it starts off as harry's fourth year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardy. the dark lord is coming into power and sends some of his death eaters to the quidichh world cup. and next the triwizard tournament is introduced. harry's name is taken out of the goblet of fire unexpectedly. he has no choice but to participate. and so the story goes on and hogwarts is the champion GO HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!!"
"intergirl-2","7","0","1","23 April 2006"," Fantastic movie, just not Harry Potter
","I must admit, after all the hubbub and excitement that had arisen around the Goblet of Fire, I went to the cinema in very high spirits and came out of it with mixed feelings. <br/><br/>Here's my negative criticism.<br/><br/>To begin with, the film consisted of literally nothing but the quidditch cup, the three tournament events, and the strict minimum of peripheric scenes, (inserted and rushed-through), essential to the plausibility of the plot. Consequently, all sub-plots were eliminated, as were all the scenes which were irrelevant to the central plot.<br/><br/>As a result of that, you didn't see any character development at all, nor any interaction between the protagonists which showed progression in their relationships (Harry's evolution being one of the essential elements of book 4, which is the mark between Harry's pre-teen years and his adolescence.) The actors were forced to evolve and interact in short spaces of time. So there is no real sense of change or progression in either the characters themselves or their relationships.<br/><br/>Also because of the scene-cutting, you had no impression whatsoever of actually being at Hogwarts, let alone spending an entire year in the castle; the daily-life routine of the trio at Hogwarts was simply cast aside. No visits to Hagrid, scarcely any dormitory scenes, barely a glimpse of breakfast in the great hall and not one, single, measly classroom scene a part from an extract of Moody's first lesson. <br/><br/>In addition, because of this lack of daily-life scenes, all the relatively major characters except for the trio, Dumbledore and some might argue McGonagall, had barely more than three words to say.<br/><br/>I also, however, have positive criticism to divulge:<br/><br/>First of all, the actors exceeded all expectations: Daniel Radcliffe provoked genuine sadness in me when he returned to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. Rupert Grint played Ron to perfection, giving incredible depth to his character and yet managing to remain funny; successfully playing Harry's frustrated sidekick, Hermione's jealous admirer and nevertheless their most loyal friend. Emma Watson played equally well; she portrayed a still insecure Hermione and consequently ""know-it-all"" and rule-abiding at the core, yet going through the experiences of being a teenager and gaining with them more confidence, strength and security. <br/><br/>Ginny actually made an appearance, (she finally seems allowed to be a real teenager), and showed for the first time a sense of humour; I was wondering, reading books 5 and 6, how on earth Bonnie Wright was going to pull off growing up and being the most popular girl in Gryffindor in the space of the next few movies. But the snippets we saw of her in the film, though too short, seemed promising. <br/><br/>Therefore, coming back to my negative criticism, it was a shame that the depth and changes of all these characters were not further exploited in all their interactions and dialogues; instead restrained to the few non-tournament- related scenes.<br/><br/>However, to me, the greatest revelation of all in GoF, was Matthew Lewis, who plays Neville Longbottom. I was so incredibly touched by his performance; you can't help but feel endeared to his clumsy, awkward, yet totally pure personality. I thought he was stunningly moving in the scene in which he watches the cruciatus curse performed on a spider. <br/><br/>Fred and George were funny for once, as opposed to the last three films, in which their jokes were too few and, honestly, not all that great, compared to the witty retorts and bubbling personalities of the book-version twins. <br/><br/>Secondly, there was, most importantly, good chemistry between the main actors, which was much more concentrated on and exposed than in the first three films.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the special effects were spectacular. I admit, though, that I'm only mentioning them as a result of having read other reviews of the movie. For in actual fact I didn't even think about the special effects. Which is exactly what makes them so spectacular. Indeed, if a person is able to watch a movie composed 90% out of special effects without even thinking once about them, they must be pretty fantastic. You simply are at Hogwarts. When Harry confronts the horntail, he is in a stadium. When he goes down into the lake, you're there too. And when he gets transported to Little Hangleton, so do you. <br/><br/>To sum things up, I think Mike Newell felt the need to shorten, cut and discard things because of his fear of Goblet of Fire receiving the same, harsh criticism as Chris Columbus's two movies did. Critics declared Columbus was much too loyal to the books and therefore stretched out his work into a pace-less, far-too-long film. Mike Newell, wanting to avoid this trap, decided to cast away anything which was not essential to the plot and simplify it: who could blame him? How, in a two-hour-movie, could any director find the time to naturally slip in all the clues JK Rowling has carefully woven into her book? To describe all of book 4, you'd need 10 hours. <br/><br/>However, in this urge to keep the film quick-paced and fresh, Newell instead made it choppy, rushed and unfluid. This made for the overall impression of wanting to compress as much as possible (character growth, interaction, sub- plots, life at Hogwarts, the quidditch world cup and the triwizard tournament) into a certain amount of time, like trying to stuff 80 sardines into a can designed for 10. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I would say that the film had all the makings of a masterpiece; a flabbergasting cast, great chemistry, top-notch special effects, much, much humour and a lot of emotion; but focusing on the triwizard tournament and the central plot, Mike Newell cut out the rest of the book, and, with it, the very essence of Harry and Hogwarts itself. So what was there was fantastic  but there wasn't a heck of a lot there"
"HMO_Corey_Taylor","10","0","1","23 April 2006"," Another Brilliant of Harry Potter Films...
","Well for starters , I'm a big fan of Harry Potter. I love all of the Harry Potter series , I've repeated watching them for like thousand times already, so far Goblet of Fire i've only watched about 5 times (one from cinema the rest from DVD ) . During 1st time when I went to the cinema with my mom to watch GOF, I was so exciting , I was really keen to see the film. But unfortunately throughout the film there were this 4 little BUGGING kids sitting behind us , TALKING throughout the whole film. They were talking about Richard Harris death and now have change the new Dumbledore and rumors about Daniel , all sort of rubbish ...and during the part where Harry almost caught the dragon egg, the four mad kids went screaming their lungs out shouting :"" Ahhhh !! harry get the egg ! get the egg ! "" Jesus ,i was sure those people nearby were staring them with these fierce gaze , so does my mum....But anyway back to the movie , I din quite understand when I got out of the theater , probably cause of those kids. I felt a little disappointment of the show , coz i think its a lil rush at some part, is like showing this scene for a while and suddenly boom ,comes another story. As too I din quite know what was it the show was trying to say , but in the end I still got home , still thinking, reading preview, that sorta thing. <br/><br/>BUT, After five darn long months I've waited , the DVD is out , my bro bought it for my b'day presant and I was so delighted. That night I sat in the AV room alone trying to put all my focus on the show , and after 2hours and 45mins, the show ended. I got up and said :'damn the living hell , another brilliant one"" ... I totally understand now after watching it for the second time , I saw some scene where I din know it was shown in the theater. It really was a excellent show.<br/><br/>(ABOUT ACTORS AND ACTRESSES) Daniel , Emma , Rupert , the Twins and other new cast like Robert Pattinson(Cedric Diggory) , Stanislav Ianevski(Viktor Krum) and of coz the beauty of a french girl , Clémence Poésy(Fleur Delacour )... they all are brilliant actors and actress...Dan Emma and Rupert have definitely develop their stamina and acting skill..I was really amazed by Emma & Ron acting this time (as always). Emma spent most of her time in this movie worrying and crying (she's act good at crying). The way she talked in this film has changed too..and as for Ron , wow his way of acting has changed and I think it's real good so as the others) , but for this one his definitely acted the best. Unfortunately for Dan , a lil disappointment , although he has improve , but still there's some part that hasn't, for example the expression on his face isn't there but others parts but others were great , just the expression of the face. As for the new cast , one word : Marvelous acting. ......... oh yeah !!! I FORGOT ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING...after I read some of the reviews I realise I'm not the only one who just think that way , there are thousand and thousand of ppl out there think that way too.....which the subject is upon Albus Dumbledore....Jesus man ! Michael Gambon S**K at playing Albus , Jesus , as I said I've read ppls review, Albus supposed to be a calm , wise type of person but this for Christ sake known Michael Gambon is like a hectic crush monster man , the way he walk the way he talk the way he look the way he treat ppl , Jesus man .... his a lunatic , his acting skills are horrible (apologise to Michael.G fans out there).....horrible , just pure horrible . As for me , I think they should find someone else instead !<br/><br/>(FAV Scene....................) My fav scene was the part where the show almost end , it was when Harry & Voldermort were casting spell at each other, and suddenly Harry's parents and Cedric (who got killed by Voldermort) came out from Voldermort's wand. When Harry's parents and Cedric talked to Harry , wow that part really touched me, Cedric said :' Bring my body back will you , bring my body back to my father' Harry's mom :' let go son , let go ! ' ... oh gosh that was a really great moment...<br/><br/>Lastly , This is another great Harry Potter Film , for all of u Harry Potter fans out there, WATCH IT AGAIN !!! and for those whom u called it Harry Pothead or whatever crap u named it , u r one idiot, you should give it a chance , watch it again , if u still dun like it , watch it again , and if u still dun like it , watch it again...that's all i can say... <br/><br/>As for now , I'm totally anxious about the next one , ORDER OF THE PHOENIX , IT'S GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AND SUPREME BETTER..........................................."
"alfiefamily","7","0","1","22 April 2006"," Satisfying fourth film of the series
","""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" may be the fourth film of this series, but it is not like most other series' that have gone on for this long. Think ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Police Academy, ""Jaws"", ""Batman"" ""Rocky"" and ""Superman"". Each of these series had grown tired and boring. ""Goblet of Fire"" is a refreshing, dark film that moves the series and the characters forward in a natural way.<br/><br/>It is nice to see the progression of the characters, not just in their studies, but in how they deal with problems that happen to all teenagers. While struggling to become wizards, they are also struggling with everyday issues. Love, jealousy,and loyalty are dealt with in a realistic way.<br/><br/>At almost 2 1/2 hours, this is a long film, especially for kids. I know that the book was monstrously long, and many of the subplots were removed from the film. In doing so, the film is not altogether cohesive. Because of this, the film feels even longer."
"fwomp","7","0","1","22 April 2006"," Growing Up Hogwarts-Style
","The Harry Potter film franchise takes off with another wizardly tale of growing up at Hogwarts with all of its interpersonal banter and dark underpinnings.<br/><br/>Watching the young actors age on the screen is probably becoming one of the more satisfying things for me. It makes it seem more ""real"" even though this is just a fantastic fantasy.<br/><br/>Coming back to the wizard school this time, we see that Ron, Hermione and Harry have hit their growth (and hormone) spurts. Dancing, love, friendship, and danger are now forever linked as we're introduced to the Goblet of Fire TriWizard competition. Normally set as a triad competition (between three individuals of different schools) this time there will be four contestants, obviously including Harry. Angst and anger are the melange of the day as Harry has to deal with his lack of knowledge about the competition and grapple with his growing affection for girls his own age. Oh yes, and he's still be chased by the evil Lord Voldemort (the wizard responsible for his parents' death and the unusual scar forever emblazoned on Harry's forehead).<br/><br/>Harry's not old enough to compete in the competition and his fellow Hogwartians aren't happy with the fact that Harry seems to be outgrowing his own shoes. Is he too cocky? Harry never entered the competition and doesn't know how his name got picked but his fellow classmates don't believe him.<br/><br/>As the Goblet of Fire contest continues, we see Harry battling dragons, saving one friend but unable to rescue another, and then meeting face-to-face with true evil.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the dark qualities of these latest Potter films that drags me in, or perhaps I'm just a fan of the genre (junky?), but whatever it is, I find the dangers and limited successes of Harry and his friends comforting and realistic (not overly done with a ""Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes"" attitude). This one's rated PG-13, too, so keep an eye on the kiddies.<br/><br/>Like the Prizoner of Azkaban, this one has very dark over and undertones. And clocking in at two-and-a-half hours, it's one of the longer in the series but well worth the sitting time."
"americandragonfreak","9","0","1","17 April 2006"," Moody steals the show
","This movie was fantastic. The story is great. The effects are cool and the acting is cool. Danial Radcliffe is doing fine, Rupert Grint overacts, Micheal Gambon just isn't Richard Harris, and Ralph Fiennes was way off. I don't think that him running around was the smartest choice. Also, I was not too happy that they left out Barty Crouch Jr.'s fate. The star of the show though, is Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody. He was zany and wild and he was excellent. Plus when Harry brings back Cedric's body is a very depressing scene. The tasks were cool and the Dark Mark was fun, but I will always get a kick out of Moody turning Malfoy into a ferret."
"chic_luvs_music","Null","0","1","17 April 2006"," i liked it but...
","I am a huge fan of Harry Potter, and I was very excited for this movie to come out since this was my favorite book in the series.<br/><br/>But i was a disappointed with how much they left out. For example, they left out Hermione's whole S.P.E.W. thing with the house elves which is mentioned again in later books. Also, Neville didn't give Harry the gillyweed, Dobby did. But there was one part that i was extremely mad at. The maze, of course. They left out everything that happens in the maze(and i was looking forward to seeing that), and not only that but they made it EAT people and also wind would blow out of no where and the paths would close! What's with that? When i saw the movie in theaters, i had to explain some stuff to my friend who has never read the books, so i'm guessing it was somewhat confusing to others who don't read the books.<br/><br/>I think they should have had an intermission or something because if you think about it, the 5th book is longer than the 4th...how much are they going to leave out of that one? And that will be even more confusing to those who don't read the series..."

","***LOTS OF SPOILERS*** (how can you give examples of the movie's greatness without spoilers?) One thing I loved about this movie is that you can see the development of teenagers very clearly, especially with Harry. Upon asking Cho out, he slobbers all over it and she doesn't understand him; when he's dancing with Parvati at first he gets nervous and doesn't want to take her waist; when he's on the Hogwarts Express, he finds the trolley to buy some candy, but sees Cho there and is completely lovestruck - he falls back into his seat with a hypnotized smile (perfectly played by Daniel Radcliffe).<br/><br/>Another thing I liked seeing in the movie were the effects. The Priori Incantatem scene is probably one of the best effects I've seen in a while, with the red and green beams colliding and sparking. However there were a few moments which I, plainly, found hard to believe. After taking the Portkey to the Quiddich World Cup, I found the way Cedric, Amos, and Arthur magically floated onto the ground without being thrown down was really poorly done, and just looked like they were riding invisible bikes.<br/><br/>This movie, however, had absolutely brilliant scene flow. Unfortunately, for those that haven't read the book I found it would have been hard to understand the plot. I went to see this in the movie theater with some friends when it had just come out, and I found that the five of us that had read the book spent a lot of the time explaining the story to the two of us that hadn't. I think if these plot holes had been minimized for those who haven't read it this movie would have seemed better for me.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like about this movie was the cracking voice of Sir Michael Gambon (Dumbledore). It seems to me that Dumbledore's ability to yell, ""SILENCE!"" at the top of his lungs and really should like the greatest wizard alive was vital, and when his voice cracked in the beginning of the movie I just couldn't bear it, and I still wonder why that wasn't re-shot.<br/><br/>All that aside, this movie was great. The actors were excellent, the effects were brilliant, and the plot was, in my opinion, the best of all the Harry Potter movies/books, and the most interesting. This movie was very well done, and my negative comments were only on a few very minor things. <br/><br/>Eight out of ten."

","The first time i heard about Harry Potter was a couple of years ago and i was totally disgusted by the fuss created round it. But then came the films. Needless to say that i haven't read any of the books. I saw the first film and it was rather cool, so was the second. I'm almost 18, and i must assure you that i've left behind the age of toys . The 3rd was rather scary comparing it to its predecessors. Harry Potter was complexly built, and he showed, obviously human traits. The same thing happens in ""The Goblet of Fire"", but, i prefer ""The Prizoner..."" best. People say it was Daniel Radcliffe was rather unconvincing, true, but, he inspired manhood, power and impulse. ""The Goblet"" is quite mixed up, not knowing, as a viewer what will happen next. This is the very aim of the filmmakers. In my opinion, the relationship of Harry with his friends is underdeveloped. They try some sort of a love triangle and rivalry, but all is too ambiguous. It was good film, but i'm really looking forward to seeing the sequel."

The movie consist of only action and hardly any substance. Three major things that connect between movies are - the raise of Lord Voldemort, the feeling Hermione have for Ron and true identity of Lucius Malfoy.<br/><br/>Anyway the movie does provide excellent special effect, with loads of scene from air, ground, to underwater fight. Making it consistently trilling to watch. Also in this installment there are also kids from other school which help to add more character to the movie making more present to watch.<br/><br/>My final words: This is a much darker version than the first three, also with the most excitement.

"Boba_Fett1138","9","0","1","5 April 2006"," I'm both surprised and impressed.
","Although the previous 3 Harry Potter movies were good as entertainment, I probably never was the biggest fan of the movie franchise. The previous movies all had their flaws, mainly with the pace and character treatment. However ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" seems to do everything right, what the previous did wrong. I was surprised as well as impressed with this fourth Harry Potter establishment.<br/><br/>The main characters in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" are maturing and luckily so is the movie and its story. Harry Potter and friend face beside the usual problems (Voldemort, the Malfoy's, some evil school teachers) also a whole new different sort of problem; puberty. Hermione has her occasional mood swings and easily gets agitated and Ron seems to be more interested in the girls at school (especially the French) than in brewing potions. It all gives the main characters a totally humane face and suddenly makes us look differently at them and we realize that they're growing up fast now. It makes the movie a whole lot more realistic and it's easier for the viewer as well to identify with the main characters.<br/><br/>There were several problems with the previous three Harry Potter movies. One was occasionally the pace. It was offbeat at times and there were some unnecessary characters and subplots in them. The pace in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" however is fantastic. It doesn't waste any time and everything happens very quick and the movie feels very consistent. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" had the problem that it took itself far too serious. It was a good movie but there was little fun and things to enjoy in it. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" however is far more humor filled and in fact is the Harry Potter movie with the most humor in it as of yet. It are not childish jokes but instead consist out of very well constructed and realistic comical situations and dialogs. It makes the movie very entertaining and pleasant to watch, even though the movie itself is just as dark, if not darker, as ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"".<br/><br/>Yes, this really is a PG-13 rating movie. There are some scary moments in it and finally also Lord Voldemort transforms into a far more threatening, convincing and scary, almost horror-like looking villain. He also is perfectly scary and villainous portrayed by actor Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>There was always a big difference between the adult cast and young cast. Both seemed like a different separated class and they never really felt completely as a whole. This time however the young cast perfectly blends in with the adults, which is I think mainly due to the way of directing by Mike Newell. I have the feeling that previous Harry Potter directors tried to impress the viewers with the big well known adult cast that had many well known names in them. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" however focuses more on the three young main characters and Harry Potter himself in particular in this case. The adult cast this time really play nothing more than the sidekicks of the movie and that's also the way it should be I think. The Harry Potter movies are all about the three main characters and it makes a whole lot more sense of the movie to focus mainly just on them. The screen time with the adult cast has surprisingly cut down, compared to all the previous two movies. Some people might be disappointed by this but I'm of opinion that this was the right step for the story and also the entire movie franchise in particular.<br/><br/>But yes, of course the adult cast is still impressive to watch, they just had been given lesser chance to shine this time. I'm especially glad Alan Rickman and Jason Isaacs returned and reprized their roles. But the movie also has some fresh new names in it, such as; Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson and the earlier mentioned Ralph Fiennes. They are a welcome addition to the already impressive cast list. <br/><br/>The story itself is exciting, mysterious and fun as well to watch. The movie is perfectly constructed and also has some fine looking special effects, consumes and sets. It's a fine adventurous and more serious movie to watch for both young ones and adults, even though the movie occasionally gets to scary and serious for the very young ones probably.<br/><br/>It does all the little thing the previous three movies did wrong, right this time. It makes ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" so far the best, most realistic, most thrilling and exciting Harry Potter movie yet.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

All the other harry potter films they were in were very good as well but i really loved this one it was so exciting and entertaining. I could watch it over and over again and never get bored. My favourite parts are the first task with the dragons and the part where harry is in the bath in the prefects bathroom. my favourite characters in this film were Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, tom Felton, clemence poesy and Katie leung they were excellent. i thought it was funny as well as scary. i really didn't like it when Cedric died i really wanted to cry. what i liked about the first task is that it is very exciting and you think oh what's gonna happen next and i really didn't want harry to get hurt. what i liked about the second task is that it seems really relaxed at first but then there are all these mer-people and harry wants to free Hermione and Ron but Hermione is for Victor to save. what i liked about the third task the maze is that it is excellent the way they have done all the special effects and it's just great to be able to watch a film with that kind of thing in it. i thought it was horrible the way voldemort put harry behind an axe which was voldemorts fathers grave and the going to touch his scar. it must have been really painful. and i really wanted to cry when he and Cedric got back to hogwarts but Cedric was already dead and then there is harry crying and it was just horrible i don't like seeing people upset even if it is a film and there is Amos diggory crying and yelling ""my boy that's my boy!"" i really felt sorry for him and harry. but then it turned out alright in the end and i felt abit better. i thought it was funny when harry and Ron were at the yule ball and they had to go with the patil twins that was quite funny actually. and then there's Ron jealous because Hermione had gone with Victor krum instead of with him. because like at the beginning of the film, Ron was mad about Victor but then he hates him for taking Hermione. its so totally obvious that he likes her. and harry really wanted to go with cho Chang but she went with Cedric and it was quite funny. i also thought is was funny when they are having a test or something in the great hall and they are talking and snape hits them with a book and everything. the film was funny, horrible, exciting, terrifying all in one i would definitely consider buying this on DVD."

"TxMike","Null","0","1","1 April 2006"," Another fun, visually stunning Harry Potter movie.
","Even though we are grandparents, sometimes we just like to be like kids again, and that's what watching a Harry Potter movie does for us. As always the trio are Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. As with all Harry Potter stories this one gets a bit complex, and being an American I don't always catch the references made in the script, but none of that really matters. You just pop in the DVD, crank up the subwoofer, and enjoy.<br/><br/>The ""Goblet of Fire"" reference is to a magical goblet of fire. A tri-wizard competition is to be held, and the potential participants are warned that it is dangerous, even life-threatening. Also, you have to be 17 or older to enter. Two other schools of wizards are brought to Hogwarts, where the selections are to be made. As the ""goblet of fire"" magically spits out partially burned pieces of paper with names, finally three are chosen, one from each school. But lo and behold, a 4th paper is spit out, with the name Harry Potter. All are surprised because Potter is only 14 (Radcliffe was actually 16) and was not supposed to be entered. Potter claimed that he DIDN'T enter his name.<br/><br/>Regardless of all that the tri-wizard competition is held, with 4 participants. One involves snatching a golden egg from a fire-breathing dragon, that also flies! Another is retrieving a personal object from deep in the sea within one hour. Another is a giant maze of hedges, but it comes alive! In the end, no surprise, Harry Potter gets to the bottom of things and the dastardly deeds of others are revealed. Just a fun, fantasy movie with no ""lessons."""
"allensmyth","10","0","1","26 March 2006"," Excellent attempt at summarising the book...
","Excellent attempt at summarising the book... however, as I usually find,the plot was somewhat scant and could actually be disjointed at times. Some of the brilliance that is JK Rowling obviously had to be compromised, with some of the book's sub-plots being completely omitted (as obviously necessary). Lets face it, who has the money to make a six hour movie to include everything? Radcliffe's performance is wonderful as Potter. Snape is almost completely lost as a character. Dumbledore seems to have lost his powerful presence somewhat. A lot of the tension in the book is just not here. The final scenes, however, are truly magnificent.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that you enjoy the movie as it is, and try not to compare it too much to the book. Given the sacrifices of this movie, I look forward to the Order of the Pheonix with some trepidation."
"the_real_HBP","9","0","1","26 March 2006"," awesome, but I have my complaints
","OK, this movie was awesome by far, but I have to say I like the third somewhat more than this one. I mean it was good, great affects, and the story line was good but I think it moved a little too fast. If I'm not mistaken, in the book the students of Hogwarts had a bit of time before the other two schools arrived. And the tasks...they were good until the third, what was up with the bushes being the only thing besides each other that was challenging them, I was so excited to see all of the things that he was to face, only to be disappointed to see that there was nothing. But, with all of my negative criticism towards the movie,I have to give the entire cast and crew kudos on the graveyard scene, awesome, it lighetend my mood. Especially the death of Cederic, I mean we all knew he was going to die(or at least the people who had read the books) but just the way the film-makers did it so well it made me feel sad and almost as if I hadn't expected it. Being a die hard Harry Potter fan I suppose my criticism comes somewhat from this being my favorite installment of the series so far. I have many complaints about this movie but overall I really like it."

","I'm hoping one of you can help explain a few things. I have read the books but still...I'm a little confused. If this has already been discussed, I apologize for annoying you.<br/><br/>What was the point of letting Harry compete in the Triwizard Tournament in the first place? I mean... Voldemort didn't want him killed right away until he grew stronger, right? So they could have that climactic scene in the end? But Harry could have been killed during the actual tournament. Dumbledore himself has said that many people in the past have died competing. Couldn't they have just let Harry be, and waited until Voldemort was stronger and then just snatch Harry from wherever he was? To perform that spell that brought Voldy back 100%? Also...I'm looking for a complete definition of a death eater for my little brother. Can you tell me where to go? Thanks!!"
"flavia18","8","0","1","24 March 2006"," Some major annoyances, but the rest fabulous
","For all the things they had to cut out, the director really had his nerve throwing in the stupid things he did - specifically the goony dance numbers of the entry into Hogwarts of the other schools (to say nothing of the disgustingly gratuitous breast/rear shots of the Beauxbatons girls). I understand the cinematic need to differentiate the schools, but was it really necessary to change the other 2 schools to same-sex schools? That struck me as a weak, cheap ploy. The costumes and attitudes (which were terrific choices) enough would have worked - the director should have had some faith in himself.<br/><br/>However, using Neville instead of Dobby was a fabulous idea, both cinematically as well as plot-wise, because it helps show Neville's growth & sets his character up for the next movie.<br/><br/>Visually, the dragon sequence was the best in the film - as it was doubtless supposed to be. I suppose it would have been too much to ask to have Harry's scene be shorter so we could see the other champions fight their dragons - especially given that it was all CGI & not animatronic, but let's not be greedy! I disagreed with the way Diggory was portrayed, & not just from a fangeek perspective. If the director was going to add/change things to differentiate between foreign schools, he should have kept in characterization that delineated the different Hogwarts Houses. He took out everything that made Cedric as special as he was written - thereby at least slightly undercutting the devastation of his loss.<br/><br/>The setting for the Ball - incredibly gorgeous! Everyone gave sterling performances - no surprise there :-)"
"abum190","8","0","1","21 March 2006"," The best Harry Potter movie so far, and a good movie to boot
","I never really liked the first two movies in this series- they failed to entertain and capture me like the books did, even though the first two books were not as entertaining and capturing as the following four. Prisoner of Azkaban was a good movie, but I was angry at some plot points left out and the treatment of Hermione as a character (She's cool in the movies, but uncool in the books. Correct me if I'm wrong.) Now this one completely delivers- even despite the missing plot points, something Azkaban (the movie) failed to fully do.<br/><br/>This movie holds everything that the book does. The action is fun and worth watching and it stays pretty much true to the major plot points in the book. Director Mike Newell and Screenwriter Steve Kloves took a few liberties, but that's necessary for a Bible-length book like Harry Potter. But where the first two failed and the third only began to comprehend was how to harness the spirit of Rowling's writing. Rowling has dry humor and loves her characters and settings, imbuing each one with something wonderful. Newell captures both excellently in this movie- the dry humor and the wonder in her characters- and he does so without strenuously copying every plot detail from the book (listen up, Chris Columbus).<br/><br/>I loved this movie and love it apart from the book. The cast is still good and has always been good, and Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes make good additions to it. If the fifth movie is as good as this one, I'll say it was worth making the series into a movie franchise."
"ruppooson","9","0","1","19 March 2006"," Clearing stuff up
","First of all, most of the people here say that they got Dumbledore wrong. I believe quite differently. In the 4th, 5th , and 6th books, J.K. Rowling begins to peel away the facade or veneer that Dumbledore was seen as. Dumbledore is strong and a true leader, but he has human faults. He is not fearless, like Harry thought, which just makes Harry think'What now? Who do I count on?'""Goblet"" shows Dumbledore as a frail old man. Sure, he seemed fearless in the first three. For those of you who have read the 5th book know about the prophecy. Now, if Dumbledore knew that, which he does, if Harry died in the tournament, that meant Voldemort would grow the strongest ever. In your declining years, wouldn't you be afraid? The point is that Dumbledore is not God. He is not immortal. He fears death and evil. HE IS A HUMAN BEING! In ""Goblet"" you see him as one. So if you think they got him wrong, your just stupid. I mean, how would you react? I think Dumbledore handled the situation well, which makes Harry admire him more, even through his fear.<br/><br/>Second off, people thought that too much was cut out. Many people are saying that they should have made two movies. Oh, that would be great. You go and watch the first half and get left off with one of those stupid cliffhangers. 6 months later, you go watch the second half. How the heck are you going to remember what happened in the 1st half? And, you should know, its BASED off of the book, NOT word for word off the book. Also, J.K. Rowling previews the script beforehand if you didn't know. If she felt that anything extremely important is omitted , she flat out tells them. SHE seemed to be perfectly happy about it. And most of the important scenes were included, for example: graveyard, Moody, all three tasks are accurate. Don't worry yourselves over minor details. By the way, if you thought Dobby should have given the gillyweed to Harry, the reason they didn't was because of high special effects costs.<br/><br/>Third of all, think off it as a movie. You don't enjoy as much if you sit there and go, "" That wasn't in the book. That's the wrong line. That never happened."" Its a good movie, standing alone and not being compared to the books. Like Princess Diaries, which were based off the books. The books and the movies were good. The movies DEFINITELY wasn't word for word, but was good STANDING ALONE.<br/><br/>Acting was great and special effects were mind blowing. Go and watch for yourself. It explores teenage problems properly but not with to much hormonal content that it clutters the movie. I loved it and I think if you read all of the above and pop in the DVD with an open mind, it won't be a waste of 2 and 1/2 hours."
"hmarasco","3","0","1","13 March 2006"," best book, movie not so good.
","This is my favorite book. The book has so much detail, so many stories within the main story and so much excitement that defines the main story and next books. Sad to say that they include in the movie maybe half of the book and another person on this site said it best when they where upset about this movie not being two movies. If they did not want two movies go for just one long great tale of a movie. I sat through 4hours of Lord of The Rings and did not want it to end. So no matter what I say the bottom line is it is no comparison to the book and it makes a cheesy love/ adventure movie about a fairy tale world. Read the book and watch the movie only to see what they think the details look like (even though they didn't go by a lot of the books details). Keep in mind no great book can ever be turned into a great movie."

","I never thought it could get any worse than the last piece of Harry Potter crap The Prisoner of Azkaban , but damn was I wrong! First off, I have the book, but didn't read much of it (since it wasn't good and am not a fan of the Harry Potter books (I got it as a present and I was trying to be generous). So, I'm not the guy to give you those ""book-to-movie"" comparisons. Now, on with the damn review! The Goblet of Fire wasn't Harry Potter at all! Not that many creatures or magic is seen (which is a load of crap), and is way more of a love story! No, I'm kidding you! Goblet turned out being a fantasy love story at Hogwarts. Harry loses best friend, tries to get revenge, his crush Hermoine (and don't give me any crap that he doesn't like her) falls in love with another man and he is now depressed. Let alone, he's in a god damned Triwizard Tournament (which we don't see much of, just hear about it a lot and see some off-court punking). This ruined the whole damn movie! Sure, Prisoner was a big pile of flaming dog crap (you know, the kind you leave on people's porch) and left a stench for miles. But, at least that stayed to the Harry Potter tradition: The magic and the creatures. Goblet destroyed that by slapping in some sappy bullcrap that made me crap my pants worse than the time I had that ""weird and unusual"" dream about Joan Rivers *shudders*! I hated it! Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane, Ocean's Twelve ) was ruined here! He too had a love interest *breaks out in laughter*. Sorry, I just don't see him in a relationship. I can already imagine the date: ""Hey, you wanna go to my house and I can cook up some ""special"" potion for you?"" God, I just don't see it happening (though I just did). Anyway, like I said, Hagrid was ruined here. He gets a lovebird (which, like mentioned before, is laughable and disastrous). But, worse than that is his lack of screen time. What the hell? This guy is an icon in the Harry Potter franchise, and you just give him a few scenes and give him his pay and a big-ass bucket of ""Popeye's"" chicken. Damn! There was also a disturbing scene in which Harry is getting a bubble bath (wtf?) and that ghost chick that hides out in the bathroom , but I'm not getting into that because I'm already having nightmares about it. And I haven't even gone to bed yet! This movie was just a putrid mess! Harry Potter magic and creatures are replaced with sappy love story and Hagrid gets a crap taken on him by the producers!

","DANIEL RADCLIFFE and his company of wizards are having the scariest ride of all in this dark, dangerous and yet fun-filled thriller with absolutely stupefying special effects and some slam bang cinematography that is nothing short of dazzling.<br/><br/>Readers of the novel may quip at all the material that couldn't be included, but the movie is extremely well-paced with a fair amount of humor to liven up even the scariest moments. The story is a lot less complex to follow than some of the others and lets you concentrate on the rich assortment of characters with almost Dickensian names.<br/><br/>MIRANDA RICHARDSON does a nifty job as an overly exuberant journalist who exaggerates her tabloid material (by the name of Rita Skeeter), and Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do their usual superb jobs in their by now familiar roles.<br/><br/>RALPH FIENNES does a chilling job as Voldemort for the final maze sequence which makes it questionable whether parents should let the very young watch this without fair warning. He's the meanest, darkest villain yet in all these Potter stories and does a brilliant job of being villainous.<br/><br/>For Potter fans, this should come as a welcome chapter in this series, extremely well directed and acted thanks to a superb cast and crew. Patrick Doyle's music is a good background score without being too obtrusive."

","After hearing and reading from so many places about this being the best and most exciting Harry Potter movie so far, this was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>Being a movie that was hopefully meant for children from 5 to 8 years old and the fact that it's a Harry Potter movie, it may be excused that the movie was somewhat foreseeable, but why oh why was it so long. By cutting off material that didn't seem to have anything to do with the plot movie would have been a short subject but so much better. There is a ballroom dance scene that lasts for hours, or at least feels like it, without anything to do with the story. It seems there is an enormous amount of material that has put into the movie just to make it longer. The movie is also filled with annoyances and things that just didn't make any sense. One of the things in particular is the ""you'll stand alone""-speech about the TriWizard tournament. Because of it Harry seems like a cheater. He is helped by half of Hogwarts for every challenge, never mind the fair-play and try telling your kids not to cheat on exams after this. And why are all the people always gathered to cheer and watch these great tournament events in places from which it's impossible to see anything that is happening. Furthermore the ending just becomes ridiculous because of the Bond-cliché: ""I've got my enemy, but alas I won't destroy him once and for all, I shall first give a pointless speech and allow him at least to escape if not defeat me"". Well, I guess you just can't kill the hero in the end, especially if there are sequels to come.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the ""Directed by Mike Newell"" appearing at the end. I also have to say there is much less quedditch than in the previous films, which is good, because the game makes absolutely no sense."

","Mike Newell's attempt to darken the tone of the Harry Potter franchise in 'Goblet of Fire' is welcome. Out go a number of the more tricksy background CGI embellishments, and a greater attempt is made to develop Harry's character. The opening is genuinely creepy, and there are more opportunities for Daniel Radcliffe to interact with, rather than react to, other performers. Ralph Feinnes as Voldermort is gleefully grim, works well with the young lead, and it would have been nice to see more of him. Newell references many a horror movie to good effect, but this, essentially, is where the film falters: the characters and the plot just aren't distinct enough to penetrate the darkness, and the inevitable lesson-learned  about the finality of death  is somewhat undermined by Harry having just survived his latest encounter with Lord V through the intervention of his long-dead parents (not to mention an odd bathroom encounter with the increasingly randy  disturbingly so as wee Danny's 16 and Shirley Henderson is 37  Moaning Myrtle. Radcliffe is a more confident presence than in previous ventures, but he doesn't have sufficient presence to carry the film. All in all a game attempt at redeveloping the franchise, and occasionally visually interesting  but let down by an insubstantial script and characters."

This by far had the most action, horror, drama and Teen hormones in it, which made it good. All the action scenes were impressive and magnificent. The horror was pretty awesome too because in the last 3 movies we didn't see a lot of horror. Now the Drama...so much going on in this movie..it's either drama with friends or drama with love or drama with enemies or just plain old drama, and i think that a lot of the teenagers that saw this movie noticed drama between the characters..well at least i did. Let me just say that this is a great Family movie, action movie, magical movie i've ever seen. They really portrayed the World Quidditch Cup well, the 3 tasks that the 4 champions had to do were very impressive and action filled also, and then the love relationships were also portrayed well. Well i would go and see this movie! definitely i mean i've seen it twice so far and there are more times to come! so go on and watch it! except i probably wouldn't go see it if you bring a 3-6 year old kid along...because of all the horror and stuff.<br/><br/>Any questions? just e-mail me at ucan_trustme30@hotmail.com"

","The most interesting one in the series, combining the youth, the competition, the courage, the magic, the blood, the friendship, the love, the devil and the death together.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, the Goblet of Fire became a dream of all the kids, as well as 3 previous movie. However, in the very end, the dream-making Goblet turned itself into a mincing machine, sliced a 17-year-old boy in a shot, and revived Voldemort.<br/><br/>I can understand why the movie wanted Voldemort, but I can't understand why it killed a boy in a shot. Indeed, the scenes are created for attracting (kidnapping) the audiences, and I see that they want to show that curiosities maybe too dear to afford. (That poor boy won't die if they cancel the championship, or if he listens to Harry to return to that goblet of fire immediately). By killing good things we can always get shaken, but that idea should not always be carried out for a good movie.<br/><br/>Due to this and that, this movie is rated PG-13. However, in the theater, though going with their parents, a lot of kids were sitting alone, a through the nd no parents are guiding them through the movie. Harry Potter is still considered a movie for general audiences, and for this, I'll have to take a point out of this movie, because it went too far away from its original ideas.<br/><br/>I myself just finished my teens, and fortunately I understood the price of life, and I appreciate it. If you have kids, be sure to sit beside them, and guide them out of the shadow of the violence part: the true meaning of sacrifice in the movie is to show both the dearness and the fragility of life. Don't let them feel either killing is magic or magic is killing, and make sure they don't feel that killing necessary/easy in the movie, as they can very easily carry out the scenes of movies in the realistic.<br/><br/>Again, this is the best movie in the series by far, and its role is just like Star War Episode III. However, just like enjoying all other good movies, one needs to enjoy it with cautious."

It was particularly more interesting because the director seemed to add a little more humor and romance in to the movie, which is great. One thing that kept bothering me during the movie was the characterization of Albus Dumbledore. I'm sorry for the old man, but Dumbledore was just way off from the portrayal of him from the book. I've always imagined Dumbledore to be calm, intelligent, and even, majestic. However, the Dumbledore I saw in the movie was irritating, confused, and short-tempered. I wonder why the director is continuing to use this Dumbledore (I don't know the actor), while there must be at least SOMEONE who can do a better job them him. However, other characters were great, and I especially liked the little romance going on between Hermione and Ron (or Harry?).

My favourite scenes were when Harry is selected for the tournament , the Maze the Underater scenes etc,even at 41 I found some parts of the film quite scary .

The script is excellent; unlike various other films with sequels (LOTR, Terminator, Beverly Hills Cop, etc.), this film takes what we already know from the previous Harry Potter films and religiously builds on it. Old tricks are not rehashed and the film isn't retelling the same boring old story all over again.<br/><br/>Think of it as a different adventure featuring all of your favorite characters (Harry Potter, Hermione, Ron, Professor Snape, Dumbledorf, old woman, Hagrid, the twin boys, Ron's parents, Harry's parents, Malfoy and his father, etc.) with the original cast of people that wonderfully play them.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much from this film, given the fact that the series has seen a different director (a third one), but was pleasantly surprised. It seems that with each successive film, the series grows darker and darker. Pretty soon, perhaps we can expect a Harry Potter film to carry an R rating? There were several images in this film that could be considered disturbing to small children, but otherwise a fun film to watch.<br/><br/>The rating given by me is a 9 out of 10. Reason being was because this film didn't start off like the others. For instance, I actually like seeing Harry's uncle, aunt, their fat son and their house. Also, I enjoy the weird events seen in the beginning of the previous films (running through the wall, the flying car and the triple decker speedy bus). This Harry Potter film didn't have enough of Professor Snape, Hagrid, Hermione, Dumbledorf, the old lady and some of the other familiar characters.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Harry never got around to tell Dumbledorf that Malfoy's father was one of the death eaters. So those things aside, this film was pretty spectacular. I hope the next film will have more of those characters that I mentioned above."
"basrutten","8","0","1","24 December 2005"," A fun yet somewhat lacking roller-coaster ride
","When I heard about this movie I my first reaction was: ""how in the world are they going to fit this book into a movie"". The fourth installment in the Harry Potter series (the book that is) is probably the most complex and dense of the series, so distilling it into a movie certainly wouldn't be easy without losing a lot in translation.<br/><br/>Much more than the other Potter movies, ""The Goblet of Fire"" is an action blockbuster. The emphasis in the movie is clearly on the spectacular trials that make of the Tri-Wizard tournament, and, granted, these have been translated to the screen in an astonishing way. The special effects are among the best, the action is riveting, and there's plenty of suspense.<br/><br/>Also, I have to say that this movie was the first genuinely funny Potter movie. While the other movies have sometimes been good for a couple of chuckles, the middle part of ""Goblet of Fire"" is a complete hoot, and finally does the humor of the books justice.<br/><br/>All this comes at a price though. In order to fit everything into a movie of manageable length, a lot of comprises have been made. The story has been simplified quite a bit, and a lot of the details that make the books so great have unfortunately been omitted. Having read the book, I could follow the plot just fine, but I suspect that without prior knowledge, it would be quite easy to get completely lost.<br/><br/>Also, everything moves at such a breakneck pace that it's really hard to keep up: one dangerous situation isn't over yet, or another one has already presented itself. Sure, it makes for a great roller-coaster ride, but ultimately also for a rather shallow one, since character development is not one of the movie's strong points, and ultimately it's hard to really care about characters don't really know.<br/><br/>In this of artistic quality, this movie probably falls somewhere in the middle. It's not nearly as good as the hugely atmospheric and superbly made third part, but it's still a huge improvement over the rather pedestrian first two parts. Also, the acting could still use a little work. Ralph Fiennes is great, but a lot of the other admittedly great actors are underused, and the rest of the acting is passable but nothing great.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good, but not a great, movie in its own right. It's a tremendously fun, if shallow, thrill ride. Compared to the book though, there's definitely something missing.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of *****"
"shuichi_shindosan","9","0","1","20 December 2005"," what a talented film
","I watched this film and the chills that went down my spine. Voldermort was perfect, Ralph Fienes played the role like an evil person should.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the emotional up roar between Ron and Hermionie just after the ball, there acting has gone up a few classes.<br/><br/>Daniel surprised me because in all the other films his acting has been kind of.....eh....awful! AKA: ""HE WAS THERE FRIEND!"" Quote from POA.<br/><br/>But in this film, the end sequence with Cedric dead on the floor and Harry smothering over him, his acting game me how do you say it.....GOOSEBUMPS.I was so amazed. Ifelt like crying myself. <br/><br/>Oh and hagrid and Madame Maxine was so perfect, when there dancing, Hagrid puts his hand down and attempts to touch Madame Maxine's bottom and she pulls his hand back up. <br/><br/>And I have read the book and I loved it, I read it about a year ago, so I was glad because then i realised how close to the book the film was. <br/><br/>Wormtail at the end, ""The Dark Lord shall rise!"" Oh how chilling. I loved it. <br/><br/>This film is so enjoyable and it will crack the kids up and the adults can realise how adult like it is. I think this film is more for an older audience because it has too much explaining for the kids. But still kids will have a good laugh when they see this movie.<br/><br/>It's better than all the rest of the HP films and I think none of the future one's will be this good. So see it before any more come out.<br/><br/>9/10"
"agmoldham","6","0","1","18 December 2005"," Not for the tiny tots
","I have got to confess that I have never been a great Potter fan. I have never read the books, so my only knowledge of Potter is via the movies. The previous 3 movies were a bit bland for those of that weren't fans of Potter, but this movie steps up the pace, particularly in the final act. I'm sure that the majority of the generation that have been brought up on Potter will be spellbound by these movies. I know there was a few students around me in the cinema who were absolutely rapped up in the movie.<br/><br/>This film sees 1 student from Hogwarts in a contest with a student from two other wizard colleges. Harry Potter shouldn't be able to compete due to his age, but the Goblet has other ideas.<br/><br/>Has mentioned previously the final act is where the movie really gets going and there are parts of it which are genuinely scary. The film also sees the youngsters start to become aware of the opposite sex which they all find quite embarrassing. I still can't help the fact that I prefer Malfoy to Potter, but the best thing about this movie is that it has made me look forward to the next one."
"bjmoomey","7","0","1","15 December 2005"," Exciting, but missing a lot from the book
","This movie is exciting with great special effects and acting. For someone who has not read the books, it is a great flick with lots of action.<br/><br/>For anyone who has read and loves the books, a lot of things are missing or changed. Some of that is to be expected, given the length of the book. Unfortunately, some of the things left out, although not important to Goblet of Fire, are important to the continued story line that goes on in Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore is also not true to character when he reacts violently to Harry's entrance into the Triwizard tournament.<br/><br/>I love the books and did enjoy this movie, but some things could have been better. Perhaps this should have been done in two parts or as an extra long movie with an intermission built in to allow for more of the things left out to be included."

","Let's get one thing straight - Emma Watson in that ball gown at the top of the staircase has to rank as one of the most entrancing and serenely beautiful sights my eyes have beheld since I saw my wife (then, only a few years older than Emma) glide into the church on our wedding day. Nothing in this movie was ever going to top that emotionally riveting scene. Every man's dream - a mixture of childish innocence, youthful beauty and understated desire, who could deny she embodied at that moment, every aspect of sought-after femininity a man could crave? The film hit the heights in places - the computer graphics for the Quidditch World Cup. The awesome dragon-fight sequences - the scenes of the beast scrabbling and dislodging tiles on the steeples of Hogwarts was unadulterated movie magic. The inspired underwater camera-work with the creatures of the deep bent on making life excessively uncomfortable for Harry.<br/><br/>What the film lacked was continuity and in the upshot - purpose. Almost everything you saw in this film would have made not the slightest difference in whatever order you saw it. Scenes came and went which may well have been meaningful to those who live and breathe Potter and who have read the book cover to cover, but for the unconverted...a case of huh?? What a chronic waste of those stunning Quidditch World Cup scenes when you never got to see any World Cup. All that pre-release guff about Harry Potter's first big romance and screen kiss with the young Japanese student....they barely had three lines together! Radcliffe himself - back to his ultra wooden ways of the Philosopher's Stone - he has no vocal delivery or 'presence' whatsoever. As always - it is left to Emma Watson to act her two co-stars right off the screen.<br/><br/>Visually sumptuous but sadly lacking in meaningful come-uppance. A good test of any movie is to ask yourself ""Could you sit through that again?"" The last two films in the series - yes I could...this one - no way!!!"
"circlelink","10","0","1","11 December 2005"," The Best One Ever
","The Harry Potter series gets better and better because the actors are getting better. I would have liked a bit of focus on Diggery and a few more classes explored -- especially the quiddich match -- that would have been spectacular -- however I thought the pace was a bit fast - and I thought even if one had never read the book, it was done where they got the gist of it. The opening was excellent, excellent, as soon as I was thrown into that opening like the book -- I was hooked again and could remember every nuance of the book -- it was a brilliant opening! This is a great series and I hope they keep coming -- very well acted and very well directed -- Loved every exciting moment Miss Desmond"

The dragon, the lake and the creatures in it, the maze, Voldemort, The Goblet Of Fire, the Yule Bal, The Quidditch World-cup...everything is perfectly done! Nothing's missing! The movie is to short, but it's good anyway. This is the years best adventure/fantasy movie. And I really hope that the movie wins Oscars. I can't wait until the next movie and i hope the next movie is even better than this, if it's possible."
"northoftheriver","10","0","1","10 December 2005"," Clearly the best of the Potter Series so far
","I am amazed how well a 750 page book has been condensed into 2 1/2 hours of film. The action and tension never wavered and as an adult I love the fact that the characters are growing up into interesting and in real life incredibly photogenic people. The three main actors improve every time I see a film and the most noticeable improvement to me is in the acting skills of Daniel Radcliffe, who displayed an emotional range that I have not seen before. I look forward to seeing him and the other main characters in future Potter and non-Potter films. I have seen this film more than once and it has already been added to one of my all time personal favorites. I must admit that I am a shameless ""Potter"" fan whose love of this story began with the books. For those of you who are upset with some details being omitted, get over it. Overall, the end result is an extremely well crafted and enjoyable film."

","I saw this movie yesterday and it was in one word:great! The first half of the movie was like a comedy as there was lots of jokes thrown in but after that things got dark. I found the scene when the statue was holding Harry and Voldemorts rebirth from the baby into a horrible evil man to be done well.Also the challenges that Harry faced in the triwizard tournament were very cool.I especially liked the first challenge when the contestants had to get the golden egg from their dragon.At one stage I thought Harry was not going to complete the challenge but he did.Also I liked the maze challenge as the item they touched was a port key and led them to Voldemort and then Harrys friend died. The acting was average at first but got better and the effects were very well done. I highly recommend this movie but be warned parents please do not take little children to this movie as it will scare them and they wont be able to concentrate for 3 hours."

","Can anyone explain why the new Dumbledore looks as if his wearing his great-great grandmother's pajamas? Remember Richard Harris's beautiful robes? His robe is not at all what one would expect from the ""great"" Albus Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Also, his handling of Harry after the selection is so out of character, that it was quite embarrassing. He really just doesn't pull it off. He does have a very beautiful well modulated voice though - that makes up for quite a bit!<br/><br/>In comparison with the books he is just not the strong figure that we all know and respect."
"sgetter","4","0","4","6 December 2005"," Don't understand all the applauding this movie gets
","This movie is slightly worse than the Prisoner of Azkaban, which puts it in last place in my book. It suffers from all the problems they had in the third movie. Namely, they didn't bother telling the story. They just went from scene to scene, trying to get all the action elements in under the time allotted.<br/><br/>I don't know if it counts as a spoiler to tell you what's not in a movie, but here is a short list of what you won't see: Qwidditch; goblins (or their gold); the name Luto Bagman; Dobbie, Winky, or S.P.E.W.; Bill, Charlie, Molly, or Percy Weezly; blast-ended scroots; a class besides Defense Against the Dark Arts; Rita Skeeter as a bug; any mention of Bertha Jawkins; the marauders map; the trial of Barty Crouch Jr or his cohorts; any explanation of how he got out of Azkaban. <br/><br/>In other words, they left out all of the story. In it's place, they expanded the action to include an extended dragon combat. They made Moaning Myrtle much more perverse than the book did. <br/><br/>If you want to go see mindless action, go find some children's movie that isn't based on a piece of literature. But if you are looking for a good adaptation of The Goblet of Fire you will be disappointed. And if you didn't read the book, or see the first three movies you will be so lost as to what's going on that you'll be bored out of your mind."

","although the film does try to stick to the book (apparently) i cant help but feel the films are aiming more and more towards the really young kids. Harry Potter is enjoyed by everyone, and i think its a shame that the older teenagers cant enjoy the film. The plot of the film also trails off at a tangent, and although keeping the triwizard tournament the focus, they mess around with the barty crouch stuff and moody stuff. all in all, and extra 20 minutes wouldn't have hurt the director to add those extra bits in. QUite disappointing, only watch if you have read the book, as you may not understand everything. The only decent bit was the end biot with voldermort, it woz pretty much accurate, and voldemort looked like i imagined him, that is the only reason the films gets a one in my opinion."

","This movie is a must see film!! It is very exciting and humorous as well as frightening in some parts. The special effects are amazing and very realistic. Daniel Radcliff is great in this movie he shows deep emotion and determination in his role as Harry Potter. I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 10 as there are some scary scenes that would give younger children night mares. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time as it was a very gripping movie. However the movie is a quick and not as spread out as the book. Even though it is 2 and a half hours long.

Had Mr Potter continued to run and grabbed the Cup then the life of the other competitor would have been saved, just like Viktor Krum and the female witch. They were alive and well after being gobbled up by the roots. Because Mr Potter had to act like a Saint and stopped to save the other competitor, he died. Good one Mr Potter.<br/><br/>And even after returning from a brush with Lort Voldemort, Mr Potter did not warn the Professor Dumbledore that one of the supporter of Lord Voldermort is Lucius Malfoy"

","The movie is good and honestly, can people just let go of the fact that the movie is missing in details? A movie is a movie. . . and I don't really expect people to sit through a 12 hour movie. Maybe they should have split it into two parts like what they did with Kill Bill. But you know what? It's too freaking late! There's nothing you can do about it. If you're that PO'd about bit, then you're just wasting your energy having a fit. If you really want all that detail then just read the book again! Now that's not hard to do is it? Just respect what a film is. . .just for your entertainment. If you want to be intellectually stimulated, then look else where. As fans of HOP, we should all be willing to give some slack as much as you don't want to.

Emily Watson or something.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, however, was shocking. He really seems to get worse with every single film. It is about time he was dropped for someone who can act, but unfortunately it looks like he is signed up for the rest of the series.<br/><br/>Great story, great film, well directed, just let down by the title actor.

","I've never read nor have I seen any of the Harry Potter books or the previous movies, but having heard all positive comments regarding them I went to see this movie. Half way through the movie, I realized that because I didn't read the book, most of the movie did not make any sort of sense to me. I also got the feeling that they cut out VAST amounts of plot from the book, so much that the movie just felt like a vague outline of an otherwise (maybe) enjoyable story. Scene development were terrible to the point that MANY events went unexplained. Maybe to the elementary school kids, this is OK, but as an educated college student, it frustrated me to no ends. To top off a movie with no plot continuity, the ending made absolutely no attempt to salvage anything and ended on an extremely bland and lifeless note.<br/><br/>And yes, the special effects were awesome. But, at some point you have to grow up and realize that flying dragons and cool effects do not make up for a badly written script.<br/><br/>Maybe Harry Potter is just not for me, but after the movie, I've been told that none of the previous three movies were anywhere close to the inferior quality of this movie (drawing the analogy of Harry Potter IV is to HP I as Matrix II is to Matrix I) and that I should be a more objective person and not judge the entire Harry Potter series based on this disappointing experience."

","The World Quiddich Final is being held, and the Weasly family, Harry and Hermione are off to attend. Joining them are Amos Diggory and his son, Cedric Diggory. During the aftermath of the match, the camping ground is attack by Death Eaters; followers of Lord Voldemort. At the start of the schooling year of Hogwarts, two other schools have come to compete in a legendary and dangerous tournament; The Triwizard Torniment. When the three contestants are chosen; Cedric Diggory, Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour, under mysterious circumstances a forth contestant is chosen; Harry Potter. People start to question when Harry is chosen as he is under age and there are only meant to be three contestants, but its binding and Harry has no choice but to compete.<br/><br/>The three tasks are designed to test all contestants strength and knowledge, each harder than the last. Though there are much harder tasks at hand for Harry; the world of dating. Apart of the Torniment is the Yule Ball, and friendships start to wain and stretch. Ron is annoyed that Harry is in the Torniment, they both cant find dates, and Ron become irritate with Hermione when she is Viktor Krums date; to him being Harry's enemy. Though there is a darker, sinister force being awakened, with a re-occurring dream of the resurrection of Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is in essence the better film of the series to date. The book being a very thick book that has so much depth and story to it, starting to hitting emotional chords about teenage life. This isn't just about magic anymore, it starts to weave in the coming of age story; growing up, dating, betrayal of friends and being independent and seeing that adults don't have all the answers. The darker tones of the story are also being drawn out. The resurrection of Voldemort, back stabbing and betrayal of once thought allies and adding much more back story to characters, giving them more dimensional; instead of flat background characters. Though the draw back is that there is too much information in the book to bring to the screen. The opening Quiddich match is not shown and it jumps and moves really fast making it very erratic. Though it is about two and a half hours long, it would have been better if they went for another twenty minutes or so, adding those little details which would have given much more story and giving a better flow to the over all pace. They could have easily extended the length as the kids were taking in every second and would have sat through another twenty minutes easily.<br/><br/>The three tasks in the tournament are each spectacular and breath taking. The fight of the dragon is fast and has a great claustrophobic feel when inside the ring, and keeps it intensity even when it takes to the skies. The underwater challenge with the Mermaids, though not as intense is visually amazing. The mermaids are not the beautiful creates people are use to; they're brutal, menacing creates in the eerie algae green water. The giant, shape shifting garden maze is a wonderful sight. The very deep violets and blues add a very haunting feel, creating a very creepy atmosphere. Though it would have been better if they kept the creatures and challenges of the maze from the book in the movie, yet dropped from time constraints. The darkest part of the film is during the resurrection of Voldemort. <br/><br/>Whats makes Goblet of Fire a lot better than the other films is that they attained a more competent director. Mike Newell's direction is more comfortable for the story. Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuarón both did great jobs on the previous films, but Newell was more adapt to the story and forced better performances from the cast. The acting also has made a jump for the better. The three leads Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have grown older and so has their acting. While still they are not great actors, they have gain a broader emotional range evoking much more drama between them. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith don't seem as bored in their roles, Michael Gambon, as we saw from Prisoner of Azkaban he's no Richard Harris, but holds a strength to Dumbledore. Ralph Fiennes is perfect as Lord Voldemort, with a very creepy performance. Brendan Gleeson seemed to have had much to fun as the crazy, eccentric MadEye Moody. Miranda Richardson was also great as the forked tonged Rita Skeeter.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is step further forward in the series and shows that they just keep getting better."

","Where Prisoner of Azkaban left of Goblet of Fire went up in flames. I mean take a look at the movie. Plus points are the background score and the great CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) but story wise it falls flat.<br/><br/>The actors are good...Mr. Gambon as Dumbledore becomes very Bumbledore though. Or maybe even a BumbleBore. No offense to those who enjoyed the movie and definitely not to those who worked in it, but c'mon, the most powerful sorcerer in the world has to shout for silence and jump around like an over fed jack-rabbit? The books portray Dumbledore as a tall lean man who doesn't look like he's one for nonsense although he does have a mischievous side to him...Michael Gambon disappoints.<br/><br/>The storyline is much like a train that has jumped its tracks. After Crouch is found dead (which he was not in the books!) Harry goes to talk about his dreams? Was this a career counselling session?! What happened to the mention of Crouch? Not to forget Sirius and Snape's teaming up to do their bit. This is where GoF leaves off and OotP starts. If it's not shown in the movie, crucial as it is, then how will non-Potter readers pick up the threads? This may sound like a rant (rest assured it IS), but that's what the movie left me feeling...Ranting Raving Confuduncused.<br/><br/>PS: The females really enjoy Malfoy...he should be included a tad more rather than ferreting out his parts."

","In the beginning they decided to put very little time into the Quidich World Cup. It was one of the biggest events in the other movies and was heartily missed. The three tasks were filmed greatly, however with another half hour of film, they could have put more time into the ending. In the book, Sirus is introduced to Snape as still being alive, however in the movie, they don't give us much of any Sirus time. I was well pleased with the casting and acting of the actor for Lord Voldermort. Overall, I think that a much better job could have been done if there had been one more hour to tell the story. They did 3 1/2 hours in Lord of the Rings, why not with this? For a final note I would like to comment on the last minute of the credits. I found it hilarious that they decided to tell us ""No dragons were harmed during the making of this film."" That made my day. I was also quite glad to see that they took the time at the very end to stick their casting director Mary Selway. May she rest in peace."

","I was disappointed in this installment of Harry Potter. For me the heart of the Harry Potter series has been the relationships between Harry, Hermoine, and Ron and this movie by far was the worst at delving into that subject. What is more disconcerting was the centrality of that relationship to the movie and the changes that they are experiencing and the relative superficiality with which that was covered.<br/><br/>For example, the stress between Ron and Harry and Ron and Hermoine were only treated in the blowups between them but no depth was ever given. Hopefully the next installment will correct the oversight."
"mep32","9","0","1","28 November 2005"," Excellent Thriller *May contain Spoilers*
","What a wonderful film. As someone who HAS read all the books, I do not nit-pick and complain about what was left out. It is patently obvious that a book of this length is not easily adaptable into a film in the first place.<br/><br/>Mike Newell's direction was fantastic - the film had pace as well as character development and all the important bits were retained. Some people here have complained about the lack of elves - I am probably quite pleased about that, as I found it to be one of the only tedious sub-plots in the whole series. I agree that perhaps a little bit of background on Barty Crouch, as well as the revelation that Barty Crouch Jr was the murderer of Barty Crouch Senior would not have gone amiss. Also, a brief explanation that Neville's parents who had both been aurors (Dark Wizard hunters) had been tortured until they went mad - using the Crucio Curse - would have made it a lot clearer as to why Neville was SO upset during Mad-Eye Moody's lesson on forbidden curses. Apart from that, I thought that the important plot elements were very well dealt with. I thought that the casting was universally excellent. The three leads have definitely matured and improved their range and I agree that Daniel Radcliffe is the most improved. Rupert Grint is a wonderful natural actor and Emma Watson just needs to lose a little of her ""drama school"" mannerisms and be a little more natural to be even better. The adult cast are uniformly excellent and despite the cameo nature of their roles, Maggi Smith as McGonaggal and Alan Rickman as Snape added great interest and humour to the mix. The raging hormones on show were very amusing and very well described. Mike Newell has managed to pin down teenage angst without any cliché ridden sentimentality. Trust a British Director to finally get rid of the schmaltz! Excellent. The main flaw with the first two films were too many scenes with the three leads grinning at each other and giving long looks to camera. This has all gone (thankfully). Also, the plot was a lot more coherent, and well put-together. The PoA, even though very enjoyable, had SERIOUS plot holes (no explanation as to the identities of ""Moony (Lupin), Wormtail (well we know that one now), Padfoot (Sirius Black) and Prongs (James Potter, Harry's Dad) or of why they had these nicknames (they were all animaguses (animagi?) apart from Lupin and had all trained to become one out of deep friendship so that Lupin would not be alone when he was in his werewolf stage) and these were descriptions of their animal identities - Prongs was a stag padfoot the black dog and wormtail the rat) and, consequently, no explanation as to why Harry's Patronus was a stag (like James Potter as Prongs) or why this was the main reason he thought his dad had summoned the patronus to save them). This was the worst plot hole imaginable in what was otherwise an excellent third film. There is nothing nearly so bad in this one. I too missed the Dursleys (especially the excellent Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon)) but can fully understand why they were sacrificed. Also, why no Mrs Weasley? She SHOULD have definitely have been there. These quibbles aside - a truly excellent film and very faithful to the book. I only wish Mike Newell were on board for the next one!!"
"ChrisQ","3","0","1","28 November 2005"," Another missed opportunity
","GOF, like the last 2 films in particular, has left me feeling disappointed and extremely annoyed. The directors and screen writers are moving further and further away from the books. They feel they must create Hollywood-style blockbusters - high on spectacle and special effects but low on plot and characters.<br/><br/>Harry's first task involved him being chased by a dragon around Scotland demolishing castles in the process. This was almost as ludicrous as the flying car and train sequence in Chamber of Secrets (or the incredibly tacky ending when Hagrid returned to the school).<br/><br/>OK, I know some settings were very pretty - the Yule Ball and Underwater 2nd Task particularly so. However it is paramount that the audience had thoroughly read the book - otherwise many parts of the film would be absolutely meaningless.<br/><br/>From start to finish the film appeared to be a race against time with subplots and characters disappearing by the score. The Quidditch World Cup was a non-event (Who won? Who cared!). <br/><br/>Barty Crouch Junior suddenly appeared in what looked like a battlefield and apparently had devastated everything himself. <br/><br/>Did Harry actually tell Dumbledore that he had just found Barty Crouch Senior hurt/maimed/dead in the forest or did Dumbledore just rush out the office on the off-chance? <br/><br/>I am not naive enough to believe that every line from the book must be preserved. But the concept of ""I am the the director and know better than the author"" has gone way beyond the acceptable here. Little of JKR's wording has been retained. Worse still the characterisations have been drastically altered.<br/><br/>Dumbledore is no longer the solidly dependable guardian figure who believes in Harry and Harry's destiny. The wonderful character of Rita Skeeter could have been omitted from this film for all the effect she had. The goofs and omissions surrounding Sirius Black were appalling. None of Voldemort's Deatheaters seemed interested in his resurrection - let alone being scared to death. Where was the snivelling Wormtail at the rebirth of Voldemort? The Peter Pettegrew in the film could have passed for a TV chef.<br/><br/>The humour of all eccentric characters has been eliminated and their appearance in the film serves just to provide cheap laughs.<br/><br/>Book 4 is the pivotal book of the series. Its central characters are now young adults full of teenage angst. Evil has been let loose upon the Magical World which stands at the brink of catastrophe. Little of this comes across in this film. This movie ended with Hermione telling the boys to write to her over the summer????<br/><br/>I know that we shall soon hear that this is the nth highest grossing movies of all time and everyone associated with will be nominated for Oscars. There is such affection for JKR's books that this is inevitable - no matter how bad the movie<br/><br/>The HP films are just travesties of what they could have been. It is a crying shame that Peter Jackson didn't tackle this project"

","I've seen all 4 Harry Potter movies and read all 6 Harry Potter books. By far, this is my favorite of the Harry Potter movies so far. Yes, some things from the book were cut from the screenplay, but in my opinion, nothing essential was left out. The ""additions"" in the movie that weren't in the book helped to clarify the plot and fill in what was ""cut"" without ruining the flavor of the story. I don't think this was accomplished as well in ""Prizoner of Askaban.""<br/><br/>This movie definitely deserved the ""PG-13"" rating. I took my 9 and 11 year old daughters to see this movie, but only because both had read the book several times and knew what to expect, as well as when to cover their eyes! I wouldn't bring a child younger than 12 or 13 if he or she was not familiar with the story."

","In the aspect that many upon many families will be hitting the cinema's to see this i have to say that i have seen this and was surprised to find that this was best one out of all the harry potter series. Constantly interesting plot lines intertwining keep you watching throughout the film. <br/><br/>Not only families may go see this. But anyone. in all my life of watching films and going to the cinema i have never seen such a mixed variety of people queue up to see a film created purposefully for children and young adults. I was amazed that middle aged men came to see this and enjoyed it for the atmosphere. <br/><br/>Although i am not a particular keen fan of harry potter, i became interested in this film as it was full of comical scenes mixed with suspense and a good direction. The cinema that i went to see the film was in hysterics and jumping throughout. <br/><br/>The film is backed by a good cast, holding out a strong act and keeping the film interesting. A few new faces show up but just adds more brightness to the film. Overall the acting and quality of filming is really good and the props really are interesting when mixed with the amazing digital effects, look out for the dragon's and the underwater scenes. <br/><br/>the only negative feedback that i can give is that it was drying out towards the end and i became a bit impatient towards the end. And the end is a tad confusing especially for youngsters. There is no real fault in the direction of the film, just more of the storyline. A reading of the book is recommended for the clarity of the storyline. but even so it was still a good film to go and see. Good for kids but there is a few moments where the youngsters might hide in your jacket, but all that adds to the experience. <br/><br/>Definitely a film to go and see, no matter who you are or even if you like the harry potter series. Just generally a good and funny film!<br/><br/>John M"

","Just a small goof or two. Rita Skeeter insists on depicting Harry as a mere boy of twelve in her articles, but the headlines of the articles read ""teenage tragedy"". Perhaps alliteration is more important than basic math? Also, Harry makes the statement, ""Here we are, four years later."" If they are presently in their fourth year, then here they are indeed, but actually only THREE years ""later"". These and other ""goofs"" as pointed out by the esteemed members of IMDb, however, do not in my opinion take away from the general entertainment value of the movie. My six year old has seen it three times and keeps begging to go back again. It has been a wonderful fun ride each time. Apologies to all of the book fans who feel ""cheated"" and that certain key elements were left out. If you want an exact replay of the book, then I suggest reading the book again. Good luck, however keeping your children attentive for seven hundred pages. On the other hand, if you want great cinematography, engaging characters, stunning visuals, and good clean family entertainment packed into a three hour family outing, then go see this movie. Thanks for reading!"

","Being a bit of a potter fan i was kind of waiting for this with baited breath. One reason for this being the tri wizard cup, wanting to see it transfered from page to screen is a must see. Another reason being that the third, the prisoner of azkerban was my favourite book in the series but a bit of a disappointment as a film. This film does not. It excites everyone, from child to adult. If I had any negative comments it would be that the film does miss a lot out of the book but what do you expect seeing the book has about 700 pages. Also rupert grint is still up to his over the top face poses, but hey never mind. Mike newell does an excellent job at directing this, dark chapter in the series. And when i mean dark, i mean dark, this is far to scary a film for youngsters and even has a certain sexual chemistry building between its characters as their obviously going through puberty. The effects are brilliant and the acting is great, but even though Gambon is flawless in is version of dumbledore, I can't help but miss Richard Harris.This is the best of the film series so far and I feel that it will be better than the next as nothing much happens in the order of the phoenix until the last chapter. Bring on the rest though, as potter is most likely the greatest magical adventure series of our lifetime"
"randal-calrissian","6","0","1","27 November 2005"," Short and to the point. (the comment, not the movie)
","I'm not going to blather on like so many other reviews seem to, I'll try to keep this short.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire was a good movie that could have been great. Too many people forget that movies are not books. It's my opinion that Prizoner of Azkaban is the best Potter movie, simply because they stripped the book down to the essence of the story. When things needed to be changed to make the movie better, they did.<br/><br/>I'm all for boiling things down to their core, changing necessary bits around a little if it helps the adaptation be a better movie. Something Alfonso Cuarón did a superb job of when making HP III. However, in IV it seemed as if they went back to cramming in everything they could into the script, despite leaving out half of the book (including the character driving parts of the story). This cut and paste effect was reminiscent of movies I and II, but even more so, as book IV is longer than books I and II combined. <br/><br/>As for the one major thing they did change from book to movie, it not only didn't help, but in my opinion hurt the plot, pacing and, I feel, made things fizzle out by the end, though part of that is J.K. Rowling's fault in the chronology of the original story. That plus an unsatisfactory denouement force me to give it a six out of ten."
"GodfatherX","7","0","2","27 November 2005"," Demo of its own computer game?
","*** WARNING SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>I am not a reader of the Harry Potter books, yet, but I have become a great fan of the Harry Potter movies and I think that every movie was better then its predecessor. So naturally I was very much excited when I entered the movie theater to see ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"". Nobody would be allowed to tell me anything about it in advance, I wanted to be unbiased and surprised. And boy, what a surprise it was...<br/><br/>I sat through almost the whole movie wondering when it will start telling me a story. I was sitting there bored, watching a sequence of tasks of Harry Potter which are told in a very undramatic chain of events with almost no climax or heap in the suspension curve. <br/><br/>The movie is missing one crucial element of basic story telling - the plot itself. <br/><br/>In fact, the whole movie appeared to be a simple demo of a computer game rather than a real story told - a sequence of tasks to be performed in order to get to the final level. The 'plot' of the movie can be outlined in a few words like this: <br/><br/><ul><li>Introduction of the players you can choose from. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Explanation of the game rules.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Level 1: Fight the dragon. Retrieve the golden egg to proceed to level 2. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Level 2: Save your friend from an underwater trap. (If you play Harry Potter, you have to save 2 friends.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Level 3: Find your way through the maze to get the trophy. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Level 4 (Bonus Level): Utilize your own blood to revive Lord Voldemort and fight him. If you can't beat him, retreat while you can and try again in the next movie. (This level can only be reached if you play Harry Potter or Cedric)</li></ul><br/><br/>That's what happens if - at the time of making the movie - you have already in mind to make the movie into a computer game. Sometimes it backfires and the movie suffers from trying to kill two birds with one stone. The only benefit of the movie compared to the game is that real actors still look better than their CGI-created versions in the game. But of course with the creatures and the scenery it's very practical since they already have the computer models which can be used in the movie as well as in the computer game. <br/><br/>It seems that the only purpose of the movie is to boost the sales of its own computer game. Apparently that is the bigger business. But ultimately the movie suffers dramatically from this method. Unlike the game, the movie does not allow any interaction of the viewer, therefore it needs a far more dramatic plot to make the movie exciting and to be able to play with the viewers emotions. <br/><br/>If i.e. Olympic Games with a predetermined winner in all events would give you a great deal of excitement then ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is for you. But if you liked the first three Harry Potter movies because of their great story, then I recommend fast forwarding 2h 20min right to the 10 min graveyard scene. That will probably give you enough to carry you over to the next Harry Potter movie. <br/><br/>I would have rated it with 1/10 (awful) but Special Effects are still great and it's interesting to see the characters in their puberty - 3/10."

","I should preface my review by telling you I have read and own all of the books, and have seen all the other movies in the theaters, and purchased the DVDs for my collection.<br/><br/>I was so disappointed, I nearly walked out of the film. The fundamental personalities of some of the main characters were completely off. For example, they had Professor Dumbledore shouting repeatedly to quiet the students in main hall so he could speak. Complete characters who were absolutely pivotal to the plot in the book were not included in the screenplay, and others written in. <br/><br/>Then I found this comment here in the IMDb about the director's adaptation of the book, ""Mike Newell decided against the studio's original idea of adapting the 734 page book into two separate films to be released several months apart, figuring that he could cut enough of the book's bulky subplots to make a workable film.""<br/><br/>In cutting the ""bulky subplots"" he has cut much of the heart and soul of the book from the film. I am at a loss.. cannot understand why such a successful series of books and films has taken such a departure. <br/><br/>I wonder if the studio would consider going back, using their original choice of a director, Alfonso Cuarón, director of the Prisoner of Azkaban, and filming it properly, in 2 full length features?"

","This is a brilliant adaptation of the book. The feel is dark and gritty and not for the very young. It continues in the vein of the last film. Meaning that there is more darkness and shadows instead of the bright colors of the first two films. The only important part of the book left out is the whole dispute between the Ron's family and his brother Percy. This makes the film more Harry-centered which is okay, but disappointing for true book fans. Ralph Fiennes is incredibly scary and convincing as Lord Voldermort. I kept wondering how Voldermort could be done. His voice is both eerie in its gentleness making it sound soft and snake-like. And his make-up is perfect."

Really, I am no Harry Potter fan, let me point my case so you'll believe me in case you're not fans and want to know if you're gonna enjoy your spent money or just throw it away to the garbage. I know the story because now it turns out that all of my friends are fans of the little mage. I saw the first movie since, as a movies fan, i wanted to know what the whole buzz was all about. I became disappointed, i was awfully bored, that was the problem, well that and all the silly situations,i believed none of them, i didn't buy them,i could forgive anything but watching a boring film, seeing a kid finding an invisible cloak is neither new nor fun for me. Of course I didn't watch the sequels, don't mention the books, but as i tell you, i seem to be the one that's wrong, now i have a girlfriend that craves everything that has to do with HP. So here i am, at the movie theater, one hour earlier to the show, i am psychologically preparing myself to watch more of the same unbelievable child tale I saw a long time ago, and they say the movie is about 2 hrs and a half long, damn. After a few silly situations the movie starts getting to a point, more important, it is fun, hey all i wanted was that from the beginning, the characters become somehow real, as real as an adventure movie can be, and the rhythm is perfect, of course, i kept laughing at some others situations, specially at the end, but hey, the overall experience was fine with me, the FX, some really nice photography, real fun characters (the twins despite being total jerks are quite fun), and lots of action, i'm telling you, this is not the ultimate adventure-action-fantasy film of all the time, but even if you don't have a son, girlfriend or friends begging u to go with them because Harry Potter is oh so fantastically marvelous and all way cool, you can seriously watch this film with no regrets, is a solid, agile action paced movie with fine FX and nice music and cinematography, truly fun."

The movie did provide some comic relief, which was just about every time Harry had to do some sort of strenuous acting, and the looks on his face were quite jestful indeed.

","Rating this or any other Potter movie thus far an 8 out of 10 can be described only as irrational hysteria. Every one of these movies suffers from a confused and flippant narrative structure bordering on the incoherent. I realize there is a larger and more detailed back-story in the books, but the movies should work on their own, and I don't think they do. They comprise, at best, mediocre (if often visually spectacular) fantasy adventures for children, executed in a manipulative and commercial style. If you want good, all-ages fantasy, see The 10th Kingdom.<br/><br/>Specifically, I thought Harry Potter 4 was pretty much identical in quality (or lack thereof) to the previous three movies. I was left unmoved by all four movies, finding only Kenneth Branagh's ""Magical Me"" character in the second movie to be amused about. I have rated every Potter movie a 4 out of 10, which amounts to just below mediocrity. There is nothing in these movies I can take seriously, much less be enthused about, and with such boring stories, no amount of great special effects can make any real difference."

","I found ""The Goblet of Fire"" to be very uneven. From the start of the movie until two hours in, nothing really happens in the way of plot development or story. Suddenly the story turns very dark, too dark for children in my opinion. The drama unfolding in the last half hour also exposes the weakness of most of the actors in this movie. Most are obviously under skilled to carry the script.<br/><br/>I always try to find something positive in a movie. That said, Ralph Fiennes stands out in a wonderful but all too short appearance as Lord Voldemort. Emma Watson has obvious talent, perhaps ""Hermione Granger and the Magical Script"" would be a better idea for the next installment in this series."

","""Come on Potter, what are your strengths?"" <br/><br/>When Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, the eccentric new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, poses this question to young Harry, the young wizard's silence tells the viewer all he needs to know. ""Neither acting nor an ability to display depth or emotion,"" would have been the honest answer, but Harry's an uncommunicative type. He's scared and more than a little vulnerable. Fans spanning the universe love this about J.K. Rowling's hero.<br/><br/>Given the fact that despite reaching the ripe old age of 14, Harry Potter's onslaught of puberty fails to help him resemble anything other than Rachel Dratch's lesbian sister, it makes sense not to portray Harry as a tough guy who instinctively knows how to take care of business. However, my movie tastes are tailored in such a way that I find it hard to root for the little dork. Give me a hero carved in the Han Solo and Clint Eastwood mold.<br/><br/>It may have been easier to accept Potter as a non-traditional hero had he not removed his shirt. Sure, a gaggle of teenage girls in the audience ""ooh-ed,"" but the fact that Radcliffe's pasty white chest is sculpted with the musculature of a hummingbird only strengthened my opinion that he's not the type of ""hero"" I love to cheer.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong; I'm not claiming this is a bad movie. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to accomplish. The Harry Potter series just doesn't do it for me. My friends tell me that if I read the books and watch all the movies in context then I might appreciate everything more, but I don't really buy into that line of thinking. I have neither the time nor the inclination to start reading the books, so I'm more than happy to step aside and let the fans enjoy these movies to the fullest.<br/><br/>I will admit that there are moments that I enjoyed. ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (whose eye is indeed mad and funny to boot) and his irreverent brand of tough love causes a healthy chuckle when he transfigures a bratty student into a ferret. And the scene where Harry must fight a Hungarian Horntail dragon in an arena carved into the rocky Scottish landscape is a visual treat.<br/><br/>However, none of these was enough to keep me from rolling my eyes as we watch Harry and his friends stumble awkwardly into puberty. If you've been dying to watch the ever-annoying and always dumb-founded Ron and Hermione acknowledge a change in their feelings for each other, and if your idea of ""cute"" is watching Harry Potter dance badly then you will enjoy this much more than I did. Just try not to be creeped out when Hermione's date to the Yule Ball is the 30-year-old Viktor Krum. What in the world? <br/><br/>Another scene I enjoyed was Voldemort's return to human form. The screen oozes atmosphere, but alas, it ends way too soon. It has been 13 years since Voldemort killed Potter's parents and he's been working very hard to regain his power. Couldn't he have had a few more minutes of screen time? However, if he knew he'd return in the form of Michael Jackson then he probably would've opted out. Look at his nose. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>So what are Potter's strengths? He knows how to please his target audience. He won't win many new converts, but this 4th installment in the series will make an insane amount of money, it will send the majority of its fanbase home smiling, and J.K. Rowling will continue to wipe sweat from her brow with $100 bills (or whatever the British equivalent is) while not losing a single wink of sleep because of Johnny Betts and his little jokes."

"evestein","9","0","1","22 November 2005"," Dude, awesome!
","I saw the movie on Saturday night with some trepidation. I was concerned that this being my favorite book in the series that I was going to be disappointed as I was with POA. I felt that in POA even thought the acting did improve from the previous two installments, that the acting was still a little stiff, scenes were added that were either not needed (bird flying into the tree three times) or laughable (crying scene in Hogsmede), the special effects were horrible (with the exception of Buckbeak), and the core story was just ignored. That said, I thought that I was going to be very harsh on GOF for the same reasons. I am happy to report that I had none of those same complaints with this new installment.<br/><br/>The core story is told very well without all the side plots that work in a book (even if they make the book drag a bit) but just do not work in a movie. I am actually glad that Winky, Dobby, the World Cup game, SPEW etc were all cut. They are all somewhat annoying in the book and I was glad that they were gone. The film makers took what both the previous directors did well (Columbus telling the story of the book and Curon upping the artistic value of the films) and fused them together.<br/><br/>I have only a few problems with the movie which I am going to mention first so that I can get them out of the way. First I was not that impressed with the score. The music was good but unlike the music say in Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, it did not make the movie better. I think that is due to the absence of John Williams (the best movie composer of all time). The second is the absence of Sirius. The problem I have is not that he is important to this particular story (which he is not) but that the bond between him and Harry I think should have been more developed given what is to come in OOTP. Third, I found the very end of the movie to be a little too upbeat but more on that later.<br/><br/>Now on to the parts that I liked in the film: this is by far the best of the series (the book and the film). The special effects were better than all three previous movies combined. In POA I was laughing at the Demetors (which looked cheesy) and the werewolf (which looked fake) because as they were both meant to be scary, they were the farthest thing from scary. And don't get me started on Fluffy. This time around I was for the first time in the movie series scared. I especially liked the dragon sequence around Hogwarts, even though is deviates from the book. It deviates from the book to make the sequence more visually appealing and it worked. I am not one of those people who wanted to see the other champions fight their dragon. This movie is called Harry Potter and the GOF, not Cedric Diggory and the GOF.<br/><br/>Even though the special effects were amazing, it did not distract from the characters as it did during the first two films. I was not a big fan of the Yule Ball in the book but I found myself laughing out loud in the theater during this part in the film, which I have done while watching any of the other HP films. I especially enjoyed the scene in the study hall where Snape is smacking Harry and Ron over the head with the book. I thought this scene blended slapstick comedy and British comedy to make a really funny scene.<br/><br/>Now on to the main event, He Who Must not be Named, oh what the hell, Voldemort. I was a bit worried that the movie makers would tone down this scene for a down graded rating. I am so happy that they did not do that. The scene is just how I pictured and Voldemort is sufficiently freaky (however, Darth Vader takes the cake as the scarier villain, sorry). The only complaint I have with this scene is that Wormtail seems kind of calm for someone who just cut off his hand. You would think that after cutting his hand off, he would be in pain. I am only guessing because I have never cut my hand off and would have no idea what it would feel like (this is sarcasm by the way). But I digress.<br/><br/>I went into the movie with some concern with the acting given the last three films. I was pleasantly surprised that the acting was greatly improved, especially with the trio. Even thought Rupert Grint stole the show in a lot of the scenes he was in, the actor that improved the most was Daniel Radcliffe. Granted, none of these kids are Haley Joel Osment but there are a number of touching scenes, namely Harry's parents ghostly visions to Harry in the graveyard and the returning of Cedric's body to Hogwarts. This is the first time that you really feel for Harry in the movie series and I am happy to say that this time around I was not laughing during the crying scenes.<br/><br/>The acting from the adult actors was, as always, a treat. From Alan Rickman to Maggie Smith to Brendan Gleeson and especially Ralph Fiennes, I thought they were all fabulous. I even like Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.<br/><br/>On a whole I liked the very end of the movie except for the fact that it was a little too upbeat. Unlike the previous two installments this movie had a beginning, middle, and an end and has the best structure of all four movies. By far my favorite. Finally the spirit of Harry Potter was captured on screen. I just hope they keep it up for OOTP."

","I loved this movie because it was able to be humorous while still being true to the story. I loved having more of the Weasley twins as they are favorite characters of mine. The kids are growing up and so is the humor. I would recommend this for teenagers (around the same age as the characters). But, I think it would be a little too much for younger kids and I can only imagine future films will also contain PG-13 or stricter ratings.<br/><br/>Although I love Hagrid, Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape, I was glad to see them play smaller roles in the movie. This year didn't seem to have Snape's character targeting Harry and Ron as much as he did in the past. I can't wait for the next movie or book.<br/><br/>In rank order, this one is the best of the first four. Second place would have to go to the original - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then Prisoner of Azkaban, followed by Chamber of Secrets (even though Chamber is a great film, also)."

","I read a lot of the comments on here and I, for one, cannot believe that some people hated this movie. Nevertheless, I respect your opinion. I just don't understand why. Sure, they cut out a lot. But honestly, the film still had substance and an excellent plot without the Dursleys or Molly Weasley or Winky. That was just excessive detail. Maybe it would have been nice to have it, but then you'd have been complaining that the movie dragged on and on. And I know some people think it would have been better as two movies, but if you think about it, would you have really wanted the movie to stop halfway through and then wait months to see the next half? Highly doubt it. I know I wouldn't have. People said, ""If you're a true Harry Potter fan, don't waste your money on this movie."" Well, I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan and I feel that it was worth it because I'd definitely see this movie again. I even shed a few tears to be honest. I'm just not that picky about details in the adaptation because I know there's only so much that the cast and crew can do. I thought it was amazing. Here are some reasons why: - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson's acting have improved greatly. They were superb. - The effects and graphics were fantastic. - There was actually a plot. Those are just basic reasons. Personal reasons include: - I was seriously wowed. - My eyes were practically glued to the screen. - I liked that they still added some humour (like the bathtub scene with Harry and Moaning Myrtle; that was gold) - It made me cry. - I'd see it again for sure! This week, even! Improvements that could've been made (not many): - The beginning didn't have to be so incredibly rushed, but I guess it wasn't as exhilarating as the part we were all looking forward to--the TriWizard Tournament. - I will agree with you GoF movie-haters that Dumbledore wasn't himself. I agree that Richard Harris was much more suited (honestly, he was awesome *moment of silence*). But what can we do about it now? At least Harry, Ron, and Hermione all did excellent performances. EEEEK, I can't wait for the 5th movie. If this one was so amazing, imagine how awesome the next one will be!<br/><br/>In a nutshell: A MUST-SEE!!! You may or may not like it; I don't know. But if you are a Harry Potter fan, check it out!!!"
"mcnasty9","10","0","1","22 November 2005"," Harry Potter 4 was awesome
","Since the first book came out way back when I have been in love with the Harry Potter series, and when the movies started coming out I loved them even more! The first and second movies were very good for the time, the actors were all so young and cute and it fit for the movies. Then came third movie, and that too was amazing, although I was disappointed on the lack of following the book, but the fourth movie was outstanding. The visual effects, the accuracy, the acting, everything was amazing. Each of the actors, Daniel, Rupert, and Emma have grown into themselves, and found how to incorporate their personalities to each of the characters. Even the newest actors, all seem to gel very well with the veterans. The chemistry was amazing in the movie. You can tell how everyone got along, and it shone through on screen. By far the fourth movie was the best and I highly recommend seeing it."
"breezybrisbane","8","0","1","22 November 2005"," A real good movie with a few flaws
","This was a really good movie. It had lots of action, humor without being to crude and some really good spots to cry like a little girl. It's all well and good to say that the filmmakers had to cut out a lot to shorten it, but the film suffered in many ways. The opening scenes whirl by in minutes and Ron and Hermoine are left out in the cold a little bit. This was a movie I recommend seeing but here are a few potential ruins for loyal Potter fans. 1. Ron and Hermione are secondary characters.<br/><br/>While you would never expect them to be bigger than Harry it seems that this film really does forsake them. The few scenes they had were very short. 2. Dumbledore<br/><br/>With no disrespect to the actor, Dumbledore is far too jittery and uptight in both this film and the last. This is not how Dumbledore is supposed to act. 3. For People who have not read the book<br/><br/>People who didn't read it may find some confusion, especially in the lightning fast opening scenes. ""Why are they doing that again?""<br/><br/>On the other hand, here are some things I really enjoyed 1. The Photography and Effects<br/><br/>Nothing short of amazing and stunningly beautiful! 2. The Action<br/><br/>Just like the book, there is never a dull moment! Again the effects for these scenes are marvalous. 3. The lack of violence and sexual humor<br/><br/>Aside from maybe one scene, there is very little crude joking in this movie. The necessarily violent scenes are very easy to stomach. Those of you that puked at ""Saving Private Ryan"" may even find this easier on the belly! 4. The crying scenes!<br/><br/>I love crying at movies and I certainly did here. The obvious scenes with Cedric Diggory, combined with scenes with Neville, who I think we all love, were enough to have me sobbing at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I definitely think you should see this. Some people who tell you it is bad are maybe a little too negative."
"cman85","Null","0","2","22 November 2005"," ratings for this film
","I actually haven't seen this film (went two times both sold out), but I think its funny just how many people gave this film a 1. Obviously 99% of the 400+ people that gave a 1 were dire-hard book fans upset that they didn't have a scene they thought was ""crucial to the film"".<br/><br/>Anyways my point is the expectations for this movie are insane. Unless you want a tedious movie that runs 4 hours and 30 minutes with a 1 hour ending sequence like LOTR3 then you must expect it to be missing certain parts. I won't comment on the movie but I will say that the way the majority of the public perceived it along with the best critics ( 87% tomato reading, by far the highest) there is no way anyone could justify a rating less than 5. Just my two cents."

","i'm glad that goblet of fire finally got the PG-13 rating that is deserve since the film is darker than the last three films, but what i didn't like is that Sirius black only got one scene in the film since Gary Oldman plays the part well. the film should have been three hours long but i wanted to see an extended version of the Qudditch world cup scene, but Daniel Radcliffe is excellent as harry and should continue the last three films ,same thing goes for Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. i hope that the 5th movie is just as good, keep up the good work. i hope that the dursleys return in the fifth movie since they play more of an important role in the storyline. the dursleys didn't really need to be in the film, but seeing molly wesley would have been nice, and i like that mcgongall, Fred, George, Neville,Seamus, and dean were given more on screen time since their characters were underused and given a chance to shine."

","I just shelled out my eight dollars or so to see this film. A friend wanted to see it and now I know why she wanted me to pay. I wish someone had payed me instead. I found this film simply boring. So much so that I almost fell asleep. It is too long and uses the Hollywood standard of using special effects to cover the fact that there is no story. It is about teenagers who do not look like teens and magic. I guess I can see why kids or kid-like adults would like this film. Sorry to be negative, but there just is not anything there. For Harry Potter fans this film may hit the mark; otherwise find something else. Even an old Hammer film is better."

","First, I never read any of the books and I was not happy with the other 3 movies. I agree this was the best of the 4. But as it was with the other movies, I went because everyone claimed this is such a good story and each movie following was supposed to be darker and better. I know I am going to be in the minority but I am not impressed with the movie. It was indeed darker but not much else was different.<br/><br/>The movie had some charming characters; had some charming moments; had plenty of good CGI; had some beautiful scenery; and I felt I had been had again.<br/><br/>I am not sure what it is, but I do not get the thrill out of Harry Potter that so many others do. I tried to figure it out and all I can come up with is it seems to be contrived. It is entirely possible the dialogue never seemed real. Matter of fact, the CGI seemed more realistic than the dialogue. With that said, the CGI may also be part of the problem for me. It is not that I do not like CGI. I love so many movies in which CGI is used, but none of them use it so much. On the other hand, I loved every Lord of the Rings movie and that makes it harder to explain my feelings. So I guess I have to say that the combination of things must just rub me the wrong way.<br/><br/>I give it a 7(I gave LOTR a 10) because the story was good, the special effects were good, the effort was good, and the fans are good. Soooo, the movie was good but I wish it could have been better."

","I am of a demographic age that many wonder why I would love this series so to that, I just enjoy when Holloywood makes things come to life that you just can't see everyday and this one fits the bill. Before I gush on about this installment pros and cons, the thing I want to put out there in a series of consistent characters is Dubeldore. Please cast a new one for the last of the Movies? Why- Know one did a better job than the 1st two in the series, the untimely death vexed this series but this new guy just does not cut it. The first Dumbeldore in the book and on screen acted as if he was a Master Chess player knowing the moves of the players before they knew it themselves and his affinity for Harry and warmth was a genuine Father/Son, this new guy seems like an idiot compared to the first, the characters themselves seem not even to revere him and his detachment to Harry is evident. In the book he does detach a bit as events unfold but always has great concern for his young pupil. I have not felt that warmth in 3 or 4. His leadership lacks, no sense of strength from the Headmaster and most gifted wizard should have which is sorely missed out of this Dumbledore. Cast anew, Pleeease! Now the Movie: I loved the original, enjoyed the second and was a tad disappointed in Azkaban, but I was refreshed a bit in the 4th installment, I reviewed and heard many talk at the theater that it was not Askaban but I liked this one and thought it was a bit better. Humor, some darkness and a overall reflection of the tone of the book and series were represented. Many complained about the length, I thought the story moved well and did not feel as I watched like ""when is this going to end"" the tempo seemed fair enough between action and character development. It has been a while since I read Goblet but it seemed to have its spirit. While many thought the acting of Ray Fienes brought credibility, I was somewhat disappointed, he did well but not shocking well! It will be good to see how he evolves the character in the later installments. Many complained about 24 year olds dating 14 in the movie, they forget Harry, Ron and Harmonee are about 14 years old while the later class-men are about 17, last I checked a Junior could date a freshman for a dance and not get to much grief about it. Here is to the next in it series, I hope it is summer 2006, if not, I am sure this DVD will tie me over, it is worth the price of admission, those that complain just don't get that movies are to be enjoyed on the whole and not to be cut like a surgeon's knife. I think too many just like to complain, I for one like to go to get away and enjoy movies! Pass the popcorn and enjoy the show!"

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire movie was fabulous. The CG was wonderful. I was wondering if they would be able to pull off the graveyard scene and talking through the floo network, but they did it wonderfully.<br/><br/>Also, I thought that Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) looked beautiful for the Yule Ball.<br/><br/>I also liked how the humor grew with the age of the characters. It was a bit more adult. I laughed my head off when Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was turned into a ferret and ended up in one of his friend's pants. That was hi-larious.<br/><br/>I really believe this is a great movie and recommend it to definite Harry Potter fans and even those who aren't fans of the movies or books. However, it is definitely holding to the PG-13 rating. I don't recommend this movie for children under that age without a parent or guardian.<br/><br/>I am definitely a bigger fan of the cast (which now includes Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, David Tennant as Barty Crouch Jr., Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum, and Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory. Grr, baby, very grr).<br/><br/>I give it a multiple thumbs up and say it's the best Harry Potter movie yet."
"Mtnbikedyk_1","10","0","1","19 November 2005"," GOF is undoubtedly the best of the series to date
","""I love magic,"" says Harry at the Quidditch World Cup in the new film, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, and this superbly-crafted, thrilling and immensely satisfying film reminds us all how much we love magic, too. Easily the best movie in the series to date, GOBLET gives us a sweet and poignant coming-of-age story wrapped in a roller-coaster, big-budget, no-holds-barred FX spectacular.<br/><br/>With a fantastic and very human story by JK Rowling as the source material, our attention is drawn naturally to the acting presenting that story. Steve Kloves' adaptation of Rowling's funny and touching dialog and plot are spot on, giving the young cast and veteran actors alike some very tasty stuff to work with. Among the youngsters, the standouts are of course Dan Radclifffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as Harry, Hermione and Ron respectively. They constitute the central core of the story and the actors' performances in this film are nothing short of remarkable. Special mention must be made of Rupert as he has at last shown us the real Ron Weasley that has been struggling to get out over the first three films. Emma is lovely, and yet shows enough bossiness that we know it's really Hermione. Dan Radcliffe has a very difficult role: reluctant hero, crush-ridden teen, friend and go-between. Nowhere does he falter, and his scene upon returning to the maze after Voldemort's rebirth is heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>Supporting these fine young actors are some of the finest actors in the UK, and the film finally gives some of them an opportunity to shine. Especially affecting are Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and new-comers to HP Brendan Gleeson as ""Mad-Eye"" Moody and Miranda Richardson in a scene-stealing role as gossip-mongering yellow-journalist Rita Skeeter. If Gleeson misses a nod for a best supporting actor Oscar, then there is no justice or heart in Hollywood! Ralph Fiennes brings his special brand of menace to the role of Lord Voldemort in a turn that will leave nightmares in its wake.<br/><br/>Among the rest of the large cast there are many nice moments, and delightful (and terrifying) surprises. Oliver and James Phelps as George and Fred Weasley are at last the merry mischief-makers we've missed heretofore, Robert Pattison as Cedric Diggory is your perfect Triwizard Champion, and Shirley Henderson brings a welcome return of a surprisingly naughty ghost, Moaning Myrtle. A surprise here is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, whose importance to the rest of the series is critical, but sorely minimized in the earlier films. Matthew is both vulnerable and winning, and his performance is outstanding.<br/><br/>Behind the story of the maturing of Harry and his friends, and the return of ultimate evil are the backdrops of the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament. Both settings give the effects designers an opportunity to shine, and they've never shown brighter! At the QWC Harry makes his ""I love magic"" remark upon entering a magic campground full of wizards, witches, and magical athletes. It seems so darn REALhow could we not love magic like this? This is also the audiences' first meeting with the Dark Lord's Deatheaters, which has an ominous effect of setting the malevolent tone for things to come.<br/><br/>The Triwizard Tournament consists of three magical tasks, each of which is completely convincingly realized by the designers and FX crew. No one could doubt the reality of the existence of dragons somewhere after watching Harry battle his own, the Hungarian Horntail. In the final credits it is noted ""no dragons were harmed in the making of this film"", a final bow to the true movie magic created here. The underwater task is also deftly executed, although everything appears a bit surrealjust like really being underwater! Krum's untransfiguration from shark to man, the mer-people, and the creepy octopus/rottweiler grindylows are all particularly noteworthy. The third task is a massive hedge-maze, in which ""people change."" As this is the set-up for the final scene, I will discuss it further below.<br/><br/>In the course of the tourney there is a ""traditional Yule Ball""and thus a perfect opportunity for the costumers as well as the designers to show their hand. Everyone is beautiful hereboy and girl, giant and midget, good and bad alike. Even poor Ron, stuck with ancient and very out-of-fashion dress robes looks perfectperfectly dreadful that is, as he should. This naturally becomes the ideal setting for the coming-of-age conflicts which through the film serve as hilarious reminders of what the kids are going through and serve to keep the audience off-guard for the impending confrontation looming ahead.<br/><br/>Since the maze in the third task serves to unnerve and even bewitch the contestants, so too is the audienceare the hedges alive? Are they evil? For evil surely awaits in the graveyard beyond and this scene in particular is most like its literary counterpart. The rebirth of Lord Voldemort and the subsequent events are terrifying and Harry's escape back to Hogwarts remains the emotional crux of the story. Hermione says to Harry and Ron at the end ""it's all going to change now, isn't it?"" This is the movie that will change the series forever from light-hearted, oh-wow magic, to the realization that there is evil everywhere, and the best anyone can do is be prepared, and stand by each other in the face of adversity."

"sharilast","7","0","2","20 November 2005"," The Best Yet
","OK OK, I know saying 'the best yet' isn't really saying much, but Harry Potter 4 has finally arrived and it was seriously enjoyable.<br/><br/>Not only is The Goblet of Fire the first 12a Potter film, (exciting if you're 5, I suppose,) it actually scared me - an avid horror fan! (well, a bit...)<br/><br/>TGoF starts off with the Weasleys, Harry and Hermoine trudging off to the Quidditch World Cup at daybreak. After a swirling, dizzying portkey journey, the Quidditch stadium is positively spectacular. Unimaginably high, it fulfils all of Rowling's descriptions, and then some! The movie even manages to condense Rowling's exciting, but nonetheless not-quite-as-cool-as-Hogwarts, World Cup section of the fourth book into a couple of minutes of screen time. Thumbs up! What is particularly frightening though, is the Death-Eaters march through the fleeing wizards after the Cup Final. Pointed hats, reminiscent of Ku-Klux Clan attire, pierce the dreamlike wonderworld that used to be Potter movies, and brings TGoF into a new, much scarier sphere. There is something actually chilling about the scenes of destruction that follow the glory and frivolity of the World Cup celebrations.<br/><br/>Back at Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermoine become real teenagers (moody, jealous, flirty) although, regrettably, not real actors (still sadly a bit too much gasping and a bit too little acting). Harry mysteriously gets entered into the Triwizard Tournament and the games begin with expected, but still very much appreciated, aplomb.<br/><br/>The three other contestants; Cedric, Fleur and Viktor are perfect literalisations of their novel counterparts. Cedric is dashing, ethical and popular, Fleur is beautiful, blond and French and Viktor is rugged, forceful and intimidating. Special effects complete the package as they allow dragon-chasing, mermaid-bashing and maze-running to rival Hampton Court to exist on the Potter screen.<br/><br/>And what we're all waiting for - Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes looking extremely worse-for-wear, does his usual superb spot of acting. He radiates evil and is pretty terrifying (especially for the little 5 year old who sat next to me in the cinema), although I think he could've done with a hood to be honest.<br/><br/>Stellar casting has made Harry Potter movies receive a great deal of merit where perhaps they have deserved a great deal less. TGoF utilises Skinner, from Only Fools and Horses as Barty Crouch, as well as the usual ensemble of Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman (not in it for much though), Timothy Spall and of course Alan Rickman, who is quite amusing in this movie.<br/><br/>Mike Newell, the director, obviously had to skim down on some of the books' finer details, and of course, the movies will never be as richly detailed as the books themselves, but Newell has added in a couple of factors that have been neglected in the Potter cinematic saga until now: 1) A real darkness. Not just some kiddy scare-tactics. TGoF is actually scary, eerie, tense and exciting. Not just a watered down version of all of the above. 2) Fred and George. Finally a director has remembered the hapless twins! Their comic potential has not been fully exploited yet, but at least they are slightly amusing in this movie, where in the previous films, they've been a couple of long-haired, overly-celebrated extras.<br/><br/>Well done, finally a Potter film that's worth its salt. The lengthy run-time flew past as swiftly as a scarred bespectacled kid on a broom, narrowly escaping a particularly ferocious Hungarian Horntail."

","Now, although I may not have rated this film very high, believe me, I am a BIG Harry Potter fan and did truly enjoy the movie. My only problem was that if I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't have known what was going on.<br/><br/>I liked how they got rid of the Dursleys, and when they showed the Portkey to the Quidditch World Cup. But when they completely skipped over the Quidditch match, I knew that this would be disappointing. One of the most exhilarating and loved things about these movies are Quidditch, and here they go, getting rid of every last shred of it, not to mention making the movie chopping and hard to follow.<br/><br/>And then when Harry gets to Hogwarts, you can see that Professor Flitwick is much younger, with short, dark, brown hair (instead of long, white hair.) Hard to follow...uh, yeah! And then with the whole crowd-surfing at the yule ball...umm, no.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Yule ball, Hermione comes out screaming that Ron ruined everything, but it never says what he did! And later, when a character dies, Harry goes to tell Dumbeldore, but instead looks into a pensieve, and never tells Dumbeldore; this character is never mentioned again.<br/><br/>I also think that they butchered the maze scene; instead of spiders, sphinxes, and other scary creatures, we get man-eating vines. The ending was also a let-down, as Hermione says ""Everything is going to change now,"" the last lines of the movie, and again, no one knows what she is talking about! I must admit, though, that the acting was done very well, and I did like them getting rid of useless characters such as the Dursleys and Winkie. But besides that, this movie was a let down compared to the third one, which completely blew my mind.<br/><br/>If you are a Harry Potter fan and have read the books, I suggest you go see it, because it is still extraordinarily entertaining. But if you have not read the books, I suggest you read it first, for even I, a reader of the book, was confused at times."
"finding-something","7","0","1","20 November 2005"," Not bad at all
","I give the movie seven stars. It did what it was supposed to do, and it did it well. The third movie was spectacular AS A MOVIE, but this was simply a well done adaptation.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, I thought, ""Oh my goodness. This is not John Williams."" This was unfortunate as the score lacked the cohesion with which the first three films were blessed.<br/><br/>Moving on. The acting is fine, but I felt at times both the script and the direction were a little off. Some dialogue just didn't fit together like it should. Hermione would say something, and I'd just feel awkward about it. To be fair though, all three of the teenage trio had some absolutely phenomenal moments.<br/><br/>The pace at the beginning was enough to make anyone dizzy. So much was happening and so quickly, I felt as though the film makers were being too careful to include EVERYTHING in the book and at the expense of the cinematic effect. I felt like I was watching a book and not a movie. What's more, the middle of the movie, the dance that is, actually began to drag! I can appreciate exploring adolescent awkwardness, but it felt as though the one stupid dance took up a third of the movie's running time.<br/><br/>As much as I can criticize the movie, the final climactic scene was near perfect. Ralph and Rupert stole the show. I was terrified and mesmerized. Still Harry was pried from Cedric's body the confused pace continued.<br/><br/>Enjoyable? Yes. As good as Azkaban? I wonder if even the seventh installment will be as good a MOVIE as the third was."
"sc_nightcrawler","8","0","1","20 November 2005"," The Best Harry Potter So Far
","I give it 10 not because it's one of the greatest movies of all time but more cause it's the best out of four. I really didn't imagine before that this fourth movie will be this dark. The maze and the graveyard scenes are amazing. It's dark, thrilled, and stunning. It's not the same as I imagined but it's way better. I love it. It's true that it doesn't show the wondrous wizard world. It's more to the main story, the Triwizard Tournament. But it doesn't disappoint me cause I'm afraid it will be boring instead. But maybe if Mike Newell could just show the Quidditch Cup a little more and Harry-Sirius interactions (which is very important cause we all know what will happen on the fifth). It's two and a half hours. I don't mind if it's three. Lots said that Daniel Radcliffe has improved much, and I agree. It's very comfortable seeing his acting. Rupert Grint shows the same old Ron. Emma Watson is the problem. Both Dan and Rupert act in a comfort way, but Emma seems so tense. And that makes their acting looks imbalance and uncomforted, especially when they appear at the same scene. I think Emma gives too much energy. While the other casts, well.. I must say that no wonder Ralph Fiennes is one of my favorite actors. He's so great. He's a perfect Voldemort. Both his movement and voice stunned me, though he appears only a few minutes. Brian Gleeson is also great. But I'm a little disappoint 'bout Madame Maxime. I imagined she has the appearance sort of Hagrid. Cause I believe in the book it said she's big not tall. And Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.. I'm sorry but I still love Richard Harris. The cold war between Harry and Ron is shown different than the book. Rather than showing Ron's sad and jealousy, it's more to comedy (in a good way). To me, Harry and Ron look like a couple who had a fight. It's very hilarious. The other exciting thing is Fred and George. They didn't appear much on the last three movies. But here, they did a big contribution making audiences laugh. Despite my great enjoyment of this film, I have one question. How did Barty Crouch Junior escaped from Azkaban? Is it dementor who help him? The film doesn't explain it, probably they forgot. Well anyway, I still love it and I hope the fifth movie can fill the missing holes."
"brenleyman","7","0","1","20 November 2005"," Not saying it's bad, but a whole lot of plot holes!
","I just seen this movie at a matinée performance, and I did like it, but a fair warning, there is a great deal of plot holes. The beginning starts with the dream from the beginning of the book, then, whoosh!, right to leaving for the world cup, at the world cup, WHOOSH, the death eaters tearing apart the camp, Whoosh again, to hogwarts and the tournament. After all that, it smooths out. It has great character build, but it could've been better. Great animatronics, and great CG animation. Acting could've been better, and some scenes were wishy washy, but it did rather well for the movie it was. Quite comical when the Mad eye Moody turned Draco into a ferret. Yule Ball was good, and the great hall kinda looked like that ice hotel from Die Another Day. 7/10."

","stars: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Warson, Rupert Grint, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Warwick Davis, Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman and many others.<br/><br/>The best Potter film by far. In this movie, Harry is put in a Tri-Wizard challenge, even though he is underaged, that he didn't put himself in. The challenges are to fight a dragon and take it's egg. Then to free a friend trapped in the bottom of the lake. Finally, to escape a maze, which ends in a death in the film (WHich probably got the film it's PG-13 rating). There's the extremely amusing sub-plot of a dance, which was fun to watch how shy Ron and Harry are...and how busy Hagrid's hands are. It was filled with many great British actors and actresses, including Alan Rickman in a relatively small role, Ralph Fiennes, looking extremely scary as Lord (He Who Shall Not Be Named) and a 4 minute cameo by Gary Oldman. I recommend this film a lot, and this is without a doubt the most entertaining film.<br/><br/>My rating-A. Running length:( Not counting credits) 144 mins. rated PG-13 for some strong violence."
"chrisfaithalin","8","0","1","20 November 2005"," Not the best!
","I now this is going against the grain but this is definitely not the best movie in the series. Prisoner of Azkaban had this one beat in many ways.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie was fantastic from a reader of the books. However, I think the movie was very choppy and even got a little confusing to me who has been reading these books for 7 years. I can only imagine what it would be like for someone coming in on these movies without reading the books.<br/><br/>The movie would jump randomly and not explain events. For instance the Quidditch World Cup was never really explained what it was, and then they made this big climax to the beginning of the game and then it just jumped to the end. I know that they had to cut things out, but it doesn't change the fact that the movie did not flow.<br/><br/>Acting did improve greatly with this movie, although Emma Watson's acting was all over the place and I could not get her character straight.<br/><br/>Fred and George were amazing and even if this movie bombed it would be worth seeing it hundreds of times just for them. Their timing was amazing and the writing for them was awesome.<br/><br/>And I give the people credit for the ending sequences.<br/><br/>The whole movie was the most emotional experience, where I was laughing so hard I had tears going down my eyes, or I was literally crying in the theatre. I think some acting could have been better along with the movie could have flowed better."
"PatrickQRS","10","0","1","20 November 2005"," My two cents on the movie. Defanently the best one yet. Spoilers!!!
","I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, there one of my favorite series. I cant say the same however for the movies, the first three i thought were...OK...but there was never the magic so to say that i saw in the books. I always wanted a little bit more from the movies. This movie however i feel broke that trend for me. When i first thought about them making this book into a movie my first thought was how the hell are they gonna pull that off. I honestly think that they did. There approach to this movie was to cut out a lot, and focus on the huge parts, i love the small parts of the books but i realized that they couldn't make that into a movie without it being 97 hours long, not that i would complain to sit threw a 97 hour long movie. They even managed to cut characters roles by combining their role in the book with other characters in the book. I.E. Doby + Nevil. Although i wish that the small stuff could have been put in, i think that the result without was great. I think that it would have been acceptable to add 20 minutes to the movie to make each task just that much longer, but i know that the typical movie audience wouldn't want that. I think these kids are really starting to get good at this whole acting thing. Nevel for example, man was i impressed by that kids acting, he had few lines in the movie, but man did he get to me.<br/><br/>I have never heard of the director, and I'm going to do some research on him because i absolutely think his techniques were incredible. Most directors forget all the simple stuff, the stuff that cant be done by computers and that no one notices but really make a difference. The really elementary ideas of cinematic effects. I believe this director mastered it, i noticed a ton of things that were so simple they were beautiful. for example the use of water, i.e. tears on the window when it was raining, or the water running past the gargoyles mouth when it was raining. This director had such a different approach to the movie, some parts i thought was almost UN-desired, but most of it i loved. i love it when a director goes to the bottom of the bag and uses all the tricks he can think of. thats one of the ingredients to make a good director.<br/><br/>there were only a handful of complaints that i can make about this movie. There are two parts that i think are essential to the books point that weren't in the movie, the Triwizard tournament, i mean the actual game. Also the hospital scene when you find out about Nevil's parents. and see the stupefied old dark arts teacher, not to mention Mr. Wesley and his ""muggle cures."" Also i think some of the acting in the beginning was a little over acted, i.e. Mad-eye moody. I also thought that for the first 1/3 of the movie the score of music didn't really line up like it should have, this is sad because i always loved the harry potter scores. Finally i believe the ending should have been like in the book. The book had one of the most intense endings ever. the movie did not, it just kinda ended in the happy note. The book ended with the...oh crap, were in trouble, chaos is happening...feeling, when Dubledore sent Hagred out with his new love to ""do what he has to"" (we find out in the 5th book that he is trying to get the giants on the good side) and Dumbledore sends Snape to spy on Voldemort. then the book ended. It was one of the most ""holy crap"" ""what happens next"" end of the book i have ever read. The movie didn't do that to me, i feel that it would have helped the movie a lot more if it did happen this way. Also it would have lead into the 5th movie very well.<br/><br/>I love also that they allowed this to be PG-13, it lead room for more to happen, and i hope that if necessary (from reading the books it is necessary) to increase this more in the future, it leaves them with more breathing room to make things the way they should be, not to mention it kinda follows the fans as they get older. I think that this was one of the best moves in the production of this movie.<br/><br/>I really hope that this director stays on board, he did this movie better than Christopher Colombus (director of the first two) and i thought he did damn well. This director blew me away. He pulled off the impossible, and hopefully he stays with Harry long enough to pull off the yet even more impossible.<br/><br/>This movie was hilarious, dramatic, suspenseful, and damn right jaw drooping its a 5 star movie if i ever saw one.<br/><br/>I recommend reading the book before you see it, i think if you read the book, and realize that it is OK that they left so much out then you will love it. If you don't read the book it will still be good, but you wont get the same effect because there is a lot of stuff that is in there but isn't described like it should have been."
"teelbee","7","0","1","20 November 2005"," Stripped to the bone! And, Casting... hello? hello?
","Firstly, I don't think it's a horrible movie. It's just that I've come to expect so much more from the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>I read that the movie makers considered making it into 2 movies, as the book is so long. Instead, they stripped it to the bone and made it into one long movie. They tried to cram too much into the 2.5 hour movie so there was not enough exposition or build-up to support the story. I couldn't see how this movie would make sense to people who had not read the book. I asked my companion (not a fiction reader) if he ""got it""; and he admitted he was pretty clueless during much of the movie. It should have been so much better with more detailed story elements. <br/><br/>I was surprised they completely cut the characters Ludo Bagman and Winky, even though they had pretty significant roles in the book. I was looking forward to seeing them portrayed. If doing the story justice meant 2 movies, clearly that's what they should have done.<br/><br/>Casting in the first 2 movies was so spot-on! I could quibble, but really all the actors accurately reflected the characters in the books (the quibble, Hermione was a too pretty). Casting of ~new~ characters is the 3rd and 4th movies, on the other hand, ranges from ""not deft"" to ""completely daft"". The new Dumbledore doesn't do the character justice - he's too tense and and lacks authority. He doesn't have the air of calm self-possession that's so essential to the role. I find it jarring that the new Dumbledore lacks the confidence and wise-yet-humble presence of the novel's character. Similarly, I thought the depiction of Sirius Black was off balance in movie 3 (vs the book)- anger replacing the pathos of the novel's Sirius. But, I digress as he was not a part of this movie. I'm not comfortable with the movie version of Maxine. The Beauxbaton's head mistress was portrayed as a simpering romantic. In the book she is a woman with great strength of character with a bit of a chip on her shoulder when it comes to a romantic attachment with Hagrid. The worst character deviation was Mad-Eye Moody, who was shown as a clumsy oaf - a clown - on screen. In the book, he's talented and flinty, and his eccentricities were fully explained.<br/><br/>Speaking of Beauxbatons! What was with that entrance into the Great Hall? ... trooping in like little bluebirds, breathy gesturing Ahhhhh.... ahhhh...."" as they flitted up the Grand Hall? They looked like something out of ~Madeline in London~! So weird. Another miscasting was the Fleur DeLacour character. The movie Fleur was shown as a regular sporty girl-next door type; whereas she is supposed to be part Veela, and thus more exotic, more beautiful, and slightly other worldly. Victor Krum was better cast as a steely Eastern European, but what happened to the slump-shouldered, toe-in footed grouch from the book? In the book, he was a bit of an anti-hero, on screen he was movie star beautiful.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie is dark and gloomy throughout The few attempts at a bit of comedy relief didn't do much to lighten things. For example, instead of being comical, Ron's angst at having to wear a frumpy set of dress robes related all to well the pain of self-consciousness suffered by teens. Actually, it was a quite a good bit of acting, but it didn't serve the purpose of providing a lighter episode as it did in the book.<br/><br/>It's just not ""magical"" like the prior movies. <br/><br/>Still, I think many people may like it better than the previous movies as it is more like a typical, action-oriented film. But, I don't go to Harry Potter movies to see ""typical""."

","The best movie I've ever seen! It had some parts missing, but it had excellent animation, and everything that had to be there was. As the kids get older and more attractive, they also get better at acting. It had the best effects I had possibly ever seen, and it was great. They were all SO lifelike! There are so many themes in this movie that it can be great for anyone. The PG13 rating was a tad obsessive, but I don't know, I suppose it could scare a few kids. The ever popular bath scene was one that might worry a few parents too, but hey, he didn't look too bad either. You don't see anything, just his chest, so don't worry. So go see this movie. Right now. It will rock your socks off to no end."

","I find that the movie was the best by far of the Harry Potter series. The special effects are great and the acting is awesome. It has sadness and horror and of course happiness and it keeps you wanting to keep watching. It is great. This movie has the teen drama. it shows you teenagers growing up. I love how the special effects look so real. Harry potter and the Goblet of Fire i feel is a great movie for everyone to see. i believe that it could have been a little more easier to understand for those who have not read the book. You have to listen closely an pay attention. but in all Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is great. I love the adventure and the action. This movie make you sit at the edge of your seat even if you know what will happen because you read the book. I want the director and producers to know that they made a great movie and Rowling made a great book. The guys in this movie are very cute and the Weasley twins are getting hotter every year as well as Ron. Harry has always been cute. Hermonie is so pretty. I feel that people grow up so fast. I can not wait to see the movie again I want to buy it when it come out on DVD. I love how the water scene looks so cool and how again the special effects are out of this world. The movie draws you in. I give my thanks to the actors in this movie and i hope that their life is successful"
"grg_info","9","0","1","20 November 2005"," Good Movie but should have been lengthier
","Hey guys!! As a Harry Potter fan I have no way to say that the movie is not good. It is an excellent movie. After all the story line behind it is very good. The only problem I found with the movie was the lack of time to take it in a well organized fashion. The duration of 2 hours and 30 mins. is not enough to include all the critical scenes which were originally written by J.K.Rowling. But I still think that the director did a very good job in keeping the audience interest alive through out the movie. The sequences of Triwizard tournament should have been a little more clear. When it comes to the Return of the King: LOTR series, the movie was well over 3 hrs.. The Warner Bros. should have done the same thing. By taking a little more time and trying to explain things in a better fashion could have been even better. The people who did not read the books but are interested in movies were a little confused at some points. The people who read the books very well like me...were disappointed a little when some important scenes were missing. But over all the movie was good. The teen element was shown in a good way. The ability to make the people laugh is appreciated."
"Facehugger2K8","8","0","1","20 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (censored).
","so last night, me, my bf and a couple of old friends from Murrow, Hunter and Cooper went together to see Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. From the time the Warner Bros. sign came up on the screen, people were already screaming, hooting and clapping, including me since we've waited for so f***ing long!!! Some people were even taking pictures of the screen when the ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" title came up on the screen. So what is with worth the wait? I must say, yes, it was definitely worth the wait. I'm not going to say F*** YEAH!!!!, because it could've been a better movie if they didn't omit some parts, and underplayed others.<br/><br/>A prime example would have to be the Quidditch World Cup, which was merely introduced fantastically, but the actual match was completely left out so that was disappointing. I mean, quidditch is always part of Harry Potter, the excitement, the thrill of those matches that J.K. Rowling brings us into was completely shattered in this movie. Another example would have to be Rita Skeeter. She was underplayed in this movie. We didn't see her enough and all the fans were looking forward to seeing her in a face-off with Hermione. Other parts that were omitted were Winky the House-Elf, Molly Weasley and his interactions with Harry after the graveyard episode, the Dursleys who weren't even mentioned in this movie and a few insignificant others that I'm not really bitching about.<br/><br/>At the same time, some scenes really get to your inner core and can truly bring out your sensitive side. When Harry and Cedric come back from the graveyard, I felt that that scene was truly powerful as many people will agree with me. The actor playing Amos Diggory was able to truly portray a father's sorrow to the loss of his son and seeing Diggory like that on the ground, lifeless, without that inviting smile is truly traumatizing.<br/><br/>The young actors have gotten better and are still improving with every movie. Daniel Radcliffe is showing acting skills by truly showing Potter's sorrow, his grief, his uneasiness growing up, the troubles he must face every day being Harry Potter. Rupert Grint was much better since he wasn't really acting in the previous movies, just being really stupid. In this movie, he was able to show us Ron's dark side towards Harry and his overprotective side towards Hermione. Now, Emma Watson is a problem, The girl is too melodramatic. She emphasizes on every line where sometimes, it was unnecessary and come on, do you really need that many hand gestures to make your point across? An addition though which I think would make for Watson's ""diva""-esque personality, would be none other than Matthew Lewis who flawlessly portrayed Neville Longbottom's character showing that he is not only the nerdy boy where nothing ever works out for him, but also his sensitive and knowledgeable side, without losing that adorable, geeky charm.<br/><br/>As for the Professors and the adult actors, they were as always flawless even the ones that had only a few scenes. Alan Rickman, who is my favorite actor, had a few lines in this movie, but still made us feel his presence on many instances throughout the movie. Professor McGonaggal, a.k.a. Maggie Smith played the heartfelt mother figure to Harry, capturing the essence of the character. Brendan Gleeson, was by far one of the best of this movie, truly portraying Mad-Eye Moody's strange character and enjoying it himself as you could tell from his acting. My problem is still with Michael Gambon. I love Richard Harris and I still believe he is the best Dumbledore out there and no one can ever top that. Gambom does a good job but he doesn't give off that grandfather figure, that protective, loving character.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars, because, again, it could've been better, but was still good. Now, can't wait, for ""The Order of the Phoenix"" and the next Harry Potter book, which is, sadly the last one (sniffs)."
"jazz-14","7","0","1","20 November 2005"," Dark, stylish, growing up
","That is the overall impression I had coming out of Goblet of Fire. The twists and traps were not as unexpected as I had hoped, but danged if the feel of the movie had not gotten edgier. Up to now I had felt the films were pleasant, but now I might actually like to go there and meet these people. They have grown from 1 dimensional kiddie stories, through 2-D matinÃ©e heroes and into (almost) 3-D people with inner lives and feelings and conflicts.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film is the pacing of the story. There is a backdrop plot that never really seems very important. Except it is life threatening! You would think people would care more. The movie is set up around the events in the competition, so the pacing is driven by it. But it isn't driven far. ""tomorrow you face the biggest challenge of your life. We can't help you. Get some sleep."" The other competitors are cardboard cutouts. Too bad, they would probably be interesting.<br/><br/>Against this is Harry and his friends trying to figure out what is trying to kill Harry, while they sort out their budding emotions. This part was great. As I said, I'd like to know these people and the world they live in. This is where the new people are really great. They have great introductions, diverse backgrounds. One is a world class athlete! And that is all you ever learn. All that setup wasted. I'd have preferred learning more about them and the world of magic than dealing with the competition. But that would have killed all the action in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 7. All the pieces are well done. Each performance was fine. the writing had problems but I can forgive them. But the pieces were not put together, and that stopped this film from being really great."
"tictactoe93","9","0","1","20 November 2005"," Hilarious, one of the best
","This movie is my favorite out of the series. It's hilarious and a must-see. They did leave quite a few things out that were in the book, but it was a great adaption considering the Goblet of Fire is the longest book so far. Even if you didn't read the book, the plot is pretty easy to follow and the acting is good. The trio did a great job and so did all of the new additions to the cast. (Katie Leung, Clemence Poesy, Robert Pattinson, Stanislav Ianevski) The special effects in this movie are amazing and I'd say that they were the best out of the four movies. In other words, this movie is one that you can't miss, and one you might want to go see again."
"seriousmissus","9","0","1","20 November 2005"," Not your average sequel
","It seems that far too often lately, there have been too many ""necessary evil"" movies... that is, movies that are made that are okay to watch, but you have to see them to truly appreciate the movie that follows in the series. These movies include the last Terminator movie that was made just a few years ago and Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Goblet of Fire is not one of these movies. How the producers of the Harry Potter movies do this is beyond my realm of understanding. I can only imagine that it has something to do with JK Rowling and the way her books continue to get better and better.<br/><br/>One thing that I really enjoyed about Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is probably something that not everyone will notice. In these so-called ""necessary evil"" sequels, it seems that there is too much emphasis placed on characters that we've seen enough of already. Goblet of Fire, however, gives a chance for some once overlooked cast members to have a larger piece in the film. For example, the Weasley twins have always been bit actors in the series. In this film, they had much meatier roles. (Because I know what happens to them in Book 5, I can see why.) Another great part was the way they showed that even kids with magic powers have awkward teenage moments like acquiring the courage to ask someone to a dance.<br/><br/>However, having read all of the books does pose a bit of a downfall. Ever the pessimist, I'm always looking for ways that the films don't hold justice to the books. With the Potter series, I keep getting things mixed up with what storyline was in which book. I think it was in book 5 where we found out who Rita Skeeter really is and how she gets her stories, but I can't be certain, so I don't know if this was ""left out"" of the film, or if it was intentionally left for the upcoming Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>Also, most people are probably saying ""Enough with the Harry Potter thing already- everything is about HIM!"" I think it was great the way the producers kept with JK Rowling's feeling of sympathy for the characters who are saying the same thing. You can feel it in Ron's every gesture throughout this film- he's as sick of the attention Harry gets as everyone else is. But then Ron realizes what the audience sees: Harry did not ask for all of this, and given the choice, neither he nor the ones who envy him would want to be faced with such demons.<br/><br/>One thing I wasn't crazy about was the mannequins that they used for the underwater scene. They could have been done better.<br/><br/>Pessimism aside, I would see this film over and over. I really loved the way that it was shown and each actor performed above par. Ralph Feinnes was fantastic as Lord Voldemort, and it was nice to see people that we don't get to see a lot of, like Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and the twins, as well as new characters like Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang. And even though we did not see a lot of Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Alan Rickmam's Professor Snape, they served their purpose and did what they needed to do to move the story along without hogging up all of the spotlight.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great coming of age film with drama, suspense, and humor."
"RecoWilliams","8","0","1","20 November 2005"," Harry Potter 4 (The Goblet of Fire)
","This movie is incredible!<br/><br/>From the very onset of this movie it had a much different feel than all of the other movies. For those of you who keep up with my reviews I was not a big fan of HP3! I loved HP1 and HP2 but HP3 was lacking.<br/><br/>WELL I'm back on the HP bus again. This fourth installment was absolutely brilliant. I loved the fact that we are growing up with the characters. Dan Radcliffe (harry) is now a teenager. Now that the movie is going into that territory and there will be no shortage of Harry Potter movies in the future I loved that they dealt with them simply growing up.<br/><br/>They with a number of coming of age things like getting a date, loyalty amongst friends, and awkward sexual tension. Hey it's in there! This movie was almost three hours long, but I loved every second of it. This movie is centered around a Tri-Wizard Competition which in and of itself was remarkable.<br/><br/>Harry is forced to grow up in this movie. I loved how the movie showed that Harry may be great, but he still needs help from time to time. It was awesome being in the movie looking around at all of the under 13 kids who seemed terrified by the dark imagery in this movie. I know this movie will be another record breaker!<br/><br/>This is hands down the best of the franchise since HP1 and this is a nice restart for the franchise.

I mean.. I know they had to cut some out, but I hate when they cut out things that were actually in the book and replace them with stuff that they want in there to make it ""look better."" Other than that, it is an excellent movie. Too bad Cedric had to die. He was bloody hot. The graveyard scene is exactly how I pictured it when I read the book. It was amazing.

For example, how Harry manages to get through task two.<br/><br/>Anyway, I went into movies expecting to see a good film but maybe a little bit of a mutilated book and after seeing how rushed the third movie was, you couldn't really blame me. I liked the movies up to this point but I have to say, non gave me the same thrill as Goblet of Fire. It was awesome, brilliant, just spectacular. And I complain about a lot of things... but no matter how much they missed from the books, I don't want to complain. They tried their bests to include as much as possible and they did a great job, even if it meant having to jumble things about a bit and this film can give the fans of the books a new perspective to play with.<br/><br/>By the way... if you're a fan of the books, look out for the Hogwarts Song (you know the one from Philosopher's Stone - Hogwarts Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts), it makes what I think is its first appearance in the films... it's short but funny."

Daniel Radcliffe's acting, as the brave unlikely hero, is very good and has improved very much compared to the last film. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger worrying about Harry just like in the books makes it even so real..and not to mention Rupert Grint as Ron making me laugh with his sarcasm and being funny..that's Ron! All the characters convince the audience that these young actors are up for the task. The movie was indeed darker than the last three altogether but everything is leading up to the whole series..that's what is going to happen. The books are becoming darker and so are the movies. This has been the best movie I have seen so far, and the director, Mike Newell was awesome. Everyone did a good job. It was challenging to have a 734 page book made into a two and a half hour long movie, but they all were brilliant. Two thumbs up and 10 stars to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!"
"vw_hk89","8","0","1","20 November 2005"," Seen it, loved it, however...
","I'm am a Harry Potter fanatic and book 4 is my favourite book at the moment, I was so excited when this film came out!!!!!!!!!! I literally had goosebumps from the beginning till the end of the film. The 12a rating evidently implies that the trio are kids no longer and they have grown-up. It was good to see the film done by a British director for once as it is a British novel. The visual effects (especially the dragon and underwater scene), were realistic. However, I felt that the dummies used in the underwater scene looked unrealistic and nothing like the actors. I also felt that the maze scene could have been improved (i.e. in the novel, there were several magical creatures in the maze, unfortunately in the film there wasn't). The quidditch world cup proved disappointing also as it was only on for 5 minutes. I also was disappointed about the fact that some characters were either not included or had little time on the screen (i.e. Mrs Weasley, Winky and Dobby, Ludo Bagman and Sirius Black).<br/><br/>Performancewise, Ralph Fiennes' Lord Voldermort exceeded my expectations and portrayed the dark lord very well. I would have liked to see some of the newcomers more on screen such as Stan Ivanevski(?)(Viktor Krum), Katie Leung (Cho Chang) and the Patil sisters.<br/><br/>The music was impressive, though I would have preferred Williams to have composed the score.<br/><br/>Like most British films, plenty of comedy was provided. But this film also provided a lot of unsuitable material for younger children. In the cinema I went to, there were a lot of young children and Voldermort appeared, there seemed to be a large number of young children heading towards the toilet. It is an incredibly dark film, all we have to do know is wait for a Harry Potter film with a 15-rating!"

","If you do what I do every time I sit down to watch a new Harry Potter movie, which is to separate book from movie then you will absolutely love Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. What some people must realize the amazing J.K. Rowling, is not writing the screenplay and she is not directing, so of course its going to be changed to fit into the 2 and a half hours time limit. Once you separate book from movie, you will absolutely love the movie, it is definitely the best one. Yes, the books will always be better to me, but the Goblet of Fire movie was most definitely the best movie I've seen in a long time. Although, there were some changes to the plot that did bug me, them being Voldemort's eyes weren't red. And I wish they didn't take out the whole argument at the end with Fudge, Dumbledore, Harry, etc.. I mean people who don't read the book won't know why the ministry is such a major donkey's butt in the next movie. Other than that the movie was awesome and I really love the soundtrack too."

","I've always been a fan of the Harry Potter books, but not so much the movies. I was disappointed by the last movie and how it left many key details out because that's what I judge movies based on. My pet peeve is when movies, which are based off books, leave gaping holes and leave key details out. I've been waiting for this movie to come out. I had heard different sides to it, from many different people. I saw it Saturday night, and I thought it was spectacular! There were parts left out, yes, but it was okay because they are able to get around it...it hasn't left gaping holes. All of the characters were fabulous, and were chosen very, very well. Even if you are not a Harry fan, I would suggest seeing it, because it is a great movie, one of the best I've seen, even if it is about ""Harry Potter""."

The film didn't exactly follow the book but all of the really important information was passed on to the viewer. I thought the acting was superb. Daniel Ratcliff has really matured as an actor and gets a big round of applause from me. I love the story. I've read all the books several times and I was so excited to see this film. I can't wait for the next book and for the next film to hit the big screens. I've already requested that Amazon notify me when this movie becomes available on DVD."

","I finally saw the new Harry Potter movie last night. I had my doubts as to how good the movie would be considering that the book is 734 pages and the movie was less than 2.5 hours. But I have to admit in comparison to other the movies, this one is probably the best. There were practically no slow scenes. It stayed packed with action and humor the entire time and remained as true to the book as it could considering the time restriction. I particularly enjoyed when the Durmstrang boys arrived at Hogwarts. It was like a cross between some sort of African tribal dance and a Greek step show...very well done. Oh yeah, if anyone else has watch the movie, do the Death Eaters look similar to the KKK to you? Just wondering...."

","After waiting so long for this film I was pleasantly surprised by what i saw in the cinema this week. The film is amazing!!! The attention to detail is astounding and the acting talents of the cast have improved 100% on the last film. The mix of comedy, romance and drama make this film the best of the series and one which I'm sure we'll all want to see again and again. Although the beginning is rushed the rest of the story flows well. The 3 tasks are amazingly detailed and well done. Emotions are conveyed well and are really believable. One word of warning - view the books and movies as a separate thing otherwise you may be disappointed!"

","This is definitely the best movie out of the series. This installment has more emotions and a good story. I'm not sure that the future movies can live up to this installment.<br/><br/>Another great detail about the movies is the casting. The cast are mostly British or European. I look at the cast and I see Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman for starters. I'm not trying to put down American actors because there are some great ones.<br/><br/>The performances were good, and the direction was well done. I found myself bored with the first two movies and partially with the third one but this one kept my attention throughout the whole screening.<br/><br/>The only problem I can see is that it could of been a bit more scary, but that's just me."

","As the opening soared, I developed goose bumps (as usual) and teared-up (again, as usual). From there on out, I actually noticed the ABSENCE of music! Sure there was some background instrumental but nothing that evokes the emotions of Williams' music. It was hardly a surprise to see that someone else was credited with most of the music. It is truly a disappointment. We usually purchase the soundtracks but are uninterested in this one. Then we read that John Williams is only doing themes for Order of the Phoenix. This is an even bigger blow. I understand that he is a busy man but you would think that he would give his continuing projects some kind of priority."

The soundtrack was absolutely brilliant, and I felt it mirrored and enhanced the emotions in every scene. Although things were missed out (like Spew...sorry, S.P.E.W) they were covered well and there were no gaping holes which I found so frustrating in some of the earlier films (like PoA). There was also a perfect mixture of tension, action, emotion and comedy. The trio's acting has improved so much.

It was funny and witty and actually shows the better side of the story which is humor, friendship, and love, that I'm sure J.K. takes a lot of time putting in.

","Ha. This guys review above me is funny (downright crazy bloke; i laughed when Diggory died). This was by far the darkest movie so far but, of the books, the best told story of the series (followed closely by half blood prince).<br/><br/>I thought the movie was generally good, absolutely hilarious in some scenes, however, i found myself disappointed in the areas where the story seemed hurried or was not congruent with the book. For example, Neville doesn't give harry the gillyweed (dobby does), the 'bone of the father' was dust not a bone, the whole first task was done incorrectly (and they didn't build up to it right), the karkaroff court scene (which in the book was powerful w/ the Crouches; sucked in the movie), and by the hurrying through one of the funnest (and important to the story) pieces, the world cup which was cut down to about 5 minutes of theatre."
"daomingsi637","10","0","1","20 November 2005"," excellent, thrilling, the best ...
","Harry potter and the goblet of fire is undoubtedly the best movie of the series by far. Its cinematic presentation represents the darkness of the book, without removing the films ""comedic"" feel. The reason why this movie is claimed to be ""incredible"" is because it simply is. It distinguishes itself from the rest of the movies through its script, its mood, and the ending which is quite depressing and tragic. Every movie improves its flaws and gets better and better as the series progresses. Its good to see that this movie did not only live up to its hype, but exceeded my expectations tremendously. Overall the movie was excellent, flawless, and will set the line for the other Harry Potter films to come."
"oshram-3","9","0","3","20 November 2005"," Finally back on track
","Given the monstrous popularity of the book series, the Harry Potter films have always had sort of a tough act to follow; as the teen wizard's adventures have continued, the books have become darker, more complex, and a little bit more adult. Though the third installment, Prisoner of Azkaban, tried hard to move the films in that direction, it was a mostly unpalatable attempt, and I wondered if any of the later films would ever be able to stack up to the first two, which are admittedly light hearted (and obsessively faithful adaptations). In addition Goblet of Fire remains my favorite book, in my opinion the piece where Rowling is at the height of her literary prowess. So, for me, this movie had the deck stacked against it.<br/><br/>But director Mike Newell seems to understand the material a lot better than predecessor Alfonso Cuaron (whom many people lauded because he's an indie darling, not because he did a good job with the franchise, because, frankly, he didn't); there's far more humor, more done with the characters, and a sense that every attempt was made to stay closer to the book than last year's disappointing outing. Of course with a book almost 900 pages long you had to expect some cuts in the material, but this time those choices were made wisely and judiciously.<br/><br/>Once again we find Harry, Ron, and Hermione returning to school at the start of the film, but the double treat of no Dursleys and the Quidditch World Cup (some of Rowling's best material ever) kick off the movie in high fashion; a pity we're yanked out of it so soon, but again, 900 pages of ground to cover. The big plot twist this time is that Harry must compete against young wizards from other schools in a dangerous contest known as the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Rowling's world expands from a predominantly English metaphor to include the French and Bulgarians as well, and the results are very satisfying, just as they were in the book.<br/><br/>Newell does his best to stay true to the material, putting the kids back in their class robes for most of the movie and adding tons of generous little touches to the film (reaction shots are a specialty, from Hermione's disgust at the boys' very positive response to the arrival of the French maidens to Harry dribbling water down his chin as he locks eyes with his object d'amour, Cho Chen. This sense of playful humor so prevalent in the books was almost wholly absent in the last film and was a welcome addition to this one.<br/><br/>The casting was superb, even by the usual high Potter series standards (it's unlikely they will ever top Ken Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart). Mad-Eye Moody, one of my favorite characters in all the books, was vividly brought to life by Brendan Gleeson; Moody is a constant crotchety joy throughout the whole film. Also looking the part very well, though admittedly given little to do, were Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum and Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory; both were able to capture their characters in a few simple turns. Less satisfying was Clémence Poésy as Fleur Delacour; Poésy came off completely flat and unappealing, baffling given the high quality of the other casting and really the first let-down in the entire series as that sort of thing goes.<br/><br/>The leads (Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron) are all getting a bit long in the tooth to pass for their ages, which I felt with the last movie as well. Ron looks in his early twenties, and while Hermione mostly passes (Watson only outstrips her character by a year or two now), Radcliffe is no longer a boy, he's a man (if there were any doubt, a scene where he lingers topless in a bath  to the very ardent delight of the teenaged girl behind me in the theater  puts any debate on the matter to rest). By the time Rowling finishes book seven and they get around to the movie in 2008-9, the kids will seem old enough to be their own parents.<br/><br/>The production design deserves a note  particularly effective and appealing this time, from the smart French outfits to the especially well-rendered Durmstrang suits, coats, and furry hats, a clever amalgamation of Baltic, Russian, and old world design that evokes many cultures in general but none in specific. Excellent work.<br/><br/>The film runs more than two and a half hours, but it moves at such a breakneck pace that it feels just a tad over two. Though Potter maniacs (Pottheads?) might whine about this or that detail being overlooked, face it, some of it had to go, and Newell and company keep the emotional core of the work intact, which is the most important thing. Though critics keep calling it 'dark,' I found the movie high-spirited and engaging, pulling me into its alternate world the way the first two did (and the books excelled at). Though it'll be tough to top the first two films, Goblet of Fire proves a worthy successor to the Potter tradition, a film certainly worth your time to go and see this holiday season."

","This Harry Potter can't get better on my point of view. The movie is a very well done and the special affects are awesome. I think this movie is the most like the books at of all 4 movies. The age is right the kids look like the age they should be. This is the BEST YET! I hope this comment helps you buy maybe you don't like it some I have talked to said it is the worst yet but I disagree 100% The special affects on the Dark Mark and the greatest adventures so far in the Black lake and the Enchanted maze also the Hungarian Hornback was an excellent feature the movie cant be better! I loved it and MANY people agree with me I saw the line for midnight showings it is such a long line! I went on opening day and that line was also huge at the theater i went to it is sold out completely! so That is the movie the movie has great characteristics to it also. THE BEST YET! How can this movie be horrible? I have a question how can ANY Harry Potter movie be horrible?"
"ChibiKuririn","9","0","1","20 November 2005"," Good movie, but the beginning felt...odd
","I thought the special effects and action sequences in this were rather well-done, plus Grint finally had lines that weren't summed up as 'comic relief.' The beginning, though, felt 'odd' to say the least - the transitions felt a bit off, though this feeling had abated by the time everyone'd made it to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Also, there wasn't much character development in here, though that's mainly thanks to the first three movies being full of it.<br/><br/>The ending scenes, however, easily made up for any shortcomings in character development - the third task, Voldemort's return (the death of Diggory, the revival ritual, the Ku Klux Death Eaters apparating and kneeling) and Priori Incantatem were exactly as I pictured them while reading the book, plus the graphics there felt real and not tacked on.<br/><br/>I personally liked this movie the most out of the four The only thing left for me to say is this: if you want character development, go watch the first three movies again. If you want a Harry Potter movie that doesn't feel like it's just a $100-million illustration of its written counterpart, see Goblet of Fire ASAP.<br/><br/>And if you want a good movie, then pay $6 and see what your opinion of this movie turns out to be. Hopefully you won't be disappointed."
"SnakeEclipse","7","0","1","20 November 2005"," after reading the book BEFORE watching it.
","Well, I will have my complaints in this, and will have my praises. Let me start by complaining.<br/><br/>They did in fact leave a lot out of the plot of people like Crouch, Bagman (who isn't even in the movie, but I suppose could have done without), and the thing that really got me that they missed was the part of Snape being a Death Eater. That was completely crucial to the plot, and it really bummed me out that it wasn't there.<br/><br/>Secondly, whatever happened to that scene of Harry sneaking around in the invisibility cloak, and him nearly getting caught by Snape and Crouch, but Moody saves him. That would have been cool to see, but that's just me. So would them finding out that skeeter was an Animagus.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not much of a book fan, and I suppose I just read these things to get a sense of what is going on. I liked it when I read Azkaban AFTER seeing the movie, because that way I could fully enjoy the movie without critiquing it too much. After reading the book and watching it again, then I guess I had a few more complaints, because they kind of messed up with azkaban, even though I thought the movie was brilliant as a MOVIE. If you put every little thing from a book into a movie, then you'll have a 6-7 hour movie, and you will fall asleep by the end. If they had tried to make this one a little bit longer, then they might have been able to do better with it, but I still loved Goblet better than Azkaban.<br/><br/>Last complaints. WHERE IN THE BLOODY HELL WAS SIRIUS? HE""S THE MOST IMPORTANT SUPPORTING CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE BOOK, QUITE LITERALLY. THEY COMPLETELY BUTCHERED THAT! Also WHERE THE HELL DID QUIDITTCH GO, they just used that whole World Cup scene to introduce Krum. there were so many interesting parts of the Quidditch Cup in the book. all we get is a bloody talent show, and then we don't even see a match. The sorry excuse for a match in Azkaban would have been like a Quidditch Globetrotters game compared to the crap Quidditch we got here.<br/><br/>OK, now for the good stuff.<br/><br/>I liked how they got the main plot of Harry in the Goblet of Fire, and Voldemort returning pretty dead on. The other thing that I liked that Newell did was how the small stuff was paid closer attention to, but in a very subtle way in some areas, and a huge part in others. there were some very interesting things that could have been put into the movie from the book that were very little and insignificant, but would have worked on film. The stuff they did cut out, some of it was worth it, some of it just screams ""why the heck did they leave that out?"" For example, I personally am getting a little tired of the Dursleys in the beginning of every movie now. The cut was bound to happen if you ask me. Harry's dream is much more interesting, plus it took forever in the books to actually get to the Quidditch world cup.<br/><br/>The whole save the elves thing in the book could have been done subtly but I wouldn't have been too interested in that. Those elves were annoying if you ask me, and I'm a wee bit thankful for their cut.<br/><br/>As for Hagrid's whole giant-allowed-to-teach-at-Hogwarts dilemma, could have been done, but wasn't. Again, another thing that took forever to solve in the book when it wasn't moving along the main plot at all.<br/><br/>As for the Tri wizard tournament scenes. Brilliance scenes, especially in the Dragon scenes. The Yule Ball was well done, and it was key to the movie, so I'm glad they got that in there. There was enough of the Indian twins as well as Cho Chang, and I'm glad they stayed true to the books with those subtle details. The Voldemort return was kind of quick at first, but as it went along, it became more interesting to watch. The ending where Harry broke down after Diggory died was major kudos on Radcliffe's's part. The ending with Moody was a good end to all the peril in the movie. I think they could have done more with the Trio at the end, but hey, it's the movies. They always butcher something from a book or game.<br/><br/>I guess I'm saying that they can't do every single thing in the books, and they often leave out wonderful parts that would work well on screen. I felt somewhat gypped from the books, but I guess that is my punishment for reading the books first. Cinematically, it's a fantastic film to watch, as for being faithful to the books, the first and second one do it the best, but it gets a little boring if you follow every detail again. I think in order to absolutely defend this movie's future, I can say that I think they cut out some of the subtle things to avoid repeating themselves in the movies as far as goes events that have already happened in a similar way. My two main disappoints are the ones in capital letters, but all in all, it's entertainment, and it's Hollywood, and this is what we get. I know I'm waiting 'till after Phoenix comes out to read that book.<br/><br/>7/10"
"dublhlix","3","0","2","20 November 2005"," What were they thinking?!
","Had I not read the Goblet of Fire before seeing the movie I am sure I MIGHT have enjoyed it a lot more, unfortunately, I did read it and it made watching the film almost painful. <br/><br/>As I watched the movie the main thing going through my head was ""What where they thinking?!"". I realize, and respect, that it is a daunting task to take a 734 page book and make it into a 150 minute movie but, I have to say, they failed miserably. They took an amazing book and turned it into a jumble of scenes and characters that just did not fit. Nothing was ever explained properly. Important scenes were left out, i.e. Barty Crouch Jr explaining how and why he did what he did, and the ""argument"" between Dumbledore and Cornelius Fudge in the hospital wing. These are integral plot points that set the stage for The Order of the Phoenix and they were barely even touched upon, why? Important characters were left out as well, what happened to Mrs. Weasley and Percy? Why was Sirius in the film for all of 5 minutes? I even found myself longing to see Dobby and Winky. Were these characters and scenes left out to make room for stupid jokes and the addition of situations that never even occurred in the book? Take the scene with Professor McGonagall teaching the students how to dance, it was totally unnecessary! <br/><br/>There were so many characters and plot points in this movie that were mentioned once or twice, never fully explained, and not mentioned again. For example, there was no point in having Rita Skeeter in the movie if they were not going to fully explore the tension between here and the kids. <br/><br/>I think what frustrated me most about the movie was not that everything from the book could not be put in the film, it was that they changed so much of the book without reason. The movie was completely inaccurate. I can only assume that they were trying to make it more ""interesting"" for movie-goers but I believe that a true Harry Potter fan wants to see accuracy, he/she appreciates the story the way it is and wants to see it portrayed that way on screen.<br/><br/>I want to take a minute to comment on the acting. I thought the kids, as always, were great. Although Mad Eye Moody did not look as he should, Brendan Gleeson did an excellent job in the role. The biggest complaint I have about the acting is Michael Gambon, he is not a convincing Dumbledore. Dumbledore should exude a quiet wisdom, even when he is angry he still remains calm, it's his eyes that demonstrate his emotions not his voice. Michael Gambon completely overacts, he is too loud and boisterous, he is simply not believable.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very disappointed with this movie, it was definitely not worth the $9 I paid to see it. It could have been great but instead it was a random jumble of junk and I think, to a person who did not read the book, it was most likely confusing. My advice to anyone who is thinking of seeing the movie would be to just stick with the books, they are infinitely more enjoyable."

"LadyLiberty","7","0","1","20 November 2005"," Fourth Potter Installment Falls Just Short
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire recounts the events of Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) fourth year at Hogwarts, a school for young witches and wizards. The movie begins slightly before the school year does when Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) takes his family and a few friends to the World Quidditch Tournament. Harry, and his best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are thrilled, especially when they're able to see the ""world's greatest seeker,"" Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) play. But when the tournament festivities are attacked by Death Eaters, the fun and games quickly come to an end.<br/><br/>Harry and his friends leave the abruptly terminated matches directly for Hogwarts where they're thrilled to hear Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) announce that their school will be the site of the infamous Tri-Wizard Tournament this year. Students from two other schools  Durmstrang and Beauxbatons  will join those at Hogwarts for the contest which is strictly limited to those age 17 and older due to the inherent dangers involved. The magical goblet of fire spits out names from each of the schools: Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) from Hogwarts, Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) from Beauxbatons, and the famous Viktor Krum himself from Durmstrang are to compete. But then the goblet spews forth one more name: Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Though too young to compete, the rules are clear: if the goblet offers up a name, that student must participate. Harry is terrified, and can only hope he survives the contests to come. He has some hope of doing so, but only with help from Ron and Hermione; groundskeeper and good friend Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane); the newest Dark Arts teacher, Alastor ""MadEye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson); and, strangely enough, the incompetent-at-just-about-everything Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis).<br/><br/>If all this isn't enough, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his father, Luscious (Jason Isaacs) continue to plague Harry; Potions instructor, Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) is still no friend to Harry; and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) might just be making a comeback. Mix all of this with Harry's crush on a fellow student, Cho Chang (Katie Leung); a nasty falling out with Ron; and a true tabloid-type reporter for The Daily Prophet (Rita Skeeter, played by Miranda Richardson), and you'll begin to understand why Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was such a substantial book and such a disappointing film.<br/><br/>I could, I suppose, blame great anticipation for a bit of my disappointment. But I think it's probably more fair to blame the severe editing needed to squeeze a lengthy book into a two and a half hour time frame. As it was, the World Quidditch Tournament  which was an absolute delight to watch  was on screen all too briefly. The unexplained attack by the Death Eaters would have been more than a little confusing to those who haven't read the book. And the necessity to pack so much into the film meant that favorite characters  such as the malevolent Malfoys, the acerbically funny Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), and the delightful Weasley twins, Fred and George (James and Oliver Phelps)  were given short shrift.<br/><br/>The acting is just fine from all of the youthful cast. The acting is quite a bit better than fine from Brendan Gleeson and, in her limited screen time, Maggie Smith. The special effects, as is to be expected, were superlative (pay particular attention to a feisty Welsh dragon), as were the sets. The direction seemed to elicit everything it needed to from the actors, and the editing was largely well done. But so much happened so quickly that there was little opportunity to really become emotionally invested in the film, and that's unfortunate seeing as how this part of Harry's story marks a real emotional watershed for him and his nearest and dearest.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire would have lent itself well to a two-part series or, failing that, should have been longer. Peter Jackson (the Oscar-winning director of the brilliant Lord of the Rings series) proved audiences would sit still for three and a half hour movies provided they're good ones, and the Harry Potter movies are among the few with stories that really are that good. Did I like the movie? Yes, I did. But it could have been better...<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is rated PG-13 for ""sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images."" I read one review where it was suggested that those too young to read the hefty book are too young to see the movie, and I'd agree. There are injuries, deaths, and other assorted nasty things that simply are not suitable for small children. Older Harry Potter fans (say 11 or so and up) will be fine, though, and will love seeing everything they've imagined (and then some) coming to life on the big screen. It's no small feat that even a movie that could have been so much better was still so good!"

","Well well well, where do I begin? I firstly have read all the books and am a huge fan of them. I didn't enjoy the first two movies but enjoyed the third, even though I did get angry that they left out very vital parts (e.g. padfoot being sirius, prongs being his dad etc.). So to my surprise, I really enjoyed the forth film! I don't believe they left out too much vital information, even though I left the cinema thinking, ""that ending was very rushed....but actually did they need to explain much more?"" Voldermort was brilliant and I was very impressed (and terrified!) OK OK OK I agree, things could have been better at explanation. And some of the characters were a little bit...unrealistic e.g Dumbledore shaking harry etc. The main problem I have with the film is how they are gonna lead it on from here. Sirius is just not in the film enough, Snape is way too nice in the first 3 (he does improve in the 4th one) for it to lead to the 6th book, there needed to be some more explanation of the death eaters and in connection to Snape etc. Overall I enjoyed it and I would see it again. Partly because I was disappointment with the 3rd, I made myself enjoy the film for what it was, I just think the directors need to think long term... xxx"

","I have to admit that the Graphics were awesome, but the Director once again made many important things gone. The Quidditch World Cup was only about two seconds longs with introducing the players, but they didn't show any playing. There was no Winky, and no Dobby, what happened to the House Elves? I must admit the first two tasks were done well, but the last one, the maze, was missing all the creatures. But it seemed to me that the movie went by too fast for anything to really happen, it seemed one minute after the first task, Harry was already in the prefects bathroom. In the prefects bathroom the mermaid was awake, and not asleep. It still has great music, and great effects, and the stuff that was in the movie was good, but they simply cut too much of the book out."

Well, what do you expect from a 734 page novel in to a 156 minute movie. They did leave out a bit of stuff but for the most part left a lot in. All the good parts take about 4 minutes to explain and then they jump to next scene.

Basically this movie had no background characters to support the main theme. They left out the scene where harry and his friends where under the impervious and they left out that Hagrid was Half Giant, but most importantly they left out the Weasely's Wizard Wheezes.

","I think my biggest mistake was re-reading the novel right before seeing the movie. It made what was missing in the transition between novel and movie all the more apparent.<br/><br/>Let me say that this is not in any way a bad movie and the time flew by while viewing it. It is only in later reflection that I feel somehow there was something missing and that was the chance to enjoy more interaction between the characters I have come to know so well.<br/><br/>When the movie took a break from the action and slowed down to enjoy the typical teenage emotions and reactions to events such as the Yule Ball, it felt much more comfortable and familiar.<br/><br/>There is plenty of humor in the film, the ""ferret scene"" and the interaction between Moaning Myrtle and Harry come to mind. There is also an overall feel of darkness and not just in plot - the lighting is dark, dark, dark! While much had to be left out of the movie due to time constraints, the cutting away from the World Cup was much to abrupt and left you longing to watch at least part of the match. The third task of negotiating the maze, did not impress me as much, perhaps I had in mind more ""living"" obstacles instead of demented shrubbery.<br/><br/>The Voldemort I had conjured in my mind sadly did not match up with the film version, but perhaps making him more frightening would have been too much for the younger viewers. (I still would not recommend this film for anyone under ten years of age.)There were tears in my eyes when Harry returned to Hogwarts after his meeting with Voldemort and I felt that scene was particularly well acted.<br/><br/>For the next film, I will do myself the favor of not re-reading the book prior to viewing the film and come away feeling like I have had a reunion of old friends and not worrying about what was missing."

This amazing film kick starts with a trip to the Qudditch World Cup with Harry and his beloved friend, Hermione, Ron, The Weasleys and Cedric Diggory and his father Mr Diggory. The movie this year shows us a new side of Harry and his strengths and he is entered to join the Triwizard competition, even though he is under-age (the limit in the film is 17) Someone has wrote his name on a piece of parchment and thrown it into the goblet of fire. Harry has been told they do not come across to him as a friendly person but to leave him in great peril. We see Harry take on the 3 tasks needed to be completed to win the Triwizard cup and the return of the Dark Lord, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Towards The End Of This Film.

","Harry Potter is back, looking slightly more grown up and with an even more dodgy haircut. I must be one of the only people who think this but for me the film was a let down, the reason for this was for me the film did not do the book justice there were bits of the film that were just skimmed over and seemed irrelevant, the bits with Rita Skeeter for a start, which are much more important in the book. The biggest problem is that the writers have tried to cram as much as they could from the book into the film as possible. There is also the problem that in the book Harry starts to deal with teenage emotions, this is important for the character development but isn't dealt with very well at all in the film, maybe this is because the prime audience for the film is around 8 years old. Which brings me to my final point. You gotta remember who this film is for, ultimately it is for the kids and they will love it, it will indeed keep them occupied for a good two hours or so. They don't care about emotions or exact references from the books and this will be just as good as reading the book if not better. For me though even though the films main market is children it could have been so much better. I mean look at what they managed to do to the Lord of The Rings."

","I am a faithful Harry Potter fan, and I have to admit, I was throughly disappointed with this movie. Vital parts of the movie were missing. <br/><br/>You know how in the book, Hagrid asks Madame Maxime if she was a giantess? Well that never happens! How are we supposed to know the Hagrid is half giant in the next movie? And Harry's Triwizard earnings were never even mentioned. So Fred and George will have no money to start their shop with in the next movie. <br/><br/>Although I very much enjoyed the acting. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson were absolutely brilliant, but my credits go towards Rupert Grint and Alan Rickman. They were absolutely wonderful. Words can't describe their performance. I particularly enjoyed the part where Snape kept ""telling"" Ron and Harry to be quiet. Emma Watson did a very good job with the Yule Ball scene. <br/><br/>If you haven't read the book, I definitely recommend you go see the movie. It was wonderful. But if you have read the book, don't bother. You will leave the theatre very frustrated with how altered everything got."

","In June of 2004, I saw and reviewed the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ""What was gold is now lead"". To say that I was unhappy with the movie would be more than an understatement. Needless to say I was very apprehensive with seeing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, especially under the direction of anyone other than Chris Columbus.<br/><br/>My apprehension was without merit. I loved this movie! It was a chapter in the series worthy of the book. The story kept to the book regardless of the fact that it had to be edited to fit into the normal span of a movie.<br/><br/>The locations were fantastic, the Director managed to incorporate the oringially unnecessary and foolish changes made by Alfonso Cuoron, to set locations in the world originally envisioned on film by Columbus into the new film which bridged the gap between the films and brought me back to the world I loved. The bridge which in Prisoner of Azkaban annoyed me as it had moved Hagrid's Hut away from the castle (after two movies of being next to the castle, is given reason and purpose in the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>This film had it's darkness but more than it's share of humour. New characters and old were given their due respect on film. The Weasley twins grew into the pranksters we know from the books, Neville Longbottom is further developed as is Severus Snape and Lucius Malfoy. I won't spoil it...<br/><br/>The actors were excellent. I was especially happy this time with Sir Michael Gambon in his second appearance as Dumbledore. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint continue to grow and I will enjoy seeing them in future chapters of the series.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast (too many to comment) were spectacular from the other youths to the powerful actors, such as the regulars Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith. New actors Brendan Gleeson and of course Ralph Fiennes have to be mentioned.<br/><br/>Movie magic that delighted the senses has returned, and in no more appropriate a film. From the sets to the costumes to the performance of the cast... A almost perfect hit! I did miss the music of John Williams but the replacement was still quite good.

","Harry Potter was good. Scene by Scene it was masterful. Continuity, however, does suffer and the transitions are poor. The production is feeling the lost of Richard Harris and though Michael Gambon does a good job of stepping in, I feel he lacks the grace and spirit of Richard Harris. Another problem is the all to frequent director changes the production has undergone. Though the third film was able to overcome these obstacles, Goblet of Fire has more difficulty doing so owing to the excessive nature of the book. Sorry if this is a bit long I just didn't feel right giving criticisms without making an attempt to justify them. It is still a very good film and enjoyable. It is definitely worth seeing."
"wrathchild712","10","0","2","19 November 2005"," Best Potter Film Yet!!!
","This is it. At this point in the Harry Potter book series, the books get longer...and darker. Between 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and 'Goblet of Fire' you see the former having almost no mention whatsoever of the evil Lord Voldemort, whereas the latter closes with his dramatic return. While I prefer the third BOOK to the fourth BOOK, as far as the movies go, Daniel Radcliffe and Co. have, with the film version of Goblet of Fire, topped the Azkaban movie, which I never would have expected.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it took a second or third viewing of 'Azkaban' before I could appreciate Alfonso Cuaron's masterful job. Before I saw 'Goblet,' I thought that Cuaron had set himself up better with that than Mike Newell had with Goblet - the main reason for this being that Cuaron turned a 400-odd page book into a two and a half-hour movie, while Newell had reportedly taken the 752 page 'Goblet' and put it into the same two and a half hour time frame. (This was a project that Newell reportedly, at one time, wanted to make into TWO movies.)<br/><br/>But dammit, Newell pulled it off, and gloriously so. Obviously, some things had to be left out of the movie, (For example, Harry's vicious Dursleys are left out, as is the back story of the House-Elves) but what you need is there. You get not only the three tasks and the Yule Ball in this two and half hours, but you also get the trademark signs of adolescence in the quarrel between Harry and Ron that is quite prominent in the book.<br/><br/>Most of the Potter regulars are back, and in fine form. Michael Gambon did not come off as well this time around as headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore gives off a calm, cool disposition in the books - and here he seemed really on edge, and agitated. (Still, given the state of things in the movie, who wouldn't?) Newcomers Miranda Richardson (Rita Skeeter) and Brendan Gleeson (Professor Moody) are perfect additions to the series. But the best addition to this franchise was, without a doubt, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort. Despite having relatively little screen time in the film, his maliciously evil portrayal of the Dark Lord when he WAS on screen shows me that he will be invaluable as the franchise continues. <br/><br/>The scenery and CG sequences were, as usual for this series, top notch. The three tasks of the Triwizard Tournament look, simply, outstanding. One thing I particularly liked is that Newell seemed to breath more life and color into this movie than was to be found in the Azkaban movie, despite the fact that the fourth book is considerably darker and more mature than the third.<br/><br/>My only criticism is the lack of time Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) gets on screen. In the books, Harry and Sirius meet up several times, not just once where the two don't even interact in person. With an actor like Gary Oldman playing the role, it is almost a crime to not take the five or ten extra minutes to get him in the film more.<br/><br/>However, it may as well be a simple misdemeanor charge, because the rest of the film more than makes up for it. I walked out stunned. This is not only the best movie in the Potter franchise, but it IS the best movie of the year. 10/10"

I am a fan however, and no one who has not read the book could ever follow the story -- especially the end. So if your a fan you should see it. They do a nice job with certain scenes, and it is fun to see them. <br/><br/>On the other had, it is not a good movie. It does not hang together as a story for a non-fan. The characters don't engage enough. Everyone is expected to know the whole backstory and even recognize the actors from the other movies. <br/><br/>This movie strikes me as a marathon to pack in as much plot as possible, and it does not have enough heart. I liked some of the story simplifications, but it needed more interplay between the characters. <br/><br/>The young actors have been good and continue to be. The best part of this movie was the dance scene. <br/><br/>This is the weakest of the four movies so far. That may be because the three contests of the story are hard to make into a movie. I would have trimmed it down to two contests or simply made two movies out of it."

While it's been a couple of years since I read the book, I was able to keep up with things. However, I can easily see how my fiancée, who hasn't read it yet, thought the film jumped around and felt disjointed.<br/><br/>Other than the directing/writing problems, this movie was well done. The regular cast members continued to do a good job. I had a hard time buying some of the conflicts, but again, that's the fault of the script writer and director for cutting a lot of the little, more telling scenes. The new people did a good job. Likewise, the casting crew did an excellent job of finding people that fit the parts.<br/><br/>The effects were great.

","This is the most mature Harry Potter film to date. The acting shows a new level of sophistication, darker themes are explored and the special effects are spectacular. As in the book, the climax effectively shows true evil coming back, making this movie a little too intense for some younger viewers. Some of the transitions from scene to scene seemed a little jarring, but all in all I think they did a pretty good job in condensing such a large book into just over 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>The only problem I had was the scene where Dumbledore starts shaking Harry after the goblet spits out his name as one of the champions. This is totally unlike his character as portrayed in the books. Does anyone remember how angry he was in Order of the Phoenix when Umbridge started shaking Marietta? Why would they have him do something so drastically out of character in this movie? I hope it wasn't just for shock value."

But by the standards of what a harry potter movie, and that said one with a large budget, the acting on whole was below standard. Emma Watson did a good job, above average actually. Daniel Radcliffe was terrible. All he showed was nervousness and sweatiness throughout the movie, almost never changing. His laughter was visibly faked. IMO they should have chosen better,this guy cant act.Ron Weasly was decent, and the rest were decent as well. However,you would expect much better of a movie based on a book of such calibre.4/10 for the acting.<br/><br/>The editing was terrible.Avid Harry Potter book readers would curse when they saw the material that was cut out.The Quidditch world cup was reduced to a 5 minute scene, with no Quidditch shown at ALL, and the death eater/dark mark scene was cut very short and small important information such as Crouch's house elf were left out.<br/><br/>The commencing of the school was reduced to almost 15 seconds, with 2 other competing schools entering what looked like the first day of school. Very rushed beginning. Editing 4/10<br/><br/>Costumes. On the whole, i was impressed with the costumes. Hagrid, Madam Maxime, filch, harry,the Weasley brothers, all wore suitable and interesting attire. Dumbledore however, did not fit his ""grand"" description from the books. HE looked shabbily dressed. The death eater masks were pitiable. They looked evil creatures right out of an infant's book. The hats were atrocious. Costumes - 7/10<br/><br/>Voldemort - For lack of any possible knowledge/idea on how else he could have been shown, ill give Voldemorte's costume/face a 9/10. He did look evil in certain scenes. However, his nostrils looked more comic than scary. Voldemort-8/10<br/><br/>Voldemorte's acting and self-carriage was unfitting,however. Certain scenes he was seen to, after for example mending Wormtails hand, to move back and look at worm tail almost looking for Wormtail's word on whether it was OK or not or if he should change it. His air was unsuitable for a dark lord. He was not confident and grand/dark enough.<br/><br/>Madeye moody's eye was atrocious. It looked like the plastic eye stuck onto my teddy's face. A red or green eye that was fixated within the eye socket would have made a tremendous difference.<br/><br/>Decent movie for a medium budget movie,but rather disappointing since it was high budget, wont watch it again any time soon<br/><br/>6/10"
"DeeB424","10","0","1","19 November 2005"," Entertainment at its best
","Why hasn't the HP series won more awards? The cinematography is phenomenal. Content is true if you watch the whole scene and not just listen to the actors. The entire series is true to the writer. When watching the movie you see more from the book than you hear, just look around each scene. GOF was a difficult book to translate into a movie. As we go further into Hogwarts years, the more challenging it becomes to give everyone everything. If there's a any constructive criticism to state it would be that there was a missing connection with Sirius. Sirius' relationship with Harry was a strong GOOD and Hermione referencing to reporting to Siruis just wasn't enough but I can understand only referencing since that probably would have made the movie another 45 minutes long...of course, that would have been fine for me.<br/><br/>From the moment the first scene shows the ""snake"" slithering through the field up to the house, you reflect back to the book. To those who have read the books, this one is another spoonful of the lives of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and my appetite is just beginning. Another success for Rowlings and Kloves into the world of good and bad and the magical connections created from paper to screen.<br/><br/>I'm not one to read these kinds of books, but I can't wait for book 7. Michael Goldenberg is the screenplay writer for HP Order of the Phoenix. I hope his vision will maintain the integrity that Steven Kloves has given for the first 4. We'll see in 2007. GREAT movie series, all four movies are a must see for everyone."

","I'll admit, I was there waiting in line with other hopeful fans last night for the opening of Potter. Despite being completely let down by the previous three films, my eternal optimism found me once again standing shoulder to shoulder with six year olds in capes and scarves and frantic mothers insisting that there was no time for candy right now. And, for the first time, Potter succeeded in making the whole ordeal worth it.<br/><br/>Indeed, the film was so much better than the previous three little comparison can be made between them. The child actors, finally growing into themselves, are beginning to experience some moments of real talent. These glimmers of hope, complimented by the obvious rapport between the actors, contributes to a movie that actually allows one to suspend disbelief for long enough to enjoy the show. This, combined with an amazing performance by Finnes, ensures there is enough good acting in the film to carry through the unfortunate lapses.<br/><br/>True, the pacing could be improved. The movie seems to shift between being too fast and then crawling, seldom actually settling into a comfortable speed. People who have not read the books may be confused by the plot holes, most caused by the elimination of small but crucial characters. Literary viewers will follow the action more easily, but may spend the film confused and angered by the many changes made. Personally, I thought the film was a reasonable adaptation, though seriously lacking in depth.<br/><br/>No, Potter will not win any major awards. And no, it's not perfect, far from it. However it is entertaining, and a much better total package than any of the previous films. The story is dark, upsetting, and certainly fair to the novel. There is hope, one now thinks, for the next movies: something certainly lacking before, even from an optimist such as myself."

Maxim is never accused of murdering Crouch, there are no animals nor dementors (ok...Boggart) and there was NO Sphinx, Dumbledore never tells harry about how were there the Longbottoms tortured with Cruciatus, nor that they're still alive, another important part missing is that Harry never gives Fred & George the money for them to open their store, some conversations with Sirius are missing and all the tension of knowing who is Hermione's partner is missing too.

","Many people find a movie hard to like after they read a book about it, and in the goblet of fire, this is definitely the case. Many people are hating it simply because it left out so much of the story, and not looking at how hard it is to put every detail of a 733 page book in a 2 1/2 hour movie. they could've done 3 hours for a harry potter book such as this, and i definitely hope they do for the fifth movie, but i think that leaving most of the minor details out, many major details were shown in an excellent way for a movie, and it is a great improvement from the PoA. It was indeed missing an important part of the story, but hopefully it will be easily shown in the fifth movie. I definitely think this movie was a good one considering how bad it could have been."

","I have been an avid reader of Harry Potter for years and have been fortunate enough to grow up with it, which is why I am such a huge fan. So far I have loved all the books as well as all the movies and I can confidently say that I loved this movie just as much. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire movie may well have had parts taken out, but I think this was done cleverly, and I'd much rather see this movie as it is than two separate ones with a lot of dragging, unnecessary detail. I do feel that several characters should have been put in though, such as Ludo Bagman and Winky the house elf. Nevertheless, I still thought the movie was absolutely fantastic. I thought the script was great - whilst in some cases scenes tended to jump, it was still wonderful as I never felt bored and was always grasped by the story - extremely important in any movie. In addition, I thought the actors all did justice to their roles; especially Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. All in all a majestic piece of work - all the money invested was worthwhile and it will be loved by millions around the world. Harry Potter overall is totally amazing; all the books have been, as have the movies, and I am extremely lucky as a fourteen - nearly fifteen - year old to have truly grown up with a dose of magic."
"specklescit","9","0","1","19 November 2005"," I can't wait to see it again!
","OK, this movie is getting a lot of flak about the omission of details from the book. I had a hard time with it in the beginning, too. I didn't like how it skipped from the house to the Quidditch cup to the Hogwart's train. Plus there's the omission of Hermione's S.P.E.W. But that wasn't really a huge thing in the book that played into the plot, so I can understand why some of these details were left out.<br/><br/>The acting, however, was at its finest. In this movie, we now have 14 year old main characters, who are dealing with normal teenage issues like love, school, rumors, etc. The romantic tension between Ron and Hermione is well-played, and this movie shows Emma Watson at her best! Harry's anguish when dealing with his best friend's betrayal is impeccable, and his sorrow after the graveyard is heart breaking. Alan Rickman, as Snape, only had a few lines, but they say that actions speak louder than words, and if that is true, than he was superb! As for the people who say you should either read the book or go to see it with someone who has, I saw it with my boyfriend and 2 roommates; Jerome (the BF) and Jenny (one roomie) hadn't read the book and they followed perfectly. I can't wait to see it again!"
"highlyevolved87","10","0","1","19 November 2005"," The forth movie was amazing!!!!!
","I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter books so whenever a movie comes out based on one of the 6 novels there's definitely pressure on the director to make the movies live up to the books. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire definitely did that. This movie was amazing! It's over 2 and a half hours but trust me the time flies by! I loved how the new director really captured the fact that the characters are growing up and dealing with regular teenage problems like dating and friendship almost exactly as it was written. I also loved the fact that even though certain characters, like Ludo Bagman, had to be cut out, and originals like Malfoy and Snape had no more then a cameo, the movie flowed so perfectly that you didn't even notice they weren't there. The movie is visually stunning and the scenes outside during the winter and at the Quidditch World Cup and Triwisard tournament are gorgeous! The stadium scene at the Quidditch World Cup was very cool to watch and I was impressed. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely the saddest and the scariest of the 4. The scene where Lord voldemort rises to life in graveyard was really creepy, and when Cedric diggory is killed and his body is brought back to his crying and screaming father made me and most of the theater cry. I think the actors were really good in this film and really funny. The director, being English, added in a lot of British humour which helped pep the mostly creepy and sad movie up. The scene where Harry is in the bathtub and moaning mettle starts hitting on him was hilarious!<br/><br/>So all in all this movie rocked! It was funny, sad, creepy and entertaining all at the same time rounded off with a few cute teenager scenes. The original cast was great as usual and the newest members Mad-eye Moody, Rita Skeeter, Diggory, Krum and Fleur Delacour were all great. So if you're a Potter fan this movie will not disappoint you. It was the best so far and the next one will be hard to top! I definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!"

","Okak, I thought the movie was absolutely fantastic! Daniel Radcliff's acting was a lot better then it has been in the past, and the tension between Ron and Hermonie was great. The thing I didn't like was that they cut Dobby, Ludo bagman, And Ron's older brother's from the movie. I realize they had to shorten it for time purposes, but if they needed to make it 3 hours, then it should have been 3 hours. It was by far the best out of the four so far. I can't wait to see how they develop the characters in the fifth movie.<br/><br/>Even though I'd read the fourth book, I cried with Cedric died. He was nice to Harry, even though he was the opposing Hogwarts champion. Not to mention when Harry's parents were talking to him, through voldemorts Wand. It's a must see!!"
"Swimmervb2006","10","0","1","19 November 2005"," I loved it
","I thought the movie was excellent. Though i do wish they had added a few parts, which might have made it easier for people who haven't read the books understand it better. I loved the 3 tasks so much, I wish they made them longer. Also I think the maze should have included the Sphinx, or spider, but I still enjoyed it. The movie over all was excellent, it was a long book, and would be very difficult to sum it all up into a 2 1/2 hour long movie, and I do believe they did that fairly well. Overall it is the best of the 4 by far. The acting was definitely the best in this film. They really have come a long way, and now i can't wait until the next film. The soundtrack is amazing too."

","I'm going to try and be as objective as possible, yet still make my point...<br/><br/>I took my 12 and 10 year old daughters to see it with my brother in law and his kids. When I heard about the PG 13 rating, I almost changed my mind - I should have! My 10 year old came running to me from across the row, and curled up in my lap crying while I had to cover her eyes for near the last 30 minutes of the movie. Not just sorcery, but blatant sorcerer's violence, cutting, blood, and death! Scenes of extreme grief by family and friends, disturbing scary images...and the list goes on. I nearly cried when it was all over and apologized to my kids for putting them through this experience.<br/><br/>I'm not expecting every children's movie to be some kind of family picnic, but I am deeply disturbed at the direction kids movies are going for the sake of marketing and making a dollar.<br/><br/>The dialog was quiet at times and difficult to hear. The scenes were choppy and jumped from no particular direction to even more confusion. Granted, I know someone who has seen the previous 3 movies will have a better grasp on certain terms and happenings, but Potter shouldn't just cater to groupies. A stronger effort to incorporate new audiences would have made it better I'm sure.<br/><br/>I won't be so mean as to give it a 0 because of my bad experience, but I have reasons for my low rating. Will NEVER again see a Potter movie, or recommend one!"

","The movie was amazing! The actors really stepped up and delivered a performance worthy of the books. The movie compressed a lot of the action which made it so much more exhilarating to watch, it was very fast paced and entertaining. I think that Mike Newell did a very good job of presenting the Triwizard tournament, it was just as I pictured it! And the scene at the graveyard is taken completely out of the book, it was exactly as Rowling had described. Voldemort's return was especially gripping. His metamorphisis was bone-chilling, and altogether fantastic!!! Also, the Yule ball scene was adorable! To be quite frank, this movie was fantastic. For goodness sake, it made me cry. I was just glued to the screen. A fantastic job was done by everyone involved in this film. Unbelievable. Honestly, anyone even remotely interested in the Harry Potter series has to love this film. GOOD STUFF!!!"
"ju_ge","8","0","1","19 November 2005"," Enjoyed it, but slightly disappointed due to missing elements
","Enjoyed it, but slightly disappointed due to missing elements <br/><br/>I watched HP4 the other night and overall enjoyed this adaptation. I thought that the graphics and sound were excellent. The editing was a little choppy, bringing the thought of discontinuity to mind, especially if you haven't read the book. I think that there was just too much material to be put into one movie. <br/><br/>Kudos goes to Ron's character. Another reviewer mentioned that Rupert Grint's portrayal of Ron was dead on. I whole-heartedly agree with that statement. <br/><br/>And MadEye's introduction to the fourth year's Defense against the Dark Art's class was pretty good as well. I thought it followed the book close enough. It definitely got the message across that MadEye is a slightly demented but wickedly knowledgeable and powerful Auror.<br/><br/>---Spoiler stuff--- However, being a lover of the books, I was disappointed that the movie bypassed Harry's training in the defense of the dark arts. I thought Harry and Lupin's Bogart/Dementor training, in the HP3 movie adaptation, was well done. In HP4's movie adaptation, MadEye's training was totally skipped over. I think this was a significant miss, because it would show the uninitiated audience how Harry can actually overcome the imperius unforgivable curse. The movie misses again with failing to show Harry's strength when negating Voldemort's own imperius curse... and with Voldemort's death eater's witnessing this awesome defiance. Honestly, would it have taken that long to include these scenes? In the books, it's obvious that Harry gets stronger with every passing school year. You don't get that feeling in this movie. <br/><br/>...But again overall the movie was enjoyable."
"r3-1","10","0","1","19 November 2005"," All Hail the Darkest of Harry Potter Films ... yet
","Which really can't come a surprise to anyone who has read the books, given that they becomes darker and darker as well. And that this time it does get a bit more serious ... but I won't give the ending to the 2 people who has not read them.<br/><br/>This movie is one of those you have to see more than once, to completely take in all of the many impressions you are given throughout the film. It is quite clear, that they must have had a hard time cutting the film down to 2Â½ hours. if you ask me, sticking to the original idea of making 2 films out of the book would not have been a bad idea. But that does not mean the movie does not work. As a matter of fact I dare say that is is the best Harry Potter film so far. But as a warning to the 2 people I mentioned earlier, it is a good idea to discuss the start of the book with someone who has read it, as I imagine it could be rather difficult to understand everything with scenes shifting so fast without much explanations of the characters action. To everyone who has read the often mentioned book, should know that they have changed the story in a few places, but nothing of much significance.<br/><br/>Proceeding to the new actors, I am happy to say an over-all ""bravo"". Brian Gleeson as Alastor Mad-Eye Moody, Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, Pedja Bjelac as Igor Karkaroff and of course Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort all give outstanding performances. Yet again BRAVO! I could speak of them for hours. But I am not going to. Because if I don't try to limit myself this is going to be so long that no one will want to read it ... ever. On the bad side, I must say that David Tennant had a tendency to overplay his role. (what is that tongue thing!??) and Roger Lloyd-Pack had too small a role to really give his character the depth he had in the book, (though I am not sure whether or not the actor could give it) and neither is there to time to get under the skin of the other newcomers as f.ex. Fleur Delacour and Viktor Krum.<br/><br/>As a final point I must say that even though the movie is dark it has a lot of comic relief (more than the 3rd movie) given to us sometimes by the famous twins Fred and George Weasley. And notice the growth of the role of Neville Longbottom(!!!). Now I must go. Watch the movie."

","This is the best film in the series. It is the darkest yet because of the return of Lord Voldemort and therefore it is unsuitable for really young kids to see. However there is an all-star cast such as David Tennent, the new Doctor Who, and Miranda Richardson for the adults to enjoy.<br/><br/>I do feel though that that there are some portions in the book that could have been put into the film.

But what can you do when the original actor dies? The movies are getting progressively darker as do the books. There have been a lot of negative comments made by parents that don't like that trend. It has been said before, but I will say it again. THESE ARE NOT KIDS BOOKS/MOVIES. If you have read the books you would know that and not throw such a fit when your kids get freaked out at the theaters. Leave them at home!!

"kingtrio9","7","0","1","19 November 2005"," OK for the fans and non readers but directorial decisions may leave the avid fan a bit disappointed.
","In a word TERRIFIC as far as special effects go but in a word Disappointing in terms of direction. The best to date as far as big screen wow-wow and while that may leave the non-reader pleased the real fan may find the film lacking in certain areas. <br/><br/>There are lots of changes as is to be expected when a nearly 700 page novel is transformed into film, some secondary characters are even left out, however, for the most part the changes are sensitive to the book and in the spirit of the story. The real difficulties lie in the handling of certain characters, Dumbledore in particular and the pacing of certain scenes.<br/><br/>The acting has come a long way, improving as it does in every movie but Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe have reached a greater level of maturation as actors are giving us the ""real deal"" in this one. <br/><br/>Most of the new characters do an adequate job in support, particularly the adults (Mirand Richardson as Rita Skeeter stands out). Stanislav Ivaneski as Krum and Predrag Bjelac as Karkaroff bring life to their stock characters. Roger Lloyd Pack is good as Barty Crouch, more nervous and weird than in the book book but a lot of fun never the less. <br/><br/>However, Clemence Poesey is miscast as Fleur Delacour. While Poesy is a beautiful girl and fine actress she just does not generate the necessary heat for a part Veela who is supposed to be able to stop men in their tracks and cause them to act the fool with a bat of her lashes. Clemence seems a bit too serious an actress for this comic relief role. A young lady of talent but a bit more curvy and with a young Angelina Jolie type facial feature would have been a better choice.<br/><br/>The massive speculation as to ""What is Voldemort going to look like?"" is resolved and there is absolutely no room for disappointment here, his transformed self is PERFECT!!! Fiennes is brilliant and an inspired choice for the player. However, the pacing of the final scene and the blocking does not leave Fiennes much to work with, it is almost as if he is dancing about at times. The whole thing seems rushed. <br/><br/>To the writers credit the horror aspect is given fullest reign, more so than in any other movie and true to the book because JK is bringing the reader into a time of torture, murder and doubt with a villain that will go down in history with Dracula as one of the most evil of all time, brought to life in a classic set piece of terror. <br/><br/>Where the film runs into trouble is in the way certain characters are portrayed. As happens with so many projects, director Mike Newell seems more concerned with big screen bombast than showing a keen understanding of his material, especially the characters within. Which is rather glaring since characterization is Rowling's strongest aspect as a writer. <br/><br/>Nowhere is this more apparent than with Dumbledore. In the film, calm, controlled, wise and confident Dumbledore comes across as a shrill, panicky, cantankerous old fart which is a shame because Michael Gambon did a more than adequate job replacing Richard Harris (who is still, however, the better Dumbledore) in the third film. Therefore I feel it is the direction more than the actor that has to be blamed for the lack of a consistent Dumbledore performance in Goblet.<br/><br/>Frances De La Tour is OK as Madame Maxime although she is neither very comely or olive skinned as she is described in the book. Frances delivers a very motivated performance and things are fine until she eats the bug (or whatever it is) that she picks off the front of Hagrid's shirt. Hagrid and Madame Maxime are supposed to be misunderstood outsiders, not revolting freaks! The dealing with outsiders, their place in the world and their struggles to fit in is a main point of HP and to fall down in this area is something a good director/writer should strive to avoid when rendering this type of fiction for the screen.<br/><br/>And this tongue thing they had David Tennent doing as Barty Jr., what was up with that??? Yes, I get it that they needed a recognizable facial tick to provide a give away so that Barty Sr. can see through his son's disguise. But the snake tongue thing almost made me laugh. An eye gesture or any number of other things would have served the plot better. This father-son conflict is supposed to be tragic but came across as rather silly and was wholly underdeveloped.<br/><br/>One last thing and it is a small point but in a film where the special effects are particularly excellent for the most part it grated. What was the deal with the sleeping kids in the underwater scene??!!? Totally fake looking or what??!!? Next time Newell needs to pick out a better rubber dummy supplier. One really expected Harry to start stretching Ron or Hermione's face, jabbing Cho's cheeks or whatever. I am wondering if any of the actors had a good time punching these silly things between takes.<br/><br/>My daughter and myself are huge fans and have read the books many times and find the film a worth while experience. Our Mom/Wife has not read the books but thought the movie outstanding. Those who want to quibble about changes and cannot accept that to turn an hours long reading experience into a movie some things must change/go will be left out. Which is unfortunate because it is a worthy watch even with some of its more rankling aspects."

"kmartin-9","9","0","1","19 November 2005"," Exciting, Fun, Doesn't get bogged down
","I couldn't have been happier with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The director's decision to cut out the subplots and focus on the Tri-Wizard Tournament, the Ball, and the shocking ending was nothing short of brilliant. Because the book is widely accepted as the best so far of the Harry Potter books largely because of it's complexity, the temptation would be to make a movie that attempts to encompass each and every facet of book, resulting in an unfocused, bogged down, uninteresting movie. The director's decision to simply bypass potentially tedious scenes, such as the Quidich game at the beginning of the movie, helped make this movie's two-and-a-half hours fly by as quickly as the book's 734 pages did the first time I read it.

"simplex992000","8","0","1","19 November 2005"," Harry Potter for the MTV Generation
","Oh where to start...<br/><br/>First off, the movie is very very good. The special effects are outstanding and the actors, acting on the material given and the movie as presented, were all superb. I cannot think of a single 'clinker' person or someone you wish wasn't there at all.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they were taking a massive massive book (JKR suffering from the curse of the ever increasing book-sizes by this period of her authorship... thankfully gotten under control by her latest book, kudos to whatever experienced author took her under their wing). So, there's no way they could fit in every single character and every single trivial but arguably important reference in the books.<br/><br/>Hokay, those things said...<br/><br/>1. The title of my article here. Since they really really tried to get as much of the book in the movie as possible, no scene seems to go over a minute. Scenes flip by like a music video, shooting past you with little buildup and less denouement. As soon as you begin to observe, take in and digest a scene, its gone. My first phrase to my fiancée after the film was ""Harry Potter by Reader's Digest"" and that about sums it up. Its a very well made 2 1/2hr music video and I'll need to see it a couple of more times to be able to absorb all of what they tried to include in the film. Downsides? The flashed scenes that readers of the book will understand must have left the casual moviegoer who has not read any HP totally baffled. The scene where Harry discovers a dead body in the forest went by so fast and no one even seemed to acknowledge it, let alone were you ever told who did it (yes I do know, but you gotta read the book I guess) 2. Rita Skeeter. If they were going to chop her part up *that* much so the point that she was pointless in the film, she should have been left out altogether. Skeeter's subplot in the book, trying to destroy Harry through lies and being an animagus in secret, is basically a warm-up for the Nazi-like Umbridge in the next book. But, being that these elements are totally cut out and hardly addressed, there's no point in her character and her fleeting moments on-screen could have been used to lengthen other scenes.<br/><br/>3. Dumbledore. Well, I thought Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore in the third film was about as exciting as cold-dishwater. Its almost as if they got a famous stage actor and said ""oh, you're playing the head of a private school but..."" and he just went away with that and came back with a performance from snore-ville. In this installment, they tried to correct that. Gambon now is trying his best Gandalf and playing Dumbledore in a more energized and manic style. This has seemed to upset many people as I've seen claims that his accent is forced and fake (I don't know if it is) and that his temper with Harry is totally out-of-character. I welcome the changes as they got it through Gambon's head that Dumbledore is supposed to be a magician on the same lines as Merlin and Gandalf and not a boring half-dead principal and stereotypical head of a British private school. I think his major problem though is that Richard Harris nailed Dumbledore *perfectly* and he's got a hard act to follow.<br/><br/>In conclusion though, most of these problems I mention above are simply coming from the fact that they took an overlong book and tried to adapt it in film format. Any film is going to get panned for what it has to leave out. Its a very good film and very well made. I just wish that the 30 second scenes and little plot development within scenes didn't make me wish I just watched a music video or 2 1/2 hour commercial for an unfinished product."
"tippygee","8","0","1","19 November 2005"," Finally, they do it correctly
","The first tip-off that this may be the first adequate Harry Potter adaptation is that is rated PG-13. It says that there might be actual acknowledgment that there's scary stuff in here. Three murders, real evil, sexual innuendoall the grown-up stuff , or at least, grown-up to 14 stuff, is here.<br/><br/>First, off, I *love* the books. I will never think that making the movies prior to the seventh book being finished, but at least this one avoids most of the continuity problems which plagued movie 3. However, book 4 is an actual adaptation of the story, not some director's imposition of teenage-angst in lieu of being able to translate a mystery properly onto the screen.<br/><br/>The three mains do a passable job here, their best yet, although Dan still has a while to go before he'll be able to pull off strong emotion without looking like a fool, and his line to Hermione at the end should have been cut or reserved for someone with more subtlety. But he does a fair job, and gets a few good lines which he pulls off with aplomb--""How could anyone have possibly understood that?!"" Truly stealing every scene they appear in, however, are Fred and George. They do a hilarious job berating Ron, trying to cross the age line, and in general, just playing the hysterical, perfectly normal older brothers that J.K. Rowling wrote them as.<br/><br/>And, all told, the boy-girl thing is done eighty times better than in any movie previously. Partly because they're older and can pull it off better, and partly because the direction and script allow them to act normally for their age. Particularly touching and funny is Neville, who gets some wonderful scenes around the Yule Ball, but Harry gets some good moments talking to Cho Chang, and the script uses many a clever double-entendre to play the humor of various situations.<br/><br/>But by far the most astounding performance is given by Ralph Fiennes, who's Voldemort, in the New York Times, was described as ""the best on-screen performance ever delivered without a nose."" He's scary, he's ugly, he's pure evil. And he's well done. The only bad thing about his performance is it's lack of length--but he'll get some great scenes in five and six, and they are to be anticipated.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Gary Oldman gets the short shrift in this film, although Sirius' character was a reasonable cut to make, along with the house-elves, and given the amazing amount of plot that had to be cut out to turn a 750 page book into a 2.5 hour movie, the cuts that were made were smart, and the alterations to the plot were both minor and believable in the context of the adaptation.<br/><br/>Overall, a slight minus for the still not so great acting from Dan Radcliffe and Emma Watson, and the lack of Oldman and enough of Fiennes, but wholly, a good movie, and at long last, a movie adaptation that preserves both the magic and the mystery of Harry Potter."

The parts of the book that they kept (ex. that there were three tasks, parts of the Yule Ball, etc.) they stayed pretty true. However, they completely kept out Hagrid's giantess mother, the veelas, and the obstacles in the third task. I think that the movie was good, though, because it displayed the main points of the book, and could stand alone as a movie. It gave the viewer the general plot and was well done. I also liked how it hinted at some parts of the plot in books 5 and 6. Also- the graveyard scene was AMAZING. It truly couldn't have been done better."
"MyDearPrudence","10","0","1","19 November 2005"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Dark, Captivating and Absolutely Magnificent
","This is the article I wrote for my university's newspaper after seeing the film.<br/><br/>Sex, scandal, ruthless battles, violence, blood rituals, torture, dismemberment and murder. Yes, I am talking about the fourth installment in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, based on the best-selling book series by J.K. Rowling. The film opened November 18th with the series' first ever, and well deserved, PG-13 rating. Harry has officially grown up.<br/><br/>The role of Harry Potter is reprised by Daniel Radcliffe, with Rupert Grint returning as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione. The remainder of the cast that has been in the previous three films remains the same, with the exception of Michael Gambon reprising the role of Dumbledore, which was originally held in the first two films by the late Richard Harris. The main newcomers to the cast are Miranda Richardson as the manipulative journalist Rita Skeeter, Robert Pattinson as the Hogwat's Golden Boy Cedric Diggory and Ralph Fiennes as the infamous Voldemort.<br/><br/>As it now seems to be customary, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is helmed by a new director, Mike Newell, best known for the film Four Weddings and a Funeral, and is the series' first British director.<br/><br/>The plot of the forth film varies significantly from it's predecessors, as this is not an ordinary school year. This year, Hogwart's hosts the prestigious Triwizard Tournament, where a student from Hogwarts, as well as two students from other wizarding schools, competes to be champion and win ""eternal glory."" The tournament is not to be taken lightly, as it involves three grand and fatally dangerous tasks and spans the entire the school year. The Goblet of Fire chooses the contenders from each school, and trouble begins when the three proper contenders are chosen, and suddenly Harry is chosen by the Goblet to compete as well, even though he never entered his name.<br/><br/>For those of you that are fans of the books as well, you should know that the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is far too long to include everything. Many sections are either rushed through or completely cut out of the film, but nothing of great importance to the main plot. If they were to include everything, you would be watching a film that's twice as long as The Lord of the Rings: Extended Edition, so be thankful.<br/><br/>This is by far the best Harry Potter film of the series and one of the best films of the year. Every aspect of the Harry Potter world has grown, from the spectacular CGI work that would rival George Lucas to how much the three primary actors have grown in their ability to actually act well.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire is quick in pace, never leaving a dull moment and always drawing you in. Watching this film, I was so engrossed in the Harry Potter world that I actually didn't tell off the yammering little twits behind me, because they simply disappeared into the unimportant background.<br/><br/>A great deal has been made of how dark the film is, but in actuality, the dark elements are mostly confined to one specific section. The bulk of Goblet of Fire is filled with intensity, apprehension and of course humour, which has also gotten considerably better in this film.<br/><br/>As for that specific dark section I mentioned, it is very dark, very intense and very emotional. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that while watching this section, I don't think I even blinked at the risk of missing a fraction of a second. And I'm not one that is easily swayed to tears at even the sappiest of films, but I almost did in this instance, solely due to its power.<br/><br/>My only criticism would have to be what I said was a good thing earlier. The film seemed a little rushed and this is due to Newell's determination to keep the Goblet of Fire at exactly two and a half hours. But, we're all pretty much grown up now and I think we can handle three hours. Hell, if Peter Jackson can do it, so can we.<br/><br/>If you take anything away from this review, it should be this: You don't have to be a fan to watch this film. You don't have to have read the books. You don't even have to see the first three. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has universal appeal and I urge you to give it chance."
"whistlestop","9","0","1","19 November 2005"," Dark and excellent
","It's just not possible folks to put the WHOLE book into ONE film, so lay off the gripes about what was cut etc. This is great - the essential elements are all there, unlike POA which left out a VITAL element, i.e. the identities of Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail and Prongs (although interestingly Pettigrew is happily referred to as ""Wormtail"" in this film). The film is really dark, and scary, and moved us to tears at the end. What more could we hope for? Voldemort is the stuff of nightmares - I'm glad my kids aren't small any more, we would have taken them and regretted it. As it was, we all enjoyed it A LOT and recommend it to Potter fans and non-fans alike. I want to see it again soon."
"pyrocitor","8","0","1","19 November 2005"," They FINALLY got it right!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire <br/><br/>After being disappointed each year by increasingly unsatisfying movie interpretations of the Harry Potter books (I found 2004's 'Prisoner of Azkaban' to be the worst of the lot) I think it's fair to say that my expectations for the fourth movie were not very high. Actually, to be honest, I didn't really intend to see it at all. But thankfully, miraculously, the movie defied my expectations and ended up surpassing the first three movies by far - easily the best Potter movie to date! <br/><br/>Safely put, if you were disappointed by the earlier films, as I was, 'Goblet of Fire' should easily live up to your expectations, if not exceed them. This seems to be the best work to date of director Mike Newell (whose previous credentials included such films as 'Mona Lisa Smile' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral') and the principal kids are beginning to grow up a bit, showing that they are actually capable of genuine drama, especially Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, though Daniel Radcliffe as the title character also manages to impress. The general overall sense of quality in the movie has been greatly augmented from those of the past.<br/><br/>But the main highlight, I would say, is despite the fact that huge sections of the book have been lopped off, the movie still seems very true to the book, and still manages to remain tense and engaging the whole way through, seeming much shorter than its almost 3 hour running time. Unlike the first three movies, which always seemed full of plot holes and missing parts, and like they were in a frenzied hurry just to get to the finish, 'Goblet' is fast-paced, but never feels rushed, and certainly doesn't skimp on the action setpieces. There's the (sadly short but still exhilarating) Quidditch world cup, the attack of the Death Eaters, Harry battling a giant dragon, swimming through Hogwarts lake, fighting off Mer-people, and the final engaging confrontation in the graveyard (not to mention the awkward hilarity of the Yule Ball, Ron's frilly dress robes and all). Let's say you certainly won't leave the theater feeling you haven't earned your money's worth. <br/><br/>Newell also manages to extract very satisfying performances from his cast, the standout here being newcomer Brendan Gleeson as gruff, demented yet lovable Professor Mad-Eye Moody, managing to overcome his ridiculous looking eye patch and deliver the film's most enjoyable performances (though Ralph Fiennes is flat out terrifying as the long-awaited Lord Voldemort). All returning cast and crew are great, and some characters such as Neville Longbottom and Professor McGonagall are given a quantity of screen time they've been denied for quite a while, while Fred and George Weasley, as always, raise all the laughs that Moody doesn't. Safe to say, the kids have grown up enough to have learned how to actually act with conviction, and the adults seem to be racing to stay up to par. Performances are quite satisfying as a whole, and manage to stay highly faithful to the book.<br/><br/>So overall, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire clearly surpasses the previous three movies in terms of quality, faithfulness to the source material and overall enjoyment factor. The last of the 'fun' Potter movies before the series gets increasingly dour (certainly the last where Harry is likely to excitedly exclaim ""I love magic!""), this is the first I have felt genuinely satisfied with, and clearly the best of the bunch so far. But don't take my word for it - see it yourself. Safe to say, you will almost certainly not be disappointed.<br/><br/>-8/10"
"pmedina-1","8","0","1","19 November 2005"," The best of the series!!!
","From beginning to end, I felt that the production team did an excellent job. It was all almost exactly as I imagined it when I read the book. From the beginning when Voldemort murders Frank, I felt immersed in the story all over again, as I did when I first read the book.<br/><br/>The actors feel more natural in their acting, and we finally get to see Fred and George's crazy personalities. I also loved that they included the part when Fred asks Angelina to go to the ball with him in a very comical way. And the part where they put their names in the Goblet and are thrown away by the Age line.<br/><br/>Neville is beginning to take more importance in the movies, which is significant in the fifth book. I loved the way they put him as being really enthusiastic about the Ball, dancing alone around the room. Also, because Dobby is missing from the movie, it is Neville who tells Harry about the Gillyweed for the second task. I loved when he says: ""I killed Harry Potter!"" The Yule Ball is amazing, and the Weird Sisters are cool!!! I loved the shot when everybody's dancing except for Harry, Ron and their dates. It was very funny.<br/><br/>The underwater scenes are brilliant!!!! The bodies of the people they took from the champions look ghastly, as JK Rowling descibes them in the book. And Krums transfiguration from a shark to his self is perfect. I kinda expected the bubbles used by Cedric and Fleur to be around the whole head, not just the mouth and nose part, but it was great anyway.<br/><br/>The graveyard scene was one of the best scary scenes I've seen on a movie. Voldemort's rebirth was incredible, just as I imagined it, although the eyes should have been red. Cedric's death is very sad. When the wands connect and Cedric, Frank and Lily and James come out of the beams is a really touching scene, especially when Cedric asks Harry to take his body back to his father. When Harry returns to school with Cedric's body, everyone cheers but then realize that Cedric is dead and scream and Harry does not want to let go of the body, just as in the book. It's a great sequence.<br/><br/>The only glitch I found was that the part when Dumbledore and Fudge have a Parting of the Ways, because Fudge is reluctant to believe that Voldemort is back. This is very important in the plot of the fifth book/movie, given that Dumbledore is discredited by the Ministry and is seen as a lier and a disturber of the peace. But I think the next movie can take it from there and include it in the opening scenes.<br/><br/>Also Hermione's SPEW campaign and her plans to get Rita Skeeter was missing, as well as Dobby. But these are minor themes to the plot of that particular book. Although the Rita Skeeter part will have significance in the fifth movie.<br/><br/>In general, I think this is the best film of the series. It has everything: suspense, romance, action, and, of course, magic."
"Merenbootygirl","8","0","1","19 November 2005"," Let's be reasonable
","I watched the 12 a.m. showing of this movie as well. Unlike many other fans, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have read all Harry Potter books more than once, so am very familiar with the series. Yes, I do feel, like others, that the beginning of the movie moved pretty quickly in comparison to the novel. However, what can we really expect? I felt the director did a good job in displaying integral parts. The emphasis of the movie was placed on the most important themes: the maturing of the characters, and the full emergence of Voldermort. The director did an excellent job in capturing the awkward feelings of teenagers in that age, and the end seen was played out exactly how I imagined it. He achieved the task of leaving that eerie feeling looming for the audience to wonder ""what will happen next"". As Hermione says, ""Everything is going to change now, isn't it"". (This not being a spoiler as the line is in the trailer) Only thing: I believe too much emphasis was directed to a certain character that should not have been suspected at all in the movie. Yes, there were many enjoyable details left out that us readers may have liked to see play out. Fortunately, Rowling has a talent of writing incredibly intricate books. There is no way they would have been able to create a movie that would do the novel justice in 2 1/2 hours time. I believe the director made good choices in the cutting of the novel. If you enjoy the movies and have not read the books...I can definitely say: YOU'RE MISSING OUT! However, for the audience members who are simply looking for good magical fun..they will definitely get that from watching any of the Harry Potter movies. The basic themes are displayed..and the movies are cohesive enough for non-readers to understand the main plot. The graphics are amazing, the cinematography incredible, and the whole movie completely entertaining and enjoyable from the beginning to the end. I definitely recommend this movie...but it may not be for the small ones due to some dark themes. Enjoy!"

","This movie was much better than I expected considering the last three movies. The acting was a lot better than the previous ones. I was especially impressed with Emma Watson whose performance is starting to mature with the character.<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie were awesome. The best I have seen since the Lord of the Rings series and they were very imaginative. The best special effects were ,in my opion the best, was the scene with the merpeople.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the book so I was a little disappointed with what they cut out. They left out Ludo Bagman and left out the Weasley Wizard Wheezez and a lot more. They also got Dumbledores character completely wrong which disappointed me a little better. Over all this movie was a great film considering how long the book is and how difficult it must have been to adapt the 700 page book to screen.<br/><br/>This movie is in my opinion a very light PG-13 movie"

","i was pleasantly surprised by this film. it was as my teacher rarely says to me ' exceeded my expectations'<br/><br/>the best part of this film is that the director of the film was able to get the audience in the mood for the scenes for example when after they have chosen the dragons to face you can almost feel there fear. you can almost know that they are afraid but they have to keep going.<br/><br/>one of my friend that was wacthing the movie with me said 'they skipped too much 7/10' this made me very mad at him because he really doesn't know a thing about movies or/and reviewing movies, secondly if there was all those scenes it would be like 4 hours long, first of all 4 hours is Waaaaaaaay tooooo loooooonnnng, two and a half hours is pretty long for a kids movie. even though i like this movie its still a kids movie and kids cant stay in one place for a long time.<br/><br/>so why didn't i put up a 10/10 well you see it was a very good movie but still only a very good movie and if i did put a 10/10 that would mean this is my favorite movie. nope overall pretty much every scenes wasn't he best, but was very good and thats what 9/10 means."

Ron is definitely best in this movie, I just love the irony in him. Harry has a great deal of sarcasm in this one which i find very amusing. Hermione is... well she... She's Hermione!

","A group of friends and i went to see the new Harry Potter dressed up - as we're all good fans. We were amazed but slightly disappointed. They missed out like half the book but the effects were amazing. My friends and i were reviewing it all the way through - we even got a few ""SHH""'s & ""Be Quiet""'s . We weren't even talking that loud! The cause of discussion was how Dan can't act & disagreement with the script. Anyway, on the bright side, we enjoyed watching Dan scrawling in pain - we were saying that that's about the best acting you get from him. Overall though, it's a good film and part of the sequel so you need to watch it. Look out for the amazing effects, no classes and remember kids, Always go to the toilet before a film!"
"swordplay227","8","0","1","19 November 2005"," Best Potter yet... by far
","This is definitely, by far, the best Harry Potter movie yet. It was my favorite book as well. It definitely wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was pretty good, and the special effects were amazing. If you love Harry Potter, (and even if you don't) come to see this movie. It was surprisingly funny at times. It also followed the book surprisingly well. Not as well as some may like, but as much as they could do to fit a 734 page book into a two and a half hour movie, and better than any other Harry Potter yet. This movie I give Eight out of Ten stars (as you see above) because this definitely wasn't the best directed movie of the year. There were flaws at times. So if you want to go see a movie, you'd probably choose this one anyway, but let me back you up in saying that it is a good eight dollars to spend."
"stacielynnbaker","7","0","1","19 November 2005"," Disappointed is my general feeling, but there are some real charms in the movie!
","First, I will say that I am indeed a fan of the books (almost to obsession) and of course, that will taint anyone's view of a movie. Stories written for books just don't translate to the screen in the same way, but that doesn't make the movie bad, just different.<br/><br/>It would have been a challenge to anyone to get everything in the book onto the screen. There is just A WHOLE LOT going on in this story (and I'm sure we will have the same problem with the remaining films).<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that the movie seemed to just jump from one thing to another without any explanation as to why it was there. I would guess that if you haven't read the book, you might be thinking ""what on earth is going on?"" However, if you haven't read the book, you might also be blessed with not knowing what is missing.<br/><br/>The scenery in the movie was beautiful! And the ""randy"" Moaning Myrtle was hysterical. The effect of Fleur on Ron, was also fantastic! The dragons were amazing and I was VERY impressed with Harry's gilleyweed transformation.<br/><br/>Then there is Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes was fantastic! The make-up was perfect. He looked snake-like, he was grandiose, and scary. The entire scene in the graveyard was wonderful. Almost exactly as I had pictured it from reading the book. It was spooky and true to J.K. Rowling's version! I felt like the Director did a great job with being true to the book in this movie, he just had so much to work with that he couldn't put it all in. He did a bad job with transitioning between the things that he decided to include (a really bad job).<br/><br/>All in all, I was disappointed. However, I was worried how it would all go into the movie, so I'm not surprised that it didn't go well. I can complain, but I have no idea how to ""fix"" it. Visually, the movie was beautiful. Still worth seeing, just go in with a reduced expectation and you won't be disappointed!"

","Having read the books and seeing the first three movies, I was very curious to see how they were going to interpret this book to film. I went to the midnight showing of this movie (of course) and I must say, I loved it. There are always going to be people who pick apart the movies for the bad points, and never actually look at the movie for the good. These ""bad points"" should not detour anyone from seeing this movie, as it is an exceptionally great movie. I was surprised with some of the plot twists that were not in the book, but it all fit. Yes, there were things from the book that weren't portrayed on film, but that is to be expected. This movie covered the important plot points from the book, it was exciting, it was funny, it was superb. I highly recommend seeing this film, this is by far the best Harry Potter movie to date."

","Way to short. Would have been excellent if more of story could have been added,as a fan I would have rather seen a longer movie or even a second installment. The actors were good Emma Watson did well. Grint was wonderful as Ron, Dan was not as good of an actor in this one as he was in PoA. This movie would have been my favorite if it had just been long enough. The visuals were stunning, but I also missed a lot of the magical settings of the first three movies. It was darker by far but much less magical.I missed the fantasy magic of the other movies, and the pace was so fast it was like they were racing to the end. The story was so stuffed, trying to get every thing in that it was at times difficult to savor."

","I just seen this movie yesterday, November 18. My mother and I were extremely excited, being the fans we are. As soon as we walked in, we saw that there were so many little kids there! Now, on my opinion, it's ridiculous that parents actually let little kids go in there. They never shut up, they don't sit still, and they barely have any clue what they're watching! PG-13 means watch out for Children Under 13, NOT 3. The movie? Incredible. It is no doubt the best Harry Potter movie yet.<br/><br/>I mean, the emotion, suspense, romance, humor, you name it! It is all in there. They just get right to the chase as the film goes on, and that's very good indeed. I got so caught up in it I barely blinked. With the humor, I actually laughed a whole lot and it is very rare for me to do that in a movie theater! Normally I would just smile or grin and not giggle aloud. <br/><br/>Believe me, if you are a Harry Potter fan, you must see this movie as soon as you can. I think it's very much worth going to see. The director? I worship him. He was just fantastic as he played the story and everything was just fabulous and I can't wait to go back and see it again. It deserves more than 10 stars.

The special effects are exceptional and the Tri-Wizard Tournament is cool. It is a very dark movie however, but if you like fantasy with a little joke now and then I would go see it. When Lord Voldemort appears he is pretty ghastly but I don't think the movie portrayed him as bad as what the book did. I expected him to be a little more evil. Hermoine is very beautiful especially at the ball. The dancing ladies that come from Beaxbatons are a marvel and their beauty is exceptional. I thought that they could have done a better job with the World Qudditch match as well. All in all this Harry Potter movie is superb and will be a delight for your senses."

I also felt that the acting of the 3 has improved miles- harry's crying scene in 4 beats the 1 in 3 hands down. As a Brit, i feel that the film benefited from having an English director. More than any of the others in the harry potter franchise, the school atmosphere was taken into account-especially in the Fred and George fight-""fight!fight!fight!"" scene.

","I saw Goblet of Fire at midnight last night/this morning dressed in full slytherin garb, and between all of my firends there at the theater, we waited a collective 9 hours, from 3 in the afternoon until the movie showed. and believe me, it was worth the wait! if i'd known even 1/8 of what was to occur during the movie, i would have waited more. Goblet of Fire has been the BEST adaptation of the Harry Potter series so far. Ralph Fiennes played a perfect Voldemort (and who better to cast than the Nazi, Amon Goeth, from Schindler's List?). all the new actors portrayed their characters wonderfully, and all the old faces, as well. it seemed in this film that many of the characters were given far more personality than in the past three, and the three main actors, dan radcliffe, rupert grint, and emma watson, have truly come into their own in this film. this time i cannot say ""oh, they could have played that scene SO much better,"" because this time around they really nailed it. <br/><br/>then there is the actual portrayal of the story itself. this new crew did an incredible job. yes, a lot of things were left out. yes, a lot of things were changed. yes, a lot of things were added. but how much does that really matter? last night, whilst watching the movie, i was on the edge of my seat. for the ENTIRE last 1/2 an hour of the movie i and my best friend beside me were gasping and clinging to each other, entirely wrapped up and in tears over the movie.<br/><br/>i am a huge advocate for the books, and have read them many, many times through, and i can say that when it comes down to it, although much of the events in the book were removed, the basic point of the story, the most important emotions and events, were present, and they were REALLY present. Goblet of Fire the movie got across in 2 1/2 what Goblet of Fire the book took 734 pages to describe.<br/><br/>this is a DEFINITE MUST SEE. my friends and i have already made plans to see it together at least 2 more times (at least once on Imax because it really is a wonderful Imax movie), and you should plan to see it at least once."

"robinbalmer","6","0","1","17 November 2005"," Terrifying, heartbreaking, and amusing, but a bit of a let down
","I recently was able to attend a screening, and after the first few sequences I knew Mike Newell and the screenwriter had messed it up. I know it would be impossible to preserve all the greatness of the thick book into one movie, but from the beginning the biggest problem is clear - they cut many things that they should not have, and greatly embellished scenes that did not need them.<br/><br/>The editing in the first few sequences blatantly says ""Let's get this over with as quickly as possible so we can fit the rest of the film in,"" with shots that are only a few seconds in length and choppy cuts. Amazingly, not even a round of the Quidditch World Cup is shown, it cuts straight from the opening of the game to after the game, with little mention of who won. If they'd cut even 30 or 40 seconds from the first trial, which drags on and on with ridiculous added scenes, they could have put in a little quidditch and given the other first scenes some more breathing room. Mike Newell also adds some ridiculously cheesy shots of overboiling tea kettles, and rain falling of stained glass like tears, trying to be symbolic but just ending up looking stupid.<br/><br/>It seems that either Mike Newell or the costumers just did not understand the Harry Potter universe that well. The Yule Ball was a mass of muggle clothing, complete with cheap-looking prom dresses.<br/><br/>The bathtub scene is somewhat appalling in the way it is sexualized. I'm sure they were trying to be funny, but it came off as completely sick. That scene may lead to some uncomfortable questions from small children seeing the film.<br/><br/>All that being said, there was quite a lot done well. The death eaters are terrifying, the sad parts are tragic and moving. The second trial is executed perfectly. Some of the added writing with the students is quite good and funny, and David Radcliffe and Rupert Grint have matured greatly as actors, and they help carry the film through some of its low points. Emma Watson also does well, but the writer and director make her more sad and whiny than indignant, which weakens her character. Most of the other characters don't get much screen time at all, which also could have been aided by cutting some of the needlessly long scenes to make room for more content.<br/><br/>I suppose all our hopes were raised when Alfonso Curon did such great work with the last one. This merely good sequel ends up coming off as a disappointment."

","Spoilers lurk below . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . s p o i l e r s<br/><br/>Hmm, saw a sneak preview the day before wide release. Overall it was okay, but some of the decisions made to trim the fat may have lasting impact. In a nutshell the modifications are: Fudge does not have Crouch Jr killed at the end. Problematic since the entire next book details a cover-up that Barties death allows. There was no prize given for winning the tournament, hence, no galleons for the Weasley twins, hence, no Weasley Wizarding Wheezes. Rita Skeeter is only represented as a semi-lecherous reporter. No paparazzi. No animagus. No tension. Dumbledore just doesn't seem like a powerful wizard. More like an absentminded professor. As seen in the pensieve, the accused in a wizard trial is caged in what appears to be an iron maiden of some sort. Weren't devices like these used on witches in our own timeline? Why wouldn't the chair with animated chains work here? Voldemort waxes poetic about love. No, really. The Dark Lord just seemed more like a bad guy from a Clint Eastwood movie and less like the vacant evil shell he was. Grint's acting is getting worse. I really wanted to see a blast-ended skrewt. The maze is missing its monsters. You don't see the Quiditch world cup, just the opening ceremony.<br/><br/>I think the film is really just a series of favorite scenes from the book. I never felt connected, because the development kept getting interrupted and the pacing was awkward."

","I saw the movie at 9:30 on the day it came out with my friends and I have to say, yes it was a good movie but I was a little disappointed, the plot was basically the same but much more of it has changed than it has in the previous 3 movies. Whether this is because of the change of director or the length of the film i don't no! It is still an excellent film, don't get me wrong, but I expected so much more of it! The ending was very powerful, I was in floods of tears but the beginning, I felt never really excited me. If you haven't read the book I strongly do not suggest you see it as I know 3 people who haven't that could not follow the film at all! Over all an excellent film but it could have been so much better!"

","I went to the cinema with great expectations. I was so happy that finally the long waiting was over, I sat down in that big, cuddly cinema chair and was curious about to start it. After I had to bore 45 min of advertisement the movie started. The first impression was really good - the snake, which sidles through the graveyard, Harry's dream of the old man, who dies in the Riddel's house by the curse of Voldemort. But than Harry wakes up at the Weasleys burrow, one minute later he is at the Quidditch tournament and 3 minutes later it is already over. In one moment they celebrate the win of Ireland over Bulgaria, in the next Harry lies on the ground and watches at the dark mark (?? don't how it's named in English?? - dark mark sounds kind of funny). And soon he is on the train to Hogwarts. The beginning of the film seems a bit snatchy. Everything is only shortly named and shown. But with the beginning of the triwizard tournament, the movie gets started. The single tasks are really good display. The computer animations are good. The fight against the dragon is exciting, the mermaids are ugly and the maze had a touch of creepy. I waited for wicked and bad creatures, but this task was also a bit too much shortened. The middle of the movie is very very funny. Look out for Filch and Neville. The end is again really good displayed and all in all it's a short but nice adaptation of the book and the best Potter-Movie so far, especially because of the humor. <br/><br/>(the actors are their bests, but the German synchronization is never as good as the original)"
"yummyballerina","9","0","1","19 November 2005"," Pros and Cons of Goblet
","As many Harry Potter fans do, I have mixed feelings about Mike Newell's 'The Gobelt of Fire'. I will therefore list my view on the pros and cons; _Pros *Neville's character was enhanced in this film by some brilliant acting from Matthew Lewis; we see some real depth from his character that I thought wouldn't be shown until the fifth installment. *Daniel Radcliffe's performance; anyone who ever doubted this guy's acting range and crying abilities will be blown away...very blown away. The scene where Harry is crying over Cedric's dead body is done incredibly well, a strong improvement from Harry's infamous crying scene in 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. Radcliffe is no longer the reactive, wide-eyed kid we knew; he now IS Harry Potter. *Rupert Grint's acting abilities were strengthened in this one as well; he gives a lot of depth to Ron in the scenes where Ron is jealous and angry at Harry. he proves that he can be funny as well as dramatic. *The fact that the characters really are all teenagers; and still in awe of the fantastic wizarding world. *Brendon Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody-he's a scene stealer. He totally owned the role, and gave a wonderful rich portrayal, making the transition from 'Mad Eye' to Barty Crouch Jr. very smooth. *The special effects were much better than I expected; they will NOT fail to impress. The Quidditch World Cup, the dragon scene, the second task were all stunning eye candy. *The leaving out of potentially awkward scenes, such as S.P.E.W and Winky. I personally thought that the earlier Dobby scenes and other creature scenes such as the Biting Books were awkward and distracting. This film was more mature and focused. *This movie does lack the artistic rich tone and style that Alfonso Cuaron brought to 'Azkaban'. However, I still think that 'Goblet' is the best film yet. -The Cons *This film feels incredibly rushed, even to readers of the books such as myself. It could have been handled more smoothly I think. *Characters like Frank and Cedric were undermined and watered-down. You end up having no sympathy for either character when they are killed, especially Cedric. Instead of the polite; humble gentleman that the book Cedric is, the movie Cedric is cocky and shallow. His character is hardly shown with Harry or Cho, leaving a hollow awkward feeling when he dies. There is no touching on the tension between him and Harry about their struggle for Cho and the Triwizard Cup, yet their strange bond. Their relationship was portrayed disappointingly, saved only by Radcliffe's magnificent crying scene. *Emma Watson's acting. I think she's putting too much of herself in this role. There is too much snorting before and after her lines, and when she reacts she gets an glare. Too much over-acting here. In 'Prisoner' she did a fair job, but I have yet to see her act to the standards she did in 'Sorceror's Stone'. Hermione's character was saved only by the Yule Ball scenes and the Avada Kedavra classroom scene. *Too much Harry/Hermione and not enough Harry/Ron. While we all acknowledge Radcliffe's and Watson's chemistry, it is important to remember that Harry and Ron's relationship is so much stronger than that portrayed in the films, which is a shame. *Finally, those classic bits which all Potter fans wanted in that got out, such as the Weasleys/Dursleys, Rita Skeeter as a beetle, the weighing of the wands, and the explanation of the Veela.<br/><br/>Despite all the cons, 'Goblet' is a highly entertaining film and is not likely to disappoint even the most hardcore Potter fans. It's well-worth seeing in the theater, and in my opinion is the best one yet!"

","Hi. Just forget anything you've read that say bad about the film. Its great. There's something for everyone. Even the people i went with are not harry potter fans but they all enjoyed it. The tri wizard tournament tasks are really well put together and action packed. Its incredibly entertaining. The movie is also the funniest and balances the very dark from the hilarious. However it can seem a bit drawn out at times but the amazing feel of the film makes you not even notice it. The Voldemort scene at the end is one of the greatest cinema scenes i have ever seen . It will blow you away. Emma Watson Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe all have grown exceptionnaly well in their acting skill. ALso Fred George Neville and Ginny finally have some decent screen time. The new additions to the cast are also great. Madame Maxime Fleur Krum and Cedric are great. However Crouch seemed out of character. I was also disappointed with the lack of playtime at the Quidditch match. The dragon task was probably the best but the lake is close behind it. I wish there were some monsters in the maze but there wasn't. Its an amazing movie that Will make you laugh cry gasp scream and cheer. Th best one yet."

","I watched the midnight showing, after a hard day of school and work, and STILL, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire managed to keep me awake and alert, even up until 2:30 in the morning. It was exciting, entertaining and enthralling in almost all its moments.<br/><br/>The movie began at a very quick pace, so quick that if I hadn't read the book, I doubt I'd be able to follow what was happening. However, what really struck me was the visual imagery of the movie. It was absolutely gorgeous and the extent that it had been taken to was VERY impressive. The Quidditch Cup, for example, was so much more than I expected and all the scenes were so vivid.<br/><br/>I expected a scary movie, since it had a PG-13 rating. However, there was plenty of humor to go around. I loved so many of the hilarious scenes, and (trust me) there were a lot of them. In fact, I found myself thinking that the ""comedy"" portions may have outweighed the ""action"" and ""romance"" portions of the movie combined.<br/><br/>Cut scenes. There were many, but most were definitely not necessary. I believe a good decision was made. I think there could have been more about certain topics that were touched upon (Hagrid/Giant Story, Rita Skeeter, Barty Crouch, Hermione/Krum) but it didn't seem like there were big gaps that had been cut out.<br/><br/>Acting. Very impressive, the actors have definitely grown and matured into talented, young adults. I found myself admiring how they had turned into such good-looking, controlled actors. Daniel Radcliffe, in particular, performed fantastically; I now am certain that he can carry the weight of being Harry Potter, and do it well. Fleur, Krum, Cedric, Fred, George, Ginny, Neville, Ron and Hermione also had very memorable roles. The ""kids"" really shone in this movie, and appeared in the majority of it.<br/><br/>The only disappointment was the actual scariness of the movie itself. I expected very dark scenes from a PG-13 Harry Potter, but I'd say the most intense scene was probably when they were in the maze. The graveyard scene was less intense and haunting than I had hoped, and casting a fairly well-known actor as Voldemort may not have been the best choice. He did wonderfully, except that I sometimes only saw Fiennes, the actor, because he was so recognizable. It made his character less intimidating and scary than he could have been.<br/><br/>Scenes to remember: When Harry returns to Hogwarts with Cedric, and Amos Diggory comes down to the field. I loved Hermione's scenes; she played them really well especially those with Harry and that one Yule Ball scene with Ron. The Yule Ball scenes were very beautiful, and I'm glad Hermione got that shining walk-down-the-stairs moment.<br/><br/>Overall, regardless of the flaws pointed out, I think the movie was as strong as ever in the HP Series and look forward to the next ones. I DEFINITELY recommend that you see if, if you haven't already. If you have, see it again. I know I will."

","I have been looking forward with the new chapter of the series with much anticipation, and though Mike Newell is one of my favorite British directors, I was rather anxious. My opinion now is that he should take the series all the way to the end because he has done a formidable job conjuring all the types of magic to make this great film.<br/><br/>There is much to praise in this film: From the lead teenagers to the entire sporting cast, all of whom are at the turning point of the Harry Potter storyline. Now, their lives will never be the same, as they grow up and most confront the fears within themselves, and the most terrifying villain in the movies in the last decade. Ralph Fiennes brings to life a rather repulsive and malevolent creation that instills fear in both its prey and the audience. He fascinates as he destroys. From its original mention in Book I, we have been waiting to see who is the mastermind behind the attacks to Harry, and now we're face to face with a character few people would like to have an argument with. The fifteen minutes or so Harry and Voldemort share the screen are disturbing and wonderful, full of emotions that give depth to the stories but were neglected in the first two films, and barely stirred in ""Azkaban"". <br/><br/>Things are indeed changing, and there is no turning back. There is some humor in the film, and the characterizations are much better than before. Our heroes have grown, the vistas have grown richer, the music more sublime, and just like everything else both the forces of good and evil are stronger and getting ready for the final battle. There is still much energy and story left, and if the directors keep the pace, we will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>There is so much to like in the film:<br/><br/><ul><li>The World Cup of Quidditch (fantastic) - Hermoine's and Ron's exchanges - The Cemetery Scene - The Tournament's Three Challenges...</li></ul><br/><br/>As I mentioned before, I could talk about it for a while, and I couldn't do it justice. Thank you J.K. Rowling for your amazing creations, and we're much indebted to you, Mr. Newell for finally capturing the spirit of Potter and sharing with us. It's indeed a treat!"

Although certain story lines were eliminated or condensed for time reasons, the most important issues where still touched on and the main themes from the book were very present. The entire cast has matured as actors, just as the characters and storyline is maturing. On top of all of that, the movie was visually stunning.

","The first two Harry Potters sucked. They felt like stage plays from a school. Prisonerof Azkaban was a big step in the right direction and made me think this series can actually be grand. I went in to see Goblet of Fire and I loved it. It's probably the best of all the films and the most realistic. The acting by the three actors is decent and getting much better as they get older and the script is decent, though leaving a lot of stuff out of the books. The special effects also are amazing to look at and the best of the films.<br/><br/>Though, the movie does drag alittle and I really don't like the guy playing Dumbledore for some reason.

","There are too many naysayers in this world. I thought Goblet of Fire was by far the best Harry Potter movie to date. Yes, a lot was left out... to the people who complain about that I say, ""You have at least SEEN the book, right?"" Goblet of Fire is a long book. Yes, it's a great book (they all are), but of course a lot of stuff is going to be left out. Who wants to see a five hour movie, regardless of what the movie is? Nobody, that's right. The point is, it's a MOVIE that's 2 &1/2 hours long. The book has 734 pages. If you're upset that things were left out, then don't go see movies that are based upon books ever again! Okay, now that my rant is over... like I was saying, Goblet of Fire is by far the best one to date. The Triwizards Championship was amazing, it was absolutely heart-wrenching to see Hermione with Viktor (her and Ron just need to get together already!), and the scene with Harry and Voldemort... let's just say that because I knew what was going to happen, I started crying the second the four of them went into the maze, and I didn't stop until the credits. Cedric was such a good character (not to mention hot), they really should have put more of Cedric in there... I was disappointed they didn't show the Quidditch World Cup... I was sure that was going to be amazing. Despite the things that were left out, I was in awe the entire time. I can't wait for Order of the Phoenix..."

Where were the blast ended skrewts, sphynxs, funky mist etc. I also noticed all of the humour and sexual tension that seemed to be more apparent than it actually was at this point of the series (and there was very little character development outside of Harry, Hermione, Ron and Neville Longbottom). Oh and what about Rita Skeeter and Sirius?? Hmmm... okay so I know there was a LOT, way too much, than could have been put in, but it seems that just clips of the best parts were shown instead of actually creating a story and great characters to follow.<br/><br/>The special effects were pretty cool though..."
"geebeegb1","6","0","1","18 November 2005"," I think I should have read the book.
","I have been eagerly awaiting this movie as I was so enthralled by the first three movies. I have to say I came away a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie was full of all the wonderful Harry Potter special effects, the bantering between the students, and even introduced some teenage angst scenes expected due to the aging of the characters. However, I found myself lost when it came to the storyline.<br/><br/>Unlike the first 3 movies, I came away from this one believing that I should have read the book first. Either that or the director was just inept at his art. The scenes seemed disjointed as if there were chunks missing. There were references to people and events I could not follow. I also found that, unlike the other movies, any accomplishments one might attribute to Harry's actions, were really due to the intervention of others.<br/><br/>There were a number of notable performances. Hermione has grown into a lovely young lady and Ms. Watson very adequately portrayed the confusion of 14 year-old girl. Ron showed a bit of a darker side initially but eventually became the slightly quirky lad we all love. I did not enjoy Harry all that much in this movie but I am not sure if it was the story or Radcliffe's acting. Michael Gambon continues his great portrayal of Dumbledore and all the other students and teachers performed as expected.<br/><br/>I am happy I saw the movie but it left me wanting. Perhaps I will go out and buy the book, read it, and then return to the movie. Maybe it will make more sense or convince me that the movie just doesn't live up to my expectations of the series."

If you are planning on seeing this movie, at least spare yourself the ruination of an amazing experience and read the book first. Even if you hate reading, you'll like this book. Besides, if you haven't read the book you won't have a clue as to what the hell is going on in the story anyway because the movie jumps around from scene to scene so confusingly.<br/><br/>Specifically, since my review is not long enough, the scenes of the tournament underwent heavy and brutal alteration. The emotions of the characters were portrayed pathetically, and not one of the personalities and feelings in the book survived to make the movie. Terrible script writing...<br/><br/>If you are even remotely a harry potter fan, do yourself justice and skip this movie until you have tackled the book.

","Or else you might miss half the plot. The newest installment of the Harry Potter series moves at such lightening speed that the audience hardly settles into one mind-blowing, spectacular, special effects-laden scene before it whisks you away to the next. It seems that director Mike Newell was going for quantity over quality, trying to fit as much of the book into the film as possible, but never slowing down enough to give the audience a chance to feel the tone of the movie or read into the depth of the characters. Granted Newell was facing a challenge from the beginning with J.K. Rowling's fourth Harry Potter book weighing in at some 734 pages; however, he barely took advantage of the book's exquisite detail when making this film. The budding romantic tendencies of the adolescents were of course portrayed thoroughly on screen, but deeper relationships, such as the growing paternal bond between Sirius Black and Harry, were merely glossed over. Also, viewers who have never actually read Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will probably be stumped over the mechanics of Barty Crouch Jr.'s kidnap and impersonation of Mad Eye Moody. Adequate explanation of this key plot element is sorely lacking.<br/><br/>As it turns out, shallow, fast-paced film-making is only part of the film's disappointment. True Harry Potter fans will most likely be affronted by Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, as well as the depiction of the final Tri-Wizard task. What ever happened to Richard Harris' Dumbledore: the quirky, powerful wizard with genius intellect? Michael Gambon has replaced him with someone seemingly rash, hot-tempered, and quite a bit less insightful. Comparing the two, the latter is not only unrealistic when compared to the first two films, but untrue to J.K. Rowling's character. And concerning the third task, I don't even know where to begin. Mike Newell must have been feeling lackluster when he decided to scrap every single obstacle the Champions face in the maze and replace them with the walls of the maze itself being the antagonist; nearly squashing the champions in a whirlwind of vines and brush. Very disappointing indeed.<br/><br/>The one show-stopping scene of the film was of course the rebirth of Lord Voldemort, due mostly to the outstanding acting abilities of Ralph Fiennes. Not only are his prosthetics so creepy as to make your skin crawl, but he ushers in this scene with stunningly commanding screen presence. When the movie was over, I was actually sad I didn't get to see more of Lord Voldemort. However, like the rest of the film, this scene was unforgivably rushed. Given the opportunity, I have no doubt that Fiennes could have explored Voldemort's subtle cruelty and overwhelming power more thoroughly in his interactions with not only Harry, but his Death Eaters as well.<br/><br/>Overall, there is something missing from Newell's adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Although it is an exciting film, taking us from one heart-pounding adventure to the next, in a word it lacks subtlety. The audience hardly has a chance to delve into the characters beyond what is skin-deep. And while there are some brilliant moments (Lord Voldemort's rebirth and Rita Skeeter's journalistic antics are two of them) on the whole Mike Newell takes us on a whirlwind tour of the book, but never stops to let us get acquainted with the finer details of plot, tone or characters."
"JackSkellington-1","9","0","1","18 November 2005"," Very Good Harry Potter film, even with many cuts to the story
","Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire Will contain spoilers<br/><br/>I'm not really sure where to begin. The movie itself was a very fun and entertaining movie. There were quite a few parts I loved and the comedy was great in it. I thought this was the best outing of acting by the three main characters, which is really the point of all these movies & books. Those three have and will be the center of attention. For the general movie fan or Harry Potter fan, this was the best one yet I think...in terms of entertainment.<br/><br/>Now, for those that actually like to follow the storyline of Harry Potter, it was OK. Not bad or great, but alright, acceptable. I tried my best to understand this was the longest book of the series, and to cram all of it would be impossible. That being said...that doesn't give the excuse to ADD things that weren't in the book and change parts of the story. There were a few things I wish they hadn't cut out, like Dobby & Winky. I thought Winky was an important part of the book, but the entire S.P.E.W. house elf thing, that was OK to cut out. <br/><br/>I know it doesn't add to the overall story of Harry Potter, but considering the book was made up of many chapters about the World Cup, for the game itself to be completely cut out of the movie, and pretty much hacked up the parts they did put in, I thought that was a bad move. Come on, give me something...they introduced the players, a small shot at Krum, and then bang we are done with the game, and they are in the tent...and death eaters are there. Oh well, like I said I did my best to know it wouldn't be the same, but I had hope. The tasks were also a massive part of the books, but the only one they did perfect was the underwater one. The Dragon one was fun, but quite overdone, and was done purely for CGI effects. The Maze at the end was boring and dragged out. There were no Skerwets{sp?}, Bogarts, and even the Sphinx was cut. All it was, was the bushes closing in around them...oh no...<br/><br/>Two things were perfect though, and that was the Yule Ball & th Return of Voldemort. I thought both scenes were done perfect, and Fiennes was just awesome. I can't wait to see him involved more in the next movie.<br/><br/>Mad Eye Moody was awesome too, and Gleason did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>If anything were to be added, I wish they had put a little more into what happened to Nevil's parents. It is mentioned, but kinda thrown to the side as it is in the middle of a fluster. I wish also they had added a few things here or there to make everyone truly understand how much Voldemort coming back means, and how it changed the entire Wizard World, but I guess that will be in the next movie....which will have a different director....again....they need to stop doing that.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy the movie as after they hacked the first half of the book into 20 minutes, I let it go and enjoyed the film. I know it doesn't sound like it, but I did, and I suggest everyone go see it just purely for the action, comedy and pure entertainment this film produced."

JK Rowling's novel is already a phenomenal masterpiece and the movie proves itself to be a masterpiece of its genre.The past 3 movies were wonderfully done and the new one just adds up to the list. Mike Newell's new approach on the novel's adaptation works really well especially the humor part which gives a relief from the drama and suspense of the film. Although several of the scenes from the book weren't included ; which is totally understandable, the viewers were left with over two hours long of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>The production team have done an awesome job particularly the special effects team. Everything seems very realistic which plays an important factor throughout the film.<br/><br/>The acting is another factor making the film one of its kind. The lead actors including Daniel, Emma, and Rupert have done a glorious job portraying the characters of Harry, Hermione, and Ron. They continue to become experts in their profession as the movie progresses and all off them shows their love of acting. The emotions are question less. From the start till the end of the film, they're in full character giving the viewers more that what they have expected. With all the new and returning actors, they've also done an amazing job. Being an avid fan of HP, I never found watching the movies to be boring. The actors have done a spectacular job personalizing the characters their portraying making them interesting and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire is a highly recommended film for all ages.

There are also a lot of funny scenes that would make you laugh for a long time. The graphics look great and the background was astounding. I left the movie theater satisfied.<br/><br/>When I got home and started to actually think of it, I began to notice that scenes were left out that I thought were kind of vital to the future books. First of all, there's no Triwizard winnings to give to the Weasley twins so that they can open their joke shop and be successful in the 6th book. Next, Rita Skeeter's role was just that of an annoying reporter. She didn't have a meaning like in the book where her libel or false editorials had the whole wizarding world turn against Harry. This in turn made convincing the wizarding population that Voldemort is back, a big part of the plot for the 5th book. Then, Percy Weasley wasn't even in the movie at all. He worked for Barty Crouch in the 4th book and it started a rift between him and the Weasley family in the 5th book and it even went so far as to him being estranged. There were other scenes that was left out that would make the future movies hard to understand just because the background is not there. That was what I liked about the book, details that seem ordinary is revealed to be a part of the twist later on that makes reading the books so interesting, like for example, scabbers, Ron's pet rat in 1st year turning out to be Wormtail, Harry's parent's betrayer in the 3rd book.<br/><br/>Anyways, the movie was great but what I'm concerned about is that the next movie will be confusing because of the lack of background."

","I had extremely high expectations for this movie and I was not disappointed. After what seemed like an eternity, it was finally here. The performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were excellent! This is by far the most wicked Harry Potter movie. The director added little tidbits to make the conversations more modern which were much easier to relate to and picture in a usual teen's life. I hope the actors do all the movies, I simply can't rave about it enough. One difference I noticed was that I preferred Cedric's character in the movie much more than in the book. This is not my favourite HP book but definitely my favourite movie. Just fantastic! Books made into movies are usually very disappointing for me but Mike Newell did it right this time! A movie finally does its book justice! Congratulations and looking forward to seeing the series evolve and continue in its greatness!"

","Was better than the last one. It was still not as graphical as some of the first few. While it still missed some points it had some excellent color and demonstrations of what happened in the book. Its definitely worth seeing. <br/><br/>It was the best sequel I have seen in some time. Although I knew everything that was going to happen because of the book I still applauded the triumphs and wished that the tragedy's did not occur. I suggest that due to opinions varying it would be best for all to watch a movie (and read the book) before it is judged.

"lw8bra","9","0","1","18 November 2005"," The movie was great, but the book was even better
","I just saw this movie tonight after months of anticipation, and I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. So much of the book was left out and it really did make a difference. The way that things were skipped, it seemed to make the movie choppy in spots. I think that some things could have been left in, and made the movie even better than it was, even if it would have added another 30 minutes or so to the movie. An example would be Rita Skeever. In the book, she is a major character, and in the movie, she just seems to be a minor annoyance, so much more could have been done with the character, it was a bit of a letdown.<br/><br/>The Quidditch World Cup scenes were awesome, the cinematography was top-notch, and the scenes immediately following were appropriately frightening. I can certainly understand the PG-13 rating, there was a lot of violence and disturbing images. There was also a good dose of humor- Moaning Myrtle hitting on Harry was hilarious, and the twins taking bets on the Triwizard contestants was a typical Fred and George type of thing.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to friends, but would also express my disappointment about the missing elements."
"zekechan","6","0","1","18 November 2005"," Disappointing
","I really think the recent Harry Potter movie was very disappointing. I went with a die hard HP fan and he actually hated it, I give it a lil more credit. The formula for the movie seems to the same for the HP movies. It's the same sequence in the events, the events just change. I especially noticed that in this, the movie felt rushed and choppy. This may be due to the 800 pages or so, they had to squish into a 2.5 hr movie, which seemed very long. The special effects seemed just OK, like the other ones. The acting was also very mellow dramatic. I really like the third one, because of the contrast of greys and blacks, and interesting light. It was also very dark, which it should be. This was just a comerical dive with one point: get the point across, and impress the viewers. When did movie making become like that. It should be about breaking new grounds.Some things i did like include the were the light jokes, and the underwater scene, and not to mention and unbelievably hot Emma Watson (take it from a teenager). So kinda let down :/"
"jldunigan","5","0","2","18 November 2005"," fans of the books, beware
","I found the special effects were just as fantastic as I expected, but I thought the music was a little overdone and sappy when it didn't have to be. The acting was a fantastic ensemble piece with each of the many main characters having several times when they come to the forefront. I did notice, however great the rest of the acting, that Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore) at times was moving far too quickly and with too much alacrity to portray Dumbledore as old as the books make him sound. At one point he leaps rather quickly on to the platform where the teachers sit to go to his podium, and another time when agitated he sits and stands up very quickly. I also think it's a bit extreme when he shakes Harry because it seemed rather uncharacteristically physical and bordering on violent for him to do that. I thought that there were several loose ends left with the reduction of the subplots from the book, such as not seeing how Barty Crouch Jr. got out of Azkaban. The movie seemed a little too plot-driven at times and skipped out on the characterization of the new characters like Fleur and Krum. Some of the dialogue seemed rather stilted, but the ending duel, when Harry takes Cedric Diggory's body back, and Dumbledore's comments about Cedric's death were truly moving. Overall, I think that fans of the movies more than the books will like this better than those who truly love the books."
"redhotchillipitts","10","0","1","18 November 2005"," A true movie that fans will adore!
","This movie lived up to everyone of my expectations, and trust me; I had many. Though the acting isn't great, I must say that the young cast has greatly improved, especially Rupert Grint as the hilarious Ron Weasley (he plays him perfectly!). The movie is set in Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, amidst the Triwizard Tournament that the school is hosting. The visual effects are absolutely stunning, and the final image of Lord Voldemort matches the description in the novel perfectly. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is - by far - the BEST Harry Potter movie so far! It's much more than a series of action scenes put together: there's heart and a journey towards personal discovery that Harry must follow. Stunning! I walked out of the there with one thought in my mind; ""Bloody Brilliant!"""

","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Visually stunning! Breathtaking cinematography! Awesome special effects! Great costumes, particularly Lord Voldemort. Definitely the darkest so far and the beginning of a less childlike Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The acting has vastly improved in the trio. ..they've come a long way since Sorcerer's Stone. This film has it's light hearted moments but is mostly an action packed extravaganza with dazzling special effects. The dragon was one of the best pieces of CG I've ever seen. It will also tug on your emotions and memories, the pains and awkwardness of adolescence especially ring true and I'm sure everyone had moments like the ones the Goblet captures.<br/><br/>The movie cuts to the heart of the book and takes out a lot of the subplot, most notably absent are the Dursley's but I think everything seemed to work itself out and stay true to the spirit of the book. It definitely covered the most important events.<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant adaptation to a brilliant book.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 Don't miss this movie! And if you've seen it....see it again.

","So I'm a big fan of the books and I think they did a great job with the FIRST THREE movies. The fourth movie is a DISAPPOINTMENT. Thats why I rated it as a three. There were parts I liked but not many. I'll probably go see it again so I can complain about it with friends. I didn't have anything bad to say about the first three movies but I could go on forever on this one. I just wish people would give up on thinking that this series is for kids. Maybe young teens but not kids. I was really glad to see more of Fred and George. There were some characters I would've liked to see again. I was looking forward to certain parts that they changed horribly or left out all together. Disappointing."

","I just saw the movie this afternoon. I noticed Daniel really improved his acting compared to the previous Harry Potter movies. I agree that the movie is really so far the darkest of all the four, story is very good. Although, I would like to see some developments in the acting of Rupert Grint. I like Emma Watson's gown during the ball, she really grown up a teenager. Draco's dialogue is fading, not much scene. And at last, I heard my favorite expression from Rupert Grint, ""Bloody Hell"" whenever something unintentional event happened. I learned this from my colleagues in Luxury Cruise Line, mostly British/Scandinavian.<br/><br/>I'm expecting more in the 5th Harry Potter movie, the Order of the Phoenix in 2007.<br/><br/>Although, there are some scenes which I didn't clearly understand/heard not because of the cast's dialogue, but because of the pitch reactions from teenage girls near my seat at the movie theater, especially when Harry Potter removed his shirt in shower, hahaha....

","I am curious as to what book this was based onSurely not J.K. Rowlings ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"". This was truly the biggest disappointment to hit the theaters since ""Episode III"". First, you cannot skip (or fast forward) through 1/5 of the book and have a stable storylineThe plot development was left to the imagination. The omission of key story line was appalling. The adlib of the story was ridiculous. I cannot imagine that anyone who has read the book can enjoy this film for much more than the title screen Just a hintIf you have not read the book, don't expect the movie to make much sense. Furthermore, if you plan to watch any future HP films, read the book...A lot of important development was omitted."

","I am a bit disappointed in the continued casting of Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore. I the books Dumbledore is always cool as a cucumber, but, especially in this new movie, Gambon overdoes it. Dumbledore should speak quietly, and calmly, and hold people with his eyes, this guy, is a bit nuts. I thought the movie was very good otherwise, except the ending. It wasn't quite ""finished"" as it was in the book, and those details left out are the basis of the whole fifth story. Hopefully, the next ""new"" director will take note, and make amends for this pictures failings. This probably sounds like a bad review, but I would see the movie again, and the DVD will be added to my Harry Potter collection."

","This Harry Potter Movie is probably the best one yet for action, intrigue, and Special Effects. Having listened to the Audio Books, read by Jim Dale (I think ), the film varies quite a bit from the book. If a person read the book before seeing the Movie, you keep wondering when "" such and such "" will happen. There is so much rich content to the book, the movie would have to be much longer than it is. My two eldest daughters, 41 and 42, and my wife and I have seen all the movies at least once, and highly recommend any and all to be viewed. Some of the content in the G. of F. is probably a tad too intense for the younger set, but anyone who likes Magic, Wizardry, and just a very good movie must see this one. I can't wait for the next book to come out. It will be interesting to see how the actors age. No complaints on this one, it's a keeper...."

","As an avid fan of the Harry Potter books, I feel like its my duty to see the movies, even if I don't like them, such as the third one. So, needless to say, I wasn't expecting a lot for this one. But am I ever glad I went. This is by far the best Harry Potter movie. In the third one, it seems they cut out a lot of the important things, and left in the not so important things. But with the fourth one, they kept in most of the important things, and left out the things that would weigh down the movie.<br/><br/>New additions, which include Brenden Gleeson as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Mad Eye Moody and new comers Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory, Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum and of course Ralph Fiennes as the much talked about Lord Voldemort among others, are wonderful and play up the returning characters, including Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and of course Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The best actor from the three young stars is probably Grint, who, with his facial expression and knack for comic timing, seems he can go far after Harry Potter is over. But the breakthrough is Radcliffe. It seems he's finally been given proper material to work with, and seems to delve deep and finally becomes the hero that was hidden under fear for so long.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone, fan or not, because it will please you if you never picked up a Harry Potter book, and satisfy you, if you are a die hard ""Potthead""."

","It's a very good thing that what most people remember about movies and the like is the first and last things they see, because ""Goblet"" is one of those movies that has a mostly forgettable middle. The action is tight and quick-moving, but only at the expense of character development. Brilliant moments featuring Matthew Lewis, the Phelps twins, and even a shining moment or two from Emma Watson are swallowed up in that great hulking plot mechanism known as the Triwizard Tournament.<br/><br/>All that said, the first and last ten minutes of the film are good enough for even the most disappointed viewer to rate the movie at least one star higher. With the fun of a Wizarding sporting event and the return of a major player in the series bookending the action, you can take a $10 nap through the middle and not miss much.<br/><br/>My recommendation: Read the book."
"pressboard","4","0","1","18 November 2005"," Perfect for 12 year old girls - and they loved it!!!
","The first thing I noticed were the abundant number of early teen girls in the theater - and they loved the movie. I am afraid the rest of us, not meeting that criteria, are left hanging out to dry. This was another example of lots of CGI, but little emotional connection with the characters. There was also a noticeable lack of action, at least, compared to the previous movies. I am not a slavering Potter fan, but I did find all of the other movies entertaining. Since Rowling has absolute control over the movies, I can only assume that she intended this one to be realized in the way that it was. The CGI is stunning, but the story, pacing and emphasis leave much to be desired. There is no excitement when he fights the dragon - none when he is running in the maze - and not much more when he faces Valdemort. What happened Harry - have you been snorting fairy dust? I think this movie goes wrong for a general audience, but does very well targeting young girls. Goblet may fair better on a second viewing or on cable or DVD. It was interesting to see everyone older, but nothing was ever done with those possibilities. I think someone may have dropped the screenplay and all the words fell off and were never quite the same afterward. The first 10 reviews seem to indicate that some people were impressed, so I may be way off."

It wasn't scary at all. The only thing that would be scary for children would be the creatures, and maybe Madame Maxime.

The movie is about 2 1/2 hours long. It got a PG-13 rating for sexual innuendos. There aren't really any, except at the end when Crouch Jr. says to Snape, ""I'll show you mine, if you show me your."" But, he was talking about the Voldemort tattoo. The best scene by far is when Voldemort got remade by Peter Pettigrew. Voldemorts face looked exactly how I pictured it in the book.

When the first Harry Potter movie came out I couldn't help but go and see it. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Harry Potter movies. Yes, they left some stuff out, but I felt they were minor details that didn't ruin the story. The third movie was good, but I had a hard time shifting from one director to the next. The third one was a lot darker but after a while it grew on me. I'm not sure why they changed directors, but I wish they would keep it consistent. I don't like change. As for Goblet of Fire, I knew beforehand that the director had changed once more and had also heard that the director wished to make this movie into two movies but ended up being able to squeeze it into one. Bad idea. He ruined the whole movie for me. They left out so much of what I thought was important. So many things were brought up and never finished. They brought Rita Skeeter into the movie and hardly showed anything about who she is and what she did. Why bring her in if you don't go anywhere with her character? I wish that Chris Columbus would direct the movies again. He did a better job. Thanks for ruining it for me Mike Newell. You should have made it two movies.

I enjoyed the first three movies, and books, greatly, but this movie contains basically the Triwizard cup, the Yule ball, and the end scene with Voldemort. Almost nothing to do with schooling is included. Ron and Hermione seem to have very small parts. I feel that too much work was put into the first task and the Horntail scene was far too long. The Dursley's are completely left out along with Winky. The Quidditch World Cup was far too short maybe lasting 5 minutes of the entire movie.

","I just came home from watching this movie, and I have to say I'm disappointed. After seeing the ""The Prizoner of Azkaban"", I was really hopeful about the direction in which the movies were going. Sadly, it's going the wrong way again.<br/><br/>The movie feels like chapters being cut from the book and then simply put together. My sister, who hasn't read the books, had a hard time following from time to time, and I don't blame her. The beginning went incredibly fast but without any explanations to things happening. They just happened, and that was that. The rest of the movie followed the same pattern. One action scene is followed by another without a trace of character development.<br/><br/>On the plus-side, the actors get better for each movie (with the exception of Radcliff who still needs to learn proper face expressions). The movie also looks incredibly nice.<br/><br/>As I said before a whole lot of material is cut from the book. Entire characters are lost. This confuses me as to who the movie is meant for. It can't be people who hasn't read the books, because they can't follow it. Neither do I think it's a movie for the hard-core fans. To much of the stuff the fans love have been taken away. What did you think when you let this pass through Rowling?<br/><br/>My reason for my high vote is that the movie is still capturing. I don't regret paying to see it. I'm simply hoping that for the next movie the tempo is cut down, and character development is brought forward. The books deserve that."

I love Ron (I even had a shirt with him on it that I wore to the premiere), and he is very brave, but is sometimes misrepresented in the films. <br/><br/>All the Tri-Wizard Tournament scenes and a certain other fight one are very intense and incredibly awesome (At one part I wanted to cry because a scene was so sad and very well done.).<br/><br/>I had only wished that the had kept the S.P.E.W subplot. But I guess you can't include everything. <br/><br/>Trust me, fifty bagillion people can't all be wrong when they give this film 10 stars. Go see it and you will love it with every fiber of your being just as I do! I can't wait to see it again! 10/10"
"rosorio","9","0","1","18 November 2005"," Easily the best movie so far
","I am a huge fan of the books, so I have high standards about the movie adaptations. I was disappointed with the first three because the director dwelled on special effects and dull moments that didn't advance the plot. The Goblet of Fire did neither.<br/><br/>Mike Newell clearly understood that a good movie needs more than flashy special effects. While the Goblet of Fire did incorporate all the amazing fantastical elements of the book, such as the Goblet and the dragons, the film didn't depend on them to further the plot. Even though the effects were marvelous and magical, the focus of this movie was the characters.<br/><br/>Each scene was well paced. Unlike the first three, there was no dull, lagging scenes. The movie wonderfully displayed how the characters are developing in the book and dealing with becoming young adults. The evolving relationships between Harry, Ron, and Hermoine was explored by the director, who understood the complexity of their friendships.<br/><br/>The Goblet of Fire was definitely not purely a children's movie. Newell balanced the light with the dark, sticking true to the book. The movie simultaneously dealt with coming of age and the intense darkness of evil. Harry is tested in his friendships, his strength, and his loyalty during the movie, and Newell didn't hold back.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe is truly growing into his character of Harry Potter. He handled the varied emotions like a pro, never creating any doubt that he is the perfect Harry Potter. Brendan Gleeson's performance as MadEye Moody was absolutely delicious. The jerky movements, quirky behaviors, and eccentricity was handled perfectly to create one of the most bizarre but fun characters from the books.<br/><br/>People have complained that a lot of cut from the book, but Newell did an expert job of pruning what was unnecessary and focusing on the central plot and character development. The book has plenty of side plots that Newell could have chased, but he focused on the most important elements of the book: the character development, the tournament, and how a 14 year old can face pure evil. Newell was able to create an emotional intensity that is necessary for the increasingly dark plot.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about the movie was it was funny. Unlike the first three, which had a few moments of silliness that made the audience laugh, this entire movie was full of humor centered around the awkwardness of growing up. The quirky and witty lines said by all the characters is true to the book, and reminds the viewer that while these characters are wizards and witches faced with a grave responsibility, they are still human and want to smile.<br/><br/>Overall, a very enjoyable experience. I am looking forward to watching it again!"

","As part of a worldwide movie franchise, Goblet of Fire is indeed probably the best of the four so far. But for those who consider themselves book purists, movie-goers may be disappointed by this pale shadow of a book many consider to be their favorite of the series thus far. I know I was.<br/><br/>While I completely understand the need to cut away excess layers for time reasons, there still remain a few things that bother me. One being the need for the screenwriters to fill time with humorous or dramatic creations of their own, rather than of J.K. Rowling's.<br/><br/>As an adult reader and a loyal fan since the 90s, it is my belief that these books are incredibly humorous, and very dramatic on their own, without the aid of outside sources. Did I enjoy Professor McGonagall instructing Ron and the rest of Gryffindor on the finer points of dancing? Of course I did. But I enjoy the visual image of Moody stumping up to nightshirt-clad Snape and Filch and simply stating, ""Pajama party, eh?"" far more.<br/><br/>I knew going into the theater that the Barty Crouch Sr./Jr. plot line would be butchered, and I was prepared for the sacrifice. But what I was perhaps least prepared for was Michael Gambon in the role of a pseudo-Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Perhaps the hardest role to cast, especially following Richard Harris' untimely death, I am nevertheless appalled by Michael Gambon's portrayal. He is not the caring, all-powerful, ostentatiously-dressed Dumbledore we readers have come to love. Instead, he is unsympathetic and oftentimes mean. And he appears to be in severe need of a dip into the prefects' bathtub himself.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe is naught but a mediocre actor, and not quite convincing in his reactions to the goings-on. But Gambon is ridiculous, and I cannot believe that J.K. Rowling would stand by and allow one of her most crucial characters to be dragged through the mud."

"jeanyus","6","0","1","18 November 2005"," Fairly disappointing if you've read the book
","To preface everything else I'm about to say, this movie was pretty decent. If you're a hardcore fan of the books, you will likely be disappointed as I was, simply because it does not follow the book very well. But, the movie alone wasn't that bad.<br/><br/>Before going in to see this movie, I knew that parts of the book would have to be cut out to fit it all into the two and a half hours it takes up. However, how much was actually removed is just shocking. I felt like everything except the most essential parts of the book were gone, just vanished, no reference ever made to them. I won't give specifics as I don't want to ruin anything for people who may not have read the book, but if you have read the book, you will notice that HUGE parts of the story have been removed. Whole chapters are completely gone. This was quite disappointing to me, as many of the best parts of the book aren't in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself felt rushed. It jumped from scene to scene, and you could tell that everything was done as quickly as possible to make the movie fit into its time frame. When I left the movie, I honestly wondered if I would have even been able to keep up with and understand what was going on if I didn't already know the story from the book.<br/><br/>I know that the people this movie is marketed to would disagree with me, but I'd personally prefer that the film-makers just made it four or five hours long so they could tell the whole story. As the story moves forward, the books get longer, and the movies stay the same length. I'm hoping that the Order of the Phoenix movie is a vast improvement over this one, but I have little faith that it will be.<br/><br/>Overall - if you're looking for a fun, fairly entertaining movie to go to, go see this. If you're looking for a movie that follows the book, you will be disappointed."
"dfranzen70","9","0","7","18 November 2005"," Smashing, dark story - well done
","The HP movies continue to wow and amaze me. As they progress, they're getting darker and more adult, much like Harry Potter himself. In the beginning, they felt more like kids' movies that adults could enjoy, and now the tables have been turned a bit.<br/><br/>This fourth movie covers Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts. The Goblet of the title is a magical urn that spits out the names of three contestants for that year's Triwizards Tournament. Ah, but there's a fourth name belched by the goblet, and to no viewer's surprise, it belongs to Young Mr. Potter.<br/><br/>No one knows how Harry's name made its way into the Goblet, especially since there's a curse on it that prevents anyone under 17 from submitting a name, and Harry insists he didn't even try. But rules is rules, and Harry's the fourth contestant. The quartet must face three challenges, including dragons, merpeople, and a labyrinth. We know, of course, that Harry will make it through all of these tasks relatively intact, since his further exploits (books five and six) have already been published. But how does he do it? What new characters will attempt to foil him, and what new friends will he make? Hogwarts is the host school for the tournament, and so two other schools will be spending the year with the Hogwarts students - a bevy of French lasses and a squadron of strapping central European lads. It is from these two schools, plus one from Hogwarts and Harry himself, that the four contestants are selected by the Goblet.<br/><br/>But perhaps Harry's biggest challenge is a rather mundane one - finding a date to the Yule Ball. Perhaps the most endearing quality of Rowling's books (and the movies) is that Harry, underneath it all, is really just another teenager. He's alternately whiny, paranoid, unhappy, and joyful. And now he and his chums have been told they'll all be taking dance lessons so they can look good on the floor later that year.<br/><br/>Of course, adding to the fun is the latest Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who has - as you might guess - one working eye and a sort of robotic eye that has a telescopic lens. And at least one fake leg. He kind of looks like the love child of C-3PO and the Skipper from Gilligan's Island. The Dark Arts teacher is traditionally a one-year wonder - something always happens - so the mystery is what'll happen to Moody, not if it'll happen at all.<br/><br/>Rowling's world is so well defined that new characters can be introduced in the books but mentioned only fleetingly in the movies - and we're none the worse for it. For example, Madame Maxime, a half-giantess who's the headmistress of the French school, falls for (surprise!) Hagrid, the half-giant. Ah, true love. We don't see much of them, but when we do see Madame Maxime her appearances aren't incongruous; they, in fact, help further the plot.<br/><br/>Since the movies are getting darker (tough times ahead!), we see less and less of the cute touches that inhabited the first two films, such as buying books in Diagon Alley, boarding the train to Hogwarts, seeing Hagrid greeting the first year students, and so forth. But in its place, we get a LOT of fantastic effects, such as Harry outracing and outmaneuvering a flying dragon - on his broom, of course; Harry speaking with Sirius via the Gryffindor fire, and the Quidditch World Cup. These scenes aren't just wowie scenes done to shock and amaze the audience; they feel perfectly plausible and logical, not gratuitous.<br/><br/>Mike Newell is the director this time around (the third director in the series), and the first Briton to helm one of the movies. He's really adept at staging action scenes without distracting the audience with special effects - which is not to say the effects aren't grand, just that they're not the only thing the movie has going for it.<br/><br/>Everyone seems to be aging with their roles rather well (although Maggie Smith's looking longer in the tooth than usual, perhaps, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is much more energetic than Richard Harris' was), and I was pleased to see that there wasn't too much attention paid to the romantic angles of the story (particularly regarding the ball). I was further pleased to see the friendship of Hermione, Ron, and Harry being reevaluated. Readers of the series know that the interrelationships of these three friends will change drastically in due time, and it's good to see just a hint of it here (rather than dwelling on it to the point of detracting from the rest of the story).<br/><br/>I would not recommend that kids under a certain age watch this movie. It is the first in the series to be rated PG-13 (fitting, since Harry is now 14), and its dark themes - including children in peril, death, serious injury - will probably be too much for the younger set who liked the first two films in the series.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought Goblet was the best of the bunch so far. Often, by the time a there's a fourth in a movie series, the characters are so well worn that one can rather easily predict what's going to happen to them. But this isn't the case here, and that might be at least partly due to the changing directors (and tone). We're familiar with Harry and his friends, and we root for them, but they never become so bland - or, to the other extreme, wacky for the sake of being wacky - that they become tiresome, not by a long shot."
"laurie617","9","0","1","18 November 2005"," loved the movie, but...
","...for a huge Harry Potter fan who has read the books a number of times, I must say that the film did leave me with some small yet significant feelings of emptiness.<br/><br/>Highlights: The actors were wonderful -- the young trio of stars truly did their characters justice. And the new characters, especially Moody, were very entertaining; Gleeson did a fabulous job. For the most part, director Mike Newell did a superb job at the helm of this popular franchise. Some of the best parts of the story highlighted in this film were the scenes involving the painful yet cruelly necessary awkwardness of adolescence. I think those quirky moments set the stage wonderfully for the upcoming movies. The rift between Harry and Ron is so believable, you wonder if they'll ever be friends again. Furthermore, the action scenes surrounding the Triwizard Tournament were visually appealing to the point of sometimes being breathtaking (despite the fact that some of them seemed a bit abbreviated).<br/><br/>However, as not only an avid Potter fan but also a die-hard reader of the books, there are some obvious holes in the movie. Certain scenes just seem ""thrown out there,"" leaving many questions unanswered. For example, the scene where Harry finds Barty Crouch Sr lying in the Forbidden Forest -- he sees him there, then goes to Dumbledore's office, but does not say a word about his grisly discovery. Hmm. The introduction and explanation of Barty Jr seems a little painfully compressed. Many of the main characters were seen far too sparsely, namely Sirius, who as a major player in ""Phoenix"" perhaps should have been seen in more than one scene in ""Goblet."" Besides, last we saw Sirius in ""Azkaban,"" we were left with a heart-touching scene in which you believe Harry finally has some family in his life to truly care for him. Yet we are supposed to believe that with all of the strange things happening at Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament, Harry talks to his beloved godfather only once? (Twice if you count the letter before the fireplace scene, but still far too infrequently.) And of our new characters, whatever happened to that pesky Rita Skeeter? From the movie, you don't know. And although I think Ralph Fiennes does an amazing job portraying Voldemort, the graveyard scene, the climax of the film, was mildly disappointing. Voldemort needed to be a bit more evil, rather than just walking around the graveyard in circles.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved the film, but I think that an extra 15-20 minutes added on would have answered a world of questions and left the die-hard fans not feeling as though they got cheated out of dessert. The whole thing just seemed a bit rushed, even choppy at times. And though the film clocks in at about 2 1/2 hours, I think most fans would not have minded a few more minutes if it meant more resolution to the story. (Many popular movies have kept fans in their seats for upwards of 3 hours +.) For those of us who have read the books, we can fill in these blanks. But I can't help but wonder if those who haven't read the books may feel a little lost in all the hurriedness.<br/><br/>I do highly recommend the movie, and I know that you can't squeeze every detail from the page to the screen. But book fans, be prepared to be thirsting for a bit more. And also be ready to fill in some blanks for your non-Potter-reading friends who accompany you to the theater."

","'Goblet of Fire' isn't my favourite of the Harry Potter books, but I've been eagerly awaiting the big screen version of the book like every other Potter fan. I saw the movie last weekend at a preview screening and I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>As the first British director at the helm, Mike Newell has made a film that fits somewhere between the first two and the third in terms of feel. It's more mainstream than 'Azkaban', but maintains that film's murkier aspect. The trio are growing up now and it's all becoming more complicated.<br/><br/>First the bad points. In terms of plot, the Quidditch World Cup scene serves only to introduce Viktor Krum. We don't even see the Irish team win, which, being Irish, I would've liked to see. Equally brief is Sirius' appearance in the fire at Hogwarts. And, although the way he appears is good, I didn't like the way it was done.<br/><br/>Rita Skeeter's presence was very fleeting also. Miranda Richardson did a fabulous job as her, but we didn't get enough of her nastiness. It seemed almost like a cameo role the way it was done. Having said that, some introduction to her is necessary for what comes in book five.<br/><br/>I'm also really missing Richard Harris' Dumbledore. I didn't warm to Michael Gambon in 'Azkaban' and I like him even less here. Rather than becoming more serious, he seems to just be morose a lot. I think Richard Harris would have played it better.<br/><br/>Now for the good points. It looks fantastic. The special effects get better and better and the wow factor is here in spades.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson, another countryman of mine, is great as Mad Eye Moody, a real scene stealer. Ralph Fiennes is appropriately creepy as the serpent-like Lord Voldemort, even though his appearance is quite brief.<br/><br/>As for the trio, the one whose acting has improved the most is Daniel Radcliffe. His Harry is how I imagine him from the books. He's particularly good at the whole teenage crush thing here, which, doubtless, he's drawing on his own experience for. He's also more convincing in the dramatic sequences too, in his crying for example. He's maturing nicely into the role and he really portrays Harry's vulnerability and nobility very well, which bodes well for adaptations of books five and six.<br/><br/>Emma Watson's Hermione seems a little over-emotional this time round, an issue we can probably attribute to the character's hormones. Still, I think Hermione should be a little more in control than that. And Rupert Grint's Ron is as funny as ever.<br/><br/>The new characters are good, but old favourites like Hagrid, the Weasley twins, and even a bit of comedy from Snape, of all people, add to the charm here. I laughed and cried and I'd say we're right on track for the rest of the series.<br/><br/>Not my favourite of the films to date, but then the book isn't my favourite either. That said, it is going to impress true fans."

Understandably more of the true fans are more concerned to the authenticity of the movies as it becomes translated from text but overall in the cinema aspect they did a wonderful job telling a story with wonderful visual effects. The story stands great alone if you never see another film in the series. Even if this is the only movie you see, you can enjoy it whole heartedly and become intertwined into the characters and realize that this isn't just for kids.

It is as if Hollywood's glitz invaded a fine idea and left it seriously lacking. There are some incredible scenes. Some of the main events are so well done it is unreal. But this is glitz, not the greatness of the previous movies. Showyness has been traded for substance. That is not a good trade. What is missing is the development of relationships, various important characters and the beauty that were incorporated into the first 3 movies. The interaction and reasons for events are ignored. I was left disappointed. What a pity. So much more could have been done."
"GradysGhost","7","0","1","18 November 2005"," Decent enough to watch...
","I'm a fan of Harry Potter. I've read the books, seen the movies, and I feel that there's a point I must hit on before continuing this review. I realize that the books and the movies are pretty much completely different entities. What I mean is this: one cannot disclaim one of the movies solely based on the fact that it was different from the book or less than a mirror image translation. The chasm between novel and screen is a difficult one to cross.<br/><br/>That said, though this movie plays out like the crew took the book to the butcher, I can only say the movie is slightly less enjoyable than if it had been all-inclusive and perfectly unaltered. The poor page-to-film translation is but one small reason that I have given this a mediocre rating.<br/><br/>The acting by the kids gets better and better with each movie and I feel I should point out Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom in particular. Daniel Radcliffe shows great emotion and the ever-quirky Ron is made even more humorous by Rupert Grint's performance. Emma Watson's tearful portrayal of a confused girl caught in the childish adolescence of two boys also makes a significant impact on the film. I have to say, however, that I was thoroughly nonplussed by Gary Oldman's appearance here. Enough of that.<br/><br/>Something I felt needed work at several places throughout the flick was how the very necessary comedy clashed with the dark tone of the more serious scenes. I felt they were disconnected, like I was watching two very different movies whose reels got mixed up at the theater.<br/><br/>Also, there are a couple of things which go unexplained. This is where I have to take off points for the translation since the movie seems at times to be contrived by not explaining events that have happened. There are spoilers afoot here. Readers beware.<br/><br/>The situation with Neville Longbottom's parents is never explained and, as a result, a person who has never read the book might think of Neville as a blubbering pansy when he watches Mad-Eye Moody perform the Cruciatus curse on the spider. Also, the phenomenon of Priori Incantatem, though touched upon, was never given the two-sentence explanation it needed. Perhaps these things will be seen in the Deleted Scenes section of the DVD.<br/><br/>For now, enjoy the movie, and don't denounce it for the sheer fact that it's not the book."
"jimmosk-1","7","0","1","18 November 2005"," Should have been two movies
","Why couldn't they have pulled a Peter Jackson, and released this as two movies? There's easily enough plot in Goblet for four or five hours of film, and Mike Newell's skill with a cutting knife was nowhere near as good as Alfonso Cuaron's in Azkaban. This movie suffered from the same flaws as Chris Columbus's treatments of the Potterverse, where getting as many elements of the novel on screen as possible was more important than letting them flow smoothly or giving the plot(s) time to unfold. As a result, we got to see many things for a few seconds each, without really getting to know them (Did Fleur have any depth in this movie? Did Krum have anywhere near enough? How could they not explain the ""Prior Incantatem"" magic, save mentioning the words?....). There were lots of good moments in Goblet, but they didn't add up to as much as I'd been anticipating. I hope the director of Phoenix gets the pacing better.<br/><br/>--Note: I saw this on an Omnimax screen, and that impacted how easy it was to watch the entire screen at once. But the points I'm making are about plot, not how easy it was to see everything."
"cybercartman","6","0","1","18 November 2005"," Good movie for the fans of the movies, bad for fans of the book
","I just attended the midnight screening of the movie here locally and left feeling very torn as to how I felt about it. If you are a big fan of the movies you are going to love this one, it has everything you could want in a Harry Potter movie and everything wraps up quite nicely. If you are a fan of the books however you are going to be left with a big hole in your heart as this leaves out entirely too much of the story for it to resemble the book. Normally I wouldn't care if a movie strayed from the book, but this one not only strayed, it changed major plot points and left very important material out entirely. I'm not going to name specifics of what was left out and what was left in, or even go into detailing why I'm mad about them being left out, because I don't want to bash the movie, because it was done well, and I want to be sure it does get credit where credit is due. I am interested to see what happens next though, I have just started reading Order of the Phoenix, so I'm anxious to see if any details that were left out come back to haunt the film-makers, though I have a feeling that Steve Kloves wouldn't allow anything to be cut that was important to the overall story-line. But through all of this it is very clear that Mike Newell, though talented and is successful in making a great movie, definitely missed what the focus of all the books is and how the characters should behave. I doubt that the book was read by the director beforehand and doubt further that if it was read that the others were read along with it to get the point of the series and what makes them good and engrossing. I'm glad I saw the movie, and I will get the DVD when it comes out, but I will keep notes handy to explain to friends that watch it what all REALLY happened in Hogwarts that year so they don't miss the important things along the way."
"kevintempel","9","0","1","18 November 2005"," Great, but to short
","I went to Harry Potter and the goblet of fire on the premiere 18.th November in Norway. I have read all the books so far and was looking forward to this movie, but I got a little disappointed for the first time. First of all the plot from the Quidish world cup, when the dark mark appeared was changes too much from what happens in the book. So that just made it to bad. We also got introduced to the real bad guy to fast, in the book it takes longer time, and we can not know who made the Dark mark at first, here we new right away. That spoiled much of the excitement of watching the movie. And for the second reason characters who was important for that plot in the book wasn't even mentioned in the film. We did not meet the Dursleys, we did not meet Mrs.Weasley, the house-elfs and they where important I thought at least.<br/><br/>So this is the first time I can't give a full pot to the Harry Potter movies. It was a great film, but to short I say. Titanic lasted 4 hours, and Harry Potter could last just as long with no problem for audience. Many where unhappy about it going bang-bang-bang finished. The story between all the excitement where lost and that is just to bad.<br/><br/>so I am really nice giving it a 9 out of 10. I was thinking about 8 mostly, but it is Harry Potter, so I gave it a 9. It is a much darker film, but it seems like it have been hurried to cut it a leave out important plots and what would make it a much better movie. I hope the DVD will have a longer version than the theatrical release. We need at least 1 hour more for this movie than we got. So I am a little disappointed. DVD must have a longer version with the Dursleys, with Mrs.Weasley, Conversations with Black, the house-elfs etc. This was to short and to fast to get the story right. So for the first time I think it wasn't good enough as the others stayed much more like the books. Must be fixed for the order of the phoenix. And by the way all 7 films must have Daniel Radcliffe and the others in it, or the whole series will be stupid. Can not change an actor in the middle of a series, when everyone have gotten used to them. It will be stupid and flop totally if the same actors ain't used in all 7 movies. The books is going to be 7 and we are following them as they get older, as in real life, so it can not be a change in the actors later. I just worries because word say Daniel Radcliffe and the others have only signed up for the 5th so far. But they need to sign up for the last 2 also. This is possibly also the opinion of the world."
"DjDeb","7","0","1","18 November 2005"," Good, but too many things were left out. Feeling of being rushed.
","I went to the midnight show to see GOF. A midnight show should start at midnight, wouldn't you think? However, after 30 minutes (yes, 30 minutes) of TV commercials and movie previews, GOF started at 12:30 am. I enjoyed the movie, but I felt that I was rushed through the whole thing. For example, the movie opened with Frank Bryce being murdered by Voldemolt (there was also a man in the room with Volty, Wormtail and Nagini), and Harry waking up at the Burrow (by Hermione) with his scar burning. Then, they were off to the Quiddich World Cup, which was very short, but with good special effects. No Winky next to Harry, and Ludo Bagman and Percy Weasley were not in the movie at all. Then it was back to the campsite. When everyone was screaming and the Death Eaters were walking about, Mr. Weasley told everyone to go the Portkey. People were running and screaming and Harry got knocked out and was separated from the Weasley bunch. When he awoke, the campsite was destroyed and saw a man lurking about. This man conjured the Dark Mark. Then the Weasley bunch found Harry, Hermione told Harry what the Dark Mark was, then they left. All of this happened within 10-15 minutes from the start of the movie. Whew! What a roller-coaster ride! The director, Mike Newell, went against the studio's request for a two-part movie. He tried to get the gist of the book into a little over 2hr movie. I was impressed by the special effects, since his previous movies didn't involve them.<br/><br/>Now I know the movie is geared toward children and that they would not sit for a 4-hour movie, but too bad they couldn't shoot the movie properly (with most of the book's content) and show a time-edited version for children and the longer version for adults and die-hard HP fans. Just gimme an intermission to pee and get more popcorn! A lot of things were combined, like the scene with Karkaroff's trial in front of the Ministry. When he was giving up the names of the Death Eaters, he mentioned Barty Crouch Jr. This is why they showed him in the opening scene and later conjuring the Dark Mark. Also, Sirius was only seen in the fire talking to Harry. The gang did not go to see him like they did in the book.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was good and MUCH better than the 3rd. Although, the 3rd book is still my favorite (story) and was very disappointed that Alfonso completely screwed it up! <br/><br/>Go see the movie. It's good, but be prepared for a lot of omissions and story combinations, due to time-constraints. But, I'm off to see it again!"
"firefox2k","7","0","1","18 November 2005"," Magical memories should not be rushed but savored
","Harry Potter and the goblet of fire, happens to be what most movie fans care to see when going to a movie based on a book. Mind you it is NOWHERE near perfect, but a GREAT and WONDERFUL delight to the HORRBILE, and devastating catastrophe that was created last year. Thank god Warner Brothers has possibly stopped hiring third rated independent directors to film a franchise movie series such as this. For people who have just tuned in to join us, my last and wonderful review helped a lot of people. I write my reviews for the non-potter lovers and followers. people who have yet to read the wonderful books, and thought that Prisoner of Azkaban was a great movie.<br/><br/>P.o.a., or as i think it should be named, ( a LOOSE interpretation of Harry potter. or P.O.S. for short.), was by far the worst movie made last year. Why you may ask, if you can answer these two questions you will know why there was a great , and tremendous task lying ahead of Mike Newell for this far better film. 1. who is Cedric Diggory, 2. who is Cho Chang. These are all questions that should have been answered but were totally omitted in the last film! So, Mike Newell has a tremendous task to catch us up to speed on the answers to these questions.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliff gives us a much better performance, only to have it highly topped by Emily Watson, who shined like a jewel. I cant wait to see these 2 in there upcoming non-potter films. Ruppert Grint gives us an OK performance, only due to bad writing all he pretty much gets to say is( ""bloody hell"", and ""no way"") Michael Gambon was dramatically better as Dumbledore in this film. No longer a bumbling biker dude but a true headmaster.<br/><br/>The one gleaming highlight that i love about films like these is the need to find new people to play new characters who will fit in great with the older cast members. we have the introduction of Stanislav Ianevski, who plays the Bulgarian quidditch star and student of Durmstang, as Viktor Krum (has all of 6 words in the movie). next we have Robert Pattinson who plays the charming and likable, Cedric Diggory( cant wait till he gets a lead in a movie, i see him as the next Pierce Brosnan, 20 years from now the next James Bond actually.)((2009 update - i see Robert already has great career with Twilight, glad to see my predictions coming true!)) Then there is Clémence Poésy who plays Fleur Delacour, Ron's big crush from Beau Baton Academy( she has all of 20 words ). Last and not least of the newcomers of the younger cast, Katie Leung , who plays a delightful Cho Chang, Harry's first crush and opposing house quidditch team seeker. For the adult cast we have the extremely talented Miranda Richardson (her part should have been extended to show the torment she had in Harry's year). last but not least we have the chilling, Ralph Fiennes, playing ""the bad dude"". (he was very well at playing Lord Voldemort, but once again, his scene was rushed and should have been extended)<br/><br/>The cinematography was MUCH better than POA( which looked like one long art-house film/ gap commercial. microphones and other flaws seen throughout the film.) The set design was excellent.( even thought they use then NEW style of Hogwarts from POA, which in POA looked more like a church graveyard than a castle of grandeur) They should revert back to the older Hogwarts in the next movies. Although the use of colors is extremely apparent in the film. Even in the Hogwarts uniforms ( YES! they actually wore the uniforms in the movie, no more gap jeans and t-shirts like POA) which made it much easier to feel like Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The other bad part of the movie, was the mispronounces of some of the magic words and names that they use in the film. my suggestion would be that they should have the actors NOT say the words, and just point their wands, and let the action happen.( as a potter fan it makes me cringe when magic words or names are mispronounced. plus as a rule of magic, that can lead to terrible results. LOL)<br/><br/>For a book to movie translation, i give this one a C-. Much better than POA, but nowhere as good as the first two movies. The movie was rushed, and should have been extended for and hour more. or as was first presented to Warner brothers two separate 2 hour movies. ( if your going to do it, do it right. ) there were no Dursleys,which would have been funny as hell to see the Weasleys meet the Dursleys. They could have show that, and would have made the movie 5 minutes longer. absolutely NO QUIDDITCH, from the world cup?!? what is going on here?!? THAT would have been something people would have talked about for weeks. And the omission of Ludo Bagman from the movie?!?! what gives?<br/><br/>For a movie for people to go watch for entertainment, i give it a B- . This movie really, truly had the potential to be a movie of the year type film. Once again, TOO RUSHED. everyone will agree to this once you see the movie. Also you never get a chance to get into the characters. or the intensity of the storyline (why cant more people take a hint from Lord of the Rings?!? 11 Oscars isn't BAD, since it was only nominated for 11) millions of fans, moviegoers, and critics CAN'T be THAT wrong."
"nightkidlaura","6","0","1","18 November 2005"," Harry lacks direction
","may contain spoilers! Goblet of fire, great acting, fantastic effects, interesting dialog but no segues. What should have been a grand sweeping story about the deadly dangerous Tri-wizard Tournament was anything but. All I really can say is I'm glad I read the book so I could follow the disjointed plot, and morn for the loss of side plots. I would have given another half an hour of my life for the segues that were needed, even the seasonal changes that were in the other three.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the dragons were awesome and the elongation of Harry's fight with the Hungarian Horntail was trilling. Mad Eye Moody/young Crouch was perfectly insane (but there was so little of Mr. Crouch that the tension wasn't on pitch for their relationship.)I believe they cut down the pensive flash back to just it's most important point. And where the maze lacked the monsters that made it tense in the book, the movie more than made up for in there choice of Voldemort and his and Harry's confrontation in the grave yard was perfect.<br/><br/>Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire was fun to watch, but is only understandable and interesting if you have read the book. There were many things that were cut out that disappointed me (Dobby and Winky, Ton Tongue Toffee, s.p.e.w., Sekeeter's bug and the Veela) and lacked continuity which made it confusing and frustrating. In conclusion, HP:GoF felt more like I was peeking in on a series of moment in Harry's life rather than a movie goer."
"giridhar-c","7","0","1","18 November 2005"," Harry disappointed me
","The movie started well with the way each new character was introduced. The plot was slowly unfolded to create maximum expectation. But harry disappointed me. The movie ended abruptly and certain areas never explained as in the book. I expected more of harry. But expectations never fulfilled. The boy wizard stayed as boy wizard. Not a bit of heroism. He was always afraid never seemed to be confident. Hermione was less ecstatic in this movie and her role was very much minimized. New characters have added spice to the movie with fresh talent. Too much hype was created before the movie was released. But it failed to sustain the hype. If it had been any other ordinary movie from Hollywood, i would have rated 10/10. But Rowling's Harry must have lived up to its fame and name. So i rate it 7."
"MSUCal","9","0","1","18 November 2005"," ""Bloody hell"", this movie was amazing.
","I consider myself as much of a Harry Potter fan as the next crazy person who sat outside in the snow for an hour just to get in the theater for the midnight showing. I'm pleased to say that this movie did NOT disappoint, and of all four, is the one that lives up most to the hype. I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I was horrified...it touched on every possible emotion, and did so in a completely realistic and non-corny way (well, as realistic as you can make a story about giants, dragons and wizards anyway.) <br/><br/>I must say I am a hard-core Hermione/Ron shipper, and this movie keeps with the book as far as giving us Hr/R followers a glimpse into the mounting turmoil and mutual attraction of their relationship. It even keeps with some of my favorite dialogue from the book. Malfoy fans will be greatly disappointed, as his exposure is limited to only 2 or 3 scenes (but oh, what good scenes they were!), and Sirius was reduced to a molten face in a fire. But I think they did a great job of picking out what was most important, and playing it out in a way that made sense to those who haven't read the books. Book fans will find themselves making mental notes of all the things that are different (there's a lot), but in its own right, it is a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. I don't even know where to begin. As for most improved, the award goes to Harry (Daniel Radcliff). He has grown by leaps and bounds as an actor from the last movie, and more than any other, truly makes you feel what he is feeling. Rupert (Ron) is hilarious and adorable as always, and Emma (Hermione) gives a stellar performance, and is truly growing into her own with the character. Cedric, Viktor, Moody and Voldemort are all brilliantly cast, and Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the Dark Lord is truly terrifying, as it should be. This movie definitely earned its PG-13 rating, and I'm glad. It's more adult, in theme, plot and action...from the undeniably suggestive Prefect bathroom scene in which Moaning Myrtle attempts to snuggle up to a naked Harry, to tales of physical love and teenage angst, to the thrilling and horrifying return of Lord Voldemort. Definitely not a children's film, as the progression of the story has grown with its audience.<br/><br/>The effects are, in a word, amazing. Nothing looked forced, or even unrealistic, actually. The dragon scene was particularly good. And, the scene where Voldemort is transformed...I was scared out of my wits. And, you get many gratuitous aerial views of the landscape that will take your breath away. The imagery, at least for me, fits all the fantasies that are had while reading the book. They seemed to pluck it right from the imagination of true Potter fans, and for that, I applaud them.<br/><br/>Even if you know the plot, this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat. I found myself laughing hysterically throughout much of the movie, and balling my eyes out when Cedric died and Harry cried over his lifeless body.<br/><br/>Because it must be said, there were some MAJOR differences that irked me a bit. The film was undoubtedly rushed, but I went into it with that expectation, knowing they had adapted 700+ pages of detailed text into 2 and a half hours. I missed the house elves, Malfoy, Snape, and many of the main characters, whose roles were drastically cut. One thing that REALLY got my blood boiling was Dumbledore's out of character explosion. We have seen time and time again that regardless of the circumstances, the chances of Dumbledore raising his voice in anger, much less grabbing at a student with obvious force, are slim to none. We've all come to love Dumbledore in that, even when Harry is acting like a stupid angsty teenager, he stands quietly aside and tries to reason, even affirms Harry's feelings. Making Dumbledore act like any NORMAL person would act is a big no-no. In addition, he was unconvincing otherwise as the strong, confident, peaceful leader that we all know Dumbledore to be. He seemed weak...and well, just off, throughout much of the film. I also felt that Harry's face-off with Voldemort, for being such a pivotal part of the story, was reduced to mere moments. Cedric, dead. Dark Lord, alive. Face-off. And back to Hogwarts. As much as I loved the Quidditch World Cup, it should have been erased from the plot to make more time for other things, like the aforementioned Harry vs. Voldemort. <br/><br/>But I went into it with the understanding that many things would be missing, and strictly from the point of simply enjoying a movie, this one is well worth the ticket price. Is it better than the book? Of course not! Is it a good adaptation of the book? Kinda. The main points are there at least. Is it an enjoyable movie? Absolutely, but one must not go in with a critical attitude if you're going to enjoy it. And in the end, I forgot about all the stuff they took out, even tried to forget that I had read the book, and concluded that this movie was absolutely, undeniably wonderful."
"thorsun42","8","0","1","18 November 2005"," Finally a HP film that does the book justice
","First the bad points. There were many scenes that seemed so rushed in its script and on screen delivery that you can easily imagine someone standing just off screen with a stopwatch saying, ""Come on! Quicker! We need this scene to be 10 seconds shorter."" Yep, that was it for the bad points! <br/><br/>NOW for the good points. Considering that the screenwriter and director had to deal with condensing such a huge book into a movie that wasn't agonizingly long, it was marvelously achieved. I applaud the cutting of cutsie elements from the book such as the elves, S.P.E.W. and a lengthy Quiddich World Cup. They just weren't necessary to keep the film moving - and keep moving it did. This 2 hour and 45 minute experience (including all the advertisements) went by so fast that I almost felt sad that it was over. The actors have certainly churned out their best performances and for the first time Daniel Radcliffe showed a true connection with his character. The others were just as comfortable in their roles and captured the troubles with teen hormones brilliantly.<br/><br/>I can't say enough praises for Brendan Gleeson's performance as Mad Eye Moody. He could be burst-out-laughing funny and then turn the mood immediately chillingly cold. Fantastic casting all around.<br/><br/>The action scenes were some of the best choreographed that I've seen in a long time. The dragon felt very real and you completely forget it is computer animated.<br/><br/>Well, that's enough from me. This movie is well worth the money to go see and I am happily going to spend the money to see it again."

","The gang at Hogwarts is back for their fourth year in the holiday blockbuster ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" They were not kidding when they told us ""Dark days lay ahead,"" for our hero Harry Potter. This fourth installment in the series is the darkest to date and is jammed with action from beginning to end. The entire cast makes their return with a few new faces. The new Defense against the Dark Arts is Mad Eye Moody, played by Brendon Gleeson and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, gossip reporter for the Daily Prophet.<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire centers on the prestigious Tri-Wizard Tournament that brings two rival schools to Hogwarts to compete. One ""lucky"" student is selected from each school when his or her name is spit out of the goblet of fire. They then must compete in a series of three challenges that risk their life battling Dragons and sea creatures. Newcomers Fleur Delacour (Clemence Posey), Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) and from Hogwarts Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson). But nothing is normal at Hogwarts, as we learned in the first three films, during the celebration the goblet spits out a fourth name you guessed it Harry Potter! The movie winds its way through marvelous special effects and edge-of-your-seat excitement to the climax that every Potter fan has been waiting for the evil Lord Voldemort! Voldemort played by Ralph Fiennes (the Constant Gardener, Red Dragon) is finally brought back to life by a group of his loyal followers called Death Eaters. Harry is forced in to a face to face confrontation with the evil wizard who murdered his parents.<br/><br/>Some more pleasant surprises feature return appearances by characters from the previous films like Sirius Black and lovely Moaning Myrtle from the ""Chamber of Secrets."" As you exit this installment in to Harry's education in the dark arts, think about what Hermione (Watson) says ""Everything is going to change now."" I, for one, can't wait! Bring on Order of the Phoenix!"

","I attended a sneak preview for this movie and I must say it's the best Potter film so farm. The Potter cast has matured and finally learned how to act. Harry is a completely believable and sympathetic character. Hermione is charming and Ron is thoroughly enjoyable in his teenage awkwardness. Funny bits are right on the money. The twins were perfectly cast. <br/><br/>The action for the most part is fast paced.

"McEnroefan","10","0","2","18 November 2005"," Intense action, intriguing plot
","After driving an hour to see this film, and getting only one half of an hour of sleep before a ruck march, I was questioning whether or not all the effort was worth it. In short, it certainly was. In this film, the characters progress from somewhat shallow early teens in the first movies, to young adults faced with life changing decisions. This movie, as it is much more serious in subject matter than the first few, is darker and in my opinion suspends disbelief very well. The visual effects, especially in the tri-wizard tourney, are superb. I would highly recommend this film to Potter fans, and just plain movie buffs alike."
"Cyklops_E_Lek","8","0","1","18 November 2005"," Potter Book Fans Flock -- The Unread...Enter at own risk.
","Let me preface this--- I have read all the books, and am on my second read through now of them. Also, I can usually ascertain the difference between the film and the literature with a separatist eye of unbiased faithfulness.<br/><br/>So--- Goblet of Fire--- Much has been made of the acting, maybe too much. It is what you should expect of the three main stars...though unfortunately, if you haven't read the books...Hermoine will not give off a very good impression, or make much sense. The rest of the cast is on par (and I think special mention deserves to go out to the twins for always capturing the scenes they're in). Now this shouldn't bring anyone out of their seats, but it should be leveled across that if you don't know the story, some of the characteristics come off somewhat contrived, and for no reason at all.<br/><br/>Which leads me to a big problem. This movie does the poorest job of the four with its story narrative. It gives many situations, and plays them out, but seemingly for no other reason than to get to the next. (sorry for the redundancy about to appear) But anyone whom has had the chance to read the books will be able to fill in gaps with ease -- those that haven't, might not understand everything that they're being fed.<br/><br/>But without getting too down on the poor mediation of the story in terms of this film or the quadrilogy of films (this being the poorest of the three) ; there is plenty to watch here. And I mean plenty.<br/><br/>This movie does feature the best special effects yet, of this series and possibly many others. You'll be hard pressed to find bones to pick about much of the imagery at all. And the action does it's best to keep up with its glossy thrust of scenery.<br/><br/>So longs as you can keep the story in front of you, the overall tone won't bother you, but I must say it leaves you wishing for a little more by the end. I won't give anything away, but I will say I would have expected a true changing of feel and tone by movies end, in comparison to the rest of the films...this doesn't really happen (with the exception of the Dual).<br/><br/>In words, without ruining it for anyone who wishes to taste it for themselves I'd say this film offers both more, and far less than its predecessors. Decide for yourself where those differences arise or merely tune out and enjoy whats provided. This movie does give you enough to sit and watch...but with little reason or back bone.<br/><br/>8/10 -- I give it a fairly high mark for it's production value and casting, but dock for it's spoon fed storyline the does it's best to keep with a 700pg plus book, but falls short of giving it meaning."
"abecipriano","8","0","1","18 November 2005"," An excellent and entertaining movie
","The fourth installment of the Harry Potter books / movies proves to be the darkest yet. With a growing cast of characters (this time, Ralph Feinnes joins as the rejuvenated Lord Voldemort), the HP series continues its momentum and in a big way! With the 3rd director of the movie series, Mike Newell (after Christopher Columbus for the first two and Alfonso Cuaron for the third), putting more serious tones at the appropriate times and injecting humor in the unique (though sometimes unnecessary ways, like HP's scene with Moaning Myrtle), he stays true to the spirit of the Goblet of Fire book.<br/><br/>With only 2+ hours, one cannot expect that it will capture in rich detail the other subplots and exciting scenes like the Quidditch World Cup. However, it shouldn't disappoint those who expect many cuts from the original book, as well as those who don't plan on reading the books.<br/><br/>The development of the main characters (Harry, Hermione and Ron) continues to grow in this picture, although other characters like Snape, McGonagall and Sirius Black take a backseat in this one. Truly a great movie and a perfect year ender (unless there's a blockbuster in the mold of this movie or Batman Begins in the late fall) to enjoy with friends and family."

","It definitely had its moments, and it is not all without merit, I think the scene in the graveyard was amazing. Overall though it lacked any sort of drive and was written for hormone ridden teenagers. I guess I should be one of those if I am watching it, but many of us are not. The books definitely have that aspect, but it does not take the main stage.<br/><br/>The characters were not bad overall. Krum and Fleur were very good, and the actor who played Diggory was really quite good. The writing for Dumbledore is awful. He can be quoting lines right out of the book and they just sound back. The feeling is all wrong. He is not someone who has any semblance of control. I highly doubt that is actor error, I think it is all in poor writing."

","By far the best Harry Potter out of the three released so far. A bit darker than the others, and in my opinion scarier, especially the depiction of Voldemort, but also more entertaining. The only part that disappointed me was the fact that they didn't show the Quidditch World Cup match. The quidditch matches are my favorite scenes in the other movies, so I was greatly anticipating this one, but it sort of just cuts off before the match begins. But I guess since they already spent about $140,000,000, supposedly, I can't really blame them. Overall the movie was fantastic though. The music was wonderful written and fit the different varieties of moods perfectly, and the graphics of the fictional beasts were phenomenal, especially the Hungarian Horn-Tailed. I also particularly LOVED the added humor in this one, especially with the Weasley twins. Most of the movie was very intense and left me sitting on the edge of my seat, shaking from the anticipation, even though I've already read the book twice. I laughed at Ron's twisting emotions towards Hermoinine and I cried at the horror of the death towards the end. This movie touches on every emotion and is sure to leave you pleased by the time you leave. HIGHLY recommend it."
"jdstevens","10","0","1","18 November 2005"," Overall a good movie, but filled with gaps.
","I love the book Goblet of Fire. Maybe I came into the movie expecting more than I should have. It is always hard to do a good book justice on the big screen (exception: Lord of the Rings).<br/><br/>At the start of the movie, the plot just took off. By the time I had settled in with my popcorn and large cola, I was already meeting the students from the other schools.<br/><br/>I felt that the acting was a little weak and fake at the first of the movie, but it definitely got better near the end. Also, I felt this movie contained some huge holes and did a weak job of explaining certain events that were explained well in the book.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and what about Dobby and the other house elves. If I am not mistaken, I think there was an entire chapter devoted to them in the book. And what about Hermoine's conquest to liberate the house elves (S.P.E.W.).<br/><br/>Another thing that I didn't like is that you hardly felt that the students were at school. I believe there was only one maybe two scenes involving a classroom. It was almost portrayed that they were only part of a tournament the whole fourth year. Don't get me wrong, that was essential to the book but they could have showed a little more schooling.<br/><br/>Now for the good news. The ending to this movie is fantastic. Let me just say that Ralph Fiennes did a spectacular job embracing the role of Lord Voldemort (woops, I mean He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named). From the point of when they entered the maze to the final scene, I was pleased. I just hope that is a sign of what is to come in the 5th movie.<br/><br/>Overall it is a hit and miss movie. Still, you must see it. You won't be completely disappointed, but if you are not familiar with the books you may be left in the dark. It is worth your money. I just wish some of the parts were a little slower with more detail. Again, they did an awesome job with the ending.<br/><br/>That is all."

","This movie as many have said before me is very ""good"". As with the previous potter films i found it very entertaining but i did have qualms especially with this one. The director used his ""directors license"" a bit to much in this film to the point where it annoyed me. Don't get me wrong i enjoyed it and it is a fine piece of film i just had problems with certain things. spoiler don't read ahead<br/><br/>for example Dumbledore seizing harry and yelling at him or Viktor Krum being a buff guy strutting his stuff, it was all just backwards. Other problems were the fact that there was no quidditch and that the first 200 pages were crammed into the first 5 minutes. I give this movie a 7 out of 10 because it was a good adaptation and i know the director did his best. I guess what I'm saying is that the 4th harry potter novel couldn't have been adapted into a movie in a way that would please me with a running length that most moviegoers would accept. As a film its great as an adaptation its mediocre at best. I'm hoping for bigger things from the next film but am expecting an even bigger let down."

","Harry Potter has finally come onto the silver screen for its fourth incarnation. From a strictly cinematic perspective, this was a fairly decent movie. I definitely has come a long way from Sorcerer's Stone in that this movie is much more adult. It has many scenes that could be considered too dark or scary for the typical under ten year old viewer. The cinematography is excellent though, with a brilliant combination of both set and cgi shots.<br/><br/>Now, I know that I am going to come off as a book snob as I write this, so get the badgering out of your system. This movie deviates on so many levels from the story it is atrocious. Many scenes are cut, including the entire beginning with the Dursleys. A crucial part of the story, about the plot to kill Harry, involves a character who isn't even supposed to really be introduced until very late in the story. Also many visual aspects are not as how they are described. All in all, these really will only affect you if you have diligently read the book, and have certain expectations already in place as to how the movie is supposed to play out.<br/><br/>Go and see it for yourself, but know now that this artistic work stands on its own, with only its skeletal story taken from the book itself."

","I just got back (literally just walked in the door) from the midnight showing of this movie and all I have to say is ""Wow!"" This movie exceeded all of my expectations. After the third movie left out so many vital plot points and confused the timeline, I was concerned that the movie version of a book twice the size of the 3rd would leave out and confuse even more important information. Needless to say, I left the theater after the third one slightly disappointed and believed that I would have the same reaction to this film. Not so.<br/><br/>This film, on the whole, stayed very true to the book. Small things were left out or changed but it did not have a tremendous effect on the plot. I did feel that some parts were rushed, but given that Kloves was given a 2.5 hour time limit, I understand the reasoning behind the parts he rushed and feel that he made good calls with what to leave in and what to throw out. All of the main characters, especially Daniel Radcliffe, have improved their acting tremendously in this film. The parts were cast so well. All emotions (by all characters)were expressed so well both in dialogue and facial expressions. I believed every character. Such was never the case in previous Potter films. There was, in my opinion, a perfect balance of comedy, drama, suspense, and action. Very, very few ""cheesy"" moments that I wish had been done differently, and no aspect of the film was overdone. I personally loved the sly comments by ""Mad-Eye"" Moody which the view does not understand the significance of until after the film is complete (unless, of course, they have previously read the books).<br/><br/>This is, in my opinion, by far the best Harry Potter film released to date.

They really needed to add some stuff. <br/><br/>I'm compelled to shave my head, get snake eye contacts and cut my nose off.<br/><br/>But I really loved how Ralph portrayed The Dark Lord. Wonderfully done.<br/><br/>Hated: Harry had the dream at The Burrow. Didn't have Mr. or Mrs. Weasely much. Didn't go into the woods during the Death Eater riots. Didn't feature any elves. Didn't have anything about S.P.E.W. YOU NEEDED DOLBY!<br/><br/>Overall...8 out of 10.<br/><br/>~e~"

","It did not really go completely along with the book, but with the 2hours and 30 minutes that they had to work with, it was excellent.<br/><br/>The movie takes you into a whole new realm of what is going on in the world of magic.<br/><br/>Lord Voldermort is ugly.<br/><br/>I suggest that everyone go see the movie NOW!<br/><br/>I just saw the midnight showing of it, and instantly fell in love, I was disappointed that they did not show the dursleys at all. Instead the went from the riddle house to the burrow. They also did not, in my opinion do a very good job casting some of the characters. Mad-eye Moody was not at all what I had expected. Nor were the Patil twins, though everyone else did a very good job. 10 For Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire!"

","Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire book has won millions of hearts with its great storyline and imagination. J.K Rowling has done her part well as an author, creating such beautiful imagination with one thing in her mind: Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived. And thus creating more books on Harry and his adventures which Christopher Columbus chose to helm this book series to the big screen. Though he has chose not to film the 3rd book, Alfonso Cuaron took the director seat and made it the worst of the trilogy(only had 3 HP films at that time.) I'm so glad that Mike Newell took the 4th book and portrayed real good on screen.<br/><br/>It is Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts and this year is special because Hogwarts is about the hold the Triwizard Tournament with other two magic schools, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Whoever wins gets the Triwizard cup. Only 3 champions are chosen in the competition but Harry turns out to be the 4th champion. Harry nearly died in all three tasks. In the end, it turns out that all of these events are planned by an evil wizard.<br/><br/>Actors were excellent in their roles. Really superb. Newcomers like Robert Pattinson(Cedric Diggory), Stanislav Ianevski(Viktor Krum), Katie Leung(Cho Chang), Clémence Poésy(Fleur Delacour) were great but the director didn't gave much time to the audiences to generate the characters of the other 3 champions and Harry's crush. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson acting's were great and Rupert Grint's Ron was the eye candy actor of the film. Most of his scenes were filled with humour. Alastor Moody, Brendan Gleeson, was also great. Ralph Fiennes as the evil Voldermort is convincingly fantastic. <br/><br/>The setting of the film were also great. The Great Hall, the Prefects Bathroom and Castle of Hogwarts(outside). I have only one thing to say: WOW! Dragons, big and small, were terribly great! They actually built a 40 foot long ""Hungarian Horntail"". The soundtrack were also fabulous.<br/><br/>One flaw of the film was that some of the parts weren't explain in the end. It's like you ask a question and that question was never answered in the end. It's frustrating for the people who never read the books.<br/><br/>There's only one thing to say to those who haven't watch this exciting film: Go and catch this film!"
