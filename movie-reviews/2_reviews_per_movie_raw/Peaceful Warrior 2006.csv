"rtolz","10","223","262","5 May 2006"," The first spiritually oriented movie that really works!
","I was invited to a screening of The Peaceful Warrior in NYC Thursday April 13th, having just learned of this film's existence a few days earlier.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to the film, but with some trepidation, considering that prior attempts at communicating spiritually oriented books or ideas had fallen short of my expectations and had fundamentally failed to convey to the audience a transforming inner experience; witness What the Bleep, Siddhartha, Little Buddha, and others.<br/><br/>Let me say this, simply and directly. They got it right this time, and they did it in a way which could be embraced by crowds at the multiplexes. By impressing the discovery of bona fide spiritual truths on a recognizable sports template, the movie makers will be carrying under-appreciated ideas and experiences to the masses. At least I hope so! I actually woke up early the morning after seeing this, with my mind full of things I might say in an exhaustive review. Never in my life have I felt that way about a movie before.<br/><br/>The reason this movie succeeds is that it follows one of the most basic rules for good story-telling: it shows rather than tells. Although some fundamental spiritual ideas are described with words, it is the plot and character development that proves the truth of those words. You see the transcendence and the realizations in the faces of the characters, and you are not left to wonder why. You understand.<br/><br/>The story, based on a book by Dan Millman, follows a college gymnast who has great potential but whose desire for success is one of the main obstacles standing in the way of that potential. In his mindless pursuit of a goal, he becomes sucked into the deep dark hole of life-is-what-happens-while-you're-making-other-plans. In its simplest message, our hero's real challenge is to find happiness by being present and finding interest and love for what's right in front of him.<br/><br/>The film doesn't try to oversimplify the content of a spiritual path into a single dogma; there are many other seeds of thought strewn along the path by Socrates, each of which could have been the basis for a different struggle to transcend relative unconsciousness.<br/><br/>For many years I have been convinced that non-religious spiritual thought and experience could be something to drive the world in a new direction. This movie provides an example of what life can be like if we ponder these thoughts and implement them in our lives in a concrete and practical way. It's not necessary to be a champion gymnast to derive the fundamental teachings from this film. It is a teaching that anyone can understand. This is why I see that The Peaceful Warrior can inspire those who embrace the possibilities which it offers to become peaceful guerrilla warriors, working tirelessly underneath the radar, changing the world.<br/><br/>This is not only a good movie, it's an important one."
"OntheMidway","9","148","183","4 May 2006"," A Great Film with an Important Message
","I've long been a fan of the book upon which this film is based -- Dan Millman's The Way of the Peaceful Warrior.<br/><br/>If you've read the book, you know its central lesson is learning how to live in the moment.<br/><br/>Filled with memorable aphorisms, the book is part novel, part autobiography, and part spiritual guidebook -- and I have to admit that I was nervous about how the book would translate to the big screen.<br/><br/>But I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening of the film. And for fans of the book like me -- and people who've never read it -- this film delivers. <br/><br/>Nick Nolte's performance as Socrates is one of the best he's ever given. Scott Mechlowicz does a great job showing us the transformation of Dan Millman. And the feeling one has when one walks out of the theater-- of wanting to seize every moment that life offers you-- is a feeling that we don't get often enough. That feeling is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>Peaceful Warrior is that rare film that manages to be hugely inspirational without being cheesy. It's well worth seeing."
"wtharrison","10","72","92","2 June 2006"," Excellent adaptation of a powerful and important book
","I've appreciated Dan Millman's work for many years, and I have looked forward to seeing how well this film would be done. I saw it last night at a preview screening, and I was very pleased, and very moved, by it. The message is profound and important. While at one level it might be dismissed as something ""we already know"", when we look around our society, it's obvious we don't. Last night the actors themselves in a live teleconference after the screening shared how -- unlike most of their work -- being involved in THIS film changed their own lives too. <br/><br/>There are many moments which are quite funny. There is much that is quite moving. If you are at all open to the real story in the film, you will not walk out of the theater thinking only of your next snack.<br/><br/>There is not a classic battle between good guys and bad guys here. Rather it gives us some tools and insight to deal with the conflicts within ourselves. I hope that many, many people get to see this film."
"tooluser-1","10","72","96","9 June 2006"," Truly The Best Movie Of The Year
","I read the book back in the mid '80s and at that time there was much I did not understand fully,I may have thought I did however as the last 20 years have bloomed in my life I know that my views were clouded by what I thought I knew rather than the experiences and revelations which come to a life consciously lived.<br/><br/>That is what this movie is all about,breaking free from all the misconceptions we have and living in the moment,a moment that is rich with all the things we think are missing and in actuality are present in every heartbeat,so close and in our face that most of us miss it.<br/><br/>Its what Socrates calls being asleep while walking around living our lives and missing the fullness of life which surrounds us completely.<br/><br/>I saw this movie then re-read the book and while I would recommend the book over the Movie,if you go into the theater with a mind willing to see something new about yourself,as opposed to being a critic,then it is possible to come away with a new prospective about your place in this world.<br/><br/>Of course letting go of what we call mind would be even better.<br/><br/>If anyone has ever read ""The Art Of War"" by Sun Tzu then you know what the Peaceful Warrior concept is all about. The greatest warrior of all is one who has resolved the battle within oneself.<br/><br/>That is what this Movie is showing us and in my view the human race would be far better if all did this work.<br/><br/>Very few movies actually leave you with something to consider about how we run our lives in the way this one does and if you are willing to be open to these lessons,then you will get far more than the price of admission.<br/><br/>This one is worth 10 stars,for what it shows us about ourselves."
"pbars319","9","71","95","2 June 2006"," not your typical movie
","A truly inspiring movie that everyone can relate to in some way. This movie is not going to please everyone because you have to see it for what it is, a movie about self awareness, its not a typical 'lets go out on a Friday night to be entertained' kind of movie. It's not just about gymnasts; anyone can relate to it. Take this movie for what it is, don't read too far into the message and you will enjoy it. Some people are saying it's a cheesy movie with an overplayed message, but I say that those people don't even see what the movie is about. Maybe it didn't speak to them, and maybe their expectations were off. The message is certainly not over-played, and there needs to be more movies of this up-coming genre."
"calimanders","8","103","145","1 May 2006"," Really good!
","I saw this movie at a screening,(ironically at UCLA) and I really liked it. The only part I didn't like about it was the odd editing they did to make UCLA look like Cal. Of course, I'm a Bruin, so maybe I could tell the differences more. <br/><br/>The movie itself was sad, but at the same time, inspiring. One of the best parts of this movie is the student-teacher relationship between Dan and Socrates, his mentor. This movie hits home because it almost portrays the classic American Dream and the many people who chase it. Dan Milliman, the main character, is living the good life: he's one of the best athletes on the team, popular with the girls, still gets excellent grades. In all, his life is perfect. Yet, in a strange way, he's not entirely satisfied with his life, and you can see that the way he is living isn't good for his well-being. When he meets his mentor, he goes through an entire mental cleansing that is portrayed with humor and poignancy.<br/><br/>In the end, the point of this movie is not whether he reaches his goal or not, but the process of going there, and thats what makes this movie worthwhile."
"DWelch3734","10","83","124","4 May 2006"," A movie about a world class gymnasts transformation
","I highly recommend this movie. Actually there are two movies, an excellent sports movie, and and even better movie about the human spirit. There are many important messages. It really is amazing what you can do when you are truly in the now, completely present. Nick Nolte plays a very grounded sage who's ability to teach Dan with out preaching could get him nominated for best supporting actor. I loved Scott Mechlowicz as Dan. He surely is one of then best young actors in the business. The fact that you still love him in the beginning when he is so full of himself and his self importance is a tribute to Scott as a person and his acting ability. And who wouldn't want Amy Smart to heal his or her broken heart."
"Shapeshifter-2","10","54","79","4 June 2006"," A real meaningful film
","I have seen Peaceful Warrior three times and get more out of it with each showing! Everyone who has come to see it plans on seeing it again and they are bringing more friends. I think this is the summer time ""sleeper"" hit. It has opened in limited release on the West coast, but will get a wider release in the upcoming weeks. Not only is it entertaining, it is loaded with great messages without being preachy and saccharine-laced. The camera-work, editing, direction, and acting are all first rate. It is clear that this film is a labor of love as opposed to a labor of over the top, slam-bang, car chasing, explosion laced commercialism. If you are looking for a true feel good movie for a change, get out and see this one."
"shadowgolem-1","5","13","16","2 April 2007"," Great book, ""meh"" movie
","I read this book when I was 19 and it actually changed my life. (I even became a Vegetarian. LONG before it became popular in the Midwest.) This movie was just OK. I'm glad I did not have to pay to see it. I took my Wife with me to see it and she, having not read the book, was confused as to how this story could have had such a profound effect on me. The movie is like a rather poor cliff-notes version of the book. The acting is a bit wooden and you never get to know the main character enough to care much about him. There are some significant changes to the plot from the book to the movie. These are major changes that reduce the importance and context of the lessons and reduce this to a ""Karate-Kid"" (as some other reviewers noticed) without a good script or decent action sequences and only so-so acting. Frankly, Sting would have been a better choice for the casting of Socrates.<br/><br/>My advice would be to read the book and skip the movie unless you ""REALLY"" like one of the actors in it and will see anything they make just because."
"guardianangelmgt","10","73","113","5 May 2006"," Message received, no distortion! ;-)
","I read the Novel in year 2000. The book literally changed my DNA. There is such magic in the way the story is told it really sinks into your fibers. The movie is exactly the fantasy I saw in my head as I read each page of this inspired book. The biggest thing that hit home is how our Ego can run our lives and trick us into believing it is actually who we are. There is a powerful scene in this film around the above comment on Ego. For that reason alone, it should not be missed and will be remembered for a lifetime.<br/><br/>When the student is ready the teacher will appear, and vice versa.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it.

"shootthepier","9","61","97","16 May 2006"," A Warrior
","As a huge fan of this book, I applaud Nic, Scott and the production team involved in getting this movie off the ground. This story must not have been easy to get made. But this is the most important movie of today, for today. I did find the musical cues to be overly used and not as dramatic as they could've been, but aside from this I was at the edge of my seat, waiting for NIc to add some wisdom to my life, so that I can go out there and be a better person. Nic, as the character of Soc does just that. The movie delivers where it should, straight to your heart. In this day of the much necessary age of awareness I HIGHLY recommend anyone who wants to be better and even be the best they can be to go and watch this film, recommend this film, watch it again, buy it on DVD and support these types of projects in any way you can. Imagine if we can get the kids of today to truly understand the lessons presented in this movie - it could change the world and the medium of film reaches enough people to do just that."
"SnoopyStyle","5","4","4","23 December 2015"," supernatural self-help spirituality
","Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) is an University gymnast haunted by fears and close to qualifying for the Olympics. He's reckless hard-partying young man. After a nightmare, he goes running and encounters gas station attendant Socrates (Nick Nolte) who may have supernatural powers. Socrates asks him ""Are you happy?"" He also meets Joy (Amy Smart) at the station. Dan accepts Socrates' offer to train him as a real warrior.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte as a spiritual guide is mind-bender. Scott Mechlowicz is OK as a brash young man but Paul Wesley could be better. He doesn't have the likability when he acts like a douche. There is a lot of zen spiritual self-help Miyagi stuff being spewed but it overwhelms the movie at times. I don't particularly like the lead character and I don't particularly get the message from this message movie. It exists and yet it doesn't."
"burton_joanna","4","4","4","18 January 2012"," Book was way better
","I really wanted this movie to be better than it was. But I guess it's hard to compare to the book, which is much better. Too many predictable conventions.<br/><br/>Not saying it was really bad, just so-so and competent, and not terribly good. <br/><br/>I thought Nick Nolte was passable, but some of the dialog was unneeded. Film is after all a visual medium. There has to be a better way to show a story like this. But at least they tried, and that is worth something.<br/><br/>Watch this on cable or DVD if you don't have anything else to watch, but you want to remember what was possible with the book."
"lanternslatrans","1","10","14","7 January 2017"," Worthless
","Alright, so going through the reviews it's painfully obvious someone who created the movie is writing overwhelmingly positive reviews under recently created accounts to bump up the IMDb score... seeing how they all give ten stars, have atrocious grammar, and are all within the same time frame. And, every other review names the movie as it actually is, a disgusting waste.<br/><br/>Now, the fake comments easily summarize the movie for what it is; a fake, corporate, pretentious and phoned-in mess. <br/><br/>The movie was written as a Hallmark produced pamphlet of inspirational quotes- which really isn't that far from the original source material. Mindless things you've heard a thousand times, like ""be yourself!"" and ""live in the now!"". The dialogue is cringe, clichéd and delivered with obnoxious performances. <br/><br/>I hate Nick Nolte for this. His stupid, monotone, pretentious lines and delivery; his character, named Socrates, is so infuriatingly on- the-nose with third grade reading level symbolism it's disgusting.<br/><br/>Our main man is an Andrew Garfield discount, with a third of the charm or skill. He is written the way evangelical moms or corporate producers think college students are like. He's insufferable, unlikable, and you're frustrated or bored with him.<br/><br/>The characters are all cardboard cutouts and fill some stupid, mindless quota of what some dribbling idiot thought a movie about sports and inspirational quotes should be. The story line and pacing alone will make you irritated.<br/><br/>The cinematography and set design is so bad, it somehow makes Berkeley and the East Bay look like a stucco and beige paint wasteland. The shots are vague and boring, over-the-shoulder. Everything feels so plastic and fake (which also describes the entire movie). <br/><br/>This movie is for idiots who like sports that nobody cares about, and have such completely worthless lives they need to pick up HallMark cards with slogans literally written into this movie.<br/><br/>God almighty."

As an anonymous night gas station attendant, nicknamed Socrates (Nick Nolte) , keeps questioning every assumption in his destination . Then a motorcycle crash breaks Dan's legs , and his bright future in Olympic Games .

The movie works at usual manner , though contains weird events and packs good feeling . Stirring and enjoyable screenplay by Kevin Bernhardt , an usual actor and art martial fighter . Good main cast as Nick Nolte as the rare trainer Socrates , furthermore a beautiful Amy Smart . Secondary appearance of young actors as Agnes Bruckner , Paul Wesley and the coach , well played by Tim DeKay . Director Salva frequently works with 'Ray Wise' who as usual plays a brief acting as a doctor . And the author of the book on which the film is based, Dan Millman , can be glimpsed for a brief moment as the driver of the car at the gas station when Dan exercises for the first time after his motorcycle crash.<br/><br/>The motion picture was professionally directed by Victor Salva , he tries for profundity at the end and blow it. Salva is an expert on suspense's creator of atmospheres, such as he proved in : ¨The nature of the beast (1995)¨, which Salva wrote and directed, starred Lance Henriksen and Eric Roberts and quickly became New Line Cinema's biggest direct-to-video title of that year, ¨Powder¨, ¨Rites of passage¨ and ¨Clownhouse¨. His next film, this ¨The peaceful Warrior¨ (2006) , was very significant to him because of the year he spent in prison , he credits the original story as ""a story that changed my life"". Rating : acceptable and passable , but especially appointed to gymnasts ."

","I was so excited when I read a movie was being made of this great book. I really wanted to like this movie. Very little time was spent on Dan's actual Journey. The premonitions of seeing Socrates were missing, so Dan had no reason to be intrigued at the Service station. What happened to the teaching of the importance of humor? And why the gratuitous shower scene? Why did Dan always look angry - especially after his enlightenment - whenever he approached an apparatus? He was supposed to be at Peace (even if his message to his Coach was an 'I'll show you"" - which defeats the purpose of releasing the Ego ). Too much screen time of guys with there shirts off. As an after-school TV movie - it was terrific; as a movie of this very special book - a major disappointment."
"pammie416","8","20","33","2 June 2006"," Great Movie!
","I really liked this movie. Gives a good feeling after watching it. I'm going to see it again with a couple of friends. Nick Nolte is one of my favorite actors and he does a great job here. I read the book by Dan Millman and I found it to be very uplifting. The other actors were pretty good, and the story moves along really well. I went to the Peaceful Warrior website which was pretty cool too. I think everyone ought to go see the movie. It's important to watch movies like this if you've every had difficult times in your life and have struggled a lot. It gives you a different perspective on things. I think the screenplay was very well written also."

Nolte evidently has had a lobotomy.<br/><br/>This was a film about wisdom seemingly made by high schoolers who had read a comic book and become ""enlightened"".<br/><br/>A dash of Karate Kid, a little Rocky and a whole lot of Ishtar.<br/><br/>The best that can be said is that this was a low budget film and not a lot of money was wasted. Unless it was a tongue-in-cheek satire, it was one of the worst films ever made.<br/><br/>You need to run your head into a brick wall a few times before you watch this and, if you like it, you need to return to the wall and hit it much harder."

","I will be open and honest here. I did not really enjoy this movie. There I said the truth and the truth is all that matters. Not only was there a lack in acting, but script, drama, and action.<br/><br/>The story is about a young gymnast who has an injury. He is down and out and seems he won't make it again. But then you have the gas station 'zen master', for lack of a better term, who changes his life. You can only guess that, yes, he overcomes his injury and coach's objection and becomes involved in the sport again.<br/><br/>None of this really worked for me. In fact the only part I really enjoyed was the mugging scene. It was the strangest mugging scene I have seen because the 'zen master' helps the muggers by suggesting what to take after they are about to leave. Needless to say, seeing two men walk away in only their undergarments was quite funny.<br/><br/>But the film was not saved with that scene. Everything else is predictable and quite boring. Nothing original so I can't give it a high grade. ""D-"""

The bathroom cleaning scene and the leaf-sweeping were reminiscent of Karate Kid. I kept waiting for Socrates to call Danny ""Grasshopper."" <br/><br/>The characters were quite forgettable because they were never fully developed. The potential for deep understanding of the characters was never tapped. A movie of this genre should leave the viewers with the impression they know the people in the situations.

I did even recognize him at first. Scott Mechlowicz was amazing playing Dan Millman. I have already placed my order to own the DVD! I have to wonder why I have never heard of Dan Millman before.

","This may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly in the bottom three. I hate to say it because they gave me a free ticket, but the film manages to be both creepy and incredibly boring at the same time. It's a cheap rip-off of 1984's The Karate Kid, without karate, a kid, or Pat Morita. (Yes, it's that bad.) I kept hoping the main character's leg would shatter into a million pieces, as in the opening scene, so I could leave the theater. <br/><br/>It's really too bad, because I hoped that the marketing ploy of giving away thousands of free tickets would prove successful, so other films would repeat it. But, this movie is not worth my time, even when the ticket is free. <br/><br/>It says a great deal about how bad this film is when I say that the best scenes involve shots of men's gymnastics. I'm sure it's a demanding sport, but it's not visually the most exciting thing that ever happened on film.<br/><br/>I never developed any empathy for or rapport with the main character. In fact, although I don't usually approve of on-screen violence, I kept hoping he would crash his motorcycle head-on into an 18-wheeler, just to put us both out of our misery. Pride is a better sports movie. The Shooter is a better action flick. Namesake is a better exploration of spirituality and cultures. I finally left the theater and went home to do something fun like organize my linen closet -- the movie is that bad!"
"ptoddf","10","9","15","21 September 2006"," A most unusual movie
","There are too few, almost no, movies that feature the interior experience, that detail the struggle to becoming a real and better person, as Peaceful Warrior does. This is not external moralism or overcoming a particular tragic life circumstance. It is not joining a particular club. Rather, this film demonstrates one way, and therefore in principle suggests many ways of finding a joyous, self directed life path based on the interior experience. The very idea that this is a life possibility seems revolutionary amidst the usual, often nearly nihilistic filmic fare.<br/><br/>Best, Todd."
"bob-rutzel-1","9","6","9","15 September 2007"," Powerful, Worthwhile
","This is based on true events we are told at the beginning.<br/><br/>Dan Millman (Mechlowicz) aspires to be an Olympic competitor and his whole life is turned around when he meets Socrates (Nolte) at a gas station one night when he couldn't sleep.<br/><br/>I thought this was going to be about a handicapped person who triumphs. After viewing the first few minutes of this, I couldn't think it would be anything else. But, it's not that at all. Dan can't sleep one night and goes for a run and ends up at a gas station for some water. He meets Socrates and is moderately impressed with him. Scott leaves the station, and sees Socrates walk out of the shop and sit in a chair outside. Scott walks on a couple more steps and looks back. Socrates is now standing on the roof of the gas station. How did he get up there in that short a time? Okay, now I was hooked on the movie. You will be too.<br/><br/>Yes, it almost seems like a Karate Kid movie with out the karate and in some ways, it is. Socrates takes Dan under his wing and teaches him about life and new values. Dan feels he doesn't need all this philosophy and preaching and resists for a while, but you know he will give in. And, you feel better when he does.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and here in this movie he transcends everything he has done before. There is no other way to say it. Scott Mechlowicz looks like Tony Perkins in some ways, but for some reason I kept thinking this was a Keneau Reeves role.<br/><br/>Dan Millman is a real person and has written books on spirituality, and enlightenment. Some book titles include The Way of the Peaceful Warrior, and The Journeys of Socrates.<br/><br/>To be honest, this is a movie that we should buy and give as gifts. And, the movie is worth seeing more than once and I will do so one day.<br/><br/>Violence:Not really, Sex: Some scenes actually show make-outs that don't last long, Nudity: No, Language: No"

","I agree with other comments that the part of Dan was filled wonderfully by Scott. I did not like the choice for his sage. which is is odd for me as I love Nick Nolte in about anything. The story was a great one about Dan Millman, but if you have read he book, really read it, you will be disappointed in the presentation of Socrates. Not Nick's fault I am sure, but just not him. Otherwise the movie was enjoyable and had outstanding gymnastics. As in many book movies, it is hard to decide what to put in and what to sacrifice. I believe, it is always hard to follow a classic book with a movie, there should be Peaceful Warrior 2 and Peaceful Warrior 3 to do it justice in content! ""What Dreams May Come"" and ""Somewhere In Time"" were examples of doing justice to the book, but they were shorter books. So all in all, it was a good movie, but not as good as the book except for Scott, who fit the part perfectly. I would recommend reading the book to everyone."

","The books are excellent. One better than the other. This movie however, was a poor representation of the book. Not only this, as a ""stand alone"" movie, it is horrible. Poor directing. Convoluted plot. The major themes were missing and distorted. It seems like they wanted to be in the categories of movies like ""What the Bleep"" and ""Secret."" It was a miserable attempt that fell VERY short. The uplifting, inspirational themes in the books were completely absent. One left the movie feeling confused, certainly not inspired.<br/><br/>I think the movie could have been at least average if not superior had the director and/or writer(s) taken more time to develop the characters and to clarify the direction of the plot. It was a""hodge-podge"" of sorts. If you put this together as a book, it would have read Chapter 1, Chapter 5, Chapter 3, summary, Chapter 7 of another book etc. No flow. No direction. Certainly, no inspiration.<br/><br/>It is an extreme disappointment to say the least."

I should have known I was in trouble when the theater didn't turn the lights down all the way. I thought that it was just an incompetent projectionist but after thinking about it I now know the real reason that they left the lights on: to keep people awake! Except for the times that Scott Mechlowicz's character was interacting with Nick Nolte, I was bored to tears. Nolte did his best with sophomoric platitudes like ""take out the trash in your mind"" and other such homilies. But the dialog between Scott Mechlowicz's and his teammates was stilted and unrealistic. I can't remember their exact lines but do I remember remarking to my friend ""this dialog is really lame, isn't it?"" And she agreed! As for the plot, it meandered all over the place before coming to a predictable, if somewhat rushed conclusion. And after the movie was over, I somewhat loudly remarked that the director should stick to horror films (Salva directed Jeepers Creepers)! Others in the crowd voiced their approval. So, to sum up, if this movie wasn't free, I would be asking for my money back!"

"Michael-70","1","14","29","27 July 2006"," Sub-Mental Twaddle Combined With New Age Lunacy, But Scott Mechlowicz is good!
","I was wary about seeing this film because everything in the preview indicated I would find it insufferable, but I went to see it for one reason only and I am glad I did. The film follows a young gymnast named Dan Millman (played by Scott Mechlowicz) who is very talented, but arrogant and selfish which means he has to be knocked down a peg or two by the movies end. Through the course of Peaceful Warrior, Dan will also learn something about life, love and himself. Good luck keeping from vomiting. I failed but fortunately I had not eaten lunch, so I only had dry heaves.<br/><br/>Not only does Peaceful Warrior espouse a philosophy no deeper than your average Chinese Restaurant fortune cookie, but it adds a level of mystical New Age crap on top that truly pushes the film into the realm of the insulting. Here's an example of a great truth according to the film, ""the hardest people to love are the ones who need love the most"". Right, like Adolf Hitler and Jeffrey Dahmer.<br/><br/>Apparently, our gymnast hero Dan Millman (who already has a coach who is dedicated and caring) has not learned such basic things like the importance of focusing your mind on your immediate task when doing a complicated gymnastics routine. Dan has to get this nugget of wisdom from a grizzled old gas station attendant (played by a grizzled old Nick Nolte) who appears out of the night mist at a service station and may actually exist only in Dan's mind.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with stories about people overcoming great odds and succeeding despite handicaps. Stories like that should be wonderful and inspiring but all too often they are just depressing and full of boneheaded, limp platitudes that offer nothing in the way of insight. This film is supposed to be inspired by real events and I don't doubt that the real Dan Millman overcoming a severely broken leg to get back up and become successful at gymnastics was not a great feat. But what is all of this ""way of the warrior"" crap? I immediately thought of the guys from Murderball and how none of them needed a fuzzy brained guru named Socrates to succeed and recover. They did it the natural way, with human brains, sweat, hard work and the help of family and friends.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte's phantom-like character appears just when our hero Dan has been having a spell of bad dreams, such as having his ankle shatter in to a million pieces of frozen chicken breast. Then, like Yoda chairing an AA meeting, he spouts fanciful parables and nonsense blather about ""taking out the mental trash"" and being ""in the moment"". Socrates (as Dan calls him which is an insult to the real Socrates) even advocates not thinking of the future or the past, as if that were good advice! Think about that for a second. If you never think of the past or the future then you are living like Guy Pearce did in the film Memento. Yeah, that's an improvement.<br/><br/>Focusing on the here and now is generally good advice, but our guru has to toss poor Danny off a bridge into a creek for him to learn that. ""Your mind was focused on only one thing while you were falling"", Socrates tells him, ""you even had a word for it, ""Ahhhh!"" Do you imagine the poor people who jumped from the World Trade Center were very focused? I don't think so. I'm sure they each had a lot of very different feelings and emotions going through their minds. Too bad they couldn't be as disciplined as our gymnast hero and his flaky gas jockey guru. They might have died happy.<br/><br/>Still, despite the psychobabble and sub-mental twaddle that passes for insight, Scott Mechlowicz makes this a tolerable film. He is a young actor to watch. With his slender physique and expressive face, he seems to be able to run a gamut of emotion. He was unique among the cast of Mean Creek in that he was simultaneously the most menacing of the boys, but also the one you felt most sorry for. He was delightfully goofy in EuroTrip and he seems to be an actor of good range and he is cute as hell. He will get better looking as he gets older and I don't think we've seen all that this guy can do. I hope he's in more comedies, but I will see almost anything he's in. He is the only reason I stayed to watch this film until the end."

Many of them had disappeared from our minds, maybe too much common developments. <br/><br/>The content of this film is beautiful, (and I will buy the book that inspired it), but I got disappointed with the flat directing job; poor acting; the constantly choreography of the Director of Photography, when he was catching the characters' acting, others' reactions; playing a lot with ""showing off"" camera movements; poor editing; weak and predictable screenplay; the unnecessary repetition of sounds effects and ""triumphal"" music scores highlighting the emotional moments...that pulled me out of the film instead get the objective...it didn't touch meand as I wrote beforepoor directing work.<br/><br/>It looked more like a ""cheesy"" Sunday TV film.

As a film there are some real problems here. First of all, its lead character is thoroughly unlikeable. There is no time to get an emotional attachment to Dan, as presented on film he is a most dislike-able jerk.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film is weak on story. It has it ""Rocky"" moments, but we cared about Rocky. The film is so intent on delivering the little pearls of wisdom that we are all looking form, that it comes across like a recitation of everything one should know for a final exam.<br/><br/>There are good points.

There's not much of a plot, the Nolte-aphorisms sound like they came from Pat Morita in THE KARATE KID, and frankly the whole set up seems absurd to me from the get-go. A movie that pretends to plumb the depths of human experience really ought to deliver something more than ""seize the moment"".

This might be second worst movie I've seen this year. ""The Karate Kid"" was a treacly, formulaic story of an adolescent learning his buddhist lessons well and finally overcoming the bully in the end. ""The Peaceful Warrior"" is a treacly, formulaic story about an adolescent college student who learns his buddhist lessons well (from Nick Nolte???) and must face the film's final test. Will he win or will he lose? You'll figure it out within the first 10 minutes of the film.

","More of a self-help guide for the Zen needy, PEACEFUL WARRIOR does have some good acting, a solid (albeit schmaltzy) message, and some amazing filming using light and shade.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Dan Millman's autobiographical novel ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"", the film focuses on Millman's over-inflated ego during his time as a super-gymnast yet having dark dreams related to failure. Unable to sleep, Dan (played by Scott Mechlowicz) frequents the streets of Berkeley, California in the wee hours of the morning only to stumble across a wise Zen-like master with no name whom Dan labels as ""Socrates."" Socrates (Nick Nolte, OFF THE BLACK) sees Dan's misguided spirit as a challenge and eventually allows Dan to see a path to inner enlightenment via the ""here and now."" Initially Dan sees this as shamanistic rubbish but quickly learns that he can apply Socrates' knowledge to help better his gymnastic abilities. Still focused on selfishness (wanting to win Olympic Gold) Dan finds himself injured after a horrific motorcycle accident and must come to terms with the fact that he may never walk again.<br/><br/>With the help of Socrates, Dan not only walks but does the impossible.<br/><br/>The message of the film is valid if you believe in such things as focusing energy only on the ""now"" and ""throwing out the trash"" that rattles around in your head every minute of every day. Doing so, according to Millman's philosophy, will allow you to become not only a better person, but a better whatever-you-are in your professional life.<br/><br/>Mechlowicz and Nolte play well off each other, one being the cocky upstart and the other a wise and patient sage (perhaps even a ghost).<br/><br/>But the real winner here is the light and shading of much of the film's images, especially whenever Mechlowicz enters the gas station where Nolte's character works. The dark aspect of the station gradually lightens up as Millman comes to accept what he's being taught. Also the motorcycle crash that injures Millman is done in fine slow-motion action with acrobatics to stop the heart of most movie watchers.<br/><br/>All in all it's good film. Not great. But visually it certainly is a treat to watch."

","Some films make a difference: viewing them can give us a story that is memorable and leave the viewer with powerful food for thought that continues to influence thinking long after the film is over. Such is the case for PEACEFUL WARRIOR. Based on a book by Inspirational Guru Dan Millman and beautifully adapted for the screen by Kevin Bernhardt, the story combines the best in sport stories with the infusion of spiritual discovery that despite the abundance of 'Hallmark-like' imitations, stands nobly as a tool for introducing young people to a journey toward self discovery well worth taking. Director Victor Salva had the good sense not to push the story over the top, but instead to let his actors and situations grow logically into a practical demonstration of spiritual growth.<br/><br/>Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) is a gymnast bent on perfecting his skills to enter the Olympic trials. He is a fine athlete but has an ego that consumes everything around him and prevents his finding a focus to be the perfect athlete he feels he can become. After a chance encounter with a mysterious Service Station attendant whom Dan calls Socrates (Nick Nolte), Dan's inner struggles begin to surface as he sees and experiences troubling 'other-worldly' responses form Socrates. He is ultimately forced to confront that he is living for pride, for accomplishment, for competition, for recognition - yet his quiet moments remain discontent. Socrates works with Dan, helping him to find his inner self and to live in the moment. Dan suffers a life-threatening motorcycle accident that appears to doom his dreams of being the finest gymnast, but Socrates helps him discover that living in the moment, giving in to the power of focus on the present, can result in overcoming the seemingly impossible obstacles.<br/><br/>Rather than 'preach' these concepts, the story is illustrated by physical feats of gymnastics and by meaningful encounters between Dan and Socrates, and it is this technique that brings the film above the usual 'inspirational flicks' to become a truly compelling movie. Nick Nolte has never been better as the subdued, understated, but immensely impressive Socrates. Scott Mechlowicz thankfully underplays the character of Dan: the use of a body double to perform the incredible gymnastic turns is seamlessly achieved. The remainder of the cast includes such fine actors as Amy Smart, Agnes Bruckner, and Ashton Holmes. This is a well-made film that deserves our attention, especially now. Grady Harp"

It's as if they hijacked a noble message and twisted it enough to apply it in a wrong way to a poor purpose and a mediocre ending. Therefore I will give it a 6. Another related point, in the recommendations of IMDb ""People who liked this also liked..."" they provide suggestions for other movies like ""The Notebook"" and ""Pride and Prejudice""... what do those movies have in common?

I didn't care much for the main character nor all the melodrama that surrounded him with either young women or his fellow gymnasts. In fact Scott Mechlowicz grated pretty well. The motorcycle accident afforded little empathy for his situation seeing as how brainless it was to begin with. And his emotional acting out was pathetic.

In a sense this can change the whole outlook of the story, while ""learning to fly"" might not fare well with 2007 reality, i don't think intense psychotic hallucinations provides a more sane reasoning.

","I really didn't expect much from the movie but i was surprised after watching it.It is one of the best movies i have ever seen.First of all story is great,and as an athlete i can relate to it.Acting is also great.I have to admit that i have never seen or heard before for Scott Mechlowicz (Dan Millman), but after this movie i can mark him as one of my favourite actors.As for the Nick Nolte (Socrates) i can only say that i never loved him that much.My opinion about him has changed after the movie.He was brilliant.All in all i think that this is a must see film for all of you who like good movies and touching stories.So if you want to spend an entertaining night get up and go to the cinema because this movie is worth paying some cash. :)"

","I read this book 2 decades ago. It was a fantastic book, and over the years I have given away many copies of it. I keep having to re-buy it for myself. It's such a great book and a great message. Simply put, I think it shows us how to enjoy life and not be a jerk. ""Life is Service"" right? BTW, the sequel ""Secret Journey of the Peaceful Warrior"" is equally fantastic. There you explore the ""3 selves"" and various ""levels of being."" It seems that so many people need to ""clean up the basement"" and get their minds out of the first 2-3 floors.<br/><br/>Oh well, so I see that reviews for the movie were not 100% favorable. That's too bad, but it is to be expected. There is no movie that is universally loved. And, there is no movie that can ever be as complete as a book. There simply isn't enough time.<br/><br/>IMO, this movie was refreshing and came very close to capturing the spirit and important concepts of the book. No, it is not a replacement for the book. But it's still a good movie. I hope that people will continue to have a choice to see a great movie such as this as opposed to the usual selections of gangster-car-chase themes and sappy love stories. ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"" is a movie for the thinking person. It is an intelligent and inspiring film.<br/><br/>When will Millman and his crew make the next movie? I can't wait to see the scenes of Dan in Hawaii. And I'd like to purchase the movies on DVD as well."

Great movies are ones that show you what can be done when the chips are down and when you think all is lost. I liked the mystery of a college student who thought he had the world by the tail, doing what he thought was expected of him, doing what he expected he would do in life and then he met a simple gas station attendant, who was a man of character and integrity who turned his ordinary planned life around and brought him on a spiritual path. A path that caused the lead character to question all that he thought he was about and bring him into a world that had heart and meaning beyond his imagination, beyond his former perceived abilities.

I was concerned that my wife, who is not an athlete, would not connect, and that my daughter, who is an athlete, would not relate to a ""man's story,"" but my concerns were groundless; they did not see it as a movie about sports, or about a boy becoming a man, but about life, and learning to live fully.

"klad-66916","10","2","4","21 October 2015"," A magnificent inspiring movie about one talented sportsman looking for his way
","Every time I had fallen short of my expectations watching the screen versions of the books. A director's vision had failed to convey to the audience a transforming inner experience. I was sorrowfully disappointed with direction of J.Ostin's ""Pride and Prejudice"",2005, C.Bronte's ""Jane Air"",2011 ,F.S. Fizgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"",2013 and lots of others.<br/><br/>""The way of the peaceful warrior"" screened on the ground of D.Millman's book is a pleasant exception from this list. It is one of the most inspiring masterpieces of modern movie-industry. I can confidently assert that this is the rare case when a film widely reflects a book.<br/><br/>Way of the Peaceful Warrior is a true story, based on the Dan Millman's autobiographical book. The book shares Dan's journey through university as a world-champion gymnast who has a passion to succeed and make it to the Olympics. On the surface, Dan has it all – he's good looking, popular, gets great grades, has women chasing him, his dad has plenty of money, great physical shape yet, there's something missing. It isn't until one night Dan wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to take a walk to a nearby gas station that he encounters an old man that he calls Socrates, who begins mentoring him and exposes how deeply unhappy Dan is. The story essentially chronicles Dan's story through life to evolve himself into a Peaceful Warrior, with all the powerful lessons that he's learning from Socrates.<br/><br/>The movie is dripped with the inspiring scenes and deep quotations that everyone can relate to in some way. The biggest thing that hooked me was ""Life brought rewards, but no lasting peace or satisfaction."" Dan, like many of us, have been conditioned to believe that ""When I achieve X-Y-Z, then I will be happy."" And while most of us intellectually know that's not true, we still pursue goals believing it will give us that fulfillment. The lesson here is simple: nothing in your outer world will ever make you happy or fulfilled. Happiness can only come from the inside. When you truly come to this realization and stop deluding yourself, you can gain that sense of peace and satisfaction within.<br/><br/>I highly recommend to watch this movie.Everybody will find and learn a suitable lesson and reconsider some views on life."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","4","28 August 2012"," Boring and uninteresting
","Usually these kinds of ""realize your own potential, seize the day"" films hold my attention, I find them interesting. The thing is, though, that usually these kinds of films try to spice up the message with a story that's perhaps a bit outlandish, but at the same time captivating. Dead Poets Society springs to mind. Unfortunately the story of this film is rather bland. It's your average sports story where the underdog overcomes physical impossibilities in order to prove to himself that he can do it. You've seen one of them, you've seen them all.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, the underdog story is not the main point of the film, though. Rather it's the relationship between this old mystical self-made guru (Nick Nolte) and his young student (Scott Mechlowicz) that needs to understand the realities of life before he can hope to overcome his obstacles. Unfortunately that relationship is where the movie fails to deliver, so to speak. Neither of the actors is bad, but neither do they have any real chemistry between themselves. The conversations they have are interesting to a point, but after the third time they'd gone over basically the same point and argument, I just couldn't care anymore. This is based on true events to a certain extent, so perhaps the real life underdog needed to hear these same arguments over and over, but I as a viewer could have used a bit of variety.<br/><br/>I also couldn't understand some of these stunts that the guru pulled off in order to impress his student-to-be. The point that the movie was trying to make, if I understood correctly, was that if you focus on the present, you can overcome your limits, yada-yada. But when some of those stunts are frankly physically impossible, the viewer is left wondering whether or not the film is trying to step into the real of magical realism. I know I was so when I realized towards the middle of the film that these stunts were to be taken seriously, I actually laughed, because no way, no way under the moon and sun is that possible like that.<br/><br/>All that being said, I don't think that this is a bad film. The acting is alright, the various gymnastic scenes are shot with great style and while the story felt a bit stale to me, I know that it's more because I like my self-improvement stories with a bit more flair than this. Would I recommend this to anyone? Probably not, but if these kinds of films are your thing, you should like it just fine."

","I had seen this movie come and go a few weeks ago. Suddenly, it came back, along with some interesting talk about it. I'm glad I saw it and strongly recommend it to everyone out there. Be warned, it will require that you concentrate and pay attention to its message. There are no hidden agendas here; it simply demands that you look at yourself, dispose of all the extra baggage that you carry and focus on the present to make the best of it.<br/><br/>There are questions about how it all came together, and what some of the symbols mean. For instance, who is the old man? Is he a God like figure, or personalized intuition? Why did our young protagonist get a chance that others didn't? Where does faith lie in the middle of the drama? It probably doesn't really matter since the message remains the same: It's time to put a little more effort and truly go after what you really want.<br/><br/>The young man in the film just happens to be an athlete who gets a second chance and blows it! Still, there is more to be discovered and pursued. In fact, it might not all be over. I loved the way ""Socrates"" interacts with his disciple, slowly teaching him the ways of knowledge and meditation, leading him yet not enabling and influencing his choices, allowing him to learn from his own observations and mistakes. In short, teaching him to believe in himself, yet never diluting the impact of the process, painful as it might be.<br/><br/>The film moves very well, and there are moments when we are not quite sure what we are witnessing. It's spiritual, or is it paranormal? Is it a tale of faith, a ghost story, a love story, a tale of reckless youth. Whatever it might be, it's truly inspiring and soul searching. It will probably help a few members of the audience reflect on what is going on with themselves and the world around them, and how much power we truly exert on our destinies or chose not to have? There are inspiring films, and there are gems like these: movies that are entertaining, soulful, full of feeling, intelligence, and not in any manner condesending and obtuse. This is a film that trusts its audience and encourages them to search whatever, specific truth, they might be needing.<br/><br/>A classic."

","Victor Salva's seventh film is unlike anything else he's done before it. It's not a fast-pace horror thriller. It's not a deeply moving drama about a lonely outcast. It's a slow-burn film based on a book Victor read while in prison that had a profound impact on him.<br/><br/>This movie is, for lack of a better term, a movie about spirituality. It's about surrendering control, being mindful of the situation you're in, focusing on the present and making the most out of every second we have right now. It's an important message that has the power to stick with a person for a very long time and will affect the way I approach a lot of things in my life.<br/><br/>Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) is a gymnast. It's the one thing he feels he was born to do. When tragedy strikes, Dan is left in a situation where he must either surrender his current situation and recover by focusing on his mindfulness or potentially risk losing the one thing he loves most.<br/><br/>It's a beautifully written tale, slow moving (particularly in the first hour) but well worth the time investment. Victor Salva, once again, gives an outstanding performance both in the writing and directing of this film. The man has a natural gift for storytelling, and it's just as evident here as ever. The score is impactful, creating emotion in all the right places without ever coming across as sappy. All of the actors in this film were fantastic to the point of giving genuine performances all-around; there was never a moment that felt like it was a group of actors.<br/><br/>This movie leaves me with a major curiosity to read some of Dan's books. If this film is any indication of the kind of life he led and the things he encountered along the journey, I can't think of anyone who wouldn't want to experience the kind of present-minded determination explored in the film."

","A movie can't be savored, at least not on first viewing, and only a few movies will be seen more than once. The best reveal new texture the second and third times around. Beyond that, we re-watch just to appreciate the craftsmanship, to see the scene we know and love. To make movies that entertain and educate or inspire is a tall order. Plenty don't even do the first for an educated palette.<br/><br/>Turning a book about inner transformation into a movie is a daunting challenge. What to put in, what to leave out, how to compress what could only adequately be told by a ten-hour long film into one-fifth that space, who to cast and how to make the thing engaging to an audience not already exposed to the book all complicate the equation.<br/><br/>Then there's the question of dialog  beyond a certain point, you need some action, but movies of this kind are going to be highly dependent on one person saying significant things to another. What films pull off extended dialog well? (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were probably unique in how dialog-intensive they were, successful at it, and that was around romance, not spiritual teaching.) These are some of the hurdles that faced Victor Salva in turning Dan Millman's Way of the Peaceful Warrior into a major-studio, feature-length film. By and large, he succeeded, making a watchable picture that those who have read the book should enjoy and those who haven't will still find accessible, if they stretch a bit and pay attention. The film is competently shot with attractive, well-framed cinematography, not over-reliant on special effects, mostly well-cast and well acted. Its few flaws aren't enough to throw off the narrative.<br/><br/>Scott Mechlowicz plays Dan, a gymnast at Berkeley. His sensitive, emotional acting in this could push his career into high gear  whoever thought the lead of Eurotrip would be a good choice probably also picked Conan O'Brien out of the crowd for a certain talk show ten years ago. The romantic interest (of a sort, this isn't taken very far), Joy, is played by Amy Smart, one of a hundred interchangeable actresses when she was in Rat Race. In Peaceful Warrior she simultaneously projects mystery and openness  not an easy combination  without apparent effort. Having read the book years ago, I was interested to learn who would be cast as Dan's mentor, Socrates, and thought Nick Nolte an inspired choice. But his performance is likely to divide viewer's opinions. How do you convey calm self-assurance, ancient wisdom in an unlikely persona, mysticism and grounding? Nolte chose a even-keeled, unflappable and perhaps even somewhat world-weary expression to portray this old sage that will strike some as spot-on but others as two-dimensional and flat. I would have preferred a more colorful, animated Socrates, but playing the role as a cipher does heighten the other characters' texture, and perhaps that was the intention.<br/><br/>The real question in any movie of this kind is how well the message gets though. Can you please the true believers, engage those new to the message and at least leave the unsympathetic with a few things to think about? I think Peaceful Warrior succeeds at all three. The choices Salva makes are generally the right ones. He mostly kept the essential, discarded the peripheral, steered relatively clear of clichés and made a film that inspires without badgering and educates without preaching. It's rich without being cluttered  there's a lot in it but it gives its vignettes space to breathe. Could it be better still? Sure, but not in under three hours.<br/><br/>There are a few other minor miscues. The events that inspired the book happened in the late 1960s; the movie is set in the present-day, but the service station where Socrates works is filled with old clunkers. At the end of the picture, when the team van pulls out of the station, you can practically see the seam between the two worlds. A smallish problem, but it strikes a slightly sour note.<br/><br/>Finally, an important caveat. Peaceful Warrior is a good movie to see alone, with a close friend, parent, child or as a conversation starter on a date. But don't let anyone you propose seeing it with watch the trailer, and avoid it yourself if you can. It makes the film look as formulaic as an algebra class, and you think you've seen the whole thing by watching the preview (including the inevitable ending). A word, then, about the ending. It isn't what you expect and it isn't the unexpected. There were a dozen ways to screw that up and I couldn't think of the one way to get it right. Salva's was pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>Somehow a good explanation of the title never made it into the body of the film. (Ironically, it's heard in the trailer.) This isn't it either, but Voltaire said ""to hold a pen is to be at war."" The authors of this book and screenplay well earned their warrior status by the time they scribbled ""curtain"" at the end of this adroit blend of entertainment and inspiration."

","This movie was great and followed the book pretty well. I am looking forward to a possible Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior Movie.

","The Way of the Peaceful Warrior is my favorite book of all time, and I searched long and hard to find a theater that was actually playing this limited release film. Finally found ONE theater in NYC (I live in NJ)... so I drove on over.<br/><br/>I made a conscientious effort to be objective when watching the film- not expecting it to disappoint (as most remakes are never as good as the book itself- except for THE NOTEBOOK! :) )... yet also not expecting people to love it as much as I do because I inherently am biased and have an appreciation for the story.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that while the movie was not as entertaining and compelling as the book, it is not for a lack of performance or direction, etc. This story simply cannot be told with the same depth and conviction as the book in just 2 hours, with no time for personal reflection throughout...<br/><br/>So essentially- it was the best attempt that could have been made at the story's re-creation.... but I warn those who have NOT yet read the book that the movie could not truly relay the powerful message that the book did.... through no fault of its own. Read the book first for the full experience, and enjoy the movie as a chance to review the story in high-speed."

","I read this book and enjoyed this movie version. I am glad they reduced the emphasis on food/purity but wish they had spent a little more time on the development of Millman's relationship with Joy, a critical 'destination' for his journey.<br/><br/>I like that they got in and out of the sports stuff quickly - that can get old on screen if the sport shown is not 'your' sport. I also like that they didn't emphasize any 'supernatural' visual phenomenon. Like most movies, I feel that they 'pushed' it along to get to the end, but that's Hollywood - God forbid a 3 hour story takes 3 hours to tell! But the moral of the story is to 'live in the present' and rushing the movie seems contrary to that.<br/><br/>But overall, I liked it and was inspired by it enough to where I will be re-reading the book very soon. This is a story worth telling, worth hearing - just in case it strikes a cord in somebody's spirit. If even one person (maybe me? maybe you?) turns a positive corner as a result of it - that would be a wonderful payoff. I'd recommend it to anybody who feels like they've lost their way or someone who needs a jump-start to the next phase of their life. <br/><br/>The guys playing Millman and his buddies/gals were good.

"fearnotaz1","10","3","9","3 April 2007"," Extraordinary Film within a film
","I'm both surprised and not at the limited advertising and public turnout for this movie. I loved it with the emotion I have for American Beauty in th aspect that most people who watch this movie will not get the movie within the movie, the story within the story. Most people will just see a gymnastics movie, when it has NOTHING to do with gymnastics whatsoever. There is irony in just that. The movie says "" There's never 'nothing' going on"" which coincides with American Beauty's ""Look Closer"". To appreciate this movie your mindset needs to be exactly in the place that is being taught in the film. You need to get in tune with your inner self in order to look beyond yourself to service others. If you understood that last sentence, I think you can truly appreciate this movie. Synopsis: Dan Millner, played by Scott Mechlowicz ( who Jesus, is just freaking sexy, and has beautiful eyes and lips... ahem... anyway... ) is an incredible gymnast on his way to the Olympics. He's got everything those around him would die for. Got the looks, the girls, the strength, the respect, the reputation, the smarts, the heart, the will, but the mindset? Not yet. Cocky & stubborn, and limited by what he was taught he's having trouble sleeping at night. He ends up stumbling upon a somewhat run down service station where he meets a special someone ( Nick Nolte ) who he labels Socrates. Socrates teaches him how to fully live. Not to just be going through life, but to be actually living it. Focusing on it. Moment by moment so that not one is left unnoticed. I love this movie and realize that it is indeed the journey we're on that matters most, not the destination. There are no ordinary moments. Every moment of every day a life ends, and another begins. EVERY moment. It's incredible. It's EXTRA ordinary. It's the beauty of why we're here. For the experience, not the outcome. For the people we interact with, not where we end up. It's not weather you win or lose it's how you play the game, and who you interact with along the way. It's astounding to me how many lives this movie has and will touch. Remember "" The people who are hardest to love are usually the ones who need it the most"" * the only flaw in this movie is how to make a PB&J properly... sorry, but the jelly belongs on top. Live in the moment because the destination is nothing without the journey. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"

","Although many have preconceived notions about Victor Salva, I believe this film is brilliant, a person's criminal past shouldn't dictate how well they produce a film.<br/><br/>Scott Mechlowicz and Nick Nolte perform incredibly, I just wish Scott Mechlowicz starred in more films, he is talented.<br/><br/>This film follows the journey of the famous athlete Dan Millman. It's set in University and depicts the early years of his life. Although it should not be mistaken for a true story, it's based on true events, which is very different.<br/><br/>This film will inspire you to strive, thrive, and prosper. Although some parts might seem somewhat cliché, it's beautifully done and the best things in life will always seem cliché since we spend more time dreaming than we do living. I'm pretty sure there isn't a success story we haven't heard, it all begins with working hard, but this film is so much more, it's deep.<br/><br/>Enjoy this film for what it is, not what you want it to be, it's thought-provoking and inspirational."

Nick Nolte, Scott Mechlowicz, and Amy Smart all jumped in with both feet and do a wonderful job. Kevin Bernhardt wrote a great screenplay. Even when he changed some scenes from the book, it only added to the film.<br/><br/>The people who made this film could have focused on the love story or on other plot themes.

","Peaceful Warrior provides the true light and love that shines in all of us -- we just need assistance in bringing it out some times. The books outlining the Peaceful Warrior, Socrates, and others touches the heart and soul -- we're all on that journey -- it's up to each of us to tap into the true soul of who we are in order to share it with the collective consciousness of the world.<br/><br/>The story has to be told in multiple movies. There is entirely too much of the journey to outline in one movie. The back ground of Socrates, his journey to become a mentor; Dan's story after the final event. What happened to him, how he too struggled to become a Warrior. It doesn't happen over night with the quick fix that we all think is out there. The heart, soul, tears, joys, and No Ordinary Moments take many movies to understand the full context of the film. This is one time that 4 or 5 movies is warranted for the basic growth in all of us. We don't always need the killer flicks, and out-in-space -- the real out-in-space is in the journey of tapping into your higher self. Here's to the Warrior in all of us!!"

This leads to my biggest criticism of the film which is that there are only so many of these life altering message points that can be conveyed, much less internalized, in a two hour movie.

Not true for the Peacefull Warrior. All the major points of the book are in the movie. For those you have not read the book, the movie is a great introduction into the concepts of the Peacefull Warrior that will hopefully open up a new way of looking at the world.

I found this to be a powerful illustration of the biggest war we have to fight...the one within ourselves. I came away with an appreciation of how often we fight the messages our lives are trying to teach us. Sometimes the messages have to come through others and still we may resist what is being given. To get our attention, we may have to experience a profound wake-up call that so shakes the foundations that we can no longer live the way we used to and we have to surrender to the learning. This movie has many dimensions to ponder and many truths to be revealed. In our current times, nothing could be more important than to learn the way of the peaceful warrior.

Using a courageous story about a college gymnast as its vehicle, the movie presents, or more likely reconnects, us with timeless insights and spiritual laws that bring us present in the moment, and confident to make lasting adjustments to how we perceive change, conflict, and the world in general.

","I loved the book. I loved the movie. I love what ""is trying to happen"" here. Then again - don't try - do. I have a long wonderful history with the book and the author so I can not be unbiased. However I will say that the learning continues from both the book and the movie. I was concerned about how the true value of PW the book, could possibly be translated to screen. Now comes the real education. The follow up. In checking out the comments and message board - I see that the learning continues post production and release. I am amazed to see the attack against the director and others. Pretty confirming that no matter what one does, no matter what the goal or higher purpose - people (that's us folks) will do their best to find a way to make you self destruct by hacking it all up instead of simply appreciating what they may or may not get from it and letting it go - and living in the here and now. The real challenge comes in understanding that people who would post hateful messages are living in a hateful past and will likely experience a hateful future. How sad. Enlightenment and entertainment - remember? For those who did not like the movie - please read the book. For those who slam the director - he is simply an ""agent of delivery""...I am just grateful the movie was made. I don't give a hoot about his past, I do care greatly about the fact that he brought us this film. Remember - we live in a time where our president has a drug and alcohol history, some priests are predators, CFO's rip off the masses without a second thought - destroying lives, and we are in a war that the majority of Americans question. In a world like this - I applaud any movie, director, writer who is sending a positive message. And please remember folks - actors are just that - playing a role, not a reality for their life necessarily. I think we all need to get a grip on what is reality, what is fantasy and always remember to be honest BUT KIND!!! Long and short of it, for me (and I can only speak for myself) I value this movie.

The director did a good job of staying true to the book and maintaining the essence of the message.I hope that the success of this film and others like it ushers in a new era of conscious film making in Hollywood.

","As a long time fan and reader of Millman's Peaceful Warrior philosophies and writings, I was bound to hate this film. Any other treatment of this work HAD to fall short of my tremendous expectations... I could not have been more wrong. This film beautifully captured the spirit and message (and much of the story) from this amazing book. The cast were all well chosen and the performances gifted. Each time Amy Smart came on screen the only thing my partner and I could think was ""JOY"". So it was not just her character's name but her presence in the film - JOY! Nolte is to be commended for his powerful yet reserved take on old Socrates and Mechlowitz as Dan stands a-tip-toe next to his titan of a co-star. Salva's direction is simultaneously economical, dramatic and loving and gives his players and their story center stage and allows it all to unfold while beautifully framed and shot. Done on next to nothing money-wise, it is wonderful to see a story and character driven drama that uplifts the spirit - 10 out of 10. See it over and over again until your life is changed."

It stopped just shot of the typical scene where the athlete completes and incredible comeback, followed by cheers, followed by getting the girl, etc. <br/><br/>This type of movie is very important in hopefully waking people up from an unconscious state.

","The Peaceful Warrior is about surrendering to this process called life. It's about surrendering to this body and all that comes with it. It's about awaking to the fact that we are more than this body, and excepting everything that is placed before us as a gift.<br/><br/>We are all on some track or another. To imagine (or believe) that the Divine can summed up as one track would be absurd. Switching tracks is the fun of life. I love the feeling of jumping into a new unknown reality. The Divine is constantly working through each of us, if we but look. We are the Divine, if we but feel with our hearts.<br/><br/>We are all brightly lost in the dream. We must all overcome certain obstacles in this life. Each person's path has it's rocky patches. The mind can become mired in it's own processes. It's only with the heart that one can see clearly. Love makes it so.<br/><br/>The Peaceful Warrior is an example of our true possibility."

","In a time when we face so many discouraging world events -- events which can leave us feeling powerless and overwhelmed (from global warming, to the economy, to the unsettling conflicts in the Middle East) -- I believe it is important to have access to movies that can offer us encouragement, hope, and a sense of empowerment. ""Peaceful Warrior"" is just such a movie...uplifting, thought-provoking, and spiritual in a way that isn't heavy-handed or pushy.<br/><br/>What is personal empowerment? What is coming to terms with one's strengths and limitations? How much control do we really have over ourselves and our environment? Dan Millman's story, based on actual aspects of his own life, takes such questions and face them head-on.<br/><br/>The story is made especially believable and interesting by some very fine acting.

Peaceaful Warrior is based on Dan's first book, without a doubt, one of his finest. It, and the books that followed, have helped create many positive changes in my life, as they have for many, many others around the world. So it was with no small expectation that I finally saw the movie while on a business trip. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte is a blast as Socrates and Scott and Amy are both excellent. Even though I know the book very well, having read it many times, I was quickly drawn into the movie of and by itself. I can promise I'll see it again if it comes closer to my hometown, and will be the first in line to order the DVD when available.<br/><br/>To say the least, I highly recommend seeing the movie.

","My friend, Linda M. took me to the Sedona Film Festival where Peaceful Warrior was playing. I had heard about the book 25 years earlier and vaguely remember wanting to buy it--but never did. Now, 25 years later, I'm sitting in Harkins Theater in Sedona, Arizona, and watching it. And Nick Nolte was at the festival as well.<br/><br/>I had been going through a two year hell that seemed like the worst ""dark night of the soul"" I'd ever had to endure. As I watched the movie unfold, it touched me in a way that was completely unexpected--and healing--for me. I had come to the movie carrying the weight of the world on my back.<br/><br/>And when I left, I felt at peace. I felt as if I had a direction. A way to survive my personal 2 year gauntlet. The next day, I went to the book store in Sedona to see if I could find Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman. I did not. What they did have was his ""The Laws of Spirit,"" and I bought it instead. Then, I went to amazon.com and ordered ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"" and ""Socrates."" Reading Millman's books just helped me put everything into focus. It made sense--finally. I broke down and cried at that time because his movie had touched me and helped me in ways that I can't even begin to put into words. But Millman can put them into words for all of us.<br/><br/>I'm so grateful he wrote his books. And the movie -- as corny as this sounds -- helped to bring me back from a black hole where I didn't think I'd ever emerge. It gave me a sense of balance. Of perspective. Of seeing the world differently and in a far more healthy and positive way.<br/><br/>If you had 12 stars I'd give it to this movie because it healed me and helped me. Thank you, Dan Millman. Blessings always."

It's a reminder of how we can empower ourselves to change the way our lives are going, our ability to overcome extreme adversity by dealing with our own thinking,respecting ourselves and others, taking action to recreate our circumstances rising up in our spirit.

","I was absolutely blown away by the movie. In 1988 I read a book that changed my life. In 2006 it came rushing back at me on the big screen. From the very first commercial screening through Dan's local appearance a month later, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie each of the several times I saw it. The scenes that differed from the book were well chosen and very effective in the movie. I laughed, got emotional, was in awe of how well Peaceful Warrior worked on the screen and how moved I was by the experience.<br/><br/>As I sat with my eyes glued to the screen, I realized there was time to process and embrace and feel so many of the scenes - to sit a minute with it, if you will. I left feeling lighter than when I went in and feeling oh-so-good. I loved the buzz in the theater  it was transformed into a group experience vs. the typical solo movie outing.<br/><br/>I hope Peaceful Warrior returns to theaters in this area. Sure I will buy the DVD but the energy and synergy in the movie theaters was just phenomenal. From young children to the mature movie-goer, this movie 'works' on many levels and shares a powerful message  universal yet personal to the viewer. (Several critics obviously missed the mark.)"
"jz-10","10","2","5","5 August 2006"," The ""spiritual teaching"" film finally has a masterpiece.
","As sites from Hollywood Jesus to Spiritual Cinema Circle point out, there's an amazing amount of spiritual message in movies, from films like Groundhog Day and The Truman Show, to Star Wars and The Matrix. Yet the films that present spiritual teaching overtly, have generally not fared as well, recent examples include ""Indigo,"" ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" and the abysmal ""The Celestine Prophecy,"" most of which had limited release or went straight to DVD for good reason.<br/><br/>""Peaceful Warrior"" is an adaptation of the novel ""The Way of the Peaceful Warrior,"" and simply put, it rocks. Yes, there is teaching, probably more than in any movie since ""The Karate Kid."" But there is humor, excitement, pain, and joy as well. We care about Dan's character as his worst fears seem to become realized in turn, and we empathize with him as he struggles on the confusing path of letting go of desires to pursue his love.<br/><br/>Scott Mecholowitz is outstanding as Dan, and Nick Nolte excellent as Socrates. Perhaps Nolte's own struggles in overcoming addiction gave him an insider's view to the truth of the wisdom he dispenses as Socrates.<br/><br/>Don't let a negative review from the ""critics"" dissuade you. At Rotten Tomatoes, only 21% rate it fresh, but IMDb shows that 45% of moviegoers rated it a 10 as I did. This is a must-see movie."

The early character development scenes, were a bit cheesy. I found it hard to buy into the idea that Dan could do all the drinking, womanising and arguing with his team mates and coach, as well as sleepless nights and not be a loser! I had to consciously forgive the film makers and just hope the story draws me in with something I can relate to, later on. And they rewarded me accordingly with an inspiring well told story of a young mans journey from a talented cocky successful athlete, through career ending injury to eventually finding real meaning in his life, with or without his sport.

"thomasdosborneii","10","2","5","11 June 2006"," Having Once Been Shown The Way, Maybe Now You Can Find It Again
","I never did read the Dan Millman book from which this movie was made (but I do plan to read it now), but I have read several others wherein seekers pursuing physical achievements received powerful spiritual guidance from mysterious mentors, such as the Richard Bach books (aircraft piloting) and ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" (golf), and others, and this movie quite well measures up to the requirements of the genre. Where this one is different is that from a purely materialistic, earth-based, egotistical perspective, this seeker already pretty much had good reason to feel that he was already ""perfect,"" what with his great looks, smarts, Olympic-level prowess, and easy sexual achievements, he was not ""broken"" initially (like many who seek because they have failed, or they are alcoholics, or they have lost everything, or never had anything in the first place), but was already conscious of an impending dissatisfaction or imminent tragedy--he was being called from within to create for himself a skyhook, and while externally he felt he had it all made, internally he knew that he was made for something more.<br/><br/>I feel that Scott Mechlowicz was a great casting choice for this part, as his considerable physical beauty was magnificently metaphorical of this earth-based sense of perfection, while his acting performance perfectly foreshadowed that his life was going to require of him something more and that ultimately he would arrange it so that he would succeed in taking on a challenge that few would be willing to take on.<br/><br/>Being on an Olympic team, striving for a gold medal, must be an almost unbreakable ego addiction, for whereas a more ordinary member of the herd could be understood as wanting a way out, how does this apply to a person on the brink of being number ONE in the WORLD in something? This really demonstrates how, while few are called, even fewer would ever answer.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte's performance perfectly walked the razor's edge between compassion for his student and emotional detachment from him--he would train this student well, but the student had to come to HIM. And as the mentor, Nolte never wavered, never doubted, never succumbed to a game of clashing egos, but quietly demonstrated the authenticity of his mastery.<br/><br/>To me Nolte's character seemed to exemplify the strength, awareness, and control of an aikido master, the existence of which is not a fiction but something that can be genuinely experienced. There really are people out there in the world like this, ready and able to help those who choose them. I particularly appreciated Socrates's line, ""I didn't choose you, you chose me,"" for that is how it must work and does work.<br/><br/>Dan Millman said that this story was based on true events, although the actual novel, itself, is a fiction. This is true and not a paradox, as these things do genuinely happen all the time. Maybe not in everybody's life, of course, that is obvious. But those who truly WANT it, their mentors will come.<br/><br/>There was a quality to this film that pierced right through the veil of the screen and shot consciousness into a realm of hyper-reality. Millman's nightmares were almost unbearable to watch and experience from the audience seats, but tension was relieved by extremely powerful and effective camera work that demonstrated the stopping of time and experiencing the NOW. Perhaps this is how the story changes lives--it grabs the bull by the horns and MAKES the book reader or movie viewer actually EXPERIENCE this state of consciousness. And once having been shown the way, maybe now they can find it again.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie to be experienced, but perhaps only few will really benefit from it."

"BobbyT24","7","1","2","6 October 2015"," A decent ""finding yourself"" movie for an evening - ""Karate Kid"" meets Zen
","Based on the bestselling book by Dan Millman, ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives."" This is a movie I really wanted to like. The story of an elite athlete that overcomes a potentially life-altering injury only to triumph in the end through perseverance and inner-healing, based on true events? Nick Nolte as the wise teacher and Amy Smart as eye candy? How can you not cheer for this? <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is a decent movie to watch for an evening. It's above-average as a story compared to most dreck being thrown at us recently. However, the point of a movie where your protagonist grows and matures from a spoiled, entitled brat into a mature, enlightened warrior would be perfect... If the actor playing the lead wasn't so pompous and arrogant through the entire movie. Scott Mechlowicz as ""Dan"" fits the opening with his spoiled, naturally-gifted, ""me-first"" athlete perfectly. His arrogant elitism sets up the character as someone who needs to take a fall to bring much-needed humility. However, as the story unfolds, the actor does not become an empathetic character. He's still unlikeable. <br/><br/>Question: If you had Ghandi, Buddha, or Jesus Christ inspiring you personally to overcome your demons, showing you ways to open your mind and experience ""the moment"" in ways you had never imagined, wouldn't that make you into a much calmer, wiser, more APPROACHABLE person? I didn't see that in the actor's portrayal in the end. He pretty much stayed the same throughout. I see where the direction and the story took us along that path. But I believe the actor missed in his portrayal. I guess that's my biggest issue with the movie.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte, on the other hand, is fantastic as ""Socrates"". His ""Mr. Miyagi""-themed character couldn't be better cast or acted by the veteran thespian. Grizzled, world-weary, and wise beyond his advanced years is perfectly woven into his character. Amy Smart is underused and fairly simplistic in the story. She's adorable, but the fact she knows about Socrates - who may or may not be real - and she is obviously part of the real world is a little confusing. For Amy's character to fall for such a self-absorbed Dan, even after he's explored warrior training, is kind of a stretch. She'd have to be smarter than that. And if she isn't, then she wouldn't have been part of Socrates' world. The rest of the cast is fairly vanilla and only there to extend the story.<br/><br/>This movie has a great premise. It's really a college version of ""Karate Kid"". Although it must have been shot on a low-budget by all the dark lighting and painful rain machine goofs, and the obvious body-double on the rings, it is pretty enough to look at. Nick Nolte and Amy Smart make the story watchable but the main character's off-putting ego tarnishes the end result. I give it a 7 out of 10. It's worth watching for the message and for Nolte. Just don't expect Oscar performances by anyone not named Nick Nolte. I think I'd rather read the book this movie is based upon."
"teknozen","7","1","2","3 June 2012"," honorable intentions, not polished results
","While all movies—even documentaries—require some deferral of disbelief to succeed, this one stretches us even further to demand a hiatus from our sophistication about New Age (or ""Alternative,"" or God help us, ""Spiritual,"" or whatever they used to call it back in the last millennium) platitudes that now ring all too hollow and tiresome in the contemporary ear.<br/><br/>Beginning in 1991, author Dan Millman turned his Peaceful Warrior series of inspirational self-help books into quite the lucrative franchise of a dozen or more titles (Hmm. Maybe the guy really is on to something.), but this movie didn't come out until 2006, by which time it was pushing a little too hard on its sell-by date. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, Nick Nolte does a remarkable job at keeping a straight face while delivering lines the likes of ""This moment is the only thing that matters."" Yeah, right. Been there, done that, and long since sent the t-shirt to the Goodwill. <br/><br/>IF, huge IF, one can put aside one's critical knowingness and allow that all the crypto-shamanistic psycho-babble might still be fresh, potent stuff worthy of mindful consideration, then a remarkable thing happens: Peaceful Warrior becomes a beacon of hope and motivation, an entirely positive reinforcement of the notion that it is indeed possible to pass through life's slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and emerge a fuller, stronger person. It might help if one happens to be experiencing one of those pesky setbacks at the moment, and consequently feeling more susceptible to the hokey, but nonetheless entirely valid message. <br/><br/>(Full disclosure: it's not a very well made movie, and to judge from Nolte's apparent age, this flick languished on the shelf for some while before finding distribution. It's not hard to understand why. True, there is a lot to forgive here, but it's worth the mental exercise to give it a try. The stars are more for honorable intentions, than a polished product.)"

","I was so impressed with this movie when I saw it in the theater about a year ago, that I have avidly awaited its release on DVD (June, 2007). Since June, I personally purchased 8 legal DVDs of the movie to give to family and friends. It is THAT good. I have heard comments about the movie from a few people who did not seem that impressed with it. Their comments clearly indicated that they took the movie strictly at face value. What a shame!!! The story and the message within it are FAR deeper than the face value of the story. The movie presents a whole new way in viewing life and the world around us.

I decided to take advantage of the free ticket giveaway at Bestbuy.com and I am glad I did. Nick Nolte did an excellent job. I enjoyed it very much & hope that people get out to see it. I think it is a good movie for teens as well as adults. I will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD. This is not a movie with action & adventure but it will hold your attention. To some it will parallel your own life and hopefully get you to think more about your actions, not just to others but ones that affect yourself directly. If it only helps one person make more of their life then it has done it's job."
"zowie-conway","9","1","3","19 July 2013"," Brilliant and moving!
","I adored this movie, Nick Nolte's character was so wise, honest and a beautiful teacher. His acting was really good. This story made me cry, prob because it was very close to home but regardless I was so impressed that the spiritual adversity and enlightenment process was not over-done or cheesy. I enjoyed watching Dan 'Millman' grow and come home to himself, how his ego diminished and his spirit began to live again. This film is a reminder of how 'the moment' is everything and only through courage of the heart and true surrender to our vulnerabilities make us 'Warriors' <br/><br/>I also loved the end scene when his fellow gymnast asks Dan for advice, and Dan realises that this was a reflection of his former self, showing him how far he had come now. A beautiful moment that gives us the feeling that he's now become the teacher, the master of himself and now in the position to be of service. He believes in himself again. <br/><br/>Very clever movie I'm sure I will recommend to loads of people, I'm surprised I'd never even heard of it before. Must be very underrated."

","Nick Nolte - The Master. The legendary actor takes an unforgettable turn in 'Peaceful Warrior'. Portraying an enlightened stranger, Nolte delivers a mesmerizing performance that is masterfully restrained & believable. <br/><br/>'Peaceful Warrior' Synopsis: A chance encounter with an enlightened stranger changes the life of a college gymnast.<br/><br/>'Peaceful Warrior', as a film, is meaningful & sensible. Kevin Bernhardt's Screenplay is well-written & offers moral. Victor Salva's Direction is, at best, sincere. <br/><br/>To be brutally honest, the lead star is convincing but he can never reach or even come close to Nolte's performance. Nolte anchors the show with a performance, that remains with you even after the show has concluded. Nolte transports you to a world where magic exists, its beyond a performance of merit. <br/><br/>On the whole, Nolte is the true Warrior of 'Peaceful Warrior'."

","This is a somewhat interesting film in the way it plays out. Having never read the book, I'm not sure how it measures up but the movie is definitely a worthwhile experience.<br/><br/>Somewhat abstract and a little confusing at points, the plot can become repetitive or jerky over 120 mins. However, even with a somewhat slow start, the movie gains more and more momentum with time leading to a semi-strong finish that I found enjoyable.<br/><br/>I think this film could have been great with a little more focused direction and the trimming out of 15-20 mins but it is still worth a watch. 6.5/10"
"mdenicola88","10","1","3","7 January 2010"," A Spiritual Masterpiece
","'Peaceful Warrior' was one of the most spiritually enlightening movie experiences I have ever engaged myself in. Rather then focus on cinematic brilliance, or a superior acting performance the movie had one thing in mind: to get it's message across. And that it did, beautifully. Whether you are looking for enlightenment or not, the movie manages to remind all of its viewers to stop and live in this moment that they are currently experiencing. Far too many of us finding ourselves fully preoccupied with what was, or living for what could be in the future. Instead if we focus ourselves upon what this moment has to offer, we will find ourselves capable of doing so much more without any true limitations. Even though emphasis was placed on the message, the cast also managed to do an effective job at portraying this message. Scott managed to show an effective transition from a human fully caught up in the physicality of life, to an individual who has come to understand themselves as the creator of each moment they experience - a major step up in his career in comparison to the roles he portrayed in films such as 'Eurotrip.' Nick Nolte also managed to effectively portray a limitless source of understanding that enjoyed each moment of his existence - however long it was that Scott's character needed him in his life. I urge viewers to take the time to watch this film and truly attempt to take something from it, rather then automatically coming into it with the belief that it is simply 'psychobabble' because it truly isn't."
"lastliberal","6","1","3","13 April 2008"," This moment is the only thing that matters.
","OK, I'll admit it. The only reason I watched this movie was another chance to see Amy Smart (Crank) and Agnes Bruckner (The Woods). A sports movie about gymnastics would not normally appeal to me.<br/><br/>But, this is not really a sports movie. It is a movie about spirituality. Not too terrible different from The Karate Kid, with Nick Nolte (Socrates) as the Mr. Miyagi character and Scott Mechlowicz as the student, here Dan instead of Daniel.<br/><br/>It's all about finding yourself instead of chasing after what everyone expects you to do. If you just forget the past and future (taking out the trash as Socrates says), and focus on the present, you can do great things. There is Buddhist awareness as Socrates tells Dan there is never not anything happening and shows his how to be aware of the moment.<br/><br/>So, forget the booze, and meat, and sex and you, too, can be great. But, who would want to? You've seen it before, but I really prefer these actors to the one in The Karate Kid, and you get to see Smart and Bruckner, too."
"zatinus","8","1","3","16 August 2007"," Peaceful Warrior Overview
","I just finish watching peaceful warrior and my overall assessment concludes that this movie is a little soft for jocks but very inspiring for the people of struggle. The main actor is not the best of expressing emotions but thats irreverent because its the message the movie sends out not the messenger. If you pay to much attention to the acting rather then the message your missing out. Pretty good movie if you can relate to what the movie is about and has nothing to do with gymnastics. Not a clichÃ© movie but it ends happy as usual so what can I say. This is not really a teen movie or a popcorn movie. It is more of a movie for insight on the way we as human beings live life without thinking what we are actually doing."
"orisons1","10","1","3","28 June 2007"," Showing the way
","I read Dan Millman's book purely out of curiosity and found it to be uplifting and insightful. I still believe it is one of the best stories put on paper, and while many may agree with me, far more will not. i am writing this to give my opinion of the movie, not as an effort to persuade or change other's opinions. Book to movie transitions have historically been badly handled with a few great exceptions. Peacefull warrior I feel is one of those exceptions. I have read many of the opinions here and have even seen the ""karate kid on rings"" mentioned a few times and to be honest I don't get it. The movie was not about the character Dan winning a tournament, but of winning a battle with himself. At times the movie gave few answers to questions posed, but I believe that is the whole premise, it's not about the destination it's about the journey. Nick Nolte again was fantastic as Socrates and given the few parts the character actually had pulled it off exceeding well. This is a movie not made for the popcorn generation, but for people who want something more than a one and a half hour distraction from life (I still can't believe someone posted ""don't see this, if you want a real movie go see TMNT...)This is a movie that given the time and respect it is due, will stay with you and have you ask yourself questions that no Hollywood blockbuster would dare ask, ask questions that only you can answer. The apparent lack of this movie's success tells me that people are not looking for good movies but something to shut out every distraction around them for a short time and pretend to live life going from one distraction to another. The movie was very well done and offers a bit more. For me it is and no doubt will remain one of the best movies of our generation."

","This movie has a lot of power to change my life. It helped me through the deepest state of heroin withdrawal, helped me to survive and gave me hope and motivation to live! Thank you Dan Millman, Victor Salva and Nick Nolte, Scott Mechlowitz, Amy Smart and all of the crew. I have read the book, before I saw the movie, but I found that the movie contains in a more compact and more powerful way the essence of the teaching the ""here and now"". I found the book a bit too talkative after seeing the movie. Scott Mechlowitz as Dan Millman is almost as good choice as Nick Nolte as Socrates. Both of them play brilliant and genuinely their part.<br/><br/>As a zen practicer I am, I found that every word of Socrates and Joy, is pure, genuine and clean zen teaching even though it isn't said that the movie is zen. Excellent way to teach zen, if the teacher doesn't say it is zen. If it was said, maybe some people would be frightened away from this movie. Though zen is not a religion, some doesn't think that, and don't like ""religious"" movies. The word ""buddha"" is mentioned only twice, in humorous context. In every context, every way and from any point of view, this is a great and life-changing movie. I can only recommend to everyone!!!! (sorry, if my English is poor!)"

It results in a complete transformation.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie is definitely the interactions of Dan the gymnast and 'Socrates' the wise man.

"alexemeel","10","1","4","22 March 2010"," It is so clear...
","I found this movie an enjoyable one. As I experienced it, it is trying to tell that the now is the only moment there is, and everything else is information. Becoming a burden (and thus trash) whenever you do not act accordingly at a situation. Take leadership and act upon it.<br/><br/>The great thing is that many do not realize that whenever they express their opinions and/or view of the world, they also provide a confession a character... And that is were the plot thickens. You see, for example, I gave a '10 out of 10'. The reason is that I believe that nothing ever is to be rated lower than 10 points. What I can do is share my experience and, were possible, ask questions. Whenever I rate something lower, I simply did not 100% understand what he/she was trying to tell me... And I judge that fact (me not fully understanding the meant message) by crediting it with lesser points. Get my drift? It is like asking somebody 'what color do I like?' and then getting into an argument with that same person because he/she gave the wrong answer. Isn't that really weird?<br/><br/>How about looking at situations (and watching a movie is a situation) from this point of view: Every filmmaker gives it their all. Otherwise they would have made an other movie, with other characters and an other plot. Do you agree? <br/><br/>It is virtually impossible to explain to an other person, by words or visualization, how the now feels and what door it helps to open. There are 3 more examples in this review. It is the door to your true talents, your true self, situations instead of problems or opinions.<br/><br/>Everyone involved in making this movie gave it their all and provide a glimpse of what life is all about: Take out the trash that is constantly roaming your beautiful little head. The reward is the biggest gift you'll ever receive: the now."

I've wanted to see Peaceful Warrior since the first time I saw the trailer, I've read all the raving reviews about how amazing and life-changing the book is and I was absolutely hyped for this. I wasn't disappointed, not even once. I think this film's message is so powerful, and so profound that it puzzles me why this was so under the radar during it's release in the cinemas. I'm a 'sucker' for inspirational films - I think they're the one way to get people to learn something from them and take action in their own lives.<br/><br/>Peaceful Warrior has now become one of my top favorite inspirational films, up there with Dead Poet's Society, and Rocky"

","Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) is a college gymnast who has a vivid nightmare about shattering his leg upon dismounting from the rings. And while he is lying on the ground in pain he notices a man who is wearing two different colored shoes picking up the pieces of his leg. He then immediately awakens and in an attempt to forget about it decides to go to a nearby gas station for a snack-and it's then that he meets a man wearing two different colored shoes. To make matters even more surreal, when he leaves he sees the attendant sitting down but when he turns back around he notices that the man is now standing on top of the roof of the gas station. As one might expect this puzzles him quite a bit, but even more than that, as he returns to the service station the next day to try to solve this puzzle the man he now calls ""Socrates"" (Nick Nolte) is so astute that it causes him to reanalyze his entire belief system in the process as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film which incorporates a heavy dose of Zen philosophy throughout. Be that as it may, while I haven't read the book from which it was based, I must admit that I found a couple of the scenes a bit over-the-top and totally unnecessary to the overall story.

Not with a lack of a nice touch, if I'm not mistaking. Anyway, this is the reference after a short notice to the subject, and 10 years later from it. This teachings are quite ""cool"" among occidentals, especially when renamed the ""peaceful warrior way"". U can make a decent movie out of this, and also a movie that holds a seed of some great meaning, that if planted will generate positive reactions in peoples minds. And it did. Just scrolling the user reviews, u get a obvious ""hint"" that the movie will not be a waste of time. The only serious prerequisite for this movie to make any sense and be somewhat fun to watch, is not to be a proselyte of any kind by that matter (even a atheist one). The message is the only thing this movie is all about at any given time. Shure u can rub your chin in a ""unshaved manner"" about the whole plot and etc., but as long as u keep in mind that the only thing that made this movie a real project, is the simple idea that backs up the whole story ... and that is the peaceful warrior way of Dan Millman.<br/><br/>Enjoy, all you that bare in mind the present."

It is a modern art exhibited to Millman (so as to us) is much like a modern art where someone can take what ever you want and some of it can be similar to the creator's.<br/><br/>Even though the lines are excellent, it doesn't take us into the world of Socrates or Millman which why we the film doesn't attach to someone watching.

Initially he has it all; trophies, girls, fast motorcycles, and wild parties but all that changes the night he meets a mysterious stranger in a gas station (Nolte) who holds the power to tap into new worlds of strength and understanding.

","I would like to say that the concept of the ""warrior"" in our lives, is the way we live each day, it's up to us to know how lucky we are by being healthy, by having people around us that loves us, by living the present each day ""knowing"" that today could be our last day. <br/><br/>This movie reminds us of what really matters in this life, what we're supposed to be ""doing"" or ""enjoying"" or ""living"" in this world instead of filling our minds and hearts with what doesn't matter. <br/><br/>My wife and I enjoyed it and we learned from it, made us remember to take care of ourselves each day, to help each other and to help other people as well. <br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie, the direction is not that good or artistic, sometimes you could see that the actor is not the same one when doing gymnastics (body and arms), but, it's definitely worth the time based on the message.<br/><br/>At the end what you feel, think or believe a movie has left on you, is what matters, this movie will definitely do that."

","A book. And more than its adaptation. A film about the essence of existence. Pieces of Zen, Christianity and self definition behind recipes. Amazing Nick Nolte and a story like a lake in sunrise. Gymnastics and snow as fruit of empty days. Values and image of world. Sketches of normality and lights of expectations. And - victory. A movie - meditation. Skin of searches and answer to silent fundamental questions. And happy end as flower of cactus. A charming film , form for define small things as seeds of happiness. delicate fabric, balancing exercise, tale about roots and force, courage and flight, miracles and hidden energy of a young man."

","""Peaceful Warrior"" (2006) is one of those 'almost good' films. It's a worthwhile movie but it's too formulaic and just seems to lack the necessary mojo to pull it out its pedestrian plotting.<br/><br/>Based on Dan Millman's hit 1980 book that I've never read, ""Peaceful Warrior"" is reminiscent of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" albeit with gymnastics substituting for martial arts.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed the constant stream of wisdom that flowed from Nick Nolte's character, ""Socrates,"" the film took a wrong turn with him almost immediately by implying that he had the power to instantaneously levitate 15 feet. From there it gets even weirder. By the end of the film one wonders if he's even real at all. I felt this took away from his character rather than make him more intriguing. Regardless, Nolte does a respectable job in the role and, again, I did enjoy his many gems of wisdom throughout. Some say his philosophies reflects a Buddhist mindset, but I saw Biblical Christianity. For instance:<br/><br/><ul><li>The stress on service and humility, i.e. servanthood. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""Putting out the trash,"" i.e. putting off the old man (the flesh) and putting on the new (the spirit). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Random thoughts are not you but they can become you if you embrace them and allow them to control/lead you. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Joy despite the mundane. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Discerning the real spirit of others (in the compassionate sense, although sometimes for protection). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Give to those who ask of you. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Turning the cheek as one's initial response to antagonism (but, keep in mind, you only have two cheeks, facially speaking).</li></ul><br/><br/>And much more. These are axioms, universal truths that are true regardless of one's lineage, culture or present belief system. It's this aspect and the character of Socrates that make the film worthwhile.<br/><br/>Other than that, though, the story is too formulaic. The plot mechanics are just too obvious. The viewer's aware of the contrivances just as much as the peripheral actors, who fail to pull off the material because of it. But the main four or so actors do a splendid job despite these negatives (Nolte, Scott Mechlowicz, Amy Smart and Agnes Bruckner).<br/><br/>GRADE: C+"

","""You can take your car to the man who wears the star,"" gets a new definition in this movie. Nick Nolte, usually an action movie star, becomes a full service garage mechanic who goes beyond checking under the hood to putting a dip stick into the mind.<br/><br/>This film has a main character, Millman, who thinks he is indestructible and it is his fate to win an Olympic Gold Medal. Instead he becomes a student to a Texaco man? Sounds kind of strange only because it is.<br/><br/>Millman's character is a conceited athlete whose personal life is even more conceited. Instead of seeking help from his team, his coach, & his parents, Socrates (Nolte) takes over. The acting is decent enough, but this movie is a bit long & tries too hard to make you think.<br/><br/>The opening of the film, one of the most cheesy computer graphic leg shattering I have ever seen put on film. Considering the weak start, the film gets better though it promotes the urban legend of athletes being great in physical relationships.<br/><br/>It can inspire someone to overcome obstacles- the main message I found."
"wes-connors","7","0","1","1 February 2010"," Up on the Roof with Victor Salva
","Handsome gymnast Scott Mechlowicz (as Dan Millman) is called ""The Lord of the Rings"" and seems destined for Olympic gold. Naturally (this being an inspirational story), he is sideswiped by a tragic accident. Although Mr. Mechlowicz is told he'll be lucky to walk again, he eventually wants to resume his athletic career, at UC Berkeley. A sagely supernatural older man, Nick Nolte (as Socrates), helps guide young Mechlowicz to greater understanding, and pretty Amy Smart (as Joy) provides some feminine balance. Paul Wesley (as Trevor) and Ashton Holmes (as Tommy) fill in the jock buddy roles.<br/><br/>""Inspired by true events,"" from the real Millman's autobiographical ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"" (1980), this film version isn't fully convincing. Not to fault Mr. Nolte's performance, but his pontifications become more irritating than inspirational. And, we're never really clued in about where the otherworldly character comes from (certainly not a Texaco service station) - perhaps, ""Soc"" and ""Joy"" come from somewhere between Millman's id and ego. Yet, Mechlowicz contributes a strong lead, and the Victor Salva direction is a strength; a high point occurs when Mr. Salva puts Mechlowicz out on a ledge.<br/><br/>******* Peaceful Warrior (6/2/06) Victor Salva ~ Scott Mechlowicz, Nick Nolte, Amy Smart, Tim DeKay"
"Seersha1","6","0","1","10 January 2010"," OK movie
","I read the book and really enjoyed it so that of course led me to rent the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is quite different from the book and only covers about half of the book.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte as Socrates did a find job, although he played the character different to how I would have imagined from the book - in the book Socrates seemed much more lighthearted and fun, full of energy and joy. Meanwhile Dan in the book got a little annoying, but Scott Mechlowicz did a good job with the character.<br/><br/>The ending actually made me cry, it resonated with me. So overall not as good as the book but still worth watching. I'd recommend it to friends"

","You probably don't need another synopsis, so I'll present this viewpoint....this movie clearly brought home its message, which I interpreted to coincide with that of many spiritual and religious practices - i.e. peace and happiness come from within and we must learn to live in the moment etc.. In that aspect, it accomplished its point. On the other hand, I felt some of the scenes were a bit contrived and over the top. Some of the visions, the ""reflex"" scenes, and some of the dialog were a bit much. Perhaps a little more subtlety would've made this a great movie for me rather than a good one. By no means am I an expert in meditation or Buddhist philosophies (or the like), but I have read a couple of books on the subjects. I view the matter as so pure in itself that any affected or overdone presentation of it (no matter how miniscule) gets me a little annoyed and makes me feel a bit unfulfilled. One might find a bit more fluffless approach in the book, Zen and the Art of Happiness, or in the DVD, The Secret Is There Are No Secrets."
"samnike_2525","9","0","2","13 August 2007"," A quick question
","I heard about Peaceful Warrior roughly four months ago. Well, I heard about it being made, then looked at the trailer and decided there and then it was a film I would really enjoy. The release date said 6/21/07 so i waited, yet it didn't come out in the UK. I then looked at the release dates and it didn't even seem to have the UK on it so now i just want it to come out. The DVD's on Ebay seem to say that they only work out of the United Kingdom so I'm not going to gamble getting one. This is really starting to annoy me as it is a film I have been looking forward to for such a long time. Sorry about the speech, it said minimum 10 lines. If anyone knows its release date in England, please email me it on samnike_2525@hotmail.co.uk. Thanks"
