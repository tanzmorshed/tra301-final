"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","692","1200","23 May 2019"," A whole new (different, but familiar) world....
","As soon as this live action version of Aladdin was first announced, it seems certain people were against it. While I too have fond memories of seeing the original animated version at the theatre, I was at least willing to give this one a chance. I'm glad I did. Firstly, people need to realise an animated film and live-action film are two different things. Some things that work in animation just won't translate too well into live-action. The other thing to accept is that, short of resurrecting Robin Williams, there was no way they were ever going to be able to replicate his unique take on the character of the Genie. Once you open your mind to the possibility that something can be 'different' but also *good*; then you'll have a more pleasant experience. That's what we get here: a movie that is familiar, but at the same time new/different (and that's not a bad thing).<br/><br/>From the very beginning, the movie is somewhat different to what we might be expecting when we're introduced to who is telling the story. While it was immediately evident to me what was going on, it wasn't a 'bad' addition. After sweeping shots set to the song 'Arabian Nights', we're introduced to the 'street rat' named Aladdin. Although much fuss has been made about the Genie casting, if Aladdin had been miscast, then the whole film would've suffered. Thankfully, I can say that I almost immediately liked Mena Massoud in the role. He's funny, got moves/charm, makes for a likeable 'thief' and his relationship with his pet monkey, Abu, is as good as I'd hoped it'd be. Speaking of, although people think of CGI characters badly a lot of the time, it must be made clear the animal companions in this are all wonderfully brought to life/fully-realised characters. Abu is expressive, funny, and helpful (despite sometimes getting them both into trouble).<br/><br/>Not before long Aladdin encounters Princess Jasmine (a well-cast Naomi Scott, who does a lot with the character and should make most Jasmine fans proud), who's undercover among the people. I was afraid that the movie would rush through their first meeting, but was happy with the amount of time devoted to them developing an interest in each other. I could instantly tell that the beloved character of Jasmine was in safe hands as portrayed by Naomi Scott and that she had nice chemistry with Massoud's Aladdin. Although not given as much to do as Abu, Jasmine's loyal tiger companion, Rajah, is another lovely animal created with CGI, who I appreciated wasn't largely ignored. Jasmine's other loyal friend, her handmaiden named Dalia, is actually a stand-out character in the movie. Nasim Pedrad has excellent comic timing, as does Naomi Scott, which is on full display in a fun scene where Aladdin comes to the palace and Jasmine attempts to maintain her cover.<br/><br/>The one 'miss' in the casting department is that of Marwan Kenzari as villainous Jafar. While others had pre-judged him based on the trailers alone, I was willing to give him a chance to make up for his lack of sinister voice with what would hopefully be at least a menacing performance. Sadly, he lacks even that. There's nothing particularly memorable about his portrayal (even near the end when he's given every opportunity to unleash in full-on villain mode, he falls way short). About the only 'positive' I could find regarding his character is his animal companion of Iago. The red parrot might not be quite as talkative as the animated version, but he *does* talk (and in a much more bird-like way), getting a few funny lines here and there (I'd expect nothing less from Alan Tudyk providing the voice). It's just disappointing that Jafar's miscast, and thus the 'weak link' in the film.<br/><br/>What most people are probably wondering about is Will Smith as the Genie. I actually thought he was pretty good here (and I found him more likeable in this role than I have in any movie I've seen him in since probably the first Men In Black). There are just one or two instances where I felt he tried to emulate Robin Williams' version and it didn't quite work, but on the whole I felt he brought his own energy/style to the character of Genie and it (mostly) worked. The most important thing was the friendship that he formed with Aladdin. While Smith's Genie may seem a bit more snarky than you might expect, when it comes to the emotional beats, his performance hits the right notes (especially near the end).<br/><br/>Speaking of notes, ""What about the songs?"" you may ask. I was pretty happy with them, there were just the right amount and they didn't feel particularly intrusive in any of the scenes they were featured. Even the new song, 'Speechless', isn't too bad (though there are those who'll no doubt complain). Massoud and Scott have really nice singing voices and did their songs justice, I thought. Will Smith's also decent with his main songs in the movie (the end credits one I could've done without, though).<br/><br/>I must also praise the costumes (Jasmine's are all stunning, as is Jasmine herself), the use of vibrant colours is quite impressive and the overall look of the film feels like something new/different to what we've seen time and time again in films (especially Disney ones). Things I forgot to mention: the Magic Carpet has as much 'character' as in the original (I especially appreciated seeing how close friends Carpet and Abu became by the end), and even the Sultan's head guard, Hakim, is given some depth.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you go into the theatre already disliking/hating the film based on just the trailers, then you're probably going to leave the same way you entered: bitter and thinking things like ""It ruined my childhood!"" (such a rubbish statement). Just try accepting this is a different thing and hopefully you'll enjoy it."
"littlejrd","Null","294","503","7 August 2019"," So much autotune.
","I was left cringing during each musical sequence due to the blatant over use of autotune. The actors bring no emotion to the story."
"kshaharudin","3","445","774","14 July 2019"," Sadly, it met my expectations
","What's to say. Before even filming we knew Guy Ritchie was obviously the wrong choice to direct the film. His style doesn't quite lend itself to this type of film.
Miscast Mena Massoud didn't bring any real character to the role of Aladdin he was simply okay/ functional.
Will Smith is as usual charismatic and had difficult shoes to fill after Robin Williams' take on the genie but he was seriously let down by the VFX in blue genie mode and a weak script.
Another miscast Naomi Scott gave a good performance but I always felt i was looking at Indian and not Middle Eastern. In fact the film IS very bollywood with the Jasmin, Aladdin dance off Indian Style (and to Indian music) then Russian dancing(?) plus other times an Indian soundtrack.
And i'm not even going to talk about that sorry excuse for a villain. No, no i am not.
For a Disney movie set in large Kingdom it sure does feel quite quite small. It looked cheap too. Weird.
Ultimately a dreadfully executed cash grab of a movie that no one asked for. Thanks D.
Thankfully this is exactly what i expected having seen the trailers."
"graves-scott","1","336","589","26 June 2019"," Souless Cash Grab.
","Why do I have this Jeff Goldblum sort of feeling about these new live action movies?<br/><br/>Disney tried so hard to see if thy COULD do live action version of animated classics that they never stopped to ask themselves if they SHOULD.<br/><br/>Damn... I always disagreed with Goldblum's character but maybe he was right."
"miy66","8","577","1033","24 May 2019"," Very Enjoyable!
","I know everyone wants to compare this to the Animated version, but don't. Take it as it comes and you will thoroughly enjoy it. It does stay pretty faithful to the animated version I think. Will Smith as the genie could never be the Robyn Williams genie, but I don't think he tries to. He does fantastically well in his own right. Absolutely loved the Prince Ali song where Aladdin enters the city as the prince. Brilliantly colorful spectacle captured really well. Jafar missed a little for me as had lost the smarmy-ness of the animated version. The songs were great and the Aladdin and Jasmine characterization was pretty spot on. I think kids would love this and I would definitely recommend it."
"renerichter","3","314","553","6 July 2019"," Disney sadly misses the mark... again.
","Like many of the Disney live action adaptations, this film utterly fails to understand what made the original so great to begin with. Moments of character growth or interaction feel rushed and are changed up from the original, yet the outcome in the story still illogically remains the same. Some of the additional scenes around new characters simply feel laughable and out of place.
The additional song written for this film heavily clashes with the musical style of the existing ones and the instrumental accompaniment of the songs in general sounds too modern and not like a classical musical anymore.
The humor in this movie is very hit and miss. Some lines and moments are indeed extremely enjoyable, while most others seem too forced.
The VFX in this film are not entirely up to task and will undoubtedly look dated in a few years time. Most importantly, the overall spectacle feels much less impactful than the original's.
Overall, there would be much more to go into. But this should be enough in summary."
"s-tahrawi","1","271","478","14 July 2019"," Lost it's Magical Touch
","Talk about the wrong cast and cheap visual effects. This is a childhood favorite of mine and was really looking forward to seeing it come to the big screen again. If you are into Indian movies and Bollywood I assume you might like it. This isn't an indian folklore people, why would you direct and cast it in such a way? Where is the Aladdin that keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement? Where is the story telling that keeps you enticed and pulls you into the movie? Where is the wonder in the cave of wonders? Where is the feeling of flying a magic carpet? Where is the Aladdin we all can relate to and inspires us to be better? Where is the family relationship we can all relate to?
NOWHERE....that's the problem; was this movie rushed? Why was the production/direction so bad? Was there not enough budgeting? Were you guys on a deadline? WIll Smith is an amazing actor, and as always carried this movie onto the big screen; but he isn't Robin William. I was actually laughing most of the time at the lines. I honestly hope not all disney re-make movies are going to be done with the same standards.<br/><br/>You know how sometimes you hear someone try and retell a joke and they just totally butcher it? Thats what happened here, great story, but terrible story telling.
At the end of the day, BAD JOKE!"
"kindrea","3","163","287","15 June 2019"," I thought it would never end
","I have only ever walked out of one movie before. This would have been the second one if it wasn't for the fact I was at the end of a row and didn't want to disturb two young families. It was so boring and yet should have been so good.<br/><br/>There were so many chances missed. It's set in Arabia and yes the sets and scenery were amazing, but we never got a chance to enjoy them. The film kept skipping from scene to scene with little or no shots of anything apart from the actors. It should have and could have been both magical and beautiful. Couldn't we have seen Jasmin explore the city a little before bumping in Aladdin? That also would have made her character more rounded and show us how trapped she was in the palace.<br/><br/>I totally fell in love with Aladdin from the animated film and had a teenage crush on him for years (yes, ok, he's an animated character I know, but don't judge me). This Aladdin lacked the animated version's spark and determination and worst of all kindness. He briefly hands a child some dates and that's about it. We don't get to see why he helps Jasmin in the market, it's all too rushed and so their relationship never really feels real and left me really not caring whether they ended up together or not.<br/><br/>The songs, whilst sung quite well, didn't seem to fit into the film and every time one of them burst into song it felt false and like it had been crowbarred in.<br/><br/>All in all it was a real disappointment and left me grieving for what might have been."
"surfer-97852","2","223","401","25 June 2019"," How many remakes can Hollywood do ?
","With the exception of Will Smith whom I have always liked as an actor, this movie and the CGI will never compare to the original with Robin Williams.
I am soooo tired of Hollywood remaking movies to make more money in the inner circle. nothing creative anymore. It's simply about making money$$$$. Its just regurgitation. Hollywood is no longer creative, with some small exceptions, and is clearly in the business of remaking movies over and over again."
"amold-73016","2","210","379","21 June 2019"," No Disney No
","The animation is one of my all time favourite Disney films. Full of laughs, heart, emotion and an incredible story. This was just a total mess. The lead actor is so incredibly wooden, and emotionless, the only good thing going for him is his fantastic dance moves (maybe stick to that from now on). Will Smith is good but forgettable. I totally get that he was trying to make it his own but I'm sorry nothing can out do Robin Williams, and unfortunately that's what this film would have needed to make it great, someone even better than the original. The actor that plays Jafar is next. AWFUL, not menacing enough and it makes for a very lack-lustre performance. Naomi Scott on the other hand was absolutely brilliant as Jasmine. Her voice when she sings Speechless gave me goosebumps. She is the only reason that I gave 2 stars instead of 1. Maybe Disney needs to stop the live action now, I'm really dreading The Lion King and Mulan now as they're both 2 more favourites. Fingers crossed."

"talajano","9","364","681","24 May 2019"," I don't understand why the critics are bashing on this one.
","I honestly didn't know what I was going into and it was such a delightful surprise! It really exceeded my expectations and I had fun during the whole movie. Critics are really being harsh and I can't believe that beauty and the beast was more critically praised. The movie was so bland and boring while this one has so much energy and life to it. The characters had amazing chemistry with each other and the lines were delivered smoothly. The two things I was worried about that subsided as soon as the movie started are:
1- Jafar's character: Marwan tries his best to make but the material he's given isn't strong enough. I wish they developed his character more. However, I didn't mind the change they did it with his character as it fits more with this version.
2- Cultural representation: The trailers made the movie look like a production from bollywood. Not hating on the Indian culture, but it really annoyed me as Arab to see a Middle Eastern/Arabic folk tale that we all know long before Disney introduced it to the world to be represented in a fully different culture. Fortunately, the movie looks and feels way more Arabian such Arabic writings here and there, hearing some people speaking Arabic briefly, the names and appearance of the people of Agrabah and of course the amazing score! Although there are some slight hints of India/South Asia in the clothing and dancing, but I didn't mind that at all.<br/><br/>I would've give it a 10 if the cinematography was better. This is my only issue with movie as it looked like high budget TV soap opera in some scenes.<br/><br/>Don't miss on this one! You'll have fun."

Aladdin truly is magical. Aladdin has a long and illustrious legacy. As usual, the plot of beggar Aladdin and Princess Jasmine fighting for their love is incredible. This movie was great !!

"theredsky","2","147","265","14 July 2019"," Aladdin Review
","I tried to like this movie but I couldn't. Disney Live Action remakes just aren't good. All the Live Action remakes are only made for money. They bank too heavily on nostalgia which I don't like. I feel that this movie should not have been made. I feel the same way about any Live Action remake that has been released or is coming out. Here are some positives. Most of the cast does a good job. Will Smith isn't trying to beat out Robin Williams as the Genie but still does a great job. The soundtrack is decent. It's still incredibly catchy but not as catchy as the original. The only song I feel that is better in this movie is Arabian Nights. All the other songs are good but not as outstanding as the original. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives. The pacing of this film is way off. It feels rushed at certain points and the end of the film starts to drag and it takes too long. It also doesn't help that this film is 38 minutes longer than the original. Marwan Kenzari is a decent actor but he didn't do a good job in this film. In my opinion, he didn't know what to do with the character. Jafar never felt like a major threat during the film which is a problem because he is the main villain. There were some changes that were made to the story but I felt they really didn't work for me. Jasmine's added character arc was a big meh for me. It felt a little out of place within the narrative. The new songs they added were meh for me. They aren't as memorable as the other songs in the film. The effects on the Genie are still as bad as they were in the trailer which was very distracting. The film is very brightly lit which makes it feel like a Disney Channel Original Film. There are also some slow motion scenes that come out of nowhere and make no sense at all. Overall, Aladdin may have a half decent score but fails to capture the magic of the original film. I give Aladdin a 2/10."

","Disappointed at how terrible this movie is. We reached a point where we had to just walk out of the theater. The acting was horrible. The singing was bad.

"lisafordeay","10","361","681","25 May 2019"," Seriously what is wrong with critics I loved this retailing
","Aladdin is the latest Disney remake based on the 1992 animated film starring the late Robin Williams. This 2019 retailing stars Will Smith, Mena Masound and Naomi Scott and follows the tale of a young man named Aladdin(Massound) who meets a young woman at the marketplace unaware that she is the Princess Jasmine in incongito(Scott)and wants to win her over. With help from a charming Genie(Will Smith),Aladdin disguises himself as a Prince. But when an evil sultan named Jafar wants the lamp,can Aladdin win the Princesses heart.<br/><br/>Now I'm not gonna lie I was so nervous watching this film as I thought Will Smith would ruin it with his singing style and the other actors,but to my surprise along with my mom and my brother,we all loved it. Will Smith was great in this film with his comedic timing,Naomi Scott was excellent as Jasmine(And boy can she sing so good). The villian was decent I thought he was different compare to the 1992 version.<br/><br/>The cinematography was gorgeous, the music was very good especially the new song Speechless. The costumes were stunning too.<br/><br/>I loved how it wasn't a beat by beat of the original. For instance in the One Jump Ahead song Aladdin and Jasmine meet first thing while she is in incognito and near the end Jasmine didn't say I choose you Aladdin/call me Al.<br/><br/>Guy Richie thank you for making this film. Would definetly put it in my top 5 favourite Disney Live Action movies of all time now.
Definetly buying this movie and may watch it in the cinemas again.<br/><br/>9.5/10<br/><br/>
Ps Mena Masound was handsome and likeable. His chemistry with Naomi Scott was perfect."
"shabooh_shoobah1","1","154","280","18 June 2019"," So disappointed
","This remake is so bad. It is not a good movie by any means. All of the characters are ruined. In the original Aladdin was charming and charismatic, in this he's clumsy, awkward and seemingly dim witted. A scene where he fumbles through a conversation with the princess, stuttering inaudible sounds is painful to watch. The sultan, once kind hearted and jolly now controlling and not nearly as likeable. Jafar, no longer old and twisted he's young and evil for a reason that doesn't seem to be explained. Then there's Genie. I was hesitant to see this movie for this reason. I love Will Smith, but no one could ever come close to the masterpiece that Robin Williams achieves with his portrayal of Genie. Will Smith could, and should, have put his own trademark spin on the character. But unfortunately he didn't, and as a result he's very bland. The storyline doesn't help, Aladdin and Genie's friendship isn't built, it's just suddenly announced that they are friends, which just seems odd and insincere. Which pretty much sums up the acting from all he other actors. It feels fake and it feels forced, there were times I thought I was watching a high school production. The original movie deserved so much more than this. The one redeeming feature is some of the choreography, but in saying that I'm reminded of one music scene where the footage was sped up and I was left wondering why film techniques from the 1950s were being used. Very disappointed. I love the original. And that's the Aladdin I love and will keep in my heart as the right and only version."

Who chose the actors? The acting was bad, Will Smith as the genie??? Everyone agrees that reenact Robin Williams would be a though task, Will Smith has done some great things but here failed completely.
Jaffar, that powerful imponent deceitful character, again, I'm sorry, Mr Kenzari wasn't up to the task.
The scenery was bad, I mean, it would be acceptable for a Sunday morning Disney channel, 8 to 10 year old audience, not for a movie theater motion picture. The singing like wise, awful, no emotion.

","The acting and chemistry between characters is so weak that it seems as if the directors pulled amateurs off the street, threw elaborate costumes on them, shot them separately in front of a green screen during their first reading, and then composited them all together with CGI. Speaking of fakery, even common animals like the monkey and tiger are CGI, when Hollywood has been using real, trained such animals with success in the industry for years. What's the point of a ""live action"" movie if even such common elements are unreal CGI.

I'm not sure if they were trying to make him do that but it just seemed odd. The songs where well done but they never go into a really Big Bang. Princess Jasmine has a totally different outlook on what she wants to achieve. The jokes where not the same, perhaps due to political correctness. It was very very Bollywood in parts. I for one would of like to see abayas for the women and kandoras for men. Aladdin doesn't wear a shirt in the original he just wears a vest, so they have tried to change his look. The palace looks like something out of a Star Wars. I don't know why they changed the look of this. The movie moves very fast in key points of the movie then slows down and drags out pointless moments. I think the best part of the movie was when the carpet makes the Disney castle in the sand when Aladdin and genie are talking after escaping the cave. Unfortunately they missed their opportunity to make this an impactful meaningful movie. Instead we got something of a try hard remake with someone's take on classic."

Everything about the movie including THE CAVE OF WONDERS was UNDERWHELMING!!!!!!!!! Aladdin and Jasmine had no chemistry whatsoever. The actor who played Aladdin everytime he was on screen his dialogue was TOTALLY PAINFUL to listen to. The actor who played wasn't any better The live screen counterparts of Aladdin and Jafar totally SODOMIZED their animated counterparts from the original DISNEY movie. The only good performances came Will Smith who played The Genie, Naiomi Scott who played Princess Jasmine, and the actress who played Princess Jasmine's Hand Maiden who's role was inconsequential to the movie, but her performance was adequate and she had AMAZING CHEMISTRY with Will Smith. Let's be honest Will Smith didn't upstage Robin Williams as The Genie NO ONE CAN OR WILL. But he did take an really interesting approach to the role and completely made it his own. Will Smith was mostly playing his Dating Coach role from the movie HITCH and I say that because he mostly offered Aladdin dating advice on how to win Princess Jasmine's heart I gotta be honest it was surprising how HILARIOUS Will Smith was in the role of The Genie when I thought he'd be one of THE WORST ACTORS IN THE MOVIE He ended up being up being ONE OF THE BEST. Also Scott did an adequate job as Princess Jasmine and her SINGING IS OFF THE CHARTS Everyone else in ALADDIN COMPLETELY ALADDIN AND JAFAR PS DISNEY PLEASE STOP REMAKING YOUR CLASSIC MASTERPIECES BECAUSE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST AND DUMBO ARE GIANT TURDS TOO"

","None of the magic, chemistry, charisma, or comedic timing of the original Disney version was present here.

And, in typical Disney fashion, they PC'd the tar out of this one as they've been doing with all of their sequels and remakes over the last several years. Other appealing elements from the original were simply left out entirely. Iago, for example, was a funny character in the 90's version, but pretty much just a normal parrot in this one. Abu? You guessed it. Normal monkey. Skip it."

"patalingjugaeron","4","60","103","22 July 2019"," A messy and underwhelming live-action adaptation, with uninspiring results
","As much as Disney continues to turn every animated film within their animated vault into live-action, the live-action adaptation of Aladdin is turned into an underwhelming, uninspired and jumbled mess, with only a few redeemable qualities.<br/><br/>In terms of direction, Guy Ritchie is proven to be ill-suited to direct a musical like Aladdin, given the fact of how he handled the direction of the musical sequences turns completely bland, and the results of its action sequences were choppily-cut and sloppy, which results on his direction as extremely rote and soulless. Another issue with this remake, is that the script is completely messy and it's all over the place, with full of cringeworthy dialogue, humour and off-putting jokes, with none of it stick the landing. Furthermore, the prevalence of ham-fisted exposition also results to the loss of naturalism and dramatic pause, and it weakens characterizations. Making no favors either, is that the brutally slowed pacing, which makes the viewing experience of this remake to feel like a complete slog. Another problem that this remake truly suffers, is with the cheap-looking quality of the costumes and sets, along with the inconsistent CGI (particularly the CGI quality of Will Smith's Genie, which almost looks unwatchable), making the remake completely dull and garish. The worst quality of this movie, comes with a cheap and bad cinematography that features like a TV instead of cinema, as well as the jarring and incoherent editing, which really weaken the film's quality even further.<br/><br/>And lastly, comes with the terrible performance of Marwan Kenzari as Jafar, who's completely miscast for the villainous role of Jafar. While film attempts to make Jafar a more suave, handsome and even charming character - compared to being both a literal and figurative cartoon in the animated film, Kenzari's lack of screen presence and wooden delivery fails to do justice to the iconic Disney villain. Furthermore, the part desperately needed an actor with actual bass in their voice, not to mention a prevailing charisma, both of which Kenzari simply lacks. Making no good favors, comes with the underwhelming voice work of Alan Tudyk as Iago, whom simply wasted and falls short to the superior voice work of Gilbert Gottfried as Iago.<br/><br/>Still, the Aladdin is still salvaged with some redeemable qualities that saved this remake from being a complete trainwreck. Among the cast that stood out as the best, was Will Smith in his interpretation of the Genie of which he easily serves as the most entertaining aspect of the entire movie and nearly stealing the whole show. At the same time, his performance gave him the most Will Smith performance that he has ever given. Also, Will Smith also have a good sense of not to try and imitate or out-do the iconic performance of Robin Williams's Genie, by placing Will Smith's own style and flavor in his version of the Genie, which is completely impressive. Also, the major standouts with the movie were Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott as Aladdin and Jasmine, who gave out their fleshed out and natural chemistry to win out above the cheesy nature of the film, as well as charismatic performances. Other members of the cast that nearly stole the show were Nasim Pedrad as Dalia, and Billy Magnussen as Prince Anders, despite of the two being underutilized, had the most effective comedic work and timing.<br/><br/>All in all, the Aladdin remake still serves as an inferior and weak counterpart to the more superior 1992 animated original. Nevertheless, in spite of the film's flaws and problems, the Aladdin remake can simply be treated as a guilty pleasure."

","I have never liked Guy Ritchie movies. Whilst I will say he does have a certain style that is recognisable in his earlier gangster flicks, his recent directorial efforts have been awash with horrible editing, painful dialogue, and surprisingly a lack of a fitting style. Aladdin is another live action remake of a Disney classic, and its only positives are two solid performances from Will Smith and Naomi Scott, and some predictably strong CGI.<br/><br/>However, the rest of the film sucks. I hated Aladdin so much it may even be my most hated film of 2019. Mena Massoud is just a pretty boy with the acting range of a TV remote. The actor who played the villain is terrible, he isn't menacing, he's more campy and pathetic. The dance and song numbers are just flat, there is zero creativity except for the costume department. The camera work is basic, there is zero attempt to add flair and pace and fun into these dance numbers, hell even The Greatest Showman had flair and style.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie is lazy. He injects nothing into the film in terms of style or making the film standout from others like it. It's just paint by the numbers, let's get from A to B filmmaking.<br/><br/>There is no tension, the comedy is so painful at one point I felt I had an aneurysm, and I blame that on the scene involving a hugely elongated joke about jam jars. The stars have no chemistry, the romance feels fake, and what hit me the most about this film, and just like the majority of these live action remakes, is that I'm always aware about how artificial these movies are. I'm aware everything is green screen, I'm aware that there is nothing remotely real or believable in these flicks. A movie should immerse you and make you forget about what went into it, only after should you admire how technically accomplished a film may be, but these Disney remakes are artificial and without a heart.

"CriticalOfEverything","2","102","187","3 June 2019"," Pointless and lost.
","Disney strikes back with yet another live-action remake disaster that soils the name of the original movies. Aladdin (2019) is a confused mess. It not only adds nothing remarkable on to the original to justify it's existence, but Aladdin is a movie that only works in animation, because in live-action it's identity is just lost. The CGI is abominable. Despite a few scenes where it's OK, the CGI overall is shockingly bad for a Disney film and it's even more depressing that they sunk so much money into it. The Genie specifically is one of the worst looking CGI characters I've seen in some time. And more on the Genie; I've seen a lot of people say that they like Will Smith's Genie, and while I will commend Smith for not trying to imitate Robin Williams' Genie and for doing his on thing, it's just not working for me. They also butchered a lot of the songs, specifically ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali"". Not only can Will Smith not sing to save his life and the songs have been 69'd by autotune, but they've also added some new lines and lyrics into them as well as changing their flow and energy at times. While it's fine to add some differences from the original, this is the wrong kind of different. No one wanted the songs to be changed and the new lyrics are OK at best and shockingly bad at worst. The flow and tone of the songs has also been changed and that's probably due to Will Smith's singing, because what made Robin Williams' Genie great is the sheer amount of incredible energy he gave which is also what made ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali"" so fun and catchy. Here, Will Smith completely butchers these songs, especially ""Prince Ali"" because of how slow and boring it is compared to the original. Finally, the movie is just pointless. It doesn't justify it's existence at all. Why would I want to watch a boring and slow version of the original with none of the colourful, expressive animation and humour when I can watch the original, at ANY TIME, which has the expressive animation and humour? It's a pointless and unoriginal bore of a film that I will not be seeing again."
"spotboyfilms","2","107","197","4 June 2019"," A magic-less tale
","Aladdin (2019) lacks the 'feels' that the original had. The strongest thing about the film is the world-building of the city. The wardrobe, makeup, and production design is pretty impressive. It's refreshing to see a ethnically-appropriate actor play the character of Aladdin. I wish they had done the same with Jasmine (even though the actress is really beautiful). For a kids movie, I haven't seen so many bored children watching this film, even when Genie comes on screen. Aladdin, Genie, the Villain, are all not very engaging.
SPOILERS AHEAD:
The movie feels like they had some original ideas that were lost along the way- for example, Aladdin's acrobatics and inventiveness never comes in to play later on the movie. Another example- the bad guy says his origins are similar to Aladdin's- as a street-rat, but they never do anything interesting with that. There's Genie's B-Love-Story that ultimately is pretty boring and contrived, seems to be placed there just to pad the run-time. When Genie gets his freedom, what should have been a strong emotional scene is just so weak. You don't feel it. Almost like it was another mark on a checklist of things to do.
When you see that kids are yawning theough the magical carpet flying in the sky segment of the film, you know the wonder is missing. I wish they had done a better job with this retelling of classic Disney. It feels so called in, and unoriginal. It feels like a Hanna Montana episode on the Big-screen. Robin William's Genie is a hard act to follow. But it seems like the filmmakers and Will Smith didn't even get anywhere emotionally with the Genie- forget the antics."

It has some good stuff, for example it's not boring and the scenery looks pretty nice. But except for that, I thought that the movie was kinda bad. I don't know if it's just me but the CGI looked a little dated and the music was kinda weird. I loved the original Aladdin and I like the fact that they changed some stuff. But the changes don't hold up, especially if we're talking about the music. I have nothing against autotune but it is so overused to the point that you can hear it.
What I especially didn't like were the actors. They weren't horrible, but they were still bad. I wasn't convinced about the chemistry between the characters, it didn't feel real. But Will Smith was pretty okay.

I wish I could say I only feel this way because it sodomizes one of my favorites, but it genuinely has so many elements that make it a terrible movie regardless of the source material.<br/><br/>Will Smith's singing sounds exactly like someone who's just there for the paycheck. Jasmine's character gets the full Hollywood treatment- songs are fabricated/forced and her arc is altered and streamlined to suit the modern feminist agenda. Aladdin is played about as boring as you can imagine. Jafar is no longer an intimidating, memorable movie villain but instead a whiny moron with absolutely cringe-y dialogue....and they couldn't even give him a legit beard!!<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely devoid of any humor; there are scenes that try so hard to make you laugh but instead made everyone in the theater groan out of discomfort.<br/><br/>There is no chemistry between any of the characters/actors (and honestly I think that was the single biggest issue with the whole thing). Whether it's Will Smith acting like he's got about 1,000 better things to do than be in the movie, or Sultan looking lobotomized the whole time, or Jasmine/Aladdin's weak scenes together that are devoid of passion, everything feels completely mailed-in. How would you ever feel or relate to a scene of friends having a fall out if you never believe they're friends in the first place?<br/><br/>""Oh well, maybe at least the old songs will give some nostalgia, at least,"" I think to myself.

","I was genuinelly excited, Guy Richie has a great library of titles completely worth his reputation.
But this... it just does not make sense, Will Smith is absolutely trapped between his role in Hitch and what I can only asume is admiration for Robin Williams iconic role, and the result is a horrible mismatch of him being unnecesarily rude and mean to aladdin, and then in a matter of minutes jumping to save him as per him considering Al his ""friend"" with no honest answer as to why.
Aladdin comes as just sort of a dork, which can't even speak a full sentence without being ridiculed, but we are somehow expected to believe that he is motivated by being a Prince, but then we are never shown that this is the case, he even says he doesnt want it, so one cant really relate as to his intentions.
And finally, stop it with the feminista agenda, the ending does a great job of promoting that women can be great sultans, and that in itself would have made an amazing ending, but that scene in which she randomly bursts into song with everyone else disappearing, only to confront the guards (by the way completely overturning the rules of the magic wishes, in which if jafar wished to be sultan, the Princess speech should not be able to modify that), and ultimately being an empty gesture as it does nothing to the plot.
And finally, whats with all the singing, this is supposed to be a live action re telling, not a politically corrected cgi dependent version of the original, I cant understand why they couldnt make a sort of more ""realistic"" retelling of the story when on paper they had all the elements for doing so.
Different media, in this case animation vs live films, should have different ways of telling stories.

For example, when Jafar says in the original ""I'm giving you your reward. Your ETERNAL reward!"" before he pushes Aladdin back in the cave it is chilling! In this one he says ""how bout my foot?""... why?? There's nothing wrong with keeping every single line the exact same, it would have done nothing but please the fans. But instead of giving us what we want you have to sit around and scheme about how change every little thing and annoy us so you can try to prove to Disney you're ""creative"".<br/><br/>The biggest offense and change of all is the ending climax, which wasn't climactic in the slightest. In the original from the time Jafar gets the lamp to the Genie being free it is an intense and chaotic whirlwind of action, never slowing down and keeping up great suspense. Here we have Jafar just LOUNGING around in the sultans chair without seemingly any good plans to use his power, an extremely painful and out of nowhere Jasmine ballad, an impromptu wedding, and a stupid carpet chase with IAGO. Which, by the way, IAGOs character in the original was full of life and wit and arguably one of the main characters... here he is just unfunny background noise.<br/><br/>So our ""climax"" is drawn out to excruciating minutia of slow events with no suspense at all. Not to mention no snake, no Jasmine drowning in the hourglass, nothin, nada, zip. It was almost like they just gave up when they got near the end of the script. I guarantee if you had just done a perfect shot for shot remake, audiences would have praised and loved it. Although Will Smith and his auto tune would still ruin most his scenes. Thanks to the blind sheep of the masses, Disney will continue to get away with these travesties time and time again, because they monopolize the film industry and no one will stand up to them or stop them which is why someday they will have a new release every weekend of the year, giving no chance to smaller films to shine and turning the entire film industry into one big Corporate wasteland. Negative stars."
"nicolemanimefan","1","140","268","29 May 2019"," Disney, STOP these remakes! I can't believe people are saying this is good!
","Oh, boy. Where to begin. Aladdin was by far my favorite Disney movie as a kid-it had positive messages, great cinematography/music, strong character arcs, and, most importantly, 2D animation, which created an experience that live action simply cannot imitate. I'm now 26.<br/><br/>This movie was AWFUL. Such a disgrace to Howard Ashman's legacy. Cheap-looking costumes, lifeless camera-work, clunky stunt doubles, and heavily autotuned songs (with the exception of Scott as Jasmine). What breaks my heart is how so many people are praising this film, especially how the character of Jasmine is portrayed as a positive role model. Let me tell you, I am a feminist and I felt her character was very poorly portrayed. Separating this from the original film, there are very little scenes in this movie that SHOW her taking action to change her circumstances. It's fine to change her character arc slightly to have ambitions and want a career (by the way, people, her original ambition in the 1992 version was NOT to have a man, but freedom. She didn't even want the crown! I am so sick of people bashing Disney's classics about how women were powerless and lovesick without even bothering to understand the context, yet Frozen's Anna, who is even MORE obsessed with boys, is praised), but one little scene at the end where she stands up to her advisor while sitting in the palace pondering about Aladdin the rest of the film is not enough to justify this new arc. In the original, Jasmine shows sprit, courage, and fights back for what she wants. Here, she sings about how ""Speechless"" she is and just waits around for Aladdin. Beautiful song, but completely out of context here. For such a powerful women, in the beginning we even see her being afraid to jump across the building with the pole saying ""oh my gosh I can't do this!!"" Where in the original, she does it no problem. Jasmine aside, important scenes are cut and unnecessarily swapped around, such as how Aladdin and Jasmine meet up immediately in the beginning of this film. This ruins their potential chemistry and build-up to their stories. Why cut out the scene with Jasmine and the birdcage, or the scene when Aladdin gets pushed down and laughed at by the townspeople (One Jump Ahead Reprise?) Those scenes showed symbolism, foreshadowing and why their struggles made them so compatible. There's nothing wrong with falling in love and finding your best friend admidst your own respective personal journey, and the original Aladdin portrayed Jasmine and Aladdin as equals. Not so here. By making Jasmine more feminist, she is more dated.<br/><br/>One trend I notice with these live action remakes is that so much dialogue is crammed into each scene (with the addition of unnecessary backstory), to the point where the story TELLS, not SHOWS. The subtlety of the 1992 film where every pause, every movement, the soft romantic music and the beats of the way the camera showed expression on character's faces is replaced with speedy, zippy dialogue (which isn't organic or funny). On another side note, the portrayal of Jafar in this film was disgusting. Where was the funny dialogue showing his maniacal tendencies? The scene where he turns into an old man? What about the huge climax where Aladdin fights Jafar and comes to terms with himself? Nope. Couldn't even give us that. And the Genie-don't even get me started on the Genie. His whole arc was changed from being a kind mentor to Aladdin to pushing Aladdin aside so he could go ""party with a women."" The core values are still somewhat here, such as being true to yourself, the consequences of dishonesty, and having ambition, but they are watered down with the omission of certain scenes to the point where the story feels so hallow. It's like Disney is trying to stay as close as possible to the original story to not oftend anyone, but at the same time making all these unnecessary changes to an otherwise perfectly constructed narrative, resulting in a chopped up mess of a script. I'm sorry to say that not even Will Smith, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott's talents could save this souless cash-grab.<br/><br/>It's a terrible shame that the Walt Disney company has fallen so far from its roots. The worst part is that this film, like BoTB and the upcoming Lion King, is going to make the company billions of dollars. There is absolutely no value in showing these films to our children. Why people continue to praise these mindless remakes are beyond me. Even if one were to compare these films separately as their own narrative, there is no heart, story, nor message to be told.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and turn on the original. Disney, go back to doing what made you great. These remakes are passable-but 2D animation is what made you exceptional."

"umalironnel","3","65","118","10 June 2019"," Good comedy
","I was excited watching this movie as this is one of my favorite Disney movies and A Whole New World is a favorite song too. All that excitement turns to disappointment though. I understand that as a ""live"" action version of the animated film, they had to make it human and realistic. However, as magical the original was, the live action was not able to portray the same, which the film is mostly about. It feels like the creator was torn between making it human and magical. The effects and cgi is not that good. Compare to other films which are originally live actions(Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings), I can't understand why they're not able to do the same level of ""magic"" with the scenes that requires it. Prime example is the encounter at the end, where Jafar got hold of Genie. That scene turned out a plain dialogue. The acting is particularly not convincing. Example is when Aladdin was thrown out to water from the window. I would've expected Genie to act more hysterical or otherwise acted it out funny, but, it turns out awkward. There are times Abu, the monkey, would just take all the attention from the actors. He was the savior of all the dull and awkward scenes in the movie. Not to mention Jafar, the acting was plain and boring. Nothing you'd expect from a wicked villain. Jasmine's character up to the end had no progression. Finally, the film is generally for kids and would easily convince them from the not so good acting and effects, but can't understand the purpose of adding politics(feminism) in it. It was just unnecessary."

","I really looked forward to watching this movie. I usually like movies with Will Smith; his acting in I am legend and I, robot I found to be amazing. Aladdin, though, fails on so many levels...... Mena Massoud was utterly uninspired in his attempt at acting; Will Smith's singing seemed really forced, a performance one would expect from an untalented amateur singer; there was no chemistry whatsoever between the actors in this film. It took five sittings for me to finish the movie. I kept coming back because I thought, ""hey, it's got to get better, right?"" I was wrong. I really hope you have a better experience when watching Aladdin. As for me, I am extremely disappointed."

"waynebullen","2","69","126","27 May 2019"," Can't understand why?.......
","Why oh why did they cast everyone that is wrong for their roles. Will Smith as Genie is so far from the mark is in fact painful to watch. What Disney did is pay cast Will Smith to be - well Will Smith. It was never going to be easy to follow in the footsteps of the late/great Robin Williams, but Smith just wasn't the right actor. The character demands a loose cannon actor who'd insert energy by going off script. The likes of Jim Carey comes to mind, Eddie Murphy, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Seth Rogan to name but a few would've suited better. I simply think this film wasn't well cast against the story we know and love. I had high hopes in this but it simply crashed and burned for me. Money will be made, but alas it's got the feel of huge CGI level of cash has been thrown at it and they hope success will stick. It's not a classic but is a simple classic retell. You'll watch it once type film, not one you'd put on again and again. On rerun maybe, to keep the kids content on a Sunday afternoon but I'll have to pass by first frozen/Tangled/CoCo/Beauty and the Beast/lion king etc, once this lands again on cable/sky. Sorry Will, don't hate me for the truth, just remember Sharks Tail my friend, you had to make a wage but dam son, this was a 'no!' all day of the week!. Sack your agent!"

"jamesmckew","1","113","215","2 June 2019"," COMPLETE MESS
","From start to finish this is a complete mess and strays so far from the original. I don't mind enhancing the story and putting a new spin on it, but Guy Richie butchered it by changing it in every possible way.<br/><br/>The dialogue is painful and unnatural and the musical scenes are a mess.<br/><br/>Aside from Naomi Scott, the casting was terrible. The old wise character of Jafar was totally destroyed by Marwan Kenzari. One of the best characters in the original, Jafar's sidekick Iago, could barely talk and for some reason was turned into a monster in one of the many completely unnecessary scenes.<br/><br/>Basically unrecognisable from one of Disney's great original movies and a real shame. No idea why Disney allowed this mess to happen."
"robertgeraldsmith","3","48","85","9 June 2019"," ""How could you?""
","Jafar the street rat trying to relate to Aladdin prior to the cave .... evil became so much less. Why eliminate the jail scene? ""The one who has the gold makes the rules."" The truly evil mystery of Jafar turns into the predictable future aspiring conqueror. Boring!<br/><br/>The talking parrot ... Iago is gone. ""Owww that hurt!""<br/><br/>Abu The Thief with no heart. Did you forget Abu arguing with Aladdin and the scene with the bread / kids ... now instead Abu just steaks from Jasmine. Lame.<br/><br/>Jasmine the sultan - who needs a man. Fair is she seeks out romance still but it feels hollow - especially after Prince Ali shows up.<br/><br/>How is Jasmine (who admits to never leaving the palace) more ""smooth"" with people than a street rat Aladdin? The Throne room scene with Prince Ali is tortuous and the curtesy - is Aladdin the one who lived as a outcast not a smooth talking city thief? Or was Aladdin always on a iPhone with no social skills?<br/><br/>Why can't Jasmine and Aladdin be equals? This felt like Aladdin is timid, no confidence even at the end, and just unable to learn. Jasmine seems single minded on the throne like Jafar was in the original, love is just a side goal to her law degree and taking over her dad's firm. The uneducated Aladdin is the man candy perk who is not her equal in any way. A safe play.<br/><br/>Did Jafar ever show he wanted Jasmine to marry him as a means to power? Not in this. Even better Jafar seems to never really show lust. ""Tell me more about me"" originally so evil.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Will Smith but how can a phenomenal powerful genie not know Aladdin's name? More so, comedy? Much of the comedy by Robin Williams made the original movie - Will Smith can sing and dance but comedy is hollow. Will Smith did the best Hitch job he could. But why did the Hulk and the Smurfs create a baby genie? ""Look at me from the side ...""<br/><br/>CGI much, it was Avatar meets Aladdin in many scenes - and a cheap Avatar at that. ""I can show you CGI, with some half inspired singing"". ""You will never again see the light of day!"" ""How snakelike I can be!"" - so much opportunity lost to uninspired tween level capitalism. Disney can do CGI but this was a epic globe trotting fail.<br/><br/>Kudos on the Sultan, he seemed more a leader but opposite the original Sultan enjoying life riding carpet, he just feels the old tired wiseman but with guts to hit Jafar instead of yelling ""guards"".<br/><br/>Where's the character development? Jasmine pushing to change laws for love not power/inheritance? The sultan learning to accept a street rat as a man of character? Genie discovering friends (Abu/carpet) not just Aladdin. Aladdin discoveries love through truth and that lies have prices.<br/><br/>Jafar still learns the price of power - in less than 5 minutes burning all 3 wishes like a man born into power without a thought ... anti storyline and far from developing a thought out scheme.<br/><br/>I enjoy a good twist. Yet ironic that here the maid can long for Genie more passionately than Jasmine for Aladdin. Creative license is great, but you guys ""tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter."" - Linkin Park<br/><br/>Role reversals can work, but when you wholesale remove characters Central to comedy/story lines - and add irrelevant characters (you can remove the maid with 0 change to the result). Plus, gut key scenes to evolving personality and development, how can you hope to succeed?<br/><br/>At no point did the story come close to the original. And if that's the goal - you succeeded. The singing is all weaker, humor - do you guys know humor using cultural references - is absentee, and love - I believe Genie loves the maid and Jasmine loves being Sultan but that's it. Even Jafar's love of power comes off as a bitter teenager who wants to be a billionaire - not really genuine.<br/><br/>Aladdin feel prey to capitalists at Disney just like Star Wars destroyed their own Universe of core planets for a movie instead of growing the universe. Capitalist greed - the death of good story telling. Not the actors/actresses fault, that's just how the cookie crumbled."
"mornept","3","50","89","2 August 2019"," Boring, no charm whatsoever, careless
","I was greatly disappointed by this film. I was expecting beautiful landscapes, incredible renditions, and a phenomenal performance by Will Smith. It has not redeemed itself.<br/><br/>Firstly, the introduction to the movie was a lazy effort at a backstory. It always feels false when a movie starts with children asking someone to tell them a story. In all honestly, this was one of the worst examples I've seen of this clichÃ©.<br/><br/>Then the editing was way too fast. It felt like someone just randomly cut to whoever was talking, and therefore we never got any reaction shots or other focuses. And all the action shots were cut way too soon; by the time I even realised what was happening in the frame, it had cut away to something else, so it felt very overwhelming to me.<br/><br/>I also disliked the new appearance of the Genie. I think he should have stayed black the entire movie, because the blue tone felt so incredibly artificial and therefore I couldn't help but laugh. During all the shots where he is significantly bigger than the other characters, he felt too stretched out and laughably larger.<br/><br/>The character of Aladdin also lost all his charm. No longer is he headstrong, confident and endearing, but the acting was so unbelievable he came across as annoying, cocky and merely a copycat of the original. It was also off-putting considering how it's only the main characters that have American accents; either all the characters should have Western Asian accents or all of them should have American - it feels weird otherwise.<br/><br/>I also greatly despised 'Speechless'. Not only is it badly written (using the words quiet, silent, and speechless in the chorus alone is just lazy), but it doesn't match the film whatsoever. Gone are the beautiful instruments and Western Asian significance, and along came a pop ballad that most certainly is only in the film to be nominated for an Oscar and to top the charts.<br/><br/>In summary, I was majorly disappointed by this movie, and all of Disney's usual talent has wasted away and become lazy, and once again they've just made another monetary, boring copycat."

"cristiandeiana","3","52","93","1 June 2019"," Poor and unnecessary remake
","I'll start by trying to review this like a stand alone film as opposed to a remake. There are a a few aspects of this film which are good, which is that the story and the songs are well written, and the setting is great, but of course this is no surprise. Sadly it doesn't shine through in all areas, most notably for the very poor CGI, as well as poor acting by most of the cast, especially from Mena Massoud who plays Aladdin. Now had this been an original release I would give this a 6/10, it's a distinctly average movie, good songs and story but with jokes that fall very flat, some poor acting and CGI.<br/><br/>The reality is however that this is a remake, a remake of a very accomplished film, and so this is where I have mixed feelings. Anyone who has watched the original and had the chance to fully appreciate it before watching the remake can see that the casting in this movie is undeniably very bad. Aladdin lacks the charm and charisma which defined the original character, Jasmin lacks that distinct kind of fiery character of the original, Jafar has become this very generic bad guy, again nothing like the original, and as for the Genie, well Will Smith was just never gonna come close to the incredible performance of Robin Williams. The casting in this remake is just all wrong, and I find it quite disappointing. Honestly I don't think there really was a need to remake this movie in the first place as the original is still fantastic. Ultimately this version is easily good enough to entertain children, so sure you can take your kids to the cinema to watch it and they'll love it no doubt. But what irks me is that the next generation kids are gonna grow up watching this shoddy remake which is just a mere shadow of it's predecessor, and that the pure class of the original may no longer be appreciated by many.<br/><br/>I do wish Disney would stop doing this as it's killing the classics. At least if you're gonna go through the effort to remake a classic then cast the right actors for the part and don't skimp on the CGI, otherwise what's the point other than to just money grab at the box office, it's just greed and a lack of original ideas which is killing cinema, and it's for this reason I have to lower my rating because I just can't advocate this garbage. If you want to enjoy the story of Aladdin, watch the original as it's far superior in every single way and if possible try to even find a classic cinema that can play the original if you want to take your kids to see it for the first time."

Will Smith was nowhere near as bad as we feared. But other than that this movie improves of the source in no way. It feels like they were just making it to address 20 years worth of people pointing out plot holes. It also, despite the leaps and bounds increase in technology over the decades, doesn't improve on the spectacle of the original, nothing feel as big or grand, it's all more down to earth. Less entertaining, less magical, just less. And the addition of the third act chase scene is indicative of the formulaic pushing of all cookie cutter movies Disney pushes.

Let me not get started on Jafar, he has to be the worst part in this entire movie he even reveals himself trying to kill Aladdin. In the original he disguised himself so he wouldn't be recognized, but here Jafar is like ""Yep I'm Jafar, get me that lamp""<br/><br/>Most of the scenes feel rushed? Like when Jasmine gives 2 kids some bread that scene goes by way too fast. Let me not get started on the actors, it really sounds like nobody cares. Except for maybe Will Smith, because he's at least trying but.. compared to everyone else it just seems like they wanted their check so they didn't bother to put some emotion in their characters. Like when Aladdin talks it sounds like he couldn't care less, and it doesn't make me feel for him as a character.

Was only pleased with 2 scenes that somewhat kept with the original movie.

"The-Sarkologist","4","40","70","2 June 2019"," Just Not a Guy Ritchie Film
","I'll deal with the main part of this film first, and that is that if you are looking at seeing Guy Ritchie's take on the story of Aladdin, then this is definitely not the film you should be going to see - it is basically a live action version of the Disney film from 1992 with Will Smith as the Genie. What this film isn't is a Guy Ritchie film - there is absolutely nothing in this film that shows Ritchie's unique style in filmmaking, and simply goes to prove that if you are directing a Disney Film, then, well, you have absolutely no creative control over it whatsover.<br/><br/>This, as such, is why I was really disappointed with it. Look, I should have known that this was the case, and if I had paid a little more attention beyond the fact that it was a Guy Ritchie film, then I probably wouldn't have bothered going to see it. In fact, I wasn't planning on seeing it, and now that I have, I am fully convinced that there is no way that I will expect to see a director's flare when it comes to Disney films (though there was a bit of Edgar Wright in Antman, but he and Disney ended up parting company).<br/><br/>So, this film is basically a live action remake of the 1992 classic (not that I have actually seen it), and to be honestly, it is as painful and watching any of those typical Disney films. Jafar is, well, just a pain in the neck, and simply has no life whatsoever beyond being some power hungry guy that just irritates you all the way through. Jasmine is, well, she's a Disney princess, but the thing with Disney princesses is that they annoy me, which is why the whole idea of Klinger and Frankenfurter becoming Disney princesses with the Fox buyout is just so cool.<br/><br/>Look, I understand that it is a kid's film, and I guess in that way it works. However, it has been ages since I have seen a Disney animated piece - well not quite because there was Wreck it Ralph - but I generally try to avoid them like the plague. This movie has basically given me another reason to do so. In all honesty, I would have preferred Ritchie to actually go back to the original story and build it up from there - it would have been so much better - but then again, after the spectacular crash that was King Arthur, I guess he really had no choice."

It completely lacked originality and I got bored watching it and fast forwarded it to the end.<br/><br/>The only positive decisions they made was to actually use actors of eastern ethnicity and that was a highlight for their talents, and they gave the genie a better ending. The capuchin monkey was sweet as well.<br/><br/>Now the original story was far more exciting and adventurous; I remember reading it in an old old book when I was a child.

","I tried to like this movie but I couldn't. Disney Live Action remakes just aren't good. All the Live Action remakes are only made for money. They bank too heavily on nostalgia which I don't like. I feel that this movie should not have been made. I feel the same way about any Live Action remake that has been released or is coming out. Here are some positives. Most of the cast does a good job. Will Smith isn't trying to beat out Robin Williams as the Genie but still does a great job. The soundtrack is decent. It's still incredibly catchy but not as catchy as the original. The only song I feel that is better in this movie is Arabian Nights. All the other songs are good but not as outstanding as the original. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives. The pacing of this film is way off. It feels rushed at certain points and the end of the film starts to drag and it takes too long. It also doesn't help that this film is 38 minutes longer than the original. Marwan Kenzari is a decent actor but he didn't do a good job in this film. In my opinion, he didn't know what to do with the character. Jafar never felt like a major threat during the film which is a problem because he is the main villain. There were some changes that were made to the story but I felt they really didn't work for me. Jasmine's added character arc was a big meh for me. It felt a little out of place within the narrative. The new songs they added were meh for me. They aren't as memorable as the other songs in the film. The effects on the Genie are still as bad as they were in the trailer which was very distracting. The film is very brightly lit which makes it feel like a Disney Channel Original Film. There are also some slow motion scenes that come out of nowhere and make no sense at all. Overall, Aladdin may have a half decent score but fails to capture the magic of the original film. I give Aladdin a 2/10."

The colors were way too bright, the CGI was sad, and the acting was terrible. Jasmine and Aladdin made me cringe several times. Their romance performance was laughable. Jafar was the least terrifying villain of all the live action remakes. They had a couple of new songs and they were almost painful to listen too. They're singing was not Disney World worthy. Will Smith as the genie was okay, better than expected. The times that I laughed it was because of him.
I saw this with my six-year-old niece and afterwards she looked at me and said ""That was not a good movie."" That should tell you something. Overall I would not recommend seeing it."

"ReadingFilm","1","7","9","13 June 2019"," They should have hired Guy Ritchie to direct it.
","Live action Disney remakes are fascinating markers to compare the 90s to today. On the surface it's the same but digital. And the digital hindrance makes so many films fail out of the gate in believability, so here I saw 'digital' as shorthand for our actual complaint being insincerity and soullessness where even our myths are streamlined. Perfect since streamlining and mechanization is exactly what the film is about. For instance how Jasmine's feminism exposes our philosophical yearning for a post-identity world; this is not accusatory but anticipating. See how the film constantly rewrites Aladdin as an attack on identity structures. Jafar is the key. He is not a sly boomer chancellor but a disgruntled millennial and completely lost within his intellect, he is closer to a Silicon Valley tech CEO. His best friend is a parrot--hilarious they made it an actual animal, furthering his schizoid disconnect. He is the borg's worst soldier. He just needs the internet really badly. And like all millennials, he wants everything handed to him. Compare to Aladdin despite the lowest of low origins integrates seamlessly high and low which is the millennials true envy is authentic non-digital living--even in this virtual digital paradise where everyone is larping as scoundrels, princesses, and heroes, the failure to integrate manifests in Jafar as a woefully inept villain. A failure in his own story. ""We are the same,"" Jafar tells him. The most powerful shot in the film shows the sheer joy on his face when he summons Will Smith, as if he's lost to Aladdin in five hundred Dr Strange-style iterations of this story, and could only win by cheating, looking inside the code, and pinpointing exactly where Aladdin would walk inside flowing sheets. (How this parallels Aladdin's thieving is a difference in scale. We know Jafar uses hacks with his mindwashing staff. He only wins by using the genies own sort of tricks--same as how he loses.) Most fascinating is its study in identity textures. The genie makes Aladdin a Prince, but not really? (Who exactly is this army around him? Where do they go?) And then his manifestation of Jafar becoming a sultan is even odder, as he seems to have actually been given the title when Aladdin was not. The genie, ultimate only in deception, is a master in persuasive tricks. He is even puzzled by the process constantly remarking on 'gray areas'. The hack is more law of attraction style voodoo. (How frightening is that forecasting the machine age?) Then this notion the genie can accomplish magic switches of identity that are not static to begin with, which is the entire story of the 21st century as compared to the 90s which was a genuine heroes journey, makes this about the Aladdin--Jafar dichotomy as disposable identity. The one has nothing and rises. The other has painstakingly risen. Both win, as the world will greet you with every choice, today's 'fate is in your hands, speak up, the i-self' keeps bringing home we are all powerful. The fact genie doesn't actually do a thing for either Aladdin or Jafar is the other clue. Often it's just authority imparting others to take his word for it. The shackles are in their heads. Then the scrambled morality of accusing Aladdin of being a liar. Really? He is painfully authentic. Not only does he not want wishes, he doesn't get any. He used a loophole to cheat out of the cave (humanity exploited the hack). He was never made Prince at all but given Prince-like clothes (the machine exploited the hack--remember that is its only function there are no actual wishes). He was forced to be saved (the machine exposes itself as a co-dependent reflection). Then I think the third wish is in the tradition of the other wishes, and that is that Genie was never enslaved to begin with. Rather this area where the streamlining mechanization meets its form is an illusion. Aladdin's final con, as it's about an urchin playing his way through life beating both the humans and the machines with his street wisdom; also clues in why Jafar does not get sucked into the lamp until he 'realizes' he's been duped. Moreover, the characters are constantly trapped by language itself, not by any rules in this fantastical reality. The film is saying none of their limitations were real to begin, not Jasmin, not Aladdin, nor Jafar, not the Genie. It's saying this fraudulence governs the modern power structure, but more, can be manipulated to any and every end. There is nothing more 21st century than the disposable nature of our governing reality. It is also why the Sultan bizarrely hands Jasmine the title of Sultan of Agrabah. Did she get ahold of the lamp herself? Rather Aladdin and Jafar had their turns, now it's Jasmine's next; which is actually practical. We are woeful to the machine and the upcoming streamlining where every castle would integrate will end in disaster if in the hands of the power, so the only hope is her empathy and pureness to combat the mechanization. Purity cannot be hacked. Bringing this back to the films function entirely opposite to its treatise on falsities: when the story is good, has heart and purpose it will never be fake no matter how fake it looks. It's also why the genie is fleeing."

Thankfully her career will not be derailed by this iceberg. Will Smith comical stylings were no match to Robin Williams goofiness and he was a total miscast. As for Mena Massoud as Aladdin, he may have looked the part, but acting was wooden and he looked over eager to please throughout.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie as director was the biggest mistake as expected.

3. They basically made the movie into a musical. Jasmine never had any singing.

My other criticisms is this movie lacked diversity and wasn't politically correct enough.

","Box office results dictate that we will be stuck with Disney's remorseless plundering of its own back-catalogue for a while to come now, and while remakes can sometimes eclipse their original counterparts, the House of Mouse's efforts so far have fallen way short of the mark. And now this!<br/><br/>On paper this could sound passable, if you were to read only the most basic of post-it-fitting summaries. The story has potential, and there are a million ways to do it right, but remember, that's not what this is about. Oh no. The constraints are suffocating: you need to adhere as closely as possible to the animated inspiration, maintain the song and music format, hit as wide a demographic as possible, yet also pad tings out to match modern blockbuster runtime expectations. Okay then...<br/><br/>Since the source's appeal flowed largely from a central performance, it logically followed that Disney would want to re-create that as best it could... BUT they needed someone with real-life charisma, box-office appeal, minimal singing and dancing qualifications and character. Since the inimitable Robin Williams was a bit resentful of how Disney overstepped their rights on Aladdin and is also very dead, they went with obvious replacement... Will Smith?<br/><br/>I care nothing for Smith's beliefs or horrendous nepotism. The guy has incredible charm, and yes, he can act. But his energy is very different from Williams. It is laid back and ironic, not manic and over-the-top. Instead of adapting proceedings to his own type of charisma and humor, the filmmakers shoehorn him into a gaping Williams-shaped hole, and try as you might, you can never forget the extent to which the role was meant for - and in great part co-designed by - someone so different. The quality of Smith's blue CGI makeup is an abomination but it is kept to a minimum, and sadly, is not what truly sinks the film. It's the constant reminder of how wrong Smith is for the part as maintained by Disney, and watching him rap over Friend Like Me will make you feel sorry for the guy.<br/><br/>Speaking of casting, the demands of finding minority actors who can appeal to mainstream American audiences AND carry a blockbuster AND sing clearly proved to much for the studio (never a problem for an animated film where you can easily cheat your way past such constraints), and it's a shame, because in the moments between doing covers of famous songs and reciting inane dialogue, Mena Massoud is rather wonderful. Other choices mostly miss the mark, with Naomi Scott being completely flavorless and burdened with a useless subplot and Marwan Kenzari giving us a ridiculously young and neutered Jafar.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have commented on the cheap-looking visuals, and it often felt like characters were walking through the Magic Kingdom. Director Guy Ritchie brings absolutely no personality to the proceedings, and anyone involved in ""adapting"" the script for this ought to be ashamed of themselves.<br/><br/>No amount of nostalgia can save this train-wreck, and watching it I either felt embarrassed for the participants or yearning for the original. The only hope it raised was that of the perverse enjoyment some of us might soon experience at watching Disney completely butcher Lady and the Tramp.<br/><br/>Please, find another - ANY OTHER - use for your time and money!"

As for the rest of the major characters? Well...<br/><br/>Jaafar was a bit of a let down from the beginning. Not menacing enough on the outside. Yet still cunning in some ways. Can't say much about his parrot... Jasmine's dad was disappointingly boring (prefer the bubbly albeit blur cartoony-version). Jasmine herself was alright (neither great nor terrible). The ""feminist"" like scenes were like an unecessary extra and a bit annoying to watch (don't ask me why). Abu (monkey) was cute. He was captured nicely. And lastly Aladdin? For a break through actor, he actually did a good job portraying Aladdin. EXCEPT his relationship with Jasmine...<br/><br/>..And THAT'S where the ""magic"" is missing. The core lovey-dovey magic thats hard to explain except through emotions. I feel it's one of the major things that makes Disney's Aladdin.. ""ALADDIN""! But I felt nothing from the ""Whole New World"" scene. No chemistry between the two ""lovers"". Even in other scenes...
This is similarly felt between Aladdin & Genie. Particularly towards the end. The lack of that ""core"" emotion is so disappointing that I couldn't enjoy the movie as a whole. It just felt more on how it looked rather how it SHOULD feel. I mean this is Aladdin! Where's the magic?"

"denizgleiss","4","23","38","13 June 2019"," Why, Guy Ritchie?
","I did not ever see the old Aladdin, to clear the table first. But i did see almast all of Ritchie's films. This one is very similar to his last flick ""King Arthur-Legend of the Sword"", just in a Disney-version. We have the guy from the streets, who has to overcome the royalty that is oppressing the people and can ultimately do so by having an outsidal object (lamp/sword), while going through several scenes inside the royal habitat, that in both movies look very much alike. I had some moments where i almost thought i was watching King Arthur, e.g. the jam scene or others that where located in the hall where the throne is. Also do we have the theme ""serpents"", that is distinct in both movies (Fountain in the cavern that Jude Law is visitig/Jaffar's scepter, the spring in the final scene, where also a cgi-fight with a smouldering person (the guy with the horns/Jaffar as he is elongated) takes place, like so in King Arthur only shorter, but visually much alike.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the distinct trademarks of Ritchie have almost completly vanished, only in very rare occasions a connaiseur can tell a ritchie handwriting (e.g. slow down at the Aladdin-falling-into-the-water-scene). So the Disney-buying-the-remaining-(relative)mainstream-directors that produced somewhat different movies with their own style from the market continues (also: Tim Burton and many more that are not that known), so that also the cultural oatmeal is to be continued. I can only imagine up some reasons for Ritchie having done this:
-Flopped King Arthur, needed a money-ritch job and prestige
-Done this for his kids or wife
-Travel to Jordan, can play chess there<br/><br/>The costumes are colorful and therefore beautiful, although a bit repetetive (e.g. Jasmine, same tailoring but with other colors, Will Smiths blue dress, but the blue is that mesmerizing that it can carry it), the design of the city is also beautiful but difficult to be really seen through the cgi-mist. I have the feeling that the cgi was even better 10 years ago, for example in the third Raimi-Spiderman, which is from 2006(?). Nowadays everything cgi is equipped with, like said, a mist that prevents one from seeing anything really and not just look at it. And even the real on-set scenes, like in the desert are made to bee looking like it is cgi. ,,The best cgi is one that one can not see as such"", they maybe subsequently make that what is filmed real also in this look so that the spectator can't tell anymore what is cgi and what not and gets used to this rubbish-look (Same goes for the majority of Disney triple-A Blockbusters).<br/><br/>The opening is apart from the ridiculous boat scene, that is later on continued, promisingly and realtively good, we have an long one-cut opening shot while the only good song of the movie is played, all the others are really pop-ish, and production names are showed. From then on it is okay, we have a cave-scene that looks as cgi-ish as the one in Perter Jackson's Hobbit, the following peak is the desert scene with the first appearance of Will Smith after a felt half hour. It is really funny, if you're trying not to, you can't help yourself but alt least be smirking. The entry into the city is really pompous and you get the feeling that this is where all the money went. After that, it is practically over and out with Will Smith and he is slowly fading out of the movie, although of course he has some following scenes but he isn't really notable caracterwise. It ends with an, like said, King Arthurish finale where you ask yourself several times if this is now the finale or not, because in the past time, the sceenplay has not been leading up to a certain goal, but rather sailed without a real destination, and you get, in the midst of the headache-causing songs, the cgi-greenscreen-uncanny-world, with, as it is already indicated in the cave-song-scene, marionettesque actors in it, the feeling of lostness.<br/><br/>I do find the cgi looks today really horrible and I am totally against it! Has everybody already been brainwashed by this so noone starts a turmoil?"

With that being said, the writing was mediocre, and the direction was lacking (for lack of a better word).

","We had so many live-action Disney movies recently like Alice in Wonderland (2010), Cinderella (2015), Maleficent (2014), The Jungle Book (2016) and recently was Dumbo (2019). There's an upcoming Disney live-action movie as well and that would be The Lion King (2019). Most live-action Disney movies can never get better than the animated one and Aladdin's one of them.<br/><br/>First, the acting is kinda weak and bland. We had Mena Massoud as Aladdin. I know he tried really hard to be like Aladdin in the 1992 animated version. There's also Will Smith as the Genie which was criticized online to be too blue but I didn't think like that. In my opinion, he was pretty okay and funny as well, even though he couldn't smash the role like Robin Williams. However, Naomi Scott stole the show as Princess Jasmine. She smashed it for a bit and I was kinda impressed as I said the performances were weak. Though the WORST in here was Jafar played by Marwan Kenzari. His voice was young and friendly, he wasn't that evil but to be quite idotic and crazy and I had no favour for his roles.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie was really entertaining with awesome magical special effects, Will Smith's humor and more but each of those had problems as well as the musical. They didn't lack any, but they made the musical more boring, more forgettable and less exciting. The music got lower and the creators got lazier and lazier. They also made the final battle worse. It didn't take long and it was totally bright. Brightness here and there. Comparing to the animated version, it was totally dark and that's how the final battle should be. Instead in this live-action, it didn't take that long and people in Agrabah were like ""look at my tricks here, see what I can do!"". They didn't even pay attention that Jafar's the ruler, not the Sultan. When Jafar turned into a Genie, he looked like a moron more than a powerful being. His face and hair, it was horrible.<br/><br/>They also had new stuffs added to the movie. They were weird and annoying, also new characters as well like Dalia played by Nasim Pedrad. I didn't see that character in animated Aladdin. She was okay to be added to make the movie funnier but the other new things are unnecessary. It made the movie boring and also took a bit long time and it was 128 minutes comparing to the 92 minutes of the animated Aladdin and it was almost perfect and almost the best Disney animated movie ever made.<br/><br/>Personally the movie was kinda disappointing and didn't live up to the hype. I could barely praise many parts of Aladdin. I bet Disney fans and other types of audiences would like it but Aladdin surely deserved to be mixed from me. It's just a bland live-action like others. This is definately not a whole new world!"
"MatthewCherrier","2","25","42","12 August 2019"," BORING! All of the magic is gone *pun intended*
","I'm literally writing this review as I'm watching Aladdin because I'm so bored I'd rather do this. Within the first 5 minutes I knew I was going to be disappointed, it's slow, lacks any energy & somehow is dull. Not a single line is delivered with any passion or emotion, it feels like the table read when the cast first meets. Aladdin has no charm at all, he's generic at best.
Jafar isn't intimidating at all, why is he so short? The costume overpowers the actor & seems to weigh him down. In the animated version Jafar was much taller than any of the other characters, he had a long, lanky & almost snake like appearance which made him a menacing character from the first moment he's seen. This version has zero draw as a villain, he blends in with the background actors & is very bland. His portrayal comes off like a stepdad who's trying to act like a parent but has no idea how to be an actual authority figure.
The marketplace scene when Aladdin ""sings"" one jump is basically a shot for shot remake but with very small but odd changes, the choreography is stiff & unexciting. In the animated version when we first see jasmine she comes off as strong & independent despite being a bit naive about how things really are. She surprises Aladdin with her courage & strength from the get go, but in the live action she comes off as weak & lost. The biggest example of this is when they jump across the rooftops to avoid the guards, in the cartoon she grabs the pole & jumps across all on her own to the surprise of Aladdin, but in the live action she has to be coached & assured by Aladdin she can actually make the jump & will be ok - why this pointless change?
They include cgi versions of Abu & Iago but strip away any resemblance of a personality or character. These two were fantastic comic relief characters in the cartoon & could have translated to live much better. You don't have to have an animal talk to give it a personality or humor, Disney should have just used real animals if that's how they wanted them to act.
The Genie is just as boring & uninspired as everything else in this movie. During friend like me he tries far too hard to be different than the original & ""make it his own"" but comes off with no emotion or anything unique in the performance. I turned the movie off after this song so maybe it gets better, but from what I saw they took everything that was special about the original & drained the life from it. It truly takes skill to turn the most colorful, over the top & magical Disney movie into a dull shell of a story. After seeing this I am now absolutely terrified of the mess Disney is going to make of my personal favorite movie the Little Mermaid, please for the love of god stop making these live action remakes Disney!!!! They are ruining everything that makes these stories & their characters special & beloved by all.<br/><br/>Ps - this doesn't have much to do with the story or acting why did Aladdin have so many clothes on? Cartoon version aside he's running, jumping & climbing around the literal dessert in the middle of the day. Also was he wearing fake hair of some sort? Something was off & it distracted me"

","What person doesn't know the story of a thief named Aladdin who comes across a lamp and unleashes a genie? Not only did the story become mainstream from the 1992 animated movie, but his story also relates with people who dream that they can make their wish come true in a heartbeat. Of course I've never heard of anyone finding a magic lamp and getting supernatural abilities to get their desires. It's part of the magic of thinking that you could get the treasure and power without having to work hard. Aladdin is the story that reveals that even with a cosmic being providing those gifts, life never really offers an easy answer.<br/><br/>Going back to the Disney animated movie, what made the movie were a lot of elements; beautiful animation, likable characters, a fun villain in Jafar, but probably the most important element, Robin Williams finally fully realized in comedic potential as the Genie. This has made arguably one of the funniest and unbound performances from a comedian who was already full of energy. In the recent trend of taking Disney classics like Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh, and The Jungle Book, and making them live-action, Aladdin now gets it's turn in that format.<br/><br/>Within the kingdom of Agrabah, a street rat thief Aladdin (played by Mena Massoud) and his monkey Abu ""eat to live and steel to eat"" within the poor village as they strive for something more. Princess Jasmine (played by Naomi Scott) also strives for more as she's treated more like an object as her father, the sultan wishes to marry her to a prince of another kingdom. Jasmine's only companions are her tiger, Rajah, and her handmaiden Dalia (played by Nasim Padrad). Aladdin meets Jasmine, but realizes when she's the princess, he realizes he can never be with her.<br/><br/>This changes when the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, Jafar (played by Marwan Kenzari), takes Aladdin out to the desert where the Cave of Wonders is. He's instructed to not touch the treasure and only go for the lamp. After the cave collapses, Aladdin rubs the lamp and releases the Genie (played by Will Smith) who tells him he gets three wishes. Knowing that he can finally be with Jasmine, Aladdin wishes to be a prince. While staying in the palace, Aladdin learns more about the Genie, how money can't buy love, and that Jafar is planning his takeover of Agrabah.<br/><br/>Director Guy Ritchie made the decision to stay as close as possible to the animated original...and that ends up being the main problem. While I can't say Aladdin is a ""shot-for-shot"" remake, it goes through the same story, same plot, same emotions, and same songs all over again, just within a live action realm. While I understand Disney knew that moments from Aladdin were so iconic they couldn't have been changed, they should have known that by constantly evoking the look of the original, I kept asking myself ""why am I not just watching the original?"".<br/><br/>So what is different? The biggest is one of the few positives, and that's Will Smith. He thankfully does not try to copy Robin Williams and instead plays the Genie like the Fresh Prince. This also makes him more of a guy whose had several masters and Aladdin is just next in line. I liked that Aladdin and Genie had do build a friendship instead on an instant one. The movie tries to expand Jasmine's role, that only ends up seeming forced and unnecessary. This is no better shown through her song ""Speechless"", which could be cut and nothing would be missed. The worst is the casting of Jafar, who has no grace and is so generic looking, that he looks like a random person from the grocery store they just put into a Jafar outfit.<br/><br/>Other then some nice costumes and sets, not much is really different. The moments from the animated movie play out the same here which can make it easy for you to guess what happens in the end. Aladdin fights palace guards, Jasmine wants more in life, Genie does his magic, and Jafar tries his big takeover. This is a movie that while made alright, it feels completely pointless. I can't say it's as bad as the shot-for shot remake Psycho or even as bad as the live action Beauty and the Beast or Maleficent, but all it did was make me think about the animated Aladdin and made me appreciate how much better it was then this.<br/><br/>I'll give this four Jafar cobras out of ten. I'm sure this will have it's fans, but whether a parent should take their kids, they can. It's just that it's so similar to the animated version that I would recommend wasting their money to see something they probably already own. For my three wishes, its to erase this, erase the majority of live action remakes, and to set you free to see something else."

","Aladdin is a nice stroll down memory lane for those who love the original, but solidly a remake for the ADHD neo-millennial generation. Editing is terrible. Pacing is off and too fast with very little discernible character development. Dialogue has its moments of genuine laughs and giggles, but most is unnatural for a supposedly ""realistic rendition"" of a movie. You shouldn't have to say what it is you're seeing or doing if you're doing it. Jafar definitely terribly miscast. Overall, I agree with reviews that say Jasmine stole the show. Pretty sure the whole theatre shed a tear during 'A Whole New World,' myself included, but that was the whole point: the movie wanted to play with the emotions of those who cherish the original. Kudos to Will Smith for trying out the Genie role. Goodness knows he tried his best, but he doesn't have Robin's kick or the ability to play with his vocal or emotional range, never mind improvisation. A magic-less remake that should have left the original to its legacy. Disney should apologize to the memory of Robin Williams. As one character in the movie said: ""Clumsy, but in a fun sort of way."" 4/10"
"Warneinator","4","26","44","26 May 2019"," Not a Diamond in the Rough; An Ordinary Lump of Coal
","To be honest, Aladdin could have been a lot worse than it actually is. But what we do have is a limp and lifeless remake that only makes me want to rewatch the brilliant animated film again. To give it some credit, though he was never going to compete with the irreplaceable Robin Williams, Will Smith does a decent job at putting his own spin on the Genie. Naomi Scott also makes for a great Princess Jasmine, and gets easily the best song of the whole film. Written by the Dear Evan Hansen, La La Land and The Greatest Showman songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, ""Speechless"" is a powerful ballad. But as a whole, Aladdin 2019 feels like a cheap $180 million TV movie, that is lacking a lot of the energy that the original had. Musical numbers like ""Prince Ali"" fall flat because they're missing the wondrous visuals that animation can provide, whilst Guy Ritchie, already a questionable fit for the material, seems to have had nearly all of his directorial voice scrubbed out. Not to mention, the changes that are made, particularly involving Jafar, don't really mean anything. But worst of all, the film is simply unengaging. Though it's not as misguided as Tim Burton's Dumbo, this is the most definitive proof thus far at how scarily competent, yet entirely pointless, Disney's live-action remakes are overall. Well, probably at least until The Lion King in July."

","As Guy Ritchie's ALADDIN arrived in theaters, there was a great hullabaloo raised by the so-called ""SJW's"" (social justice warriors) over whether the live-action remake would be sufficiently politically correct. With the movie set to be light-years more ""authentic"" than its predecessor, one would think they would have been grateful. But what they were promised seemingly wasn't enough for them.<br/><br/>But with what they ended up getting, they needn't have worried. ALADDIN is quite possibly the most ""woke"" Disney fairy tale you'll ever see.<br/><br/>To start with the obvious, the significance of the casting is impossible to miss. With the exception of Will Smith (who does get top billing, even though this is ultimately not his story), pretty much the entire cast is of Middle Eastern, North African, or South Asian extraction. The main characters do speak in American accents for the most part, but otherwise this is a show that is (with one ironic difference) thoroughly non-Western, and in some ways even anti-Western. There is only one character of European (or, given the mythological setting of Agrabah, pseudo-European) descent seen throughout the entire movie, and he is not only marginalized but made to appear a buffoon - and, to add insult to injury, he isn't even funny.<br/><br/>But the ""socially relevant"" changes do not end at the cosmetic level. There are the small things, such as the ""sensitized"" song lyrics (Agrabah is no longer ""barbaric,"" and Prince Ali no longer owns slaves), but the more fundamental alterations have been to the plot itself. Believe it or not, ALADDIN is now primarily a political thriller in which Agrabah's national security is at stake. The evil vizier Jafar is now not only greedy and power-hungry, but a visionary in foreign policy. And, as it turns out, the kingdom's most worthy head of state proves to be...Princess Jasmine.<br/><br/>Yes, that's right. In fact, as events play out, Jasmine becomes the sultan! Disney might as well have titled this version JASMINE and called it a day. Though it makes sense that Aladdin, who can claim no experience in statecraft (not having been a real prince, you know), would not have made a good sultan himself, the denial of the throne to the person who logically would be the (male) sultan's successor still seems vaguely like a humiliation. Certainly, it's Aladdin who brings Jafar's ultimate defeat, and Jasmine is indeed reduced to a damsel-in-distress courtesy of Jafar's black magic, but that's really only for the sake of form. The irony of this big change, of course, is that in simultaneously trying to make the story more sexually egalitarian AND more respectful to Arab culture (among other nods, they recognize Friday rather than Sunday as the Islamic holy day, correcting a blunder made by the 1992 animated version), Disney has done a disservice to the latter by rendering the tale more Western - which is, to say, progressive. Sometimes you just can't have it both ways.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I adored the movie's visuals, the delightful music, and Will Smith's brave attempt to match Robin Williams's cosmic level of charisma. But for all that, there was a chagrined spirit inside of me that wanted to yell: ""No, Jasmine, you do not get the throne! You're not a man! JAFAR deserves to be sultan more than you!""<br/><br/>Let's just say this movie will make you feel so ""woke,"" you will probably never sleep again. Jeez Louise. For all my hatred of Trump, this sociological debacle is almost enough to turn me conservative again."

A higher mm filmed movie would not show as much of the background, but rather the actors expression, just like the animated movie. THAT'S WHAT WE LIKED WITH THE ORIGINAL, the expressions and feelings between the characters.<br/><br/>I didn't feel like Aladdin or Jasmine had a love connection at all in this movie. People who know love knows this. You know the look you get from someone who loves you? Like a parent. best friend or a partner? That look, wasn't there in ANY of the x-frames of this movie. In the animated it was there every second.<br/><br/>I feel like Disney lost their touch to what made great films. People don't care if you spend 1000000 million dollars on CGI unless the feeling are there. It's funny cause I think you could make a better Aladdin with 10% of the cost of this movie if you actually knew what people like. That's why youtube and other platforms take over even this ""well produced"" material, people don't care about low budget when the feelings you touch are genuine and is something you can relate to."

","I walked into Aladdin knowing that nothing could top the original. That being said, I was hoping that it would be decent, and it really wasn't, and that made me sad because I'm a huge fan of Guy Ritchie films. I'm just gonna list all of the pros and cons of the film.<br/><br/>PROS: The cast and costuming was great, the Genie had a lot of enthusiasm in his performance, Aladdin and Jasmine had great voices, and I especially loved the darker side of Jafar.<br/><br/>CONS: Some of the musical numbers were very lackluster. The numbers such as ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Friend Like Me"", ""Prince Ali"", and ""A Whole New World"" were supposed to have a sense of energy and excitement, but I was bored throughout them all. I didn't like how they remixed ""A Whole New World"" to be this generic pop ballad. I also felt that the addition of the song ""Speechless"" was totally unnecessary. The Genie could've been better cast, but I like how he didn't try too hard to copy Robin Williams. I said before that I liked Jafar's darker nature, but he could've been even darker and more menacing had he been better cast. Some of the camera work was lame and there was nothing special about it. I also didn't sense any chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine. Also, I wish I could've seen more of Guy Ritchie's distinctive style of filmmaking instead of a generic blockbuster because I really like his films. I was also missing some of the elements from the original such as a smartmouth Iago, Jasmine being trapped in the hourglass, and shapeshifting Jafar just to cap it all off.<br/><br/>That all being said, I wish I could've enjoyed it more. I personally think that Guy Ritchie should stay away from the blockbuster genre (unless it's a Sherlock Holmes movie), and he should stick to independent films such as ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"". In conclusion, I didn't like Aladdin, and I wish I could've enjoyed it more."

"Amthermandes","4","37","66","1 June 2019"," Really disappointed Genie didn't call Aladdin a ""fresh prince""
","Aladdin is yet another cash grab; an exhaustive remake of a perfectly good animated Disney classic. An attempt to pander to both loyal Disney fans and potential new ones, Disney tries to bring Aladdin to life with CGI, a new look, and new faces. Of course, NOBODY could do Genie like the late and beloved Robin Williams, and it would be rather dull if Disney did a mirror remake of the original, so naturally doing things differently would be inevitable and sensible, and that's what they did, only they put little effort and creativity into it.<br/><br/>Jam packed with enough messages about morals and modern politics to make even Sean Penn feel awkward, this preachy remake is mostly pomp and circumstance, having the costume design, some of the CGI, and a few of the jokes, really the only good points about the movie. The rest is mostly corny moments (""you can do it!""), confusing plot elements, extremely lame original music pieces, and otherwise lame attempts to be original while keeping the classic story intact. While Will Smith did a better job in the role of The Genie, one cannot shake the feeling that there were others out there who would have done much better. And of course, the writers are also partly to blame. But Smith did certainly shone brighter than the rest of the cast, who apparently were told to act like they're in a high school play.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to completely condemn the movie, as it's obvious why many people would enjoy it. It might be right up their alley with their style of comedy, and I may be a tad biased because so far none of the live-action remakes of the childhood quintessential Disney flicks lives up to their standards. And yes, they WILL be compared to the classics, so don't act like they're supposed to ""stand on their own"" and such.<br/><br/>All in all, it's yet another disappointment from Disney, who has the talent to do better, but they would rather try to appease as may people in a generic, paper-cutter, almost ""bureaucratic"" sort of way. The Lion King is our last hope...."

The story wasn't told in a gripping way, it was just moments tied in together with mediocre dialogues and mostly ok-ish song (however one or two were actually good) and Not to undermine the efforts of the lead actors they were actually trying their best and I could see potential in their performances but I believe Guy Ritchie failed to bring the best out of them. Speaking of which Jaffar was such a disappointment. Will Smith's Genie at first I wasn't on board with, he looked like he was trying too much but towards the end of the movie you kinda get used to it and even he starts to loosen it up and overall was nice I'd say not bad but not too great as well.

And contemporary I guess? It was all for fun I know. But its Agraba based in Arabia and Arabian traditions I thought. Which brings me to my next point. The cringy women empowerment thing they were pushing with jasmine was very cringy worth. And I'm all for women empowerment, as a women. She had these random song moments. Which to some maybe empowering but it just came off as random and culturly incorrect. But whatever it's a movie with a flying carpet and a genie.

"Rob_Lee_W","Null","8","11","21 August 2019"," Aladdin 2019: The Most Expensive High School Play of All Time
","1992's Aladdin is one of the best movies in Disney's extensive catalog. Beautiful visuals, great music, stellar comedy, and Iago the parrot. It's left a major impact on the Disney movie formula with touches of its comedic style felt in subsequent Disney films like The Lion King, Emperor's New Groove, Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Big Hero 6 (even if that's not always a positive trait). At the time of its release, it was hot off the heels of Beauty and the Beast and at the height of the Disney Renaissance. It was wildly successful in theaters and years afterward through syndication, making it one of the most beloved of Disney's films. Most, if not all, the hype surrounding the movie then and now was focused on one thing in particular.<br/><br/>The golden ticket that Aladdin owes most of its lasting success to (besides maybe the music) is the late actor/comedian Robin Williams and his portrayal of the Genie. His quick-talking, pop culture referencing, and shapeshifting antics completely override the movie's tone the moment he's introduced. He's the main template from which most other animated comic relief characters are derived. The folks over at Disney knew they had gold on their hands even at the time as Genie was the focus of most of the marketing for the movie.. Even though Robin has had dozens of memorable roles over his career up to his death, none rival the popularity and belovedness of the Genie.<br/><br/>So imagine the internet's reaction when Disney releases a trailer of their live action Aladdin remake where the Genie looks like a SnapChat filter. Understand that I'm not gonna bash the live-action Aladdin for things like ""the Genie/music/blablablah is too different to the original."" Being different isn't the problem with this movie, quite the opposite. The problem is being derivative and pointless.<br/><br/>The most talked about aspect of the movie is the performances and we're already off to a weak start. As two positives, Naomi Scott as Jasmine was good and Will Smith as the Genie was alright. There's not much to say of Naomi other than she did a really good job portraying Jasmine. It helped that the dialogue for her wasn't god awful, but I still think her acting skills went into Jasmine being the only part of this movie I really liked. The Genie is a bit more interesting. Most of the returning characters from the original are more or less the same in terms of their core archetype. The Genie was wildly changed due to the fact that Will Smith could never hope to recreate Robin Williams's performance. So instead, the Genie is a snarky sass-machine. His comedy isn't focused on fast-talking impersonations and shape shifting but more so poking fun at Aladdin and the situations they find themselves in. In the scene after the ""Prince Ali"" song, Aladdin is miserably failing at impressing the Sultan and his court. He goes on a tangent about jams and Genie quietly tells Aladdin to knock it off with the jam and says how uncomfortable he was after the fact. I'd recommend you look up the scene yourself to help gauge whether or not Genie's comedy is for you. The only other changes are that the Sultan went from a bumbling buffoon to a generic serious guy and that Jafar has an impoverished background as a thief (which isn't really explored).<br/><br/>Speaking of which, everybody else in this movie is either forgettable (like the Sultan of Aladdin himself) or outright laughably bad. One of those laughable characters is a new one, Jasmine's handmaiden Dalia. Some of her moments had me laughing in the theater at how unfunny or awkward they were. However, I would be willing to put most of that on the fact that Dalia's actress, Nasim Pedrad, was given nothing to work with. She has the least to do or say out of any ""important"" character in this movie so I can't say the actress is fully to blame. But Dalia pales in comparison to the real so-bad-it's-good character, Jafar. Not only does he have way less character in terms of his dialogue, his actor seems to refuse to emote or give any flair to his material. He also has a tendency to really over exaggerate his mouth when speaking, kinda like those videos where the Team Fortress 2 trailer models are given 400% facial animations. Jafar's actor, Marwan Kenzari, is Dutch so he might just have to do that because English isn't his native language. I'm not trying to make fun of him, I'm just pointing out the one bit of personality in a performance where there otherwise would be none.<br/><br/>Much like the acting, both the music and the visuals are a mixed bag. Let's do visuals first. Most of the animals looked fine, nothing special, they'll look dated in the next three years. Genie looked bad in the beginning but got better as time went on. Most of the CG environmental stuff during songs like ""A Whole New World"" and 'Friend Like Me"" were well done. But, my god, when Jafar turns into a genie at the end, it's so bad it's hilarious.Most of the practical stuff ranges from okay to bad, too. The costumes were really good. The sets were hit or miss. A lot of the extras felt stiff at the most unnatural points. During the Prince Ali and party scenes, the crowd feel like high school play extras that don't want to be there. Another thing that bothers me is how clean everyone looks all the time. Despite being in the desert, none of them ever have any sand or dirt on them and that doesn't sit right with me. Shot composition is also pretty flat, with little style or personality. The only time you get anything is when the film goes into slow motion for no real reason but to raise the tension maybe? Either way, not much to talk about.<br/><br/>Music is the only semi-consistent aspect of the film. Almost all of the music is on par with the original, even the new song they added in. The exceptions are Genie's two songs, ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali."" The instrumentals are well done and professional, but Will Smith can't sing. Neither could Robin, but he made up for that with the personality and goofiness with which he sang the lyrics. Will Smith sings flatly and they just gave him Auto-Tune in post.<br/><br/>With the poor acting, stiff extras, flat cinematography, and the artificially clean look of the people and costumes, this movie gave me the vibe of a high school stage play with some subpar CGI and put on film. For a film made by the most powerful entertainment company in the world, the film feels ameteur in almost all aspects besides the music. This speaks to a general problem with Disney remakes as of late. They try to recapture the magic of a film when that's impossible and goes against what remakes should be for. The nitty gritty of the subject is beyond the scope of a review of a cash grab, but think of it in this simplified way: Remakes are good when they rework bad or dated movies or take concepts of good movies and go into a new direction with them. The Aladdin remake doesn't fit into either one of these categories and it shows. If the cinematography were great, the dialogue and actors were less awkward, the CGI was less creepy in places, and Will Smith could sing, maybe I wouldn't mind them treading old ground as much (though I'd still dislike it). However, if all those things were quality, it wouldn't really be your average Disney live-action remake, now would it?"

Pros
+ The setting really brings you back to Agrobah. Even if some spots look spotty design-wise, you do feel like you are transported back in time. It's undeniable that without it, the rather simplistic story would've dragged. (Which, admittedly, holds true for the original)
+ The songs from the original are still as good as they were all those years ago. some spots and additions make a few dragged down, but for the most part they still retain their energy and bounciness.
+ Jafar, while a far cry from the original, was surprisingly remade. This is not the deliciously evil snake from the original, yes, but somehow you can feel it. This Jafar is thief turned vizier, essentially corrupt by ambition. it's practically venomous.<br/><br/>Cons
<ul><li>The movie has an issue with what to leave in and what to leave out. Being a crushing 2 hours and 8 minutes, as opposed to the original's hour-and-a-half. It may not seem like a lot, but it's how the time is used, not adding to the story, but rather just adding filler in the form of extra characters and songs. 'Why was one scene lost so another lesser new could be added?' It makes one think what could've been to bring the movie above.</li><li>The genie, sadly, disappoints. Not to say he wasn't funny or energetic, because in many points who actually promises a lot. Even if he wasn't Robin Williams, which is a hard role to fill, there was promise....for the first half. After that, its heavily toned down save for a few scant flicks of magic, just to remind you 'oh yes, this is the genie, remember?' It almost makes sad sense as a comparison to the movie itself.</li><li>The new songs, specifically Speechless, leaves a lot to be desired. It's more of a mini-point relating to 'what must go, what must be added', and these songs clearly feel just patched in just to lengthen scenes that don't need to be. It'd be like remaking Toy Story, and giving Sid a villain song about how he's going to burn the toys for four minutes, when he could use four seconds to give you what you need. It's pace-breaking.</li><li>Why wasn't that ending crazier? One thing Aladdin is known for, along with the Genie, obviously, was how Sorcerer Jafar really goes all out with his magic. the palace really corrupts, the princess is trapped in that hourglass, there's fire breathing and the guy turns into a massive snake(which was actually one of my brother's favorite parts in the original), all culminating with him becoming an all-powerful genie. All of this is sadly gone in the remake. The worst of Jafar's magic does is force-choke the Sultan, and maybe turn Iago into a large Roc. When you have the money that Disney has, you have money to burn, so don't bring up ""it wouldn't work because the budget."" The whole ""Friend Like Me"" scene from early on was a spectacle, so why not make this a grand finale? It would've went off with a bang, rather then a fizzle.</li></ul><br/><br/>Final Thoughts: This movie is no Diamond in the Rough...its more like a Geode. It's got rough portions within and without, but you see sparkling crystals that promise magic. But, as Aladdin says, ""Would you see that if you looked closer?"" Sadly, while it was dazzling all around...it had little of worth all things considered."

The best acting in the whole film was courtesy of the magic carpet which happened to also be completely CGI, and had no speaking lines.<br/><br/>The casting itself just seemed completely wrong. Will smith could have been a good genie, if he was allowed to be himself. Instead the writing and directing seemed to dictate that he attempt to replicate robin williams. Aladdin and jasmine were ok as far as looks go, but again the acting was so abysmal that any casting points earned were omitted.

Aladdin somehow gets everything so wrong.<br/><br/>Bad casting, horrible CGI and poor decisions from director Guy Ritchie all around. I honestly don't think the could have casted worst people for the roles of Aladdin, Mad at and Genie. Naomi Scott on the other hand carries this entire film! Her portrayal as Jasmine breathes life into this hollow remake. The new original song will blow you away. Her voice nails the songs we all know and love. Will Smith seems lazy and uneager to fill the shoes of Robin Williams. While Friend Like Me was somewhat enjoyable Prince Ali couldn't be more dull. How Disney butchered this fun and iconic song I'll never know. Could have hired ANYONE else and use the money you saved not bringing on Will Smith and invest in into the CGI. The CGI is the worst you'll see in theaters in this modern age. Disney shouldnt have skimped out on that front, especially for a remake of one of their most popular movies ever. Mena Massoud was a horrendous Aladdin. This loveable and optimistic character is so lifeless. His personality was as closed off as his nips.<br/><br/>How did they get all this so wrong? Please don't waste your money on this even if you're curious to see how this turned out. There's a dozen better movies in theaters right now, even a few better options to give Disney your money still."

"AdrenalinDragon","4","318","684","22 May 2019"," A-Lame-In nostalgic cashgrab
","The original Aladdin is still one of my all-time favourite Disney movies. Everything about it is so much fun to watch. The animation, the music, the comedy, the story, the atmosphere. After seeing the Live-Action Disney remake, I have to say it was mostly lame in comparison. The atmosphere in this one felt like a TV movie for large chunks of it and despite the colours, everything still looked bland and cheap. Aladdin and Jasmine have no chemistry together in this and their acting is pretty bad, and Jafar is now very bland and just a stock villain badguy with very little personality or wit to him. The only character that is passable surprisingly is the Genie, where Will Smith faired better than I initially expected. The closest I got to laughing or finding myself entertained in the movie was whenever he was on screen. I can definitely confidently say Will Smith was the best thing going for the Aladdin remake.<br/><br/>For the most part, Aladdin is basically the same as the original. There are a few little changes here and there and some plot filler stuff that doesn't really go anywhere. If you've seen Beauty and the Beast it's similar to that. The classic songs are not performed nearly as well, and the new ones are pretty forgettable. The CGI can range from fine to laughable, and it's not really done in any memorable way. The score is decent but that's because it relies mostly on the original. The movie is not really shot in any special way, it just feels conventional and nothing about it screams like it's a Guy Ritchie film at all. Just another passable/mediocre Live Action Disney remake movie at best. Why did it need to be 2 hours long I have no idea, but the movie was weak and Will Smith is really the only thing going for it, despite Robin Williams still being far superior in the original. Overall, another ""Bleh"" Live-Action Disney remake we didn't need at all. Stick with the original Aladdin that has superior effects, acting, jokes, atmosphere, characters, and depth over this nostalgic cashgrab.<br/><br/>4/10"

Mena Massoud tries, but is just not quite right for the role of Aladdin. Perhaps he was trying too hard.
Will Smith, while charismatic as always, just does not hold a candle to Robin Williams.
Marwan Kenzari, without being rude, is embarrassing as Jafar.
Naomi Scott, while putting the best performance out of the lot, made the whole world-wide search for a Middle-Eastern Jasmine redundant. This I don't care too much about, but if the marketing for your film has an angle of authentic casting, perhaps don't cast a Disney alumni who is British as Princess Jasmine?<br/><br/>The music was wonderful and made me recall being a child again singing along to the original film. I would suggest listening to the soundtrack as there are some songs here that weren't in the original too.
The CGI was a mixed bag. Iago, Abu, and Rajah looked fantastic (although don't expect Iago's loud mouth and wit in this one). Everything about this film screams cash grab, banking on our collective nostalgia. It seems as though Disney is too lazy to come up with something original, and I can only pray they don't destroy my all time favorite Disney film next: The Lion King."

","It was terrible... I actually had some hope for this movie based on some of the TV spots, but upon watching it, what little expectations I had were destroyed.<br/><br/>Lets start out with the positives...<br/><br/>Will Smith was decent as the Genie. He wasn't bad, he wasn't great, he was decent. He brought his own energy to the role, and although he wasn't as funny as Williams, he did get 1 or 2 chuckles out of me.<br/><br/>The plotline about Jasmine wanting to be sultan was decent, though I do wish they developed that plotline beyond I don't like that people are hungry and i've read books<br/><br/>Will Smith's version of Arabian Nights was a decent change and was lyrically interesting, though the autotune was noticeable in parts.<br/><br/>That's about it. Oooh boy, where do we start with the flaws.<br/><br/>Lets start with Aladdin... I was not impressed at all with the titular character and his story arc.<br/><br/>I wish Mena Massoud the best and I hope this role gives more opportunities to him, but my God he was flat at times. Scott Weigner put WAY more emotion into his voice acting in pivotal scenes. He isn't terrible, especially when he is acting scared, but there was often something off about Massoud's delivery.<br/><br/>I also felt that his character development was a little rushed towards the beginning. And what was with that ""I'm a proud, vain prince now"" subplot that was brought up and waved away with almost no proper resolution?<br/><br/>Now lets talk about Jasmine... I thought she and Aladdin had almost no chemistry. In the original Jasmine is saved from being horribly mutilated, immediately establishing some huge trust and respect between the two... in this version it boils down to a quick, non suspenseful argument with a merchant. In the original when Aladdin takes Jasmine back to his home, he is quickly impressed with Jasmine's intelligence, and they share some cute banter. In this version he takes her home, she giggles at one of his jokes, and that's about it... for goodness sake, Genie and Aladdin's friend had more chemistry than Aladdin and Jasmine.<br/><br/>The original blows this movie out of the water when it comes to visual appeal. I'm not expecting everything to translate, but there were multiple scenes they could have tried harder. The cave of wonders wasn't beautiful at all IMO. The A Whole New World sequence could have thrown in some clouds, or something more exciting than a dark landscape. As you can imagine from the brief teaser they gave us, Prince Ali was very cheap looking, especially those comically tiny golden camels.<br/><br/>The Prince Ali sequence also brings up another problem... the autotuning. Will Smith was painfully autotuned in that sequence, and the auto tune is REALLY noticeable whenever Massoud sings. Why don't they hire real singers that sound similar to the actors rather than insisting performances out of actors who can't sing? Half the original songs in this movie were ruined.<br/><br/>Lets end with Jafar. He was not intimidating in the slightest. He displays signifcantly more emotion in the original, for ex. when he finally gets the lamp he has been searching ruthlessly for, he is ecstatic... in this version he just kind of smiles.<br/><br/>And can someone please explain to me how Jafar and Iago deduced Aladdin was the diamond in the rough? In the original they discovered him through magic, from what I saw in this Iago just kind of sees him and decides he's the one...<br/><br/>If I can borrow the words of Lindsay Ellis: Thanks, I Hate It! After this and Dumbo I have no excitement for The Lion King, Mulan, or any of the Live-Action remakes slated for release."
"Martinito_08183","2","6","8","30 August 2019"," The biggest waste of time of 2019.
","Do i need to go in full detail on why the movie is bad? It looks like i really have to express my feeling towards this. It's very obvious that it was a bad idea from the start. They spend 183 million dollars to make a movie that doesn't have a reason to exist and at the same time it looks very fake, since it relies so much on visual effects.<br/><br/>Aladdin (2019) proofs why those type of stories that Disney has told already work so well in animated form and how they can't recapture the magic of the old animated classics. It's also disrespectful not only to the original, but also to Robin Williams, who gave the best performance in his entire career and a very unique interpretation of Genie. Will Smith doesn't work at all and he is very miscast in it. They retold the same story that everybody is familiar, but in live-action and worse than ever; did some changes that are horrible (Jafar and Iago are the best examples); they stretch out the story for no apparent reason, just to be longer - like the other Disney remakes and the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>I'll admit one thing that Disney will never change at all: they were never good at making live-action movies with the only exception of Pirates of the Caribbean (if you don't count the forth and the fifth movie), but everything else is not good at all and all of them are very dull. It's a big waste of time and money and it's a movie that i'll never going to revisit ever again.<br/><br/>So do yourself a favour and watch the original instead, since it's beautiful; timeless; charming and the story was way better told, while the live-action remake will become dated very quickly, because of the effects. It relies solely on making money at the box office and manipulates you by using your childhood memories (or should i say nostalgia) to get your money."

I grew up watching Aladdin and I expected nothing less than this, although I believe that the most anticipated character of the movie could have been introduced 20 minutes earlier in the film and so, I advise you all to have a little patience till the 40th minute and then have your mind blown away by the never ending exciting journey.
As expected the character of Jasmine was nothing less than fabulous and Aladdin was as convincing as it could be as street rat (my bad, I know he hates this title). Loved the monkey and the PARROT. Oh man! It was as abhorring as it's master Jaffar, even worse than him. Gosh! I have started hating parrots.<br/><br/>The last twenty minutes will make up for a little slow beginning of the film (of course I understand, a bit of time is definitely needed for introducing the characters of the famous ""Arabian Nights"" - I totally get it......PAUSE........NOT).<br/><br/>Worth every second and penny invested to witness this cinematic marvel!"
"TheMovieDiorama","4","122","261","25 May 2019"," Aladdin rubs its live-action lamp and produces a mere dusting of musical magic.
","Disney's onslaught of extravagant remakes of their classic animations has certainly had its ups and downs. Think of it as a nauseating magic carpet ride, powered solely on money, that is showing no signs of stopping. 'Beauty and the Beast' was a success, and with that the Renaissance era of animations was bound to get the live-action treatment. So here we are with one of my favourites, Aladdin. And despite the intrinsic split in opinions from both critics and audiences, I can happily confirm my original suspicions that this is one heck of a soulless, pointless and boring production. A ""street rat"" falls in love with a princess who is unable to marry anyone but a prince, and so he encounters a genie to which he decides to try and win her love.<br/><br/>Of course, the sinister Jafar is present in an attempt to rule the kingdom, yet Ritchie's musical monstrosity is predominately focused on Jasmine and Aladdin's forbidden love. Engrossing performances from both Massoud and Scott are probably the film's only selling points. The initial look of cosplayers quickly transformed into real characters based solely on their exquisite chemistry. They both looked the part, acted the part and essentially lived the part. Just a shame that nothing else in this desolate production was breathing any life.<br/><br/>Now I know what you're thinking. Why didn't I turn my brain off and try to enjoy the fantastical adventure that Ritchie translated. Well, I did just that. I tried. But when Jafar comes on screen in his silky smooth attire, stiff as a wooden pole, and gently commands ""bring me the lamp"", that is an immediate sign that I wanted to jump off this magic carpet ride. Abhorrently forgettable and the complete opposite to his antagonistic roots, and seemingly felt like an afterthought once the romance was established within the first five minutes. A script that felt drier than the Arabian sands, with most of the dialogue being heavy-handed exposition outlining each character's relationships, feelings and positions within their first spoken line.<br/><br/>Occasionally the comedy crept in, mostly in the second act when Aladdin becomes Prince Ali from Ababwa and is incompetent at flirting (enough about those damn jams!), however it's nowhere near as hilarious as the original. And yes, whether you agree or not, I will be comparing this to the original. As a direct remake, with the story rarely being altered, it's an absolute fair method for analysis. Oh, and it just highlights the ridiculous amount of uninspired money grabbing producers that work for the ""House of Mouse"". I'm bluntly saying this because Aladdin marks the rapid downfall of the quality that these remakes uphold.<br/><br/>Not even Will ""Get Jiggy Wit Da Genie"" Smith had enough material to save the film, despite comparing favourably to Williams' unanimously perfect voiced performance. His charm manages to shine like a ""diamond in the rough"" on occasion, but even with the mediocre CGI role, he just wasn't animated enough. Literally! Sure, he performs his own songs and adds that little ""Fresh Prince"" flavour, yet it strangely irritated me. The random ""woahs"" and ""eyyys"" after every sentence (classic Will Smith ""rapping"") took away from the romanticism and flamboyancy of the lyrics.<br/><br/>The noticeable autotune to Scott and Massoud's singing, especially for ""A Whole New World"", pretty much destroyed all emotion that the song should've exhumed. Newcomers to the story who have not seen the original will appreciate the musical numbers, however Ritchie's lack of exuberance in directing these lavish set pieces clearly showed. Quick cuts galore! Everything is plagued by a digital filter that, whilst providing depth to landscape shots, made the green screen and CGI even more noticeable. Hopefully he has used his third and final wish when it comes to creating blockbusters, as his strong suit is excelling in character driven gangster flicks. Not these excessive stylistic empty shells.<br/><br/>Other characters such as the Sultan and Iago were completely rewritten to be ultra realistic, and in doing so have relinquished all sense of personality. ""Don't touch anything but the lamp"". Proceeds to touch gold to which nothing happens, but touch a ruby? Different scenario! Oh, and Jasmine has an original pop song that ironically left me ""speechless""...as to how unnecessary and deliberate it was. We get it. She doesn't want to be imprisoned. Move on! Atleast the costumes and production design were authentic and had vivid colours burst through the screen.<br/><br/>As I end this review, I want to reaffirm my opinion regarding these Disney remakes. I have nothing against the company doing these relentless translations, all for the sake of money mind you. But only if they are good. Only if they retain the charm and memorable quality of the work that it is reproducing. If that is lost, what's the point? It'll always be a lesser work of ""art"" that remains in the shadow of its original. Aladdin is exactly that. An empty shell rolling around in sand, dust and ruined characters. Aside from the central performances and occasional smiles, this did nothing for me. Families I'm sure will enjoy the heck out of it, but nothing compared to the magical animated feature. I shall watch 'The Lion King' with trepidation..."

This is another of Disney's live action remakes of one of their classic animated movies. It's been a while since I've seen the original 1992 movie but they did good on this one. Mena plays Aladdin, an extraordinary street thief that falls in love with Naomi/Jasmine, the princess. Will plays the genie that grants 3 wishes to whomever rubs the lamp. Marwan is the king's chief advisor, who has plans to take over the kingdom for his own-that's the way villains think-by getting Mena to steal the magic lamp. Things change when Mena decides to keep it and use it to win the beautiful Naomi. Will does not just impersonate the great performance of the late great Robin Williams. He puts his own spin on it just enough so that it is different but it also reminds you of Robin Williams, too. FYI: Just in case you did not know it, this movie is a musical with lots of singing and dancing. I did recognize a few of the songs so they did use at least some from the earlier incarnation. This movie is directed by Guy Ritchie, who directed the new Sherlock Holmes movies and RocknRolla.

"shawneofthedead","5","268","619","22 May 2019"," Aladdin tries, quite hard, but doesn't make a convincing argument for its own existence - and occasionally threatens to ruin your childhood.
","THE LOW-DOWN: For the past decade, Disney has been mining its treasure trove of animated classics for live-action remake fodder. Thus far, the results have been charming enough, though none of them has made a definitive case for or against telling the same story in a different medium. Aladdin has the rather dubious distinction of tilting the debate in favour of leaving well enough alone. Notwithstanding a few welcome sparks of colour and reinvention, this remake will struggle to convince anyone that it needed to exist. In fact, it provides concrete proof that - however good, however photo-real modern special effects have become - there are some things that just work better when animated.<br/><br/>THE STORY: You know the drill - Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is a street rat with a heart of gold, picking pockets to stay alive in the bustling markets of Agrabah. He's recruited by Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) - nefarious, ambitious vizier to the Sultan (Navid Negahban) - to steal a magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders. Aladdin's life takes a turn for the weird and wonderful when he rubs said lamp, freeing an all-powerful Genie (Will Smith) who grants him three wishes. With the Genie's help, Aladdin makes his bid for the heart of Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). But romance falls by the wayside when Jafar sets his evil plans into motion.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: There are some welcome efforts to update elements of Aladdin's story to better reflect the world in which we live today. In the 1992 original, it was always frustrating that a princess with the intelligence and independent spirit of Jasmine had to find a husband to rule Agrabah. This remake doesn't derail the romance, but it does make time to return Jasmine her agency - making clear that she's the one in the relationship with all the (political) power. It's a shame that Speechless, the new song she's been given to explore her inner turmoil, feels so out-of-place in both the film and the score. The tune is disposable, presumably fished out of composer Alan Menken's bottom drawer, with pop anthem lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul that are frustratingly generic. But hey - effort appreciated.<br/><br/>THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Unfortunately, the rest of Aladdin never quite lives up to the spectacular heights of the original film. It's decently made, for the most part, and the action sequences are gratifying to watch. In live action, Aladdin is something of a parkour practitioner, the camera chasing after him on his gravity-defying sprints through the streets of Agrabah. But the magic is curiously gone, bled out of scenes that should crackle with joy and emotion, like Prince Ali and A Whole New World. Apart from a couple of goofy moments that feel charmingly improvised, you won't be able to spot director Guy Ritchie's chaotic comic streak in the film at all. Almost all of its best bits - specifically the friendship between Aladdin and the Genie - are lifted, beat for beat, from its predecessor.<br/><br/>I (DON'T WANT TO) DREAM OF GENIE: Robin Williams' Genie is one of Disney's towering achievements - his every motion, facial expression and quicksilver transformation like lighting captured in a bottle, literally and figuratively. It's truly one of the most sublime marriages of actor and animation ever: Robin Williams is the Genie, and the Genie is Robin Williams. It's actually unfair to expect anyone to fill Williams' enormous shoes, even someone like Smith, who has bucketloads of natural charisma of his own. Here, he's not only hamstrung by having to give a performance already perfected by someone else - he's saddled with unfortunate character design (that gigantic, puffed-up torso) and occasionally ropey CGI. As a result, Smith's Genie becomes the stuff of nightmares. It should come as no surprise that Smith is most effective in the scenes when he isn't big and blue. The opposite can be said of Jafar, who was made all the more sinister by his distinctively arch appearance in the animated film - something Kenzari can't possibly hope to approximate as a real human person. At least the film's animal companions (Abu, Rajah and Iago) are wonderfully rendered, which gives one hope for Disney's next live-action remake, The Lion King.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDED? Not particularly. Aladdin tries, quite hard, but doesn't make a convincing argument for its own existence - and occasionally threatens to ruin your childhood."

","What....a....joke! I was expecting this movie to be bad but nothing prepared me for this mess. To take one of the best Disney Cartoons that everyone loves and turn it into this?!? How did Guy Ritchie sign up to direct this abomination?!? No inspiration, no joy and no heart.<br/><br/>Everything from the costumes and decorations to singing and dancing looks cheap and feels like a TV movie despite its vibrant colors and CGI. This remake feels more like a parody where questionable actors don't have chemistry or know how to act for that matter. Jafar is flat out pathetic. Why are you singing Arabian nights in the start if it is all going to be Bollywood? Why does everyone except the main characters have an accent?<br/><br/>They adjusted the story and I can certainly get behind Jasmine's new arc since she is intelligent, independent and should be able to rule but the way they present it is forced and rushed specially with her song which feels out of place and breaks the flow of the film. Last and Main point: you can NOT replace Robin Williams. NO, NO and NO. This is an iconic character with gigantic magical boots that Will Smith sinks in despite his effort.Yes, the movie has one good musical scene but it is not enough so avoid it and watch the cartoon instead."

","This is not a great Disney movie (not exactly Frozen or the Lion King), but not a terrible one either. I give it two stars out of five. Actually, it gets a bit better over time. The last part of the movie might warrant three stars out of five.<br/><br/>The key acting roles are good. The guy chosen to play Aladdin and the lady chosen to play Jasmine are well cast and well done. Of course, Will Smith is a really good Genie. That said, Will Smith always does a great job.<br/><br/>Those are the positives.... The Sultan (Navid Negahban) is not great. Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) is too much of nice guy. Not nearly evil enough for the role.<br/><br/>The Tiger (Rajah) was a big plus. Not clear to me if they used a real tiger or a CGI tiger.

"TheLittleSongbird","4","4","5","6 December 2019"," Lots of spectacle but little magic
","Am a huge Disney fan and have been for pretty much my whole life, 'Cinderella', 'Peter Pan' and 'The Lion King' being my first Disney films (still love all three, especially 'The Lion King'). 'Aladdin' is one of my favourites from them as well as being one of my favourite animated and even overall films. Great animation, songs, characters and one of Disney's best voice acting performances ever in Robin Williams. Will admit to not being overly excited hearing that there was going to be a live-action remake and was a bit mixed on the trailer.<br/><br/>Have nothing against remakes, or at least try not to, and have liked a few of Disney's previous live-action remakes. The best being 'The Jungle Book' and 'Cinderella'. Will Smith when he has good material is a likeable actor and still have fond memories of watching 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air' when younger. Although not a fan of Guy Ritchie, there is no bias against him either. Decided to see 'Aladdin' with mixed expectations, due to being such a big fan of Disney and after hearing from a few friends that it was good.<br/><br/>Do sadly have to agree with those that were disappointed and this is even when judging 'Aladdin' (2019) on its own merits. There is a lot of spectacle and most of it is great, but the magic and soul were missing. Again, like as was said for the recent version of 'The Lion King', there has always been an effort to not excessively compare and judge something on its own, but when one version is so great and another fails badly in comparison it is hard not to.<br/><br/>There are good things with 'Aladdin'. Although very Bollywood-ish (am not saying that as a bad thing, just an observation), the costumes and sets are big, colourful and quite lavish. Some of the photography dazzles. The music that still has the involvement of Alan Menken, songs and score (the music being one of the main reasons as to why the animation is the classic that it is), is a sheer delight. The likes of ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World"" being classics. Here the older songs are re-worked and there are a couple of new ones, complete with some equally dynamic new scoring. ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World"" are very nicely done, and also really liked the more ambitious re-working of ""Arabian Nights"" and ""Speechless"" (the better of the two added songs) adds such a lot to Jasmine's character.<br/><br/>Really liked what was done with Jasmine's character, who is by far the most interesting and most developed character in the film and her development is richer than in the animated films. The performances were mixed, with Naomi Scott sparkling like a true diamond as Jasmine and Will Smith makes a very game and spirited effort filling giant shoes and brings a lot of charisma and freshness to Genie. Mena Massoud isn't as strong but is appealing as Aladdin.<br/><br/>However, Guy Ritchie came over as the wrong director. Did think even hearing about it that he was a strange and potentially disastrous choice for the job and his style just doesn't gel and was in serious need of more subtlety. There is some dazzling photography but too much of it is a bit too overblown and gimmicky. The film could have done with having fewer special effects and they tend to not be all that great, felt even from the trailer that Genie looked weird and my feelings haven't changed. The script could have done with more freshness.<br/><br/>For me too the story was in need of more charm, energy and soul. It doesn't quite suffer as badly as 'The Lion King' from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity, but what comes over faithfully does not have the same impact or feel anywhere near as fresh. The additional content mostly doesn't add as much as ought and bloats the film, which could have been 15 minutes shorter (which was a fairly similar problem too with 'Beauty and the Beast'). Marwan Kenzari is a complete non-entity as a pretty one-note Jafar, whose back-story was laudable on paper but wasn't particularly compelling somehow. Abu, Iago and Rajah don't make anywhere near the same impression either, though Abu has his moments (helps too that Frank Welker is back, Iago however sounded odd without Gilbert Gottfried who voiced the character for the original and its two sequels and the television show).<br/><br/>On the whole, lacklustre but has its moments. 4/10"

So on that note, I very much enjoyed this with my movie theatre-working friend. Will Smith is amusing enough as the Genie now and when the more dramatic scenes come, I was touched enough by the story, characters, and the actors playing them.

"grantpaulsen","4","37","77","22 May 2019"," Aladdin (2019) Misses the Mark
","Disney's latest live action remake misses the mark, proving once again that these live action remakes aren't working. They're made for financial benefit, but the quality of the film dips from the original by adding completely unnecessary characters and plot points that were cut from the original for a reason. The acting from Will Smith and Naomi Scott was surprisingly the best part of the film. The rest of the actors were really bad, especially the actor who played Jafar. He was terrible as this character, he was not intimidating in the slightest. I can't believe that an animated cartoon character was somehow more menacing and scary than a real actor. The acting overall in this film felt like stage play acting, very over exaggerated facial expressions and body language, which works well on stage, but doesn't translate well to film. The singing was pretty bad too, you could tell the actors, other than Will Smith, couldn't sing so their voices are very heavily auto tuned and it sounds really bad. The directing was very bland, it had no style to it. It honestly looks like a soap opera you'd find on the Lifetime channel. With all these elements mixed in, as a result, nothing about this film felt authentic in any way. These live action remakes need to have more effort put into them writing wise."
"arishsankar","6","121","286","23 May 2019"," Aladdin lacks real magic

","Greetings again from the darkness. Aladdin ... come on down! You are the next participant in Disney's ongoing mission for live-action remakes of their classic films. And rest easy fans, this time the mega-studio has done right by the original. Now that doesn't mean there aren't surprises. How about Guy Ritchie as director? How about a cast of mostly unknowns? How about modernized songs and even a new one sung by Jasmine? And it probably goes without asking, but how about a lot of CGI?<br/><br/>Mena Massoud (""Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan"") stars as Aladdin, and he gets to showboat early in the film and flash some parkour skills in the familiar and high-octane chase through the village. Aladdin, of course, is labeled a 'street rat' and 'riff-raff', but he's also charming, handsome, talented as a thief, and quite warm-hearted. He and his pet monkey Abu - or more accurately, partner in crime - are streetwise and work quite well together, both for theft and love.<br/><br/>Naomi Scott (slated to star in the CHARLIE'S ANGELS movie coming out later this year) is a beautiful and ambitious Princess Jasmine, who wants to succeed her father as Sultan of Agrabah, but is instead forced to choose between a steady stream of suitors - each a Prince, as required by law. Ms. Scott has a terrific singing voice and really gets to cut loose on the new woman power song ""Speechless"".<br/><br/>The blue Genie is played by Will Smith, and this is what has fans of the beloved 1992 animated film so flustered. No, Will Smith is not Robin Williams, and few if any, could match the late great comedian for his energy and comedic flair. But Mr. Smith does a marvelous job of staying true to the original, while also adding his own style ... a style that works very well for comedy, music, and dramatic moments. He is not likely to disappoint anyone who has an open mind.<br/><br/>So let's talk about the villain. Marwan Kenzari is Jafar, the man so dissatisfied with being number 2. Personally, I would have preferred a more intimidating bad guy, but given the tone of the film (more on that below), he's a solid fit. His sidekick and smart-aleck parrot Iago is voiced by Alan Tudyk (it was the distinctive Gilbert Gottfried in the 1992 version). Two other key supporting roles include Nasim Padrad (""Saturday Night Live"") as Dalla, Jasmine's handmaiden; and Navid Negahban (Abu Nazir in ""Homeland"") as the Sultan and Jasmine's father.<br/><br/>It's been 27 years since Robin Williams' Genie entertained so many, and the comparisons to that version are inevitable. It's a relief that Disney opted to keep the film family friendly (Rated PG) and avoid the dark tone that had their recent projects aimed more at adults than kids, rather than the balance they've been known for more than 6 decades. Yes, this is the same director that made SNATCH (2000) and SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), neither of which any decent parent would allow their young kids to watch. But, Mr. Ritchie has delivered a film which entertained (and didn't overly frighten) kids as young as 5 in the screening I attended.<br/><br/>Director Ritchie co-wrote the script with John August, who is best known for his work with Tim Burton (BIG FISH, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, CORPSE BRIDE, DARK SHADOWS, FRANKENWEENIE). The film runs 2 hours and 8 minutes, 38 longer than the 1992 film ... though it doesn't feel too long. Gemma Jackson's set design of Agrabah, the Palace, and the Cave of Wonders are all stunning, and then of course, there is the music. Alan Menken won an Oscar for ALADDIN (1992) and his music is back and modernized, and sounds wonderful ... especially ""A Whole New World"" and Jasmine's new song.
With a talented cast of Arab/Middle Eastern/Central Asian/Southern Asian actors, there should be no cries of ""foul"", and there really is something special about a movie that can be thoroughly enjoyed by all ages. The Bollywood-type closing number provides a kaleidoscope of color, texture and dancing ... and is a nice twist to ""You've Never Had a Friend Like Me"". And I'll leave you with this final offer: you can have the monkey, if I can have the magic carpet."
"bob-the-movie-man","6","11","19","12 June 2019"," Not as Agrabahd as I was expecting.
","You all know the plot! ""Street-rat"" Aladdin (Mena Massoud) fancies Princess Jasmine of Agrabah (Naomi Scott). Her father, the sultan (Navid Negahban), only wants happiness for her. But the law says that she can only marry a prince.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the sultan's evil adviser Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) perceives Aladdin as the fabled ""diamond in the rough"": the only one able to enter the 'cave of wonders' to retrieve an old lamp; a lamp that contains a genie who will grant the owner three wishes.<br/><br/>The biggest problem here is a 27-year old legacy from the late Robin Williams. In 1992 he embarked on 90 minutes of improvised riffing that the clever Disney animators worked around. How exactly does anyone follow that? Who exactly *could* follow that? As it is, Will Smith has a good crack as the genie, but only makes it to about 60% on the Robin-o-meter. He seems to be far less ""street"" in this film than his normal persona, perhaps being asked to tone it down by Disney? But this feels like a bad call. If he'd been allowed to 'let-rip' and ad lib, Williams-style, the film might have been a bit more dynamic.<br/><br/>Elsewhere in the acting stakes, both Mena Massoud and Marwen Kenzari both feel underpowered: Massoud can sing adequately for the lead, but lacks the screen presence to nail the role; Dutch actor and comedian Kenzari on the other hand is supposed to be utterly evil but comes across as mildly sarcastic with a side order of constipation. There are a whole world of actors out there who could go the whole ""Billy Zane"" on the role... but apparently overlooked.
In both cases - and in general for the whole production - the roles seem to have been largely chosen for their facial similarities to the animated characters rather than for their charisma or acting abilities.<br/><br/>The biggest change in the script, other than minor tweaks for current taste and sensibilities - ""barbaric"" for example is gone! - is the respect given to Jasmine who gets a thoroughly ""MeToo"" makeover as the empowered force for good behind the throne. She even gets her own song - ""Speechless"" - which gets a curious ""snippet"" treatment initially but which comes good in fine style later on.<br/><br/>And Naomi Scott is a revelation in the part, setting the screen on fire as a sexy, sassy and wise Disney heroine. Scott firmly sets herself up here as ""one to watch"" in the future. She is far and away the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>Also good as Jasmine's maid is Saturday Night Live regular Nasim Pedrad, who I spent most of the film thinking was Selma Hayak!<br/><br/>With four grandkids under 5, I always view these films with an eye to ""suitability"". In Aladdin, there are a few dodgy moments early on: 'henchman number 5' gets suddenly munched by the ""blue tiger cave""; and Jafar - clearly to illustrate the depths to which either his 'sarcasm' or his 'constipation' can reach - tosses his hapless right-hand-man down a well to his (presumed) death. (""It's OK little one.... there was a BIIIIGGGG pillow at the bottom""). But other than that, and some possibly scary 'giant-Jafar' effects in the finale, the rest of the film is pretty innocuous. My one reservation for younger kids would be the 128 minute running time. It's a bit flabby in places, and cutting 10 minutes out of the run-time would help youngsters with a less-than feature length attention span.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has the unenviable job of bringing it all in, and I was not disappointed by the effort. There is a visual flair on show that made it very watchable. There are also some nice Disney in-jokes: the carpet builds the Disney castle opening titles (tinker bell arc and all!) and the genie conjures up ""Fantasyland"" on the map.<br/><br/>Overall, I went into this expecting to hate it, but I didn't. The songs lack the manic pizzazz of the original animated versions, but some of them still worked well: ""Friend like Me"" is particularly effective (I actually got to hear and understand the lyrics this time!). It's a perfectly fun way to spend a couple of hours at the cinema, and for kids, particularly those without the reference of the Disney original, will probably love it.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the interweb or Facebook.

"ajzeg","1","6","9","15 September 2019"," Well, I saw this for some reason. I guess I just like to suffer.
","This movie is really bad! It has no reason to exist! Everything it does well was done better in the original and everything that the original did well is done much worse here! Now, when you think of the original Aladdin, what comes to mind? Probably the incredibly rich and colourful and energetic animation with great comedic timing and Robin Williams' incredible performance as the Genie. Well, obviously this new movie isn't animated so you don't have any of that and Robin Williams is dead so you don't have that either. Instead of the beautifully-crafted hand-drawn animation, you get very flat-looking and washed-out environments and some very crappy CGI. Instead of Robin Williams improvising most of his lines and talented Disney animators giving life to his words, you get Will Smith being slightly charming and slightly comedic, which is pretty much every Will Smith performance for the past 20+ years! Also, instead of Looney Tunes-style visual gags and slapstick, you get cringe humour. Not cringy humour, cringe humour, which is an actual style of comedy most often found in sitcoms like The Office. Cringe humour can be great if done well, but it can fail spectacularly if not done well. This was not done well. It wasn't very funny. It was just awkward. What is even the point of watching this if the best parts of the original movie that arguably are the reason it is so beloved do not translate at all? Okay, so the comedy doesn't work, but how are the other actors? Well, the rest of the performances were honestly pretty bad, especially the guy playing Jafar. He is not threatening in the slightest! He just sounds monotone and bored. He just wasn't the right actor for the role. His facial features are too soft and his voice is too high-pitched. Not great villain material if not written correctly. The guy playing Aladdin just felt awkward, which kind of works sometimes for when he's turned into a prince, but his performance still feels awkward even in the scenes where he's supposed to be in his home element. He's supposed to be kind of a Han Solo type, he's a thief but he has a heart of gold, but in this he feels more like Scott Pilgrim. The girl playing Jasmine was probably the best actor in the movie, either her or Alan Tudyk as Iago, but in practically every scene she's in without Aladdin she's accompanied by her sidekick character. Not the tiger, a new character, her handmaiden. She was also very awkward and not very funny. I really don't understand the point of this character being in the movie at all. Okay, so the performances leave a lot to be desired, but how is the music? Also terrible! The new orchestrations of the old songs are made more modern and hip for the kids (With some rapping and beatboxing. No, really.) and the only person who can sing in the whole darn cast is the girl who plays Jasmine! Speaking of Jasmine, she also has a new song of her own which she sings really well, but the lyrics are not very good and it seems very out of place with the rest of the songs. It doesn't sound like Aladdin, it sounds more like The Greatest Showman. Probably because it was written by the same people who did The Greatest Showman. Now, I haven't seen that movie, but I am not a fan of the songs from that film. They sound way too poppy and not enough like musical theatre for my liking and the lyrics I think are just awful, but at least all the songs were like that in The Greatest Showman. In Aladdin, it just does not fit at all. The effects during the song were cool though, or at least they would be if I didn't see literally the exact same thing before in Into the Woods and Avengers: Infinity War. That's most of this movie's problems summed up. No matter what it does, there is always another movie that does it better. Overall, this movie is an embarrassment. It's a complete and utter waste of time. It's pointless! Just stay home and watch the original! It's shorter (Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the remake is over 2 hours long! The original is under 90 minutes! It's full of padding. It even ends with a big dance party scene like a DreamWorks movie. And it shows Aladdin and Jasmine getting married! What the heck?? They aren't supposed get married until the third movie, after a direct-to-VHS sequel and a TV series!) and it is better in every way! It's colourful, energetic, hilarious and a ton of fun! This is boring, tired, unfunny and frustrating. Do not watch this movie! The only reason I did was because this movie has already made over a billion dollars and there is nothing I can do to affect its financial performance at this point. Also, OVER A BILLION DOLLARS????? People actually LIKE this????? Why?? It's the same movie we've all seen over 2 decades ago only worse! I do not understand the appeal of these remakes at all. If you like these Disney remakes, please tell me why. I'm curious. Why would you ever want to watch them when you could just watch the original movie again and get a better viewing experience? I'd love to know. Anyway, those are my thoughts on the new Aladdin and also my thoughts on the new The Lion King. Even though I haven't seen The Lion King, I have a feeling that most of my criticisms of this also apply to that movie, but I'll see it at the dollar cinema just to be sure. Stay tuned."

To be honest I wasn't a real fan of the original animation, I am a huge Disney fan with my favourite being Robin Hood.
I thought Will Smith did a good job as the Genie without trying to out do the wonderful Robin Williams. The roles in the movie were perfectly cast and I just found myself sitting back, watching and enjoying the movie.

","Within a duration of about 2 hours, I was able to journey through my childhood days, and enjoy each and every bit of the ''Whole new world'' as well. Almost three decades have passed in between the old and new film, yet not a single emotion is absent in the new movie. It is as fresh and soothing as the old one. Hats off to @guyritchie, the director of the movie, for recreating most of my favourite scenes.
Although a debate about @willsmith as the #genie is on air, Smith is too awesome for this role. He has done great justification for the role as well as for the movie. Once again, he proved that he can portray any role in any movie as efficiently as one can think of. @menamassoud as Aladdin is too adorable. He justified the multifaceted character of #Aladdin - a street rat who is forced to earn his living by thieving, a selfless vulnerable guy, a trustworthy friend and a true lover. But what I like mostly about Disney is the paradigm shift of its recent movies; a shift in the trend of female characters from dwelling on a bubble of romanticism to strong women who can earn their own positions in the society by themselves and not by the mercy of the patriarchal society. #Jasmine of this decade can speak about their own demands. They need no help of any man. They know what they want, and how to get them. Jasmine (played by @naomiscott) is perhaps the best role in the movie, and will be remembered by the audience for a long time."

","I was honestly shocked when my friend told me this was a Guy Richie film. Definitely not a great film but the two new leads carried what would have otherwise been a pretty unwatchable film<br/><br/>Edit 2020;
As a remake, this film falls flat. As a movie on its own however, it really falls flat. The story of Aladdin, however you tell it, is supposed to be an enchanted and magical time, or as Aladdin himself would put it, a whole new world. It shouldn't be distracting you with its inconveniences, but instead immersing you in a brand new fantasy.
The film, if you've seen the original Aladdin, is pretty much the same only with a lot more ugliness. Aladdin is a street rat and thief living in the Arabian city of Agrabah. One day however, he comes across a princess named Jasmine who is dressed as a commoner. In an attempt to take advantage of Aladdin's affections for her, the royal vizier Jafar manipulates Aladdin into going into a magic cave filled with treasures and a lamp he must retrieve for Jafar and in return, Jafar will give Aladdin the happy ending he so desperately wishes for with the princess. He betrays Aladdin however, leaving him stuck in the cave with the lamp, which he soon discovers holds a magical genie, played by Will Smith. Aladdin uses the Genie to become a prince so he can woo the princess and hopefully win her over.
Now the first problem is the subplots. Not only does this film carry over subplots from the first film, but it also invents completely new and pointless ones to go along with them. For instance, the Genie has a crush with Jasmine's handmaiden. Now you might be asking yourself, ""Why?"" I mean, not only is it weird to see the Genie attracted to human women, but it also adds nothing to the story in any way at all!
Then we have the special effects. They look awful. The Genie, as I'm sure the people who've already watched this film have already pieced together, looks hideous. Like, REALLY hideous. He is so obviously a CGI character, and he moves just like one too. The idea of CGI is to make something that is obviously fake move and look like a real thing, not make it move and look more fake!
Then we have the song numbers. First off, the new song numbers are bland. Jasmine gets a new song called Speechless, which not only is sung during the worst possible time in the movie, but also has the most forgettable melody and lyrics. Then, the old songs are given some ""updates."" I put quotes around updates because they are extremely downgraded. They are surprisingly sung terribly, especially by Will Smith, but songs like Prince Ali have the most boring choreography put on film. They somehow managed to screw up Prince Ali, which should be an epic song and dance number in its sleep!
Overall, Aladdin is an awful movie. Like a really awful movie. I'm glad I'm done with it and I never have to watch it ever again. If you never watched the original Aladdin film, you might see this as terrible, but if you have seen the original, you will probably for sure see this as cringey."
"leonblackwood","5","2","2","17 January 2020"," Will Smith saved the movie! 5/10
","Review:
Will Smith definitely saved this movie, because I was falling asleep after the first half an hour, and the singing was getting on my nerves. In true Disney fashion, the sets are spectacular, and the animals, which include a tiger, a monkey and a parrot, are terrific but the two main characters, Aladdin (Mena Massoud), and Jasmine (Naomi Scott) became a bit dull after a while. The movie really picks up when the genie, played by Will Smith, enters the plot, just like Robin Williams in the original movie, and he brings a whole new light to the popular character. Guy Ritchie makes full use of CGI throughout the movie, and the fabulous costumes and humongous sets look great on the big screen, but it could have done with some other established stars in the cast. If your not familiar with the storyline, it's about a kind-hearted street urchin, Aladdin, who lives in the Arabian city of Agrabah along with his pet monkey Abu. Aladdin rescues and befriends Princess Jasmine, who has snuck out of the palace to explore the city because she is tired of her sheltered life. Meanwhile, the grand vizier, Jafar, schemes to overthrow Jasmine's father as the Sultan. He, along with his pet parrot sidekick Lago, seeks a magic lamp hidden in the Cave of Wonders that will grant him three wishes. He has been unable to retrieve the lamp himself because only ""the diamond in the rough"" is allowed to enter the cave. Jafar discovers Aladdin is the diamond in the rough, and when Aladdin sneaks back into the royal palace to talk to Jasmine, he is captured and persuaded by Jafar's deal to help him retrieve the lamp. As Aladdin can enter the cave alive, Jafar offers him enough riches to impress Jasmine, in exchange for the lamp. Jafar warns Aladdin not to take anything but the lamp. Inside the cave, Aladdin finds a magic carpet and obtains the lamp, but Abu accidentally causes the cave to collapse after he catches a fallen ruby. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar but he double-crosses Aladdin and throws him and Abu back into the cave, but Abu manages to steal the lamp back. The magic carpet catches Aladdin and saves him from falling to his death. Trapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning an omnipotent Genie, who lives inside it. Genie explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes, with the exceptions of murder, romance, the resurrection of the dead, and more wishes. Aladdin tricks Genie into freeing them from the cave without using a wish. After they get out of the cave, Aladdin uses his first official wish to become a prince to impress Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free Genie from servitude and turn him human. Aladdin enters Agrabah as Prince Ali of Adawa, arriving in an extravagant spectacle. However, Jasmine is unimpressed by his first presentation, including an assortment of gifts and gems. The two later bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet to show her the world she wants to see, while Genie goes out with Jasmine's handmaiden, Dalia. Jasmine realises who Aladdin is and tricks him into revealing his true identity, however, he convinces her that he is actually a prince and only dressed like a peasant to meet the citizens of Agrabah beforehand. Jafar discovers Aladdin's identity and to test his theory, throws Aladdin into the sea, saying if he lives, it will be because he found the lamp and the Genie saved him. If he dies, he really is a prince and doesn't have the lamp. Abu and the carpet arrive with the lamp and Aladdin rubs it just before losing consciousness. Genie saves him but at the cost of his second wish. At the palace, Jafar tries to turn the others against Aladdin with lies but when Aladdin returns, Jafar is exposed by him and Jasmine, who was also suspicious of Jafar. He is arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon. The Sultan offers Aladdin the position as heir to the throne. Fearing he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin needs Genie with him now and refuses to free him, much to Genie's disappointment. Lago snatches one of the guards keys and he frees Jafar. Jafar stealthily steals the lamp from Aladdin and becomes Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to become Sultan and then when the guards refuse to acknowledge the change at Jasmine's request, to become the world's most powerful sorcerer, imprisoning the guards and Jasmine's pet tiger Rajah. Will Aladdin save the day and reunite with his loved one, and take down the evil Jafar? You have to watch the film to find out. The core of the plot is very much like the animated version, so you can easily work out the ending, but the main changes are the Genie, who made the movie watchable. All of the songs that we grew to love in the original, became tedious after a while, and the additional songs didn't really work. With all that aside, it made a hell of a profit at the box office, which must please the bigwigs at Disney, but it got mixed reviews from the critics. Personally, I much preferred the Disney classic, mainly because of Robin Williams as the Genie, but I must commend Will Smith for taking on such an iconic role. In all, it's a watchable film but I didn't like the singing. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Guy Ritchie, who also brought you Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998, Snatch, Swept Away, Revolver, RocknRolla, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. He also released The Gentlemen in 2020, which I'm yet to see, and he is due to direct Cash Truck and Empire Rising, which are both in the development stage. Compared to Guy Ritchie's previous movies, this movie is definitely out of his comfort zone, but he managed to pull it off, even though I wasn't that impressed. Like a lot of directors, including Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, his earlier work is much better than his later projects, but they have become bankable filmmakers, mainly because of the profit that their movies make at the box office. Personally, I'm yet to fell the magic that I did when I watched Lock Stock & Snatch, in his latest projects so I'm hoping that he has gone back to his original style of filmmaking with The Gentlemen.<br/><br/>Budget: $183million
Worldwide Gross: $1.05billion<br/><br/>Genre: Adventure, Family, Fantasy
Cast: Will Smith, Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, Marwan Kenzari, Navid Negahban, Nasim Pedrad, Billy Magnussen, Aubrey Lin, Nina Wadia, Alan Tudyk and Jamal Sims. 5/10"

"Hyliannoyed","7","2","2","31 December 2019"," Pretty Decent Overall
","I'm not going to lie: I'm not a big fan of Disney's new tactic of remaking their older animated films. Cinderella's remake was excellent, but outside of that, the others have felt fine at best. 2019's ""Aladdin"" is one of the more interesting cases, as it makes a few improvements to the original, but also does some things worse. Overall, it's pretty much comparable to the original. Will Smith does quite well as the genie, and there's a nice twist for his character which was a welcome addition to the story. Additionally, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott do pretty well with their roles overall. However, the score is comparatively weaker, with the newer takes on older songs not really matching up to their predecessors, and the one newer song feeling out of place with the others. Additionally, Jafar is not portrayed successfully, undermining a lot of the tension. As it stands, it's a decent remake that's worth a watch. It doesn't replace the original, but it does do a fair amount to differentiate itself."

","Guy Ritchie, you can make good movies. Was this Disney's fault? Or have you been not doing great as of recent? Whoever is to blame for this AWFUL movie needs to come forward.
Okay, I love the original Aladdin, as we all do. But this tried, it TRIED, to capture why we loved the original.
It tried having the big show numbers, it tried having the same zest in the Genie, but it just failed on all fronts.
Will Smith can also do good things. And also do Wild Wild West. But here, he TRYS to do his own Genie but just comes off like he's trying to be Robin Williams.
Aladdin was bland, Jafar was Ja-far from being a good villian, and Jasmine was just nothing. Her song felt like High School Musical 4: Arabian Days.

Empty, hollow, plastic. Disney needs to stop DESTROYING perfection. The original animated Aladdin was just that: PERFECTION. Nobody wants a shot for shot remake of Citizen Kane or Casablanca do they? No. If you are going to re-imagine a thing, then do that, re-IMAGINE it: use your IMAGINATION! It seems Disney has dumped all their creative talent into one department and they are all at work on the Star Wars franchise leaving the rest of the crew to imperfectly re-shoot scripts which were previously shot PERFECTLY. Walt Disney must be somewhere in heaven crying his eyes out right about now. Whoever thought that since there was a lack of new material pumping out from the Imagineers that in its stead they should pull out all the old archive material & just trace over old projects with new pens (in the form of computers) should be fired, no, shamed out of employment & run out of town. A studio ripping off another studio is one thing but a studio ripping off itself is just MADNESS. The direction this studio is heading outside of it's one creative, imaginative pull (Star Wars) right now is downright distasteful, irreverent, & outright shameful. I will keep supporting the Star Wars projects since they retain a creative vision but I dare not subject my child to anymore Disney disgrace outside of that universe until they get all their Donald Ducks back in a row."

","I was hoping for something passable, I was not expecting anything great....I did not even get that. I found myself skipping over parts of the movie just to get to the songs and set pieces and even they were just disappointment.<br/><br/>This version has no charm, Aladdin's part in ""A whole new world"" was just flat, there was no emotion to it no strength when the song changes key and is meant to step up a gear it just doesn't. Jasmine's singing voice is far superior but due to the lack of any soul in Aladdin when is meant to be one of the most iconic duets in this part of Disney history felt more like a high school attempt.<br/><br/>Jafar was just a generic bad guy, he failed to come across as the scheming villian he was portrayed as originally. Poor Iago, what did they do to you....in the original Iago was a living breathing character with real lines and interaction. I loved the original Iago he was a coniving as Jafar. Here.....what was he? Practically nothing...<br/><br/>All of the heart, all of the charm that the original had they forgot to put into this version. Which leaves us with the biggie....the Genie....<br/><br/>Will Smith, you were a brave BRAVE man for taking on such a role that Robin WIlliams was loved for the world over. You were never going to get an easy ride on this one. If you tried to just imitate Robin you would've been called a coward and I do not think you could've done it. It making the role more your own, you tried....you really did. The musical numbers you had just did not feel as impactful as when Robin did them. I think that was the problem....they did not go BIG enough with Genie for you. A lot of why it worked for Robin is because he was just so over the top and crazy and ...well...Robin...<br/><br/>You, Will Smith, can be just as big and just as crazy but it felt like Disney just held back as if they were too scared to let you off the leash and really OWN the role. You weren't bad....I just think the Genie was not the other thing that was stuck was shackled and lacked freedom.<br/><br/>Jasmine's new song added nothing to the film, it was added purely to try and push the whole female empowerment aspect of the movie....the original managed that already by showing Jasmine speaking out and standing up for herself. The song was well performed, if just felt like padding and extra run time that did not enhance the movie.
It felt almost like they look at Moana and ""how far I'll go"" and wanted a similar song to try and show that same strength for Jasmine, but it just did not work.<br/><br/>This is the first live action re-imagining of Disney I have watched and I have to saw I do not have hope for the others...."

However, I just could not get into it. I tried and tried and tried and tried. Ok now let's get to the casting... The guy who played Aladdin just BUGGED. He was so short, his lip syncing was bad and he didn't have any chemistry with anyone, not even the magic carpet. Naomi Scott who played Jasmine was great, especially her singing! I didn't dig the Genie side romance with Jasmine's friend played by Nasim Pedrad, it felt phony and forced. I didn't really care for her character mostly because I didn't feel she really added anything to the story. Her lines were a bit cheesy and overall her part felt like an SNL skit. The whole character of Jafar just did not work. The casting was not right for him and his entire character portrayal was off. Jafar's genie part was laughable. I like Will Smith and didn't mind him as the Genie, I guess? But Robin Williams is just the OG. All and all this is a miss for me, sorry Disney. Maybe the kiddos will dig it!

What not a big enough budget for that? And no Prince Ali reprise? Everything about him made the movie just... less.<br/><br/>I think they did ok with Princess jasmine. My biggest complaint is her wanting to be sultan. It's not the idea of it that I don't like, it's the fact that you literally take away from plot points in the original. Why was princess in the market place for example.<br/><br/>Then abu and iago. It's a shame they chose to go the route of more ""real life"" animals. It really took away from them. Oh and my bad. Not iago. I mean parrot. Good grief.<br/><br/>Overall they just took away a lot of little things that made the movie great. There were some good things added but overall the movie gets 2 stars for the movie itself with a full star bump for A Whole New World sticking closer to the original.

Honestly, if Will Smith wasn't in the movie I'd EASILY rate it less than 4
I gave 1 start for the visuals
1 star for some recreated moments in the movie
2 starts for Will Smith
Although he -for sure- did not mirror the performance of Robin Williams, which is understandable, his performance wasn't bad at all.. Some moments I felt like NOOOO where's R Williams? Especially in the cave scene.
Mena and Naomi were not so bad as a cast, but Mena did not impersonate Aladdin so well, and the characters did not have any kind of chemistry on screen. Maybe this was due to the awful Dialogue written by the writers.
Overall, the cast is bad (especially jafar and the sultan) the scenes are so rushed, dialogue is terrible, and I thought the costumes were not so great (Especially Jasmine's).
When you want to make something different (as not to mirror the original movie which is kind of hard to do) try to make it better... but this is just total disappointment. I have to watch the original Aladdin just to wipe that awful memory from my brain."

Just like the retelling of The Lion King this one seemed to miss the magic of its predecessor and the humour was also lacking just like in The Lion King, the jokes they left in didn't work and the ones they removed needed to be there.

"jackgdemoss","8","10","18","12 June 2019"," Will Smith's Genie is legendary
","As many movie-goers know, live adaptations of animated films rarely fair well. Thankfully, Aladdin is an exception. One of the biggest question marks coming in was how Will Smith could possibly fill the shoes of Robin Williams. I think it is safe to say that they have been filled and expanded, because Smith's genie was phenomenal. The entire ""You Ain't Never Had a Friend Like Me"" scene had me glued to the screen in awe and wonder. I have to imagine a quarter of the budget was dropped in that 2 minute window. The only thing better than the effects was the costume design, which I believe is deserving of any number of nominations. The one gripe I had with the film, albeit a minor one, is that it could have stood to cut 10 minutes out by eliminating the ""Speechless"" songs. It ultimately added nothing to the story and the second song felt like I was watching some weird fan flick. Don't count this film out!"
"stevecrowson","9","26","58","27 May 2019"," A Disney classic comes to life!
","What can I say? When you hear that one of your favourite Disney classics is going to be recreated for live action, you also hear that tiny voice of trepidation in your head saying ""please don't mess this up"". Well I'm pleased to say that was not the case here. Aladdin is a complete triumph.
Let's break this down.<br/><br/>Will Smith as the Genie was always going to be a huge talking point. He had some very large Robin Williams style shoes to fill. Smith admittedly did not want to recreate perfection but instead put his own spin on the character whilst still maintaining the nostalgia of the role. It's fair to say it was a success. There were some classic Smith comedy moments throughout as well as stamping his own original musical flare into some of the films most famous numbers. A great job for the Hollywood legend.<br/><br/>As for Mena Massoud (a fairly unknown actor) who played the title character, he was simply perfect for the role. He looked the part, had an excellent singing voice and managed to capture the cheeky charisma of the character brilliantly well. With some excellent dance scenes and some hilarious comedy timing with co star Smith, Massoud was a truly wonderful casting choice for the film. He really is the real life Aladdin.<br/><br/>It wasn't just Massoud and Smith who stood out either. Naomi Scott (Princess Jasmine) and Marwan Kenzari (Jafar) gave an equally believable performance in recreating these characters. Naomi's out of this world singing voice was enough to send shivers down your spine whilst the villainous stare and evil tongue of Kenzari did not disappoint. A film is only as strong as its actors and everyone in Aladdin did a phenomenal job.<br/><br/>The film itself was very well directed. A huge standing O to Guy Ritchie for putting his own personal film style on this without diviating from the well known story line and maintaining the magic of the classic 1992 original.
Visually spectacular scenes including the memorable flying carpet scene and the cave of wonders greatly exceeded my expectations. This CGI magic mixed with some excellent musical production scenes made this film one I would watch again and again. A classic story exquisitely made with an immensely talented cast. What more could you want from Disney? For me, watching this was like watching one of my favourite childhood films come to life.
A well deserved 9 stars!"

","Okay so before I went to watch the new remake of Aladdin, I watched the animated movie again the night before. And I really was expecting the new remake to be disappointing.<br/><br/>But then I started to just enjoy the movie new remake (And yes it was so much better than the Beauty and the Beast's remake!)<br/><br/>I loved Cinderella's remake as well and now I am in love with Aladdin's remake. They kept to the original script. It was so much fun to sing along with all the music and they did a great job with Jasmine's new song.<br/><br/>I loved Will Smith's adaptation of the Genie and how he made the Genie his own. I was so worried that he would ruin the way Robin William portrayed the Genie.
All the people who said that Jasmine is now a feminist. Should really rewatch the animated version again. HELLO! She is and always will be ""a strong and independent "" woman.<br/><br/>I really had high expectations like any Disney fan for this movie. And I was not disappointed. I have been watching Disney for almost 26years and I loved every minute of the movie. Just give it a try. And just enjoy it for what it is. Don't compare it. That is when the movie will be ruined for you."

"MovieTVRomanceFan","5","9","17","29 May 2019"," Aladdin (2019) was... Okay?
","When the live-action remake of Aladdin was announced I couldn't have been more happy as Aladdin has always been my Number One favourite Disney film ever since I was a little girl. I was very excited and couldn't wait to see it. However, after finally watching it I can honestly say that the original animated film will Always and Forever Will Be My FAVOURITE. The remake didn't really meet any of my expectations. I thought the special efforts were good, but in some cases I thought they were trying too hard. The songs were great especially, A Friend Like Me and Jasmine's solo, Speechless. Although A Whole New World was good I still prefer the original animated version. I certainly noticed a lot of differences with the characters such as Aladdin being slightly more cocky and a little too over-confident at times, specifically the scene where he breaks his promise to Genie. Jasmine was different as well such as her goals. While some of parts of her original animated counterpart remained, she was really, really different compared to the original such as her goal where she wanted to become the new ruler of Agrabah and actually didn't mind getting married and was less hostile. In regards to Will Smith as Genie I think that Robin Williams would have been proud. Plus I am happy that Genie got a romance with the new character, Dahila who played Jasmine's handmaiden. I really enjoyed their romance.<br/><br/>However, I still wish they would have remained more in touch with the original storyline and not change too much of it. Although change can be good at times, others not so much and it was perfectly proven in this remake as I wasn't happy on all the changes they made from the original classic. Plus, one of the Worst and Most Awkward scenes EVER was the introduction where Aladdin as Prince Ali introduced himself to the royal family. It was awful and one of the most embarrassing things I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. Just so much JAM. SERIOUSLY WHY. The romance between Aladdin and Jasmine was good and I have to admit I kinda liked the beginning, but I still wish they could have kept more of the storyline from the original animated version.<br/><br/>Overall, the remake of Aladdin was okay. Part of me liked it and disliked it all at the same time. In the end, the original animated classic will Always and Forever Be My Favourite, but the remake... Not So Much. :/"

"Prismark10","5","5","8","7 June 2019"," Not a whole new world
","Disney continues with their live action remakes of their classic cartoons at breakneck speed. I do wonder if they should had spaced them out more.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie brings a more subdued style like he has been hemmed in by Disney or he just wanted to make a family film that one day he can watch with his grandkids.<br/><br/>Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is the street urchin in Agrabah. The diamond in the rough who frees a genie (Will Smith) from a lamp and is granted three wishes. He transforms himself into a charming prince in order to marry Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) the woman he rescued from the market as she wandered outside the palace incognito.<br/><br/>The evil Vizier Jafar wants the lamp for his own purposes to rule the kingdom.<br/><br/>Ritchie has made a more respectful version of Aladdin. At least most of the cast come from the middle east. He also adds as a joke, a token white man. Billy Magnussen plays a Scandinavian prince, a potential suitor for the princess.<br/><br/>The whole film though is rather anemic. Gone is the freestyling of Robin Williams genie. Will Smith is following a script, the classic songs are here. The princess has a modernist interpretation but it is never more than average and certainly not better than the animated film from 1992 because it brings little that is new to the table."

Jafar wasn't even looking a villain, just an unnecessary evil. Another forced feminist goal - Jasmine to be a Sultan- was it in the game/animation (1992)? What about the score department. Can't they bring classical music instead of making this a modern high school musical?<br/><br/>One thing Disney is always great. And that is visuals! What happened?

","As a huge fan of the original i went into this not wanting to compare the two, and i didnt as this felt like a different movie with the same story.. if that make sense.
The cons i found with this film was the singing wasnt very strong, the camera work felt often very stagnant and overall felt it wasnt very well directed. I felt like i was watching a bollywood stage production alot of the time, and everything and everyone was just to clean in the world they created.
Jafar was not menacing at all every time he speaks he just sounds weak and not intimidating at all, i also think Iago was a big part of the original and should of played more of a role in this.. i guess they want it to be realistic and not have him talk and at the same time they have magic carpets, talking caves and genies.
What i did enjoy aside from the story and music was the relationship between genie and aladdin they had good chemistry and banter i found myself laughing a bit. Will Smith nailed it in this film i felt it shinned best whenever he was on screen.
I did somewhat enjoy watching this film whether that was because i loved the original and wanted to love this one who knows but i do know i wouldnt watch it a second time i left the theater feeling underwhelmed and dissapointed thinking why didnt i really like this movie much."

","Here's my review of Aladdin ( the new one ,duh ). Let me cut to the chase , the movie wasn't great. No one expected it to be great from the very first look , heck I thought it was an Aladdin parody when I saw the first look. It's directed by Guy Ritchie who's known for the rdj starring Sherlock Holmes movies and man from Uncle. If you're familiar with Guy ritchie movies you'd know that they have very fast edits and zero track shots . So all of the Aladdin jumping off rooftops stuff is like that chase from Uncharted 3 but with bad editing. The guy who played Aladdin wasn't bad , he just didn't look like his 2d counterpart is all. Naomi Scott was great as Jasmine and Will Smith wasn't that bad as genie . The bar that Robin Williams set for genie was very high and I liked how will Smith didn't improv on that and did his own thing. Jafar in this movie was not even half as menacing as the 2d jafar , this guy is like a bad tv villain with bad monologues . The story is exactly the same as the original but with new additions like Jasmine wanting to become Sultan and Jafar being a former thief. There were a lot of scenes which looked like something out of a soap opera or a stage play than a movie . And most scenes just switched from tone to tone instantly , there was no character setup and the cave of wonders wasn't anything close to the original . Even the whole city of Agrabah didn't feel big in an epic scale it Should've been . This movie would've been much better if they'd done a scene to scene remake of the original . Of all the scenes they could cut for time , they cut that scene where jafar turns into a snake and traps Jasmine Into an hour glass , instead they just eased on the whole thing. Iago in this movie wasn't even a character, he was just a normal talking parrot. Oh yeah , the music in this movie was pretty good , they tweaked a lot of songs from the original and made it sound cool , but there was this new song they added to the roster and that was jasmine singing some woman empowerment crap , it got on my nerves. And there was a song at the credits featuring DJ Khaled and that's when I lost it. In the end , Aladdin doesn't live up to the original and while trying to be a musical with a bright colour tone , it looks more like a straight to tv movie on a big budget than a blockbuster. However , if you haven't seen the original , you might actually like this movie. I can go all day roasting Aladdin , but my fingers have gone numb from typing continuously ."
"Robert_duder","9","21","49","27 May 2019"," A genuine surprise and a great start to movie season!
","My expectations for this were relatively low. I was just wary they could pull this off in live action and the trailers didn't help those expectations. I, like many others, were very worried about Will Smith's genie who didn't look quite right. Any and ALL of my concerns melted away within minutes of the start of this film. Aladdin is a glorious, splashy spectacle and Will Smith was one of the best parts of the movie. He absolutely nails the role of genie and makes it his own but still pays a certain homage to the animated version. It was the first movie in a really really long time that made me remember Will Smith is a superstar. This was the perfect role for him. Additionally, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott were magnificent both on their own and together. Their chemistry was perfect. In fact, the chemistry between all of the cast was so great which really helped the film. I've read a lot of positive reviews about the film and all of them seem to imply that Jafar was a weak point in the film but I actually though Marwan Kenzari was very good as Jafar. He was underused perhaps a little but he still played a very good villainous role and was the perfect adversary. Navid Negahban and Nasim Pedrad were also good in smaller roles. The music is amazing, all the original classics are in place and don't disappoint and some new music as well that is very good. I think they added a certain depth to Jasmine that really works well for today's audiences. Aladdin is the movie to beat this summer in my books. I loved it. It was very nearly a perfect experience and if I were to see it again, I think it might become a 10 for me. 9/10"

"justinsubmit","2","4","6","18 September 2019"," An unnecessary poor remake of a classic
","The animated Aladdin in 1992 was my favourite animation of that decade. So I was looking forward to a live-action remake of this classic.<br/><br/>Let me talk about the good. The special effects were well done and it made you feel right in the middle of an exotic country The sets were beautiful and scenery was eye-catching The actors were well chosen and looked like live versions of the cartoon.<br/><br/>Now the bad. Why would the director choose to deviate from the well-thought out script of a classic and come up with something that is worse? Just to show something different? Too many scenes felt like it was ad-libbed because there was no proper dialogue to begin with. The jokes kept on repeating again and again. In fact the actors didn't seem to know what emotion to show because the dialogue had no point.<br/><br/>The comedy from Jafaar...a big plus in the original, was nowhere to be found in this iteration.<br/><br/>They injected feminist/hollywood ideology into a fairytale romance. Jasmine who was so loveable as a strong-willed heroine who fought for what is right, was turned into an equal-rights advocate who's main goal was to be a Sultan. What a disgrace? If the script writers want to tell a story about a feminist, why not make another movie, instead of destroying an age-old classic.<br/><br/>There was no chemistry between the leads. I believe that goes back to the terrible script. The dialogue between them was so awkward, you have to wonder how any romance can develop out of it. In fact, when they started singing a whole new world, it seemed so forced and out of place.<br/><br/>All in all, the director I think the director did not take this movie seriously. Not only was the script half-baked or non existent, the refused to use the original material for the sake of change! What we have is barely watchable, incoherent, and clearly rushed movie. This is the last of these remakes I'm watching for sure!"

"BoganKoalaFilms","2","4","6","5 September 2019"," Disappointing, pointless and sloppy.
","The 2019 Adaptation of the Disney classic, ""Aladdin"", was nothing more than a sloppy, cash grab.<br/><br/>Many moments throughout the film were uncomfortable to watch, purely because of how painfully cringeworthy they were. There were majorly important parts that seemed to be brushed over for the sake of adding new pointless plot points. The story was too quick in parts when there needs to be more information, and too slow in the filler parts. The plot makes very little sense unless you know all of the information from the original.<br/><br/>The modernisation of the soundtrack was something that could have been incredible. But instead we got crappy overproduced beats that didn't fit with the theme or mood of the story. For example, the fan favourite song ""Friend like me"" sung by the Genie, is a jazzy show tune, with a boppy swing. The song is powerful and over the top, which is what made it so perfect in the original. It's a song that is supposed to showcase the Genie's talents and personality. However, in this version of Aladdin, friend like me has a rap beat, which simply didn't fit with the song. Will Smith is an amazing actor and talented rapper, but this song requires a powerful singer to do it justice. Unfortunately, Smith didn't sing those powerful parts in this song or any of the songs well. This is a shame because I really love Will Smith and I was very supportive of the casting of his role.<br/><br/>One of the only songs I really enjoyed in this version, was Arabian Nights. It stayed true to the original and still managed to bring something new to the story. However, it set up a level that the rest of the film just couldn't match. Another song that was good was ""Speechless"", sung by Princess Jasmine. Finally Jasmine had her own solo number that showcased the strength and perseverance of her character. But it just didn't seem to work with the story. Jasmines character development, much like the other characters development, was rushed. This song just seemed shoved in there. Having said that, I really enjoy the song and I think it is a perfect reflection of her personality. But it didn't work within the context of this version of the story.<br/><br/>Now for the most disappointing segment of my little rant... JAFAR. A once mysterious and intimidating villain, with wit and cunning... becomes a whinging obnoxious toddler who didn't get what he wanted. I have nothing against Marwan Kenzari. He is a talented man with a bright future in film ahead of him, already being in many big titles. However, I don't think he was quite the right choice for Jafar. His acting was great, but the character he played is not Jafar.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was an absolute disappointment. Being a fan of the original, it was painful to watch and heartbreaking to listen to the soundtrack. I could go on for an eternity about why I hated this movie but I don't want to keep typing and I refuse to even address how pointless and terrible the character of Dalia was.<br/><br/>-Andrew"

","Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) has snuck out of the palace to be among her people. She gives bread to some young urchins but she has no money to pay. Street-wise thief Aladdin (Mena Massoud) comes to the rescue. Jasmine is destine to be married away to a prince. The Sultan's scheming advisor Jafar recruits Aladdin to retrieve a lamp and nothing else from the Cave of Wonders. He finds a magic carpet as well. Jafar takes the lamp and abandons him in the cave. Aladdin's faithful monkey Abu grabs the lamp and they escape on the flying carpet. He rubs the lamp and is shocked by the magic Genie (Will Smith) who gives him three wishes.<br/><br/>Disney has settled on this lucrative formula of remaking old animated classics into live-action films. It's safe. Families can take their kids. The IP is well-established. They have plenty of material in the Disney vault. It all makes sense as long as Will Smith is purple. The casting fits. The setting is CGI but reasonably real enough. There are no complaints about the production. A purple Will Smith comes with some issues but somehow he fits the role. I do have an issue with People sees what they want to see. It's a fine idea and there is a movie logic to it. What is missing is emotional logic. It's missing the narrative logic. The audience wants them to be in fantasy love. She has to recognize him right away. The movie does save it by her recognizing him quickly and him spinning the lie. The story needs to help her out a bit. Maybe, she doesn't recognize him right away because her encounter with him is during the dark of night and she didn't get a good look at him. In addition, he could be made into a Robin Hood character and he's hiding among the shadows deliberately. It's maybe asking too much to change the story but it shouldn't be set in stone. Quite frankly, I like the start of the movie and that's probably the biggest change from the animated movie. I've never been convinced about Superman either."

","Mrs. Shullivan and I are familiar with the earlier live and animated versions of Aladdin, but this version brings new life into the FAMILY ADVENTURE film which can be enjoyed in its purest form with all its spectacular color and escapism from your otherwise ho hum day.<br/><br/>Will Smith is a wonderful, magical and wise genie. The lead role of Aladdin is played to perfection by the relative newcomer Mena Massoud. Aladdin's love interest and excited passenger on his magic carpet is Princess Jasmine played by the multi-talented Naomi Scott. Their singing duets were also enjoyable.<br/><br/>This is definitely a family themed big adventure film, but it is also a classic DISNEY film that will definitely stand the test of time and when it is eventually released in the public domain, on whatever the current film format of the time may be, VHS, DVD, Blu Ray, 4K and/or 8K, I guarantee it will be enjoyed across the world in hundreds of different languages by young and old alike!<br/><br/>I hope you can ignore all the bad reviews (I assume it's Disney's competition and/or disgruntled former Disney employees) and I bet a dime to a dollar the same people wrote bad reviews on earlier Disney released too! Walt Disney would be very proud that the 2019 version of Aladdin bears his name. A PERFECT 10 out of 10 rating!!!"

","I watched twice already in Thailand with IMAX 3D. The movie so amazing. All characters are great I love all of them. They fit to the roll. The song are amazing also CG. (The trailer so boring to be honest not like the movie.)"
"molinagrn","5","9","19","28 May 2019"," A very pretty set. Little substance.
","Although, the movie isn't as bad as Beauty and The Beast (2017) it still holds being eye catching but kinda pointless and bland. I do think the build up to the death of Jasmine's mother, her being mixed-race, her being Sultan, Will Smith's performance are pretty good and interesting ideas but the whole play out very.. nothing.<br/><br/>Like mentioned in Chris Stuckmann's review, I agree that the problem with the set is that it is too pretty and detailed to interact with it's setting. I would've liked to feel the sandy and grittiness of the poverty shown. Aladdin and Jasmine's performances were honestly the least enjoyable. I did like the choreography Mena Massoud offers in the remake's version of ""One Jump Ahead"" and I did chuckle at Naomi Scott's reaction to the balcony scene and Jasmine joining in running from the guards, I even liked the song ""Speechless"" however, I don't really like most of the display of Jasmine in the movie.<br/><br/>When watching her in this, the passion and loveable sassy quips we got with the original Jasmine felt sucked out with Jasmine being displayed as very blank faced and not having many reactions. Even though I like the song 'Speechless', it didn't feel like an earned song and it felt kinda out of left field.<br/><br/>And similar issues with Aladdin, since there would be moments I couldn't feel the sly character he's supposed to be. He looked really awkward in this version's ""Prince Ali"" and even in his scene of meeting Jasmine in the market.<br/><br/>But, I think the worst is Jafar. I have a feeling why they made him the younger in the movie was to push the marriage/love interest conflict here without the creepy knowledge of the original Jafar being possibly in his 40's or 50's and seeking a 15 year old girl romantically, I get that but with this Jafar, the story and potential that could be used felt awkward with his acting in this. He tried to sound diabolocal but I thought it was wonky.<br/><br/>I think Will Smith was fine in the movie, he made the movie more enjoyable when viewing and when he was off, it often got boring. I do have a bit of a problem with Dalia, since she doesn't have much drive to be there and when she was on screen she seemed so awkwardly placed into it. I guess the Genie having a love interest and them paralleling as Aladdin and Jasmine's ""right-hand"" is cute but it doesn't really have substance for me to like it.<br/><br/>I would rate it a five out of ten. I will say, would recommend this more than Beauty and The Beast though, but don't come in too hopeful."

","Let me start by saying that the visuals of the movie were pretty stunning. The camera work was pretty great even chasing after Aladdin's parkour type running around. HOWEVER. There are times where you can tell that the video has been sped up. It's so obvious that it really takes away from the scene and just makes it an awful experience.<br/><br/>The music. I get that all Will Smith knows how to do is hip-hop. But this is a Disney movie and that is not needed here. The original songs are fantastic without needing any kind of revamping. If they really wanted to revamp any of the music then they could've taken a page out of the Broadway adaptation. Why did ""One Jump"" need the hip-hop in it? Will Smith wasn't even in that scene. It's just unnecessary and ruins the moment.<br/><br/>The autotune is so obvious that anytime someone is ""singing"" it sounds so flat and boring. The only person that could actually carry a tune is Jasmine. Aladdin's voice is so autotuned that it sounds like he's bored with what he's saying. There's no emotion in his voice. And Will Smith is just talk-singing the whole time. I will say that ""Prince Ali"" was excellent though.<br/><br/>Jasmine's new solo song is a great song, but the reprise is just unnecessary. It completely stops the flow of the film and does not belong.<br/><br/>All in all I would watch this film again, but it definitely did not live up to my expectations."

","Another year, another live-action remake of a Disney Classic. After global billion dollar box office-hit Beauty and the Beast, it didn't take long for Disney to announce another '90s animation was getting the treatment. Aladdin was released back in 1992, made history as being the first animated feature ever to gross more than $500 million and it was also the most successful film that year! This lead to numerous sequels and tv-shows, until now.<br/><br/>British director Guy Ritchie (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) is a bold choice to direct a musical, since he's better known for his more gritty comedies. But maybe we've been missing out on a hidden talent of his.. or maybe not! This is Ritchie's most ambitious project so far, and it will all depend on the success of Aladdin, if he'll ever get an opportunity like this again.<br/><br/>First of all, Aladdin has gained quite the fanbase over two generations of kids. So there's the nostalgia of the animated version they'll have to compete with. Second, a lot of media had reported on early set pictures that made everything look a bit too much Bollywood instead of keeping it more Middle Eastern. Was this project doomed from the start?<br/><br/>Going in with the lowest of expectations, might be the best chance this movie has to win over audiences. Aladdin is more of a ""retelling"" of the animated feature, co-written by Guy Ritchie himself. There are of course some similarities with the tale we're all familiar with, and this could cause for some fans to leave the cinema empty-handed when they don't see their favourite scene making it into this live action version. The story relies the most on its comedic timing in some of the dialogue to distract people from the horrid CGI that blurs the screen more than 80% of the time. You can also tell Ritchie is inexperienced in this genre and interrupts big musical dance scenes (who are by the way, clumsy in every way) with unnecessary comedic moments that then feels forced.<br/><br/>The other co-writer is John August (Dark Shadows), who was able to help flesh out Jasmine (Naomi Scott) a bit more, as she wants to become the next ruler of Agrabah. Another character that wants to steal the spotlight - but fails miserably - is Jafar (Marwan Kenzari). He's too one-dimensional to come across as a threat and let's be honest, not every cosplayer is an actor. Jasmine on the other hand is here to be shown as more than just a princess waiting to marry a prince. Scott sings two new ""female empowering pop ballads"" (written by The Greatest Showman song writers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) and is the true MVP of the entire film. She delivers the looks, has the acting (AND singing!) chops and commands your attention whenever appearing on screen.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud plays Aladdin, a humble thief turning into a hero. His chemistry with Scott is very natural. Will Smith is the one who everyone was so afraid of, to be portraying Genie, largely due to Robin Williams' memorable vocal performance. He's more known as a rapper, not a singer, but he makes this role his own, instead of trying to duplicate the animated version of his character. He delivers a distressed and comedic sophisticated Genie with a certain stage presence that'll make you laugh more than once. And even though you might've have thought Will Smith was painted blue, it looks like this character is almost entirely motion capture and copy-pasted into every scene. He floats on a cloudy legless lower body and looks as fake as the background.<br/><br/>Aladdin isn't a total disappointment, but one day that game of roulette will finish with a bang and end the cow that is ""Disney Classics"". Leave a classic as it is, it'll never be as good."

","I honestly wanted to hate this movie. I didn't want to give it a chance after the photos of Will Smith as Genie leaked. I thought it was going to be completely ridiculous. Well, I was wrong. This is yet another solid live screen adaptation to a Disney animated classic. Guy Ritchie did a fantastic job directing a multi-cultural cast of actors and actresses full-filling the roles of the main characters. As someone of Arabic descent who grew up reading One Thousand and One Arabian Nights, a collection of old Arab folk tales which included the story of Aladdin, I highly appreciated the fact that Disney did not ""white cast"" this movie and instead sought out a collection of multi-talented Arab, Indian, and Persian actors. The big question everyone has been asking is if Will Smith was able to fill the shoes of the late great Robin Williams. Well, while Robin Williams lent his voice to the role of Genie, Smith went beyond the voice acting. He was spectacular in his role as the Genie of the lamp, and mentor/guide to Aladdin and led his experience as a singer/dancer, comedian, and actor to the role. He took the silly mannerisms and comedic elements of Williams' Genie and infused them with what we've all come to know and love of The Fresh Prince, to bring the role of Genie to life. Overall this was a fantastic film. If you're a fan of Disney musicals, which have not been present for a number of years, you'll truly enjoy this film. It is one of the best versions of Aladdin, full of magical wonderment. It's colorful, entertaining, and absolutely beautiful. This is the first time that you will see the setting of Agraba. Overall, a standing ovation of Guy Ritchie, his cast, and his production team. Well done."

His stunts were marvelous and eye catching!
Noami Scott she played her all the scenes gracefully the shocking part was that she sang a song in this movie and her voice was so pleasingly beautiful.
And the one who never goes wrong when it's time for some entertainment its played by
will Smith(genie)who can make every wish possible! Woot woot!

"WillsFilms","5","8","17","29 May 2019"," Aladdin Is Not The Diamond In The Rough
","I can't say I had high hopes for this movie and it was what I expected; an inferior version of a classic movie made for a quick buck. Now, to be fair to this movie, there were quite a few things I liked. I loved Will Smith as the Genie. In every scene he was in, he stole the show. He had the energy and charisma that a lot of the cast was lacking. He was definitely the best part of the movie. I also really liked Jasmine, she was given a more compelling backstory and a bit more character than she had in the original film. This was helped by an amazing performance by Naomi Scott. The movie has fantastic visuals, showing beautiful landscapes of Agrabah.<br/><br/>However, there was a lot that I didn't like. First off, the CGi looks awful. For a film made in 2019 and a studio like Disney the CGI should look a lot better, but it just looks horrendous, especially towards the end. I also did not like the songs, (with the exception of Arabian Nights, which was wonderful) as they didn't have the energy that the songs in the original movie had. In the original, during Prince Ali, the Genie is and running around and changing form throughout the song. In the remake, he's just walking in a straight line throughout most of the song. There were also some bizarre changes to the lyrics to make the songs more modern and funny and they're just odd to me. I didn't mind Aladdin, but there was nothing new that Mena Massoud bought the role to differentiate himself from Scott Weinger's superior performance. Jafar, I did not like. Marwan Kenzari is not very good at capturing the menacing, intimidating nature of the character. His performance makes Jafar come across as more whiny than threatening. In the original, Jonathan Freeman had a cold, sinister voice that instantly made Jafar one of Disney's greatest villains. Kenzari just cannot deliever the magic that Freeman bought to the role. The movie also tries to make Jafar more interesting, by explaining that he was a former street thief that's tired of being second best to the Sultan. The problem is that that doesn't make what he's doing any less evil or make his actions any more justifiable. Iago was a huge disappointment. When I heard that Alan Tudyk had been cast, I was excited. Tudyk's a great comedic actor and he had to potential to be even better than Gilbert Gottfried. Instead, they just made Iago a normal parrot with no personality, wasting Tudyk's great talent.<br/><br/>In summary, I wasn't dissapointed by this movie, I got what I expected. I do not recommend this movie, it's average at best. It's just a soulless remake of a classic movie, made to make money, that lacks the energy, creativity and heart of the original."

It really isn't that good at all but its not the worst thing I have ever seen.

The Sultan has a lesser role, but nothing to complain.<br/><br/>The original songs were done excellently, I love to see that Arabian Nights was made longer, i love that song. The other ones, one can argue if the animated version is better or not, but I can believe that at least both are at the same level. The new Jasmine song ""speechless"", although being a good song, Naomi's voice is also very good, but I just didn't feel the arab style in it, it just have a generic pop style, what I love about Aladdin is that middle east style.<br/><br/>But maybe the biggest problem is Jafar, is not the actuation of Kenzari, he does a very good job on his part, but I also believe it was a total miscast, he doesn't look menacing, imposing, his voice is too soft, and is not strong enought for you to feel that Aladdin and Jasmine are in real danger, not even in the third act. This character needed to be a bigger menace to the heroes. Also I missed his disguise as an old man.<br/><br/>But even with its problems, is a very good movie that you will surely enjoy!"

"pulsar-16","8","4","7","8 August 2019"," I can tell you that I was satisfied.
","Growing up at home in the 90s with two younger siblings, Disney had it's spot on the top of the mountain as far as animated features went. And it's ambassador at the top of that mountain. ""Aladdin"".<br/><br/>Needless to say our whole family wanted it done well. We wanted a strong cast, loyalty to the material and music, as well a performance that did justice to one of Robin Williams' most iconic performances.<br/><br/>I can tell you that I was satisfied.<br/><br/>The live action remake of Aladdin is strong. Not perfect, but it's worthy of it's animated counterpart that was a part of so many families that are looking to past the story on to the next generation.<br/><br/>The story stars Mena Massoud as the title character, and Naomi Scott as Jasmine. The casting of Disney princesses will always come under scrutiny (see Emma Watson in the Beauty and the Beast remake) but Scott takes charge of the role with a powerful voice that really shines during the musical numbers. It's not a stretch to say it's her film.<br/><br/>Now we have to talk about the Genie.<br/><br/>Will Smith had the impossible task of following the late, great, Robin Williams' animated genie that remains to this day, one of the finest voice performances in history.<br/><br/>Director Guy Ritchie was right to let Smith make the role his own, while staying loyal to the original. His vocal aren't quite the same on songs like ""Friend like me"" and ""Prince Ali"" but they ""get over the net""<br/><br/>The special effects are first class Disney. Characters like Abu the monkey, Iago the parrot, and the Magic Carpet are wonderful and while the appearance of the Genie itself hasn't flown well with everyone, it's hard to imagine how they could have done it differently in a fashion that would have remained original.<br/><br/>All in all, Ritchie's ""Aladdin"" is fine. Capturing the magic of Disney animated classics is not an easy filmmaking feat but this is a carpet ride worth taking."
"schmidever","8","4","7","4 August 2019"," Much better than people say.
","I have seen most of the live action remakes and this one has got to be one of my favorites. Aladdin and Jasmine were well cast and fit perfectly into their roles. Will Smith did a good enough job as the genie---not trying too hard to be Robin Williams, but adding his own style to the character. The visuals were great and the songs were pretty much on par with the original. The song ""Speechless"" was a fantastic addition and just blew me away. Unlike **cough** The Lion King**cough** the movie was not just a book by book film, it was a nice retelling with new additions. The dancing choreography, the handmade Dalia, the genie-Dalia dynamic, speechless, more depth to Jasmines character and the different beginning are a few things that come to mind. The main weak links would be the miscast for jafar, the change to Iago( tho this could be a good thing depending whether or not you were a fan of the original loud mouth), and the climax of the movie. Other than that, this is a movie well worth your time."

"Icedooitle","6","22","63","24 May 2019"," Built-In Audience
","Much like a Tyler Perry movie, or Transformers instalment, Disney's new throng of live-action remakes was destined to have a built-in audience. The fate of the legacy was decided on the success of the first attempt, 2016's The Jungle Book. Jon Favreau created a familiar, but thankfully not a cut and paste remake that showed the potential of truly fantastic CGI. A single human interacted with a remarkably life-like world and any reticence I had about the necessity of its existence fell away. More than being a well-crafted exercise in technology, it was a plain good movie. The following year, Beauty and the Beast stepped up to the bar and it was decided then that quality would likely take a backseat to familiarity for future developments. A taken-for-granted audience was guaranteed, and with a library spanning 80 years, Disney films could now be repackaged and digitized to autopilot a franchise. For all its occasional charm, Guy Ritchie's Aladdin 2019 is continuing a tradition based more on the Disney brand than the Disney magic.<br/><br/>Much like Beauty and the Beast, I can only briefly describe how marginally Aladdin departs from the animated feature. If the nagging thought ""I've already seen this movie"" doesn't bother you, you're getting exactly what you came to see. The street-rat one jump ahead of the lawmen, the princess in disguise, the Cave of Wonder, it's all there, confined to a box that won't spoil a single pre-conceived notion.<br/><br/>Nobody can deny that Mena Massound embodies Aladdin like he fell seamlessly into a mold. Naomi Scott plays Princess Jasmine as if a casting agent was given the directions, ""Go find me a 25 year-year-old Sarah Michelle Gellar of Middle-Eastern decent,"" and find her they did. I don't know how much of themselves our two leads were allowed to bring to these roles, but I didn't feel much. When I first saw Will Smith in a pre-view, glowing blue and built like The Rock, I had to remind myself that there was no point in comparing anyone to Robin Williams. As Aladdin came to the second act, I was actually a little anxious to get to something that felt new. I can assure you Smith does not disappoint. Even while watching ""Friend Like Me,"" I wasn't hearing Robin Williams re-packaged, I was seeing a gamble pay off. Will Smith has his own musical style and incorporates that contagious personality into a new genie that could have gone horribly wrong.<br/><br/>Almost as severe as the initial pullback fans had of Will Smith as the Genie, was Marwan Kenzari as Jafar. The animated character's sharp features and measured delivery doesn't lend itself to a specific actor I can think of off-hand, but Marwan certainly isn't it. As much as I would welcome a fresh anything to the feature, forgettable is forgettable.<br/><br/>What we can mark as a successful new addition to the Aladdin soundtrack is Jasmine's powerful Speechless. I would not have checked Aladdin as needing a strong feminine anthem, but this one was built to impress. The story arc makes a more progressive turn than any preceding genesis of the story and sheer effectiveness beat out an eye-roll. The same cannot be said for the film as a whole. Favreau made such a strong statement with The Jungle Book that I can't imagine July's The Lion King will be anything less than incredible, but Aladdin seems to be a precursor to an upcoming decade of safe remakes that will transparently play a numbers game. I can only hope the magic comes back to Disney."

"msunando","8","16","45","26 May 2019"," It's pure magic
","Aladdin - if it's a Disney movie, there must be magic and Aladdin is no exception. Comparisons with the animation film are perhaps inevitable, but I would advise you to leave that baggage behind when you immerse yourself into this superlative experience. Replete with colour, VFX, high octane action and mounted on a lavish scale, this larger than life reproduction of the Arabian Nights tale directed by Guy Ritchie contain slight departure from the original story. But that only ensures that the narrative remains taut, crisp and concise.<br/><br/>The production values and glossy output are a treat to the eyes, albeit it's an all-American venture. Please don't try to look for the aesthetics or originality of the Arab culture as you are then likely to be disappointed. Aladdin is a pure commercial entertainer and let's take that at its face value instead of getting lost in the cultural or artistic debate.<br/><br/>The sets are jaw dropping. Shot largely in Wadi Rum (Jordan), the desert looks majestic. The palace, bazaars, local people complement the build of the story, which gets going from the very beginning and there's never a dull moment. Will Smith as the Genie is absolutely cracking - high energy, infectious in charm and his usual comic timing are all packaged into this tailor made role for him. Mena Massoud in the titular role is impressive too. I only thought that newbie Naomi Scott playing Princess Jasmine was far too Western for the role and has made no effort to adopt the Arabic accent or traits. Nevertheless, her chemistry with Mena Massoud is fantastic, offering a wave of freshness to the screen. Aladdin will be endearing to viewers of all ages, please don't write it off as a children's film. Go for it!"
"Chris12movies","10","16","45","22 May 2019"," I was hesitant but it ended up being so much fun!
","So I will admit... I bought into the hate that was circulating around about this movie. I definitely thought this movie was going to under perform but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie mostly stuck to the 1992 plot, with the satisfying addition of making Jasmine's (Naomi Scott) character come more to life and have a bigger voice. I just loved the new song ""Speechless"", a total banger. I loved the Bollywood and middle eastern feel to the movie, all the costumes and sets are so unlike anything we get in Hollywood these days. It was refreshing.<br/><br/>Will Smith's Genie, my initial main concern, was incredibly funny and the children will enjoy him just as much as my generation enjoyed Robin William's rendition.<br/><br/>Lastly, Aladdin played by Mena Massoud was just so charming and endearing. He really brought the titular role to life and I hope to see more from him in the future."

","I've had a very luke-warm relationship with ""liking"" Will Smith over the years. But this movie and it's Director were so very wrong on all counts.

He could have phoned in this performance and it would have been better.
I understand wanting to give lesser known actors more roles, but this was not the time do it. Very badly written, very badly acted, very badly done, period. It has nothing to do with putting it side by side with an animated film, either way, it failed, on so many levels. Not enjoyable or entertaining regardless of your age or bias."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","5","11 September 2019"," A laudable effort
","I'd say this is more like it. Aladdin is merely the latest in the recent long line of Disney live-action remakes. So far all of them have been disappointments. At least to yours truly. All so far have had at least a few redeeming qualities, but they have all paled in comparison to the originals. It's hard to turn animation to live-action, it seems. There's energy and vibrancy to animation, which Disney has always been a master of utilizing. And that energy doesn't translate very well when you need to be more realistic.<br/><br/>Which is why I think it was exactly the right call to hand this film over to Guy Ritchie. The man has been directing live-action animation films his whole career, frankly speaking. If there's something that has never been missing in his films, it's energy.<br/><br/>And I can safely say I like what he has done with his source material. This Aladdin pays homage to the original Disney animated film, but is confident enough to move past it, to extrapolate, to change things, to even improve. And while I still vastly prefer the original, I think this will be the first Disney live-action remake, which I will return to.<br/><br/>So what works? Well, as I already said, the film is not afraid to mix things up a little bit. It's still mostly the same story, but it's not identical. Jasmine's role, for one, has been expanded by a whole lot, which I find to be a great thing. The original Jasmine was a feisty thing, but she didn't have that much to do in the film, aside from being the love interest. Sure, she distracted Jafar at that one point, but that's about it. This Jasmine has much more of her own voice, her own part to play. And I like it!<br/><br/>Will Smith's Genie is also pretty different, a lot grumpier for one, which I also like. It would have been hard to beat Robin Williams, so I'm glad they didn't even try. Most of the extra run-time of this film compared to the original is spent with either Jasmine or Genie and they're all good, funny scenes.<br/><br/>So what doesn't work? Well, Jafar for one. I like the small hints we get at his backstory, but aside from that he's a much more subdued version of the original. And it's such a disappointment. The original Jafar was a magnificent villain, one of Disney's best. I guess they were afraid to go too over the top, but that's unfortunately exactly what was needed here. Something more bombastic and menacing. This guy says his lines very placidly, very calmly, very methodically. And it's just not that scary.<br/><br/>And while I applaud the film for trying for something similar yet different, there are moments in the film that are pretty much identical to the original film. They're also the moments I found myself caring the least about, because I had already seen them.<br/><br/>The film also isn't quite as interesting visually as the animated version. It looks amazing, don't get me wrong, but the more realistic look means that they can't go as over the top crazy as they did in the original. And that loss is felt.<br/><br/>Still, even though most of this review was spent comparing the film to its animated predecessor, I truly do feel that this is the first Disney live-action remake that can stand on its own two feet. It has the energy and creativity to awe its audience without the crutch of nostalgia. Kudos, Disney. You finally did it."
"cherold","5","3","5","30 August 2019"," painfully mediocre, except for the dance numbers
","Aladdin was, as best I can recall after all these years, a movie that didn't really get going until the genie appeared. The same can more-or-less be said for the sequel, although I'm inclined to say the movie never really gets going at all.<br/><br/>The first half hour is pretty bad. The young leads, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott, seem like solid touring company actors who aren't notable but can sing a little and dance a little and deliver their lines with a semblance of attitude. Marwan Kenzari is another dinner theater actor who imbues Jafar with all the ominous power of a testy assistant manager at The Gap.<br/><br/>There are also several new songs in that first half hour; they are all drab and mildly irritating.<br/><br/>And then the genie comes, and the songs from the original movie come, and it's ... mildly entertaining. Will Smith is okay as the genie, but neither he nor filmmakers manage to create the manic hilarity Robin Williams supplied.<br/><br/>The movie is surprisingly workmanlike coming from director Guy Ritchie, who one would have expected to at least shake things up a little. But while generally watchable, the only thing that really stands out is the dancing in several musical numbers. Choreographed by Leah Hill, they deserve to be in a much better movie."

"robert-rhys","5","3","5","26 May 2019"," Lots of style, but unfortunately no substance
","With all of Disney's storytelling experience, you'd think that they would be masters of film, but sadly Aladdin (2019) demonstrates that they have a lot left to learn. On the positive side of things, the musical performance scenes are both fun and exciting to watch with good performances from the cast. There's also an excellent storyline change from the 1992 animated version that has Jasmine in a stronger role as a woman as well as a head of state. Unfortunately the negative aspects of this production far outweigh the positive. The most glaring of these is the absolutely flat acting of Aladdin (Mena Massoud). He was jarringly painful to watch when speaking - especially in scenes with Jasmine (Naomi Scott) because there was just no chemistry between the two of them. Switching over to a more nuanced criticism, the script itself was highly disappointing. Disney had an immense opportunity to more deeply explore the Arabian folklore at the center of this story which would have more prominently pitted Aladdin's street smarts against Jafar's cunning. Instead, the writers (John August & Guy Ritchie) chose to downplay and trivialize this conflict which results in a very shallow, uninteresting story that must rely on its visual effects to get by when it could have been so much more."

","'Aladdin (2019)' is the first of Disney's live-action remakes I've seen. While it isn't bad, I will admit that it does seem a little pointless. It makes a few changes to the original story, mostly surrounding the character of Jasmine, and obviously reinterprets things through its own lens, but the foundation remains the same. Its superficial switch-ups seem just that: superficial. The stuff surrounding Jasmine is a nice touch, though. The film itself starts off pretty slow. It's not terrible, but it stumbles a bit and doesn't pick itself back up until the Genie is introduced. Of course, you do have to adjust to Smith's larger-than-life interpretation of the character - an issue that the 1992 feature also suffered with, albeit with a different actor. You have to adjust to the CGI, too, which slips into the Uncanny valley every now and then. When you've done this, however, the flick becomes rather entertaining, dipping into pseudo rom-com territory to pleasing effect. This portion of the piece is good enough that the somewhat lesser third act doesn't dampen the experience. I think this is primarily because it sees the successful completion of several previously established character arcs. Most of these are believable and rather fulfilling, though a couple seem to be somewhat artificial in the wider context of their characters. In the end, though, the movie is fairly fun. To be honest, the best thing about it is the music, which sticks in your head long after the credits have rolled. Most of the songs aren't new, though, which does further compound the fact that the whole thing is rather unnecessary. Also, some of the musical sequences are ripped straight out of the first 'Aladdin (1992)', almost shot for shot. Still, an entertaining time isn't to be balked at. I wish I could say it was better but... wait, I'm not going to waste a wish on that. 6/10"

","This film is really good, even though I have watched aladdin many times since I was a kid, this film was really nice to watch. Because it was not 100% the same and it kept you wondering about the ending.
Guy Richie is my favourite director and even though this totally different from his other movies,he nailed it. The colours,the scenery were amazing.
What I did not like is the feministic views that appear so strongly in this movie.
In the cartoon Jasmine did not want to become a sultan. In this movie she wants to be a sultan so bad that it is ridiculous.
I liked will smith as jinnie ,he was really good at his role.
I did not like tha casting for Jaffar, because he never looked as scary as jaffar was. Jaffar is a super villain,they should cast someone who gives you the chills."
"turdymac","Null","4","8","7 August 2019"," Are people serious?
","This movie was an example of the deflated expectations of film and a PRIME example of how Disney and Hollywood is exploiting the stupid generation. Is this film good? Absolutely not. In fact it was a film relegated to an audience of idiots. Anyone who simply eats anything that has a Disney stamp on it. Look, I didn't enjoy the original but this was just completely sad. The performances were lifeless (including Smith who I actually like aside from this because he was just bad), the duets were horrible, the general acting was pathetic (no chemistry at all) and the parrot...yes the parrot. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? There are no redeeming qualities to this people. You want Aladdin, watch the original (which I don't like either) it's way better than this mess."
"BatStarIndyFreak","8","4","8","28 July 2019"," Better than the Original
","The original has AN EDGE with Robin Williams' brilliant, comedic, perfectly cadenced, impression-filled voiceover performance, but overall, I have to give THE EDGE to this better packaged version. While Smith doesn't manage to match Williams' charm, his portrayal of the Genie is more than satisfactory, bringing his own approach to fast-talking, and his ""jive"" charm to the equation.<br/><br/>What makes all the difference here is the more fleshed out story, and the more fleshed out characters. The stakes carry a broader spectrum to make the peril much heavier. Then when you look at Aladdin, Jasmine, Jafar, and yes, the Genie, you see so many more layers, and greater relatability than before. I am by no means done watching the original, anymore, but I am now much more likely to be in the mood for the remake---a rarity for me."
"bangel3322","8","4","8","3 July 2019"," Better than expected
","Of course I'm a huge fan of the cartoon. And I feel this stayed true to the cartoon but managed in my opinion to excel it. My only problem with it is that the actor who played Jafar didn't sell it. It's a big character to play and I don't think he lived up to it. The Jasmine character was good, beautiful girl and great singer, but still could have had a better actress. The actor who plays Aladdin was absolutely brilliant. He really embodied the character adding a lot more humour which was great. And what to say about Will Smith? I thought he was excellent. He never tried to copy Robin Williams portrayal of the genie, he made it his own while still capturing all the genie's traits. And I like they slightly changed the story of the genie a little bit. And let's give props to the character Dahlia. Absolutely hilarious.
Funnily enough I didn't want to watch this, my daughter dragged me to the cinema to watch it, but I ended up loving it more than she did."

","I love Alladin by Disney. This is my Disney movies. Can't wait for two and three. It was 100% Disney majic. They nailed it down. All the story from the movie I grew up with was there. Jasmine was a strong and powerful woman at the moment it made the difference, she defeated Jafar in his first two wishes and fooled him to destroy himself. Alladin's wishes were true, and Jafar's were a lie. The whole movie was beautiful there is an Easter egg hunt in the footage. It was great."
"neoclone07","7","4","8","22 June 2019"," Not bad... but far from the original
","When I first saw images from what would be a live action recap of Alladin with Will Smith as the genie I didn't have the greater of expectations. I thought it would be dull, unnecessary and that ol'prince of Bel Air would ruin his career (which is not in great shape for him since the poor After Earth). Most people thought the same as me, arguably regarding Will's blue role, as he would be no match for the late Robin Williams. I was not planning to go see it at the movie theater but when positive reviews started to come out (to my surprise) I thought I should go and check it for myself.
The movie actually isn't that bad but is also far from being such a gem like its cartoon counterpart. It has some great moments and a few things here and there were rearranged to meet nowadays perspectives, most notably the fact that Jasmine fights for her freedom despite the fact shes's a princess, due to his overprotective father. She strugles to show that she's a strong woman, capable of staying ahead of her country as ruler and achieve a higher life quality for the inhabitants of Agrabah.
Aladdin is very well portraied but he's not great, as was with the animated Aladdin. Jaffar was an iconic, insidious and nefarious character in the original version and the new one presented himself way lower than the animated one. I guess that occurs because the animated Jaffar is such a cliche figure with his voice, face, and all his tone while the live action version has no soul. He doesn't seem evil or cunning. And against all odds, Will Smith nails his perfomance as the Genie. He's off course a different genie than the one Robin portraied, but by no means is inferior. He's just... him, ina different tone.
The first and second acts are ok, there are really some moments but as the movie develops, it becomes more and more uneffective as narrative. At some point, some actions simply had no sense at all and you ask yourself where is that cool atmosphere of the beginning.
All in all is a good movie and some good entertainment if you are new to the tale.If you're like me and watched the 1992'´s version, you will enjoy the movie though without having a strange feeling of something was lacking."
"Reckno64","7","4","8","12 June 2019"," Honestly, way better than expected!
","Despite all the negativity surrounding Will Smith as the genie, he did a fantastic job overall! This remake sure didn't need to be made, but for what it's worth it was a decent remake with a great score and great effects. And Will Smith just killed it as the genie man. I enjoyed every moment he was on screen. I would like to think Robin Williams would be proud of his performance. :)"
"Fd-Up-Squirrel","10","4","8","9 June 2019"," Better than expected, but ...
","I was dreading the idea of watching this.. one of my favorite movies of all time wasn't looking to be making the transition to live action worth my while... the film proved me wrong.. but it did do something previous remakes didn't.. make me question why it was necessary
The bad: Will Smith's Genie has his moments.. but definitely not when he's singing... but he's not too far behind the leads.. Aladdin is flat and can barely reach the notes and although Naomi Scott shines the brightest, her vocals just can't reach the quality of the Score..
The Good: Visually incredible.. lavish sets, gorgeous costumes, and special effects bring the magic to life. The story tweaks work well, the cast, aside from singing, do a fantastic job of bringing the classic characters to life<br/><br/>But outside of the incredible score, upgraded to an epic degree by Alan Menken.. very little of the movie really justifies why it needed to be made. This could be said about the remakes that preceded.. but they offered enough to keep me from questioning their existence. I still look forward to coming remakes, but they do need to start finding their own identity."

","Spoiler Alters: Don't listen to the critic and go and enjoy this magnificent film.
I just came from watching this magnificent film and will see it again in the theaters at least one or two more times like I did the original animated version. I applaud Guy Ritchie for his exceptional direction. I thought Will Smith was phenomenal as the genie He is marvelous in the film and a perfect choice for the role of the genie. I must say I feel the same way across the board about the cast choices for Aladdin, Jasmine, Jafar, The Sultan, with the wonderful addition of the character portrayed by Nasim Perdad. I truly thought this might be a challenge to bring to a live action version and I am blown away with this film. There was not one part I thought was out of place from the original and I absolutely loved the minor changes to the story. I always felt that Jasmine was one of the first Disney ""Princesses"" portrayed as a strong character and to not be looking for a man or ""prince charming"" to save her. The Jasmine in this film is even more independent and has a beautiful added that are very inspiring about giving herself a voice and no one was going to stop her. I loved how the film began and ended (one again spoiler alerts) with the genie living a wonderful life of freedom with his family with the new additional character of Dahlia. Brilliantly executed on all levels and extraordinarily entertaining. I laughed and I cried and I left the theater with the anticipation of seeing Aladdin again within the next week. My favorite Disney animated film transformed into a spectacular live version. My sincere thanks and appreciation to the entire cast and crew."

She's a strong, tempered woman that pushes to lead her people while having her feet swiped by Prince.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud is the weakest of the main cast, but still gives a nice performance.<br/><br/>I loved Nasim Pedrad. She brought and extra dose of comedy which was very well done.<br/><br/>What's really dissapointing is Marwan Kenzari as Jafar. At no point does he seem powerful or even menacing. More like a spoiled brat.<br/><br/>Still, the movie delivers. The costumes are great, the photography, the singing, the music, the setting. Only the CGI genie falls short, but its still fine.

At times it felt like an original movie that was based on the animated movie, but in the best way possible! I get confused when people say it didn't add anything new or it was too much like the original. Coming from a huge fan of the original, this was NOT a copy and paste of the animated. It took what made that movie good and made it great as well as taking other aspects and changing them to make it better.<br/><br/>The music was simply amazing, Alan Menken took all the songs that we loved and made them fit perfectly with this new Genie as well as adding some new music that made Jasmine so much better than her animated countrtpart."

I left the cinema with a smile on my face & humming the tunes-exactly what I want from a Disney film."
"CubsandCulture","10","5","11","4 June 2019"," Deeply surprising in how enjoyable it is.
","Disney live action remakes of classic animation are often re-worked to respond to criticism lobbed at the films over the decade. (or in the case of Dumbo criticism lobbed at Disney generally). This reached peak absurdity in Beauty and the Beast where the live action film went out of its way to try to respond to every bad faith criticism anyone ever made. (i.e. trying to explain why the servants were also punished, does Belle suffer from Stockholm Syndrome? etc.) Aladdin doesn't quite escape this tendency but it largely ignores some of the really bad hot takes that exist around the film I.e. This fantasy land isn't very much like the Middle East, Why did Aladdin get punished for Abu's mistake? Etc. The changes they made to the story-aging up Jasmine and giving her more to do, giving the Genie more agency in the climax/story, a complete re-write of Arabian Nights-felt germane and organic to the story. Most are neutral, and a few were for the better. (I like the part the Genie plays in the climax much more). It really felt like the same story.<br/><br/>It is for this reason the film is very entertaining. The technical aspects are utterly gorgeous. The film is a charming take on setting and the film is as delightful for the senses as such classics as The Thief of Baghdad. The musical sequences land and the cast does a great job with the songs. Richie directs everything with evident glee and everyone is clearly having fun. I must say that Massoud is just perfect for the role. He is sexy, charming and embodies the diamond in the rough.<br/><br/>The big question, of course, is WIll Smith. I like his Genie and they wisely stayed away from trying to replicate Williams. Smith's Genie is entirely his own. He seemed to be channeling his Fresh Prince persona for the role. It works. The character is not as iconic, powerful, or humorous as Williams' turn but it is no mere serviceable stand in either. Smith makes the character his own and you stop thinking about Williams about 5 minutes after he shows up.<br/><br/>This is a fun film. One of the better Disney live action remakes."

The movie was cute and funny, and really, what more could you ask for?"
"spykdabarstud","4","2","3","20 January 2020"," Unnecessary and poorly executed.
","The original Aladdin has been a favourite of mine for many years. It's got a brilliant mix of humour, action, and morality, in a wonderfully crafted and voiced presentation. Sadly, the same cannot be said for Guy Richie's love action version. From the very offset, we are treated to changes that lend nothing more to the story, and just feel as if they were added to be different just for the sake of it. Add to that, said changes are created from merely average CG, something we wouldn't generally expect from a company like Disney, where the best has always been their natural go to, when animation is concerned.
The classic songs are rehashed in a way that makes them feel somehow less, in every sense. Less competent, less feeling, less needed. Even the orchestra or instruments behind them feel empty, actually sounding smaller, and more amateur, nowhere near on the level of the original versions.
The CGI on the Genie is particularly bad, with the characters face feeling as though it's floating over flat-painted head and body, and eyes that are completely soulless. Smith is the funniest part of this movie, but Both his comedic and his musical timing are somehow nowhere near as well executed as the performance given by the late Robin Williams.
The same can be said for characters like Abu the monkey, and Jago the parrot (originally Hysterically voiced by Gilbert Godfried). Again, poor computer generated imagery is mixed with new versions of these characters that are completely dumbed down. No longer are there conversations between the now twenty-something, short and clean-cut Jaffar and his winged-confidant, Jago, who is now just meant to be a normal parrot, with no more intelligence than the next. All the comedy and charm has been wrenched from the character for no apparent reason, and were left looking at something poorly created and adding nothing to any scene it's in. The exact same can now be said of Alladin's personal sidekick, Abu, who is now meant to be a regular monkey. Why Disney couldn't use a real monkey and parrot for these characters, given the choices they made to remove their personalities, will forever remain a badly- made mystery.
Speaking of which, the Royal Viseur, Jaffar is now a young man, that commands no on-screen presence. His wardrobe is standard black garb, unlike the animated characters, which have him a tall, commanding look, and his age os always a distraction, given that this young man is the advisor to the Sultan of Aggrabah. It's puzzling throughout, and even his hypnosis of the characters just seems tacked-on, at best. The once commanding and menacing voice of a devious, evil power commander, is now replaced by an average sounding young gentleman (who does actually act very well, but just seems miscast). You make think ""okay, but this is Disney. There's no need to look at the seriousness of this'd or any other role."" and you'd usually be right, but the single-minded villainy of Jaffar, his only goal really to be to get the lamp and rule the world, is now replaced by a man that is actually talking about military tactics, and is hell-bent on attacking the homeland of the Princesses late mother, although, we are never treated to the reason behind this.
Ultimately, I feel this is where the live action version has lost itself. It doesn't know itself if it is a heart-warming family tale or, if it is a serious dramatic love story, with some songs thrown in.
Of all this, the most offending part of the movie is the assumption that the audience will not notice that, in order to not be tarnished with the term ""white-washing"", the studio have cast Pretty much anyone as Arabian, even lending a Bollywood tone to musical numbers. This is all well and good, but it's like they assume the western audience can't tell the difference between Indian and Arabic, and simply wont notice that the two are very different cultures and ethnicities, and we'll ultimately be too distracted by the on-screen shenanigans to care. This is one of the most insulting versions of racism, when really boiled down. Cast anyone as the Arabians. It's not like anyone will care.<br/><br/>All in all, the live action Aladdin is a movie that already feels dated, and out of touch, and most people will still be reaching for the original Disney movie above it."
"questl-18592","4","2","3","20 January 2020"," 'Laddin
","So far, I haven't enjoyed any of the Disney Live Action Remakes and this absolutely isn't going to change that. It's just unnecessary. It's the same movie, just without the perfect original cast, the cartoonish whimsy or the thinly veiled racism.<br/><br/>Ok, that last one isn't a terrible thing to lose, and the cast isn't entirely awful. The new Aladdin and Jasmine do quite well, actually, they look the part and sound great. Jafar is ruined though. In the original, he was a manipulative, wicked yet smooth monster and in this he's just so sniveling and whiny. So not intimidating or fear inducing.<br/><br/>Then there's Will Smith. Easily the biggest name here and, honestly probably one of the best contemporaries around that could play the genie. He's got swagger, a sense of humor and he's musical. I absolutely see why the studio would pick him. He's no Robin Williams though and frankly can't even compete, but he tries.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with this movie, aside from the whole ""it's pointless to make a shot for shot remake of an existing classic"" thing that bothers so many, myself included. No, my biggest issue is the anachronistic change to Jasmine. Disney goes out of their way to empower the character, which I'm all for Female empowerment but this movie takes place in like 8th Century in a Middle Eastern country. People still have their hands chopped off for pickpocketing here, as evidenced in one of the first songs. So while I'm totally on board with female empowerment, back then it really didn't feel realistic. Have her toss him out for lying to her or something rather than rewriting history.<br/><br/>Anyhow, that just bugged me. Don't try to force modern ethics and sensibilities into a period piece movie. Of course the movie also features a genie, magic carpet and elephant monkey so... maybe I shouldn't take it so serious?"
"Olicosmic","7","2","3","5 January 2020"," Distinct enough to work for the most part
","(I give this a 7.4, but a 7 works fine)<br/><br/>Disney sure seems oddly content with making remakes nowadays, and while it can sometimes work, there are times where the only thing the remake will do is wonder about it's existence. While I can understand how some may feel that way with this film, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't surprised with it. After watching the incredibly dull remake of ""The Lion King"" (which I saw before this), I was worried. The original film is one of my childhood favorites, and to see that be poorly remade would hurt. Thankfully, that's not entirely the case here. The performances were all spot on and awesome, which helped give new life to classic characters. Sure, the likes Jafar and the Sultan seem to be different characteristically than their animated counterparts, but it's not enough to ruin them in any way. The music, overall, is also fantastic, as it's not only classic, but it's got its own style that helps it be its own thing. Speaking of, Will Smith's portrayal of the Genie was shockingly great, and while no performance would be anywhere near as iconic as Robin Williams version of the genie, Will Smith, as well as the writing surrounding the character, does a great job in bringing something familiar, yet fresh to the table. I also appreciate how the writing in this film, while true to the original, mixes a few things up a bit, such as Jasmines friend wanting to be with the genie, as well as Jasmine wanting to do what's best for herself. While that's all well and good, this film still suffers from a few problems. One of them being the pacing. The original always had a somewhat simple story, and this film is no different. However, there are times where the film can feel a bit stretched out, whereas the original never had this problem. A few minor characters, such as Iago and the sultan have way less characterization than the 1992 film. Iago is now a normal evil parrot that can sometimes shape-shift at the end, and the sultan has very little backstory, which is somewhat disappointing, since both of them were far more interesting and memorable in the original. The CGI is good, but not the best I've seen in a Disney live action film. It's all gorgeous, colorful, and lively, but they didn't quite look as real as they feel like they should be. It still worked well enough, but there were times where the CGI stuck out more than it would've if it were handled a little better. Again, far from bad, but something still worth noting. Overall, this movie is a bit harder to digest than the original for more than one reason, but I give it major credit for having its own identity. Sure, a lot of the things have been recreated, but never to the point that it seems pointless. I was still invested because of how distinctive it is and how well everything that worked was executed. It's beautiful, faithful, and often flawed. While this isn't quite as fun as the original, it's still a good time that's distinct enough to work for the most part. It's nothing essential, as the original is still far superior, but it's got enough magic to be a good remake, making this an easy recommendation for those with an open mind."

","The only casting in this movie that was even decent was Naomi Scott's Jasmine. Her portrayal of Jasmine felt (if I remember correctly) relatively faithful, and more than anyone else she was the only one who felt like she belonged in the movie's world, if only barely. Mena Massoud's Aladdin felt like he was putting on a broadway show (and only being decent at it) rather than portraying a live action character. Marwan Kenzari's Jafar looked like he was bored out of his mind and wanted to go home, and lacked the energy and emotion of the original Jafar. Plus, he didn't even get to sing ""Prince Ali (Reprise)"". Will Smith was decent as the Genie but his casting was a huge mistake. He had Will Smith's charisma, but too much of what he did was just Will Smith being Will Smith. Nasim Pedrad's Dalia added nothing meaningful to the story (Genie did NOT need a love interest), and worse yet, overacted everything. In general, the cast lacked the energy, heart, charm, and charisma of the original versions. If they'd replaced it with something meaningful, this would be a different story."

From voices, to jokes, to improve & even singing Will would be a 1 to Robin's 10. Infact because I like Will Smith his performance in Aladdin made me realize just how great & unparalleled performer Robin Williams was. And then Disney tries to make Jasmine much more woke but instead makes her much more weak. The original Jasmine was adventureous & unafraid & this one is scared to do the same things. Oh but she can be sultan so it is okay I guess."

The negatives are simple in the technique of cgi because it was bad at the stage and immature at another stage, which I hope will end soon.<br/><br/>Before I finished, I tried to ignore all the negative points of the film. It is related to women and their role. Honestly, it was the most powerful negativity of the film, which I do not think it needed.

Genie's character was an absolute delight! Will Smith did an amazing job encapsulating the genie's grandiose personality while bringing his own fabulous spin to the character. He was the hightlight for me in this entire movie. I even thought Jasmine's character arc was more compelling and enjoyable. BUT the movie is called Aladdin, he was the only thing it actually does not have enough of. Alladin had no personailty, he was barely a character in his own movie. He lacked conviction, bravery, streetsmarts and devilish (yet loveable) charm. This is not an Aladdin movie at all unfortunately, and I was terribly disappointed to see that."

"r96sk","8","1","1","19 April 2020"," I'm a fan
","I'm a fan of 2019's remake of 'Aladdin'. It isn't as great as the original from twenty-seven years prior, though it does a fine job nevertheless.<br/><br/>Will Smith is no Robin Williams obviously, but no-one would ever have met the extremely high standards that Mr. Williams set as Genie. Smith does well, I enjoy his humour and overall performance in this.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud is very likeable as the titular character, I think he brings more life to Aladdin than Scott Weinger does from 1992. Naomi Scott is excellent as Jasmine, who is miles more developed in this production.<br/><br/>Now for the elephant in the room: Jafar.<br/><br/>Marwan Kenzari, if I only judge his performance, is more than satisfactory. However, he simply has to be judged based on Jonathan Freeman's version of the antagonist. Kenzari's Jafar is nowhere near as fearsome and devilish as he should be, I'm never uneasy when he appears here.<br/><br/>Away from the wannabe Sultan, I would've liked to have seen more of Abu and, especially, Iago - who should've been voiced by Gilbert Gottfried by the way. On the other hand, Navid Negahban is decent as Jasmine's father.<br/><br/>Overall, despite some iffy CGI and editing, it makes for entertaining viewing. The music, although changed, is as fun as before (I also liked Jasmine's new song, 'Speechless'). I've seen lesser remakes, that's for sure."
"angelicakeith","10","1","1","16 April 2020"," Holds its own.
","This movie holds in own in time. It is not the original but compared to a lot of the live action movies, it keeps the fire of the originals. The songs don't lack the passion that a lot of the new live actions do. Also, the new songs give the characters added substance. The Genie's performance is Will Smith's. Its not meant to be Robin Williams'. He left giant shoes to fill...but Mr. Smith does a spectacular deliverance with his own flare. Overall, each character delivers dynamic performances in their own ways. For a remake over 20 years later, with live actors, this movie deserves it's place in the sun."
"ixnsjssjsnrbdks","9","1","1","8 April 2020"," One of Disney's best remakes so far
","First things first, I grew up in the 90s, Disney was a solid staple in my diet being brought up with Aladdin, Mulan, beauty and the beast and the lion king etc.<br/><br/>Let's start with Will Smith as the Genie - Of course he had giant shoes to fill as he was essentially taking Robin Williams role, no-one on god's green earth could bring Robins unique talent to Genie but Will bought his own and it worked. Come into this film with a open mind and don't expect like for like with the animated version and you'll enjoy Will aswell. He took Genie and made the character his own. He did the impossible and soon I stopped comparing him with Robins Genie.
Will is a fresh take and it works wonderfully.<br/><br/>
The cast for Aladdin and Jasmine also worked well, again I was sceptical with the animated version that I grew up with and watched with my own child at the back of my mind, but I was again soon dragged back into this version and of course no-one can bring animated to live action fully without the over use of CGI and then the masses would complain still.<br/><br/>People need to remember the magic of the movies that we grew up with and what made them great and re-watchable, Disney has of course missed the mark in previous attempts (I'm looking at you Lion King).<br/><br/>
Guy Ritchie brings his unique touch to the film and the style is vaguely his. He didn't over do it but he didn't under do it either he balanced the style perfectly in my opinion.<br/><br/>
Back to Genie I was of course with many Aladdin fans when the trailer showed Will Smith as blue genie and I watched the film prepared to be disappointed but I was pleasantly surprised instead.<br/><br/>The only con in the entire film is Jafar. While Marwan Kenzari is a decent enough actor he's just not evil enough for the role. I feel another actor could have taken Jafar higher in terms of villainy. His performance just didn't bring that evil feeling even at the peak of his role where he could have pushed it that extra mile it fell short. That being said the film is still one of the best animation to live action remakes I've seen so far.<br/><br/>Overall I'd happily watch this remake again willingly and not just because it's on and I can't be bothered to turn over. It does justice to the animated classic. Those of you who have judged on the trailers alone need to clear that and remember not all things found in animation can be brought to reality. Please watch this movie with an open mind and I promise you will find it enjoyable and a good homage to your childhood"

","I found this movie interesting. It was enjoyable - Aladdin. I liked it. It's pretty much the same as the original though I still noticed some differences. I wouldn't say it was as good as the original - no way! The original Aladdin or the animated version was superior.<br/><br/>The ending in this Aladdin was different compared to the original. I actually didn't like the ending for this one. It was ordinary. It could've been better.<br/><br/>The music was pretty much the same or similar as the cartoon version of Aladdin. I like the song/music Princess Jasmine was singing towards the end of Aladdin. I enjoyed listening to that. The song is called ""Speechless"". It's a great and wonderful song.<br/><br/>The cast was brilliant. I liked Aladdin and Jasmine in this one. Both were excellent choices.<br/><br/>The story was pretty much the same. Aladdin goes in that cave to search, find and retrieve that magic lamp. That was important because that magic lamp grants you three wishes. That was my favourite part of the movie though I prefer one in the original better. Nice to see the magic carpet too - I like the magic carpet in Aladdin.<br/><br/>When it comes to the movie, the thing I was looking forward to was seeing the Genie. The Genie was played by Will Smith. He was excellent as the Genie; in fact, I was actually surprised by Will Smith's performance. He was one of the reasons why this movie, Aladdin, was enjoyable along with the people that played Aladdin and Jasmine. Like I said, the cast that were chosen was excellent. It was pretty much spot on. I liked Will Smith as the Genie. He was cool and funny. It was the Genie that made this movie a success. The Genie wishes to be ""free"" you know, and that's what happened.<br/><br/>The movie made over a billion at box office which was good to see and deservedly so. It's a record I think.<br/><br/>The most interesting character of all, Jafar, was in this movie. Jafar, as the villain, was fine. The only thing I didn't like about Jafar was that he didn't look anything like the one in the animated version. I did like Jafar's Snake Staff. I always wanted to own one as a child.<br/><br/>I actually have the calendar of this Aladdin movie at home. I have it displayed on the wall. It looks really good. That shows how much I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The most interesting of the lot was that Parrot - Iago. He looked and sounded nothing like the one in the animated version. I was disappointed by that. Iago is one of the reasons why Aladdin is enjoyable. In the animated version, Iago has a personality. In this one, he doesn't have one.<br/><br/>Abu, however, Aladdin's pet was fine. Looked exactly the same as in the animated version. Let's not forget other characters such as Hakim and Razoul. They're important characters found within Aladdin. I liked them in the animated version better still.<br/><br/>Basically, Aladdin was still a fine and good movie. I found it to be enjoyable, and it's something you can enjoy watching again, but I still think the original one was still the best. It would've been great had it been an exact copy of Aladdin. I think they made a mistake with some of the changes.<br/><br/>However, I won't mind at all if there is a sequel to this Aladdin movie in the future. I think it will be a good sequel especially if it's about the return of Jafar. I really liked that movie or sequel. Happens to be one of my favourite Disney sequels."
"TheHesleyHood","4","1","1","11 March 2020"," A Whole New World - Unfortunately . . . . .
","The year is 1992, Disney's Aladdin film has been a massive hit for the studio. A great story and catchy musical numbers. I film loved by many and I personally remember getting this on VHS (that was a thing back then) and watched it time and time again.
Unfortunately like many of Disney's new live action remakes to date this is not one that you will be in a rush to repeatedly watch. It just simply does not have the same soul and playfulness of the animated original. Don't get me wrong they have done well with how the action was created and the cgi was top notch as you would expect with the quality of a studio like Disney but it is just missing a little something and I can not quite put my finger on what currrently.
I saw nothing in this entire film that was better than the original, too much auto-tune and far too much Will Smith. I know that Robin Williams was going to be a tough act for anyone to follow but honestly he just does not possess the playfulness the was so engaging from Williams enigmatic genie of yesterday's year.
Simply this is an ok film for a new generation but I would stress that anyone who is a fan of the original should set themselves up for disappointment.

"snowfre","5","1","1","11 March 2020"," One again, Disney remade a film despite no one asking for it
","The original ""Aladdin"" film by Disney is praised and beloved by many. It also features one of the most memorable performances of the late, great comedian Robin Williams as the Genie. As with the case with other recent Disney remakes, these factors make Guy Ritchie and John August's remake having a lot of expectations. The film follows the original storyline quite closely but compared to the also very recent ""Lion King"" remake, the originality of the ""Aladdin"" reimagining is bigger, though very limited. Overall the cast makes a good job despite the film's main issue of staying interesting when we all the know the story. Will Smith is of course true star of the film and he makes a good part playing the Genie, although he never reaches the brilliance of beforementioned comic mastermind. Ritchie's ""Aladdin"" adaption relies heavily on its visuals which are grand, vibrant, and colorful; but I'm asking for a lot more. In a time where veteran filmmakers criticize the many superhero movies' likeness to each other, if there is anything I'm tired of it is the many Disney remakes that we've been fed with the last couple years. ""Aladdin"" and the other Disney animated films are timeless classic, if the studio was only interested in reviving people's interest for these characters a rerelease of the original would be enough. Another multimillion-budgeted uninspiring revamp is not."

Even trying hard to forget the brilliant original this movie is exceptionally poor in many ways:<br/><br/>The beginning has absolutely no character development and we are thrown into the main storyline without really knowing how we got there.<br/><br/>While no-one could compare to Robin Williams as the Genie, Will Smith delivers absolutely no magic in this magical role.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part is bland."
"sebastianschlicht","1","1","1","23 February 2020"," As expected: A painful remake without meaning and soul!
","Guy Ritchie (he made both Sherlock Holmes films with Robert Downey Jr.) released the remake of ""Aladdin"" in 2019. A film that nobody asked for! But Disney does not hesitate to reissue the last cartoon from the Renaissance period with spectacular CGI effects and no soul. Disney's remake trend has certainly left no trace. Some think it's great, many others hate the direction the megacorporation is taking. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was too much for me, even if I liked ""Cinderella"" and ""The Jungle Book"". But the last two films have brought at least some new aspects into the story. But now Disney is not only trying to recreate its original films one-to-one as ""real films"", they even use the same music ... It is just sad and especially from the group that was known in the 20th century for trying new things. Walt Disney himself would surely turn around in the grave! That's why my wife and I actually wanted to avoid these Disney remakes from now on and not leave any money at the box office, but due to a Disney presentation at their university (on the topic of Jafar), she was almost forced to do it and I didn't want to leave her alone ... And when the film was over, we could hardly believe it!<br/><br/>The story should be known: The young street thief Aladdin falls in love with the princess Jasmin, who lives in her palace as if she was locked up. But the evil grand vizier Jafar wants to become the new sultan and uses the innocent Aladdin to get a magic lamp ...<br/><br/>Almost needless to say that I still love the cartoon and think it's great. The music, the characters, everything is so wonderfully done. Even worse, Disney really thinks you need a remake of this almost perfect film. But above all, ""Aladdin"" is still the newest of all remakes (1992 in America), it should be remembered very well by many. But who cares? Money!!! I start with the positive, because there is one aspect of the film that was good for me: Will Smith.<br/><br/>So many made fun of his look as a jinni, but Smith was a very good choice for me. Sure, Robin Williams will always be unbeatable, but Smith actually got his own touch on the character and was by far the best actor with fun and energy.<br/><br/>But that's it ... Mena Massoud as Aladdin is terrible, Naomi Scott as Jasmin is at best passable, and Marwan Kenzari as Jafar pale and boring! But I'm sure the biggest problem is the script. As with ""The Beauty and the Beast"", the creators here try to incorporate new story elements in order to artificially inflate the story and, above all, make the film longer. Films like ""Cinderella"" from 2015 did that in places, but in my eyes parts of the story were expanded there that didn't work so well in the original. Here at ""Aladdin"" people thought they wanted to make great moments and scenes even better. One does without important little moments in which characters question or even regret their decisions and actions (there was a similar problem in the remake of ""The Beauty and the Beast""). Instead, the whole film looks like a ticked-off list of the most important moments. No matter how, the main thing is that Aladdin gets the lamp. No matter how, but the main thing Jasmin falls in love with him. WHATEVER, but Jafar must be evil. It is a tragedy!<br/><br/>Moments like Jasmin's new songs were particularly aweful. Her final song, in which time is stopped, was the low point: a forced and weak attempt to swing the feminism club. It was clear from the beginning that Disney would mess up the figure of jasmine in this film, but that really surprised me. I guess in the upcoming remake of ""The Lion King"" Nala will sing a song at some point in the film that there can also be queens ...<br/><br/>But in the course of the film it became more and more clear that this is actually an animated film. A lot of things just don't fit into a live-action-film, for the same reasons why the filming of ""Dragon Ball"" was such a disaster. The exaggerated but charming character design has completely disappeared, which is why many characters seem so soulless and lifeless ...<br/><br/>I could go much further, but let's blaspheme about the music: Wow! What a certificate of poverty. I've already mentioned that Jasmin's songs are not really good and don't leave a lasting impression. But almost all of the old classics were underlaid with a painful electro beat. Probably because Will Smith does a lot of hip-hop? Everything seems so wrong. Menken's original music is so terrific and has this jazzy flair. Hip-hop doesn't fit in there. ""Quickly away"" was particularly terrible, while ""Prince Ali"" sounded okay.<br/><br/>And visually there is also nothing good to note: The CGI effects are often horrible, especially when Aladdin is riding on the flying carpet. All figures and sets seemed as if they were just parts of a film. Nothing ever felt real. The costumes and the sets all looked so cheap, and a street boy like Aladdin shines with clean clothes and white teeth ...<br/><br/>
Finally, the film is much too long: 129 minutes! The original came out perfectly at 91 minutes, but today everything has to be bigger and more epic, no matter what the price!<br/><br/>Conclusion: Will Smith tries to save some things, but ""Aladdin"" from 2019 is a pitiful attempt to improve an existing classic. A soulless work that did not understand why the original is so good. Dark and ugly CGI is apparently what everyone wants now. Timeless animation? This is for kids! And unfortunately, you can see from the successful box office earnings that Disney continues to get away with it. I hope that someday people will wake up and ask for something new, but that will obviously take a long time ... But there is hope: we have the control. If we no longer fall into these obvious nostalgia traps and waste our money in them, we may soon be able to admire new ideas!"
"FireHead322199","5","1","1","21 February 2020"," Its OKAY
","The Live-Action Aladdin movie was an alright film. I felt like some of the special effects looked dated and really did not like the actor who plays Jafar. However, I did appreciate Will Smith for doing something new with genie rather than being a copy+paste of Robin Williams Genie. Aladdin and Jasmine did an alright job. I really feel like the film could have been better had it done some thing different from the animated original. That being said I hope the upcoming Aladdin 2 follows an original plot rather than having one that resembles Return of Jafar or King of Thieves."

I must admit I never saw the orginal Aladdin so been nice to go in not knowing completely what happens. I think the casting of will Smith was the best part about this film he made the role his own and makes it shine and it's all the little things to like the fly carpet is just smile maker whenever it did something quirky it made me smile and chuckle. My only negative thing I had to say about this film is the singing. I just found the actor to play Aladdin just didnt have that stand out voice in my opinion but jasmine my god what a voice!! Any who watch this film if your in a I want feel good film mood because that's this film."
"danaeredmond","8","1","1","4 February 2020"," Give it a chance
","I loved this movie. To be honest, the original Aladdin was not one of my favorite animated Disney films. Obviously I loved Robin Williams as the genie and I still listen to some of the soundtrack, but the movie as a whole was just never one of my favorites.
That being said, this is one of my favorite live action remakes Disney has done. While they stuck pretty well to the original story, they didn't copy it. Will Smith didn't even try to recreate Robin Williams' genie, he made it his own. That was the only way it would ever work, and it did. They switched up the soundtrack a little and made it more modern, which typically I would hate but I actually enjoyed it here.
From reading other reviews, it sounds like the people who have written negative reviews went into the movie expecting it to be a total recreation of the original. To me, when making these live action remakes, you want to make it original in its own way. So, if you go into this movie wanting it to be the exact same as the original animated version, you won't like it. But, if you give it a chance as its own movie while looking for a little nostalgia to go with it, it's very enjoyable."

"sherylchilders82","8","1","1","26 January 2020"," One of the best movies of 2019 that will endure like others in the Disney catalog
","I have a theory that most of the negative reviews (between 1-4) are xenophobes that subconsciously disliked this movie because of the entire cast that is not of European descent. I saw this movie in the theater, purchased it on blu-ray, and have watched it multiple times.<br/><br/>For those who do not appreciate the art of the theatrical music and dance in this film, it is rich in Indian / Middle Eastern influence. This makes complete sense, since Aladdin is based on an old folk tale from the Middle East. Indian dance has an extremely rich history and variety, as rich and older than modern dance, which has roots in court dancing and ballet. There was a nice blend with some hip-hop, and I'm guessing some other world influences (I'm not a dance expert). Disney's live action films have a history of artistic dance, including in films like Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (the market scene features classical Indian dancing as well).<br/><br/>The best song is Jasmine's theme, ""Speechless"", and it honestly made the film, which can be considered a feminist message (another possible reason for the hate). Without creating spoilers, it updates the original animated version in a much needed way, giving Jasmine more of a character, and making her less of a second sidekick to Aladdin (after Abu of course). The animation is seamless, and the cinematography is as good as it gets. Many overhead / zoom in views are beautiful.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie is campy and theatrical. If you aren't into musicals, dance numbers, and creative confetti, it might not be your thing. Personally, it was my favorite cheesy flick of 2019. I will watch this many more times to come, whenever I want to hear the music or have a good laugh."

I enjoyed it, and as my wife said, only Disney could give a carpet the character that makes you engage with it.

"bazwarshazwar","9","1","1","19 January 2020"," Possibly a superior remake
","I'm 36 years old and Aladdin was my favourite Disney film growing up, along with a lot of people I would guess. Disney have been piling these remakes out over the last few years with varying degrees of success. Beauty and the Beast was okay, The Jungle Book and The Lion King did financially well and Dumbo was welcomed with lukewarm reviews. So Aladdin was one I worried about. Mixed in with all these other remakes, would it fade into the background, can Will Smith do justice to the Genie role, and why on earth had they hired Guy Ritchie to direct? Well fear not, because for me, this is the best live action Disney remake to date. It has the charm of the original, the story is tweaked to be more relevant with today's audience, and Will Smith is amazing as the Genie. Guy Ritchie's best film since Snatch. Maybe we've found a genre he can tackle outside of British gangster."

"dontscrewupp","6","1","1","6 January 2020"," It's not bad... but not very good either
","Before I say anything I just want to say - People are expecting this movie to be the same as the animated one. That's impossible. No matter how hard you'll try, it'll never be the same as the original one. Different actors, different writers, different directors, different generation. Adaptions are never gonna be the same was as the original. And that's OK. Such is a way of life.<br/><br/>Now, to my thoughts... I was entertained.<br/><br/>The costumes are beautiful. Extremely detailed, coherent and so wonderfully made. They helped make the movie more immersive. The only one I didn't like was Aladdin's. In the animated one he shows as much skin as Jasmine. But in here they put a shirt on him. Boo.<br/><br/>Agrabah is truly stunning, and you get some amazing shots. The architecture is unique and interesting to look at. You just want to pause the screen to take everything in. It is CGI, and as it's moving on the screen you know it's fake and CGI, but still, it's a pretty CGI.<br/><br/>The movie uses colors in such a good way. Whether it's on costumes, environment or interior, It's pretty incredible and so pleasing to look at. It's clear that those departments worked together and shared a similar vision.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty okay. Pretty normal to today's standards and Disney's trying to look for a middle ground.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud singing and acting didn't amaze me. But hey at least he's cute and looks the part.<br/><br/>Naomi Scott is an incredible actress, but damn she doesn't have a good singing technique. Talented? maybe. But that singing wasn't that good.<br/><br/>Too much auto tune on both.<br/><br/>I liked the new characters. They didn't add a lot to the movie but they didn't take away from it either. They're kinda there. A whole different version of... well, different. I liked Jasmine's & her maiden's relationship. Hakim is... well, kinda there?<br/><br/>Jaffar was... too realistic. He's supposed to be this bigger than life Disney villan yet he acts like a power hungry misogynistic dude. I liked his voice but other than that it really hurt his character, missed the mark and made for a boring, yet somewhat preachy performance. Bad.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a family friendly, wholesome, entertaining movie look no further. But it's really average. Not the best I've ever seen but not the worst. +1 for visuals."

This is actually a good movie but on certain moments there was to much unnecessary dialouge (im not speaking of genie) but for example the scene at the end where Jafar wishes to be 'the most powerfull being in the world, when he turned in the genie he had way to much dialouge in That moment.<br/><br/>2. Jasmine
I mean Come on do I need say something to the People who've watched this movie already

But this jasmine is just souring about nothing her full screen time: than she wants a relationship but not with the Prince of her fathers choosing, she meets aladdin for the first time, seems in love already but No again.

","Almost everything about this movie says ""weird"". For one thing, the sets and costumes don't look at all right. As others have mentioned, it has a definite Bollywood look and feel, and it's hard to believe that was not intentional. But why?<br/><br/>The casting is odd too. In fact, the only characters that I thought were a good fit and interesting were Will Smith's Genie and the handmaiden. They should have just made an entirely new movie about those 2, and left Aladdin, Jaffar, and the rest of the sorry cast entirely out of it.<br/><br/>Overall, it comes across as tired and uninspired, and, yes, weird. I just can't get my mind around what they were going for in this remake. But whatever it was, they clearly missed the mark.<br/><br/>I give it 4 stars because there are a few good laughs, but there's also a lot of dead air between those laughs. Unless you're a huge Will Smith fan, I would not recommend seeing this. And, regardless of your level of Will Smith fanboy-dom, if you are a big fan of the animated Aladdin, you probably should avoid this live action version like the plague. If you've seen both, it's impossible not to compare the 2, and this new live action version just doesn't hold a candle (or magic oil lamp) to the animated edition."

"davidmvining","6","1","1","22 November 2019"," Extra stuff bogs down a decent adaptation
","Do we need this movie? Well, we don't need any movies, so the answer is no. However, the movie being what it is, it's far from the worst time at the cinema.<br/><br/>So, you know the early 90s animated movie, so you know the story of the live-action remake. Most of the film is beat for beat the same story. There are some small changes (one of which I quite liked, but the rest felt either extraneous or simply unimportant), but yeah, it's exactly the same.<br/><br/>The movie's opening is surprisingly quick and a bit out of order, though. It zooms through the animated movie's first 20 minutes in about 10, leaving out a proper introduction for Jasmine and throwing her right into her moment disguised as a peasant in the market. We know who she is because we've seen the previous version, but the movie acts like we shouldn't know its Jasmine. It's an odd situation to the point where she calls herself Dahlia, the princess's handmaiden, one wonders if that's just for Aladdin or for the audience as well.<br/><br/>Then we get to what is probably the best part of the whole remake affair, Jafar. His introduction and first few motions are far superior here than then were in the original. In the original, Jafar was bad man who did some unexplained magic with a large diamond to find the diamond in the rough. In the remake, he is throwing peasant after peasant into the Cave of Wonders before he watches Aladdin make fools of the palace guards in order to reach Jasmine. He decides, actively, that Aladdin must be the diamond in the rough. His guards end up capturing the street rat, and instead of tricking him as an old man, he reveals himself fully, takes Aladdin to the Cave under guard, and actually makes a small connection. Jafar started from nothing, much as Aladdin is then. Jafar can rise up, and so can Aladdin. Pretty much everything after that is the same with Jafar, but that introduction and how Jafar gets things moving is the one actual improvement.<br/><br/>Will Smith is good as the genie, but he can't escape the shadow of Robin Williams, which is unfair. Smith is in a different movie, and we should judge him based purely on that context. In that context, he's pretty good. It's whenever they mimic Williams too closely (like the 3 rules of wishing scene) that it ends up feeling false. Smith doesn't have the same personality to make a series of off the cuff impressions, and whenever it does happen, it feels wrong.<br/><br/>The music is largely the same (surprise!). A few lyric changes here and there to make lyrics from a kid's more more...er...kid friendly. The ""Friend Like Me"" number is a strong combination of visual effects and (probably CGI enhanced) dancing set to a tune everyone already knows they love. The ""Prince Ali"" song as Aladdin comes into Agrabah feels smaller and more confined than the animated version, but it's still colorful and energetic. Jasmine has a new number which feels out of step both stylistically and narratively (the movie stops dead so she can sing it). The actress sings it with passion, but the song ""Speechless"" ends up feeling a bit pointless and out of place.<br/><br/>Overall, on its own, the movie is okay. It's not quite good because of its opening, which is confusing and rushed, and the fact that it embraces complexity where it's not necessary (there's a lot of talk about invading a neighboring country that is oddly extraneous). I was actually along with it for a while, but the movie kind of got bogged down in its final act that ended up dragging the rest of the movie down with it."

Jafar wasn't convincing either. And even the parrot sounded far too evil. They also completely ignored little details - in the original movie when jafar gets sucked into the lamp and pull the parrot in, a little feather comes out of the lamp. Those little details were ignored - the magic of the first movie totally blanded over.<br/><br/>Then overusing Will Smith. While I adore Will Smith, he does not have a good voice for Arabian nights - that particular song needed to have been interpreted by a more powerful voice - it was painful to hear. Someone with an opera like voice would have done much better <br/><br/>The sets - Agrabah looks fake all across. Like a cheap production. The script had so many cringeworthy adaptations but the worst has to be the new song Jasmin sings - which is meant to be about woman empowerment - the lyrics are absolutely terrible. Cringe beginning to end. Its not her interpretation, its literally the words - such a useless filler.<br/><br/>This could have been so wonderful.

"beckyanca","5","1","1","14 August 2019"," A mess
","The stars are for Will Smith, the colours, the Prince Ali song and maybe the nostalgia. But the movie is a total mess, lacking almost all the magic from the original. When they sang A whole new world it did not move me a bit - and that song is my favourite from Aladdin.
The movie has two main problems: Aladdin and Jafar. The boy cast as Aladdin can't sing and act to save his life. He speaks all the movie with American accent and tries to much to impersonate de Aladdin from the cartoon, but fails every single time. He is not a dashing rouge, a daring street rat, he is just bland and has zero chemistry with the girl playing Jasmine.
And Jafar is horrible miscast. So the antagonist of this story is just a wannabe villain. In the cartoon Jafar was menacing, here he is just an angry teenager, just as 'threatening' as Kylo Ren is in the new Star Wars trilogy. You cannot have a decent Aladdin movie if your male lead is weak and your villain is one-dimensional.
Jasmine is good enough, at least she can sing. Why they had to change her and her dreams? What was wrong with wishing to see the world and fall in love? I liked her way better in the animated version.
The new songs are just out of place; the Speechless songs did not fit at all, seemed just forced in and taken from a different movie. And what is with the whole Bollywood vibes and dances?
Will Smith was the best part of this movie, but not even he could have saved this mess."
"akyu1","4","1","1","9 August 2019"," Where was that excitement I had when I went to see the stage version of this?
","Well, I had a feeling already when I found out Will Smith was going to be Genie. My pre-viewing feeling was an disappointment because Will Smith had the good-looking and slender image although in the movie he was muscled up and was made a lot bigger than he actually was. This wasn't good enough. There was a song missing I though but I'm not sure, in the stage version when Genie was singing it gave the audience such excitement and the people were roaring. It was in Melbourne Australia. But this movie version never caught up the quality of this show I saw at the Her Majesty's Theatre. What a disappointing movie, none of the songs made me feel happy, in addition Jafar in the movie didn't look evil and sly enough, he looked too young and too innocent. The casting and the charactirisation was lacking. I was so sad to see it. Dumbo was the same. Mary Poppins Returns was good."

"margulanabutrlov","9","10","29","23 May 2019"," ALADDIN REVIEW
","A notorious 'street rat' Aladdin, feels a deep sense of connection with the Princess of the kingdom he resides in, but upon reaching her palace, he realises that winning her over is going to be tougher than he had imagined.
A local thief Aladdin (Mena Massoud), from the kingdom of Agrabah, falls in love with its princess - Jasmine (Naomi Scott) - and decides to persuade her, but the evil Grand Vizier Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) and chief advisor to the Sultan (Navid Negahban) put forward this condition - Aladdin must bring him the magical lamp and its Genie (Will Smith) that grants three wishes.
The story of Aladdin and the Genie is known to one and all and this live-action adaptation of Disney's animated classic by the same name, which has originally immortalised this legendary tale, is no exception to that phenomenon. The fresh pairing of Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott works and is a welcome surprise as the duo share an amazing chemistry on screen and pretty much hold on to the likeability factors of their respective characters till the very end. Will Smith, the Genie, is a straight up natural as far as tickling our funny bones is concerned but again, it would be criminal to compare him to Robbin Williams's 1992 act in the original movie as the standards set by the late actor-comedian are pretty high.
Jafar - the vengeful villain - is so bad in the movie that he's actually good, and brownie points to director Guy Ritchie for fully exploring and bringing to light the twisted psyche of this greed-filled character, which ultimately makes you wonder - who's the sinner and who has been sinned against.
However, the downside of the whole direction process is that it is somewhat mixed and some of the song-dance sequences look & feel forced and could have been avoided. Despite its grandeur and larger-than-life cinematography-animation, at two hours and eight minutes - the film starts to feel bit of a drag. The momentum, at which the film moves, is yet another problem that cannot be overlooked - all the characters are given ample time and attention to grow and develop, while the ending is wrapped up in a tearing hurry.
Kids born in the 90s, who have watched the cartoon version of this story, will find 'Aladdin' a bit too hard to get accustomed to in the beginning, but otherwise, the film - sans its minor hiccups - is congenial and establishes the 'feel-good' factor from frame one and maintains it till the curtains are drawn."

"KATO-SUBZERO","10","6","15","25 May 2019"," ""ALADDIN"", Great Remake of the cartoon version
","25 May 2019: The story of ALADDIN has been around for over 60 years. Aladdin is my favorite Disney movie. My grandmother told me of Aladdin as a bedtime story in the sixties. Therefore it has been and still is my all time favorite. I saw the Disney cartoon version in the theaters no less than 5 times which included taking my sons to see it. I bought the dvd and watched it several more times with my sons. My favorite character was Jafar. The cartoon version, I liked the voices better. Although, I like this version, but I did not like the voice of actor, Marwan Kenzari as ""Jafar"". He was not sinister or evil enough. His voice should have been dubbed by voice actor, Jonathan Freeman as ""Jafar"". His voice is much more sinister and evil and actor, Gilbert Gottfried's should have dubbed the parrot, Iago. Actor, Will Smith is perfect in the role as the Genie. He is just the right amount of comic coolness to pull off the jokes, but deceased actor, Robin Williams's voice was the best. Arabic actor, Mena Massoud is perfect in the role of Aladdin and so is the rest of the cast. However, since Aladdin is tale from Saudi Arabia, it would have been nice to cast more Middle Eastern actors/actresses in some roles.<br/><br/>The musical numbers have been updated a bit, but actor, Actor, Will Smith and the musical scenes are very well done. I will see this version at least two more times. Money well spent. A movie for all ages to enjoy, no profanity, no nudity, just a good clean fun movie for grandparents, religious folks and small children. Two Thumbs up high. NKD"
"cruise01","8","11","33","24 May 2019"," Beautiful, stunning, and a well made adaptation of the original.
","Aladdin (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Aladdin is a beautiful wonderful musical fantasy film that brings the animated classic movie to life. Which director Guy Ritchie does really well in being faithful to the original movie. From similar musical sequences to very much the same story. Sure, there will be some new changes and additions like Will Smith's Genie telling a narrative story in the beginning of the movie. And some new characters like Jasmines Handmaiden, and some new original songs sang by Naomi Scott. Otherwise, fans of the original will love. I know some may find it difficult to accept Will Smith playing Genie. After beloved Robin Williams is so great as the character. Will Smith was fantastic as the character. Brought his fun, outgoing charms, and the musical sequence were great. Will Smith was the perfect choice. Mena Massoud as Aladdin was also good as well. He delivered the charms of a thief, trying to feed the poor, and falling for a princess. Naomi Scott was also good as well. She is beautiful and great as the character. Marwan Kenzari was good as Jafar. A villain that wants power.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's direction is one of his better films. The film feels like an adventurous kind of movie feeling similar to The Mummy. With the opening credits sequence of the city and the desert landscape of a monstrous cave. The film does have some fun action sequences and chases with Aladdin. The story is similar to the original so don't expect anything new. The musical sequences are also fun and great as well. The best one with Whole New World song sang by Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott were also great. There is also plenty of humor with Aladdin being awkward in talking to the princess. And Genie being his mentor in trying to teach him. The visual effects is also great as well.<br/><br/>I will say the movie did feel a little too long with the run time. Feel like the editors can trim the film a little in trying to make it a better pace with the movie. There were some slow moments that dragged on a little.<br/><br/>Overall, Aladdin is a good fantasy musical film. The cast did great. Guy Ritchie's direction stuck to the original movie and some new additions with characters and musical sequences. The music was great. The characters were fun and entertaining."

","One more Disney live action, and one more success in adapt a classic animation, and bring all this to reality, with more feminism and representativeness, not only in your plot, but in your songs and the solo of Jasmine, where show us a character pretty powerful and segure of yourself. Will Smith as Genie is incredible, de CGI is not perfect, but on no moment harms the experience, absolutely is the best character in the movie and the more exploited with different way of the another movie. The magic carpet and Abu are so cool to see, even if they are not so caricatured, both have good scenes, Iago is a great animal villain, not so funny like the animation, but still a good to see it with Jafar that unfortunately is the only character that is not so good in comparison to animation, but have so many things to see that you don't care very much about. Lastly, the movie has perfect songs, great choreographies, beautiful photography and a lovely adventure story."

"JoeYabuki","8","13","41","24 May 2019"," The best adaptation of Disney's live action movie
","The first act is quite slow and boring, even improbable when they are chasing Aladdin at the beginning, you do not believe the world they want to put you through the eyes and he's juggling and absurd jumps (I give it a 6), but then when the Genius appears the movie rises. Will Smith is the best of the film, Mena Massoud (Aladdin) also does his performance very well, you believe in everything, Naomi Scott (Jasmine) does her part. Those last 2 acts are great (I give it a 9). The scenes don't happen in the same order as the animated one, besides there are 38 more minutes of songs and new scenes. You don't feel that Guy Ritchie is the director, it could have been any other. This story is Arabic but they changed it and it feels a bit Indian, more of Bollywood. The ending just surprised me, it's not the same one when Aladdin sets the Genie free. You have to go watch it Noowww."

","First and foremost, rate a movie on a scale like
You grade a paper. People giving things a 4/10 is like giving it a 40%, it's incredibly rude and disrespectful to the time and money went into making it. This isn't a TV movie.<br/><br/>That being said. This film breaks cultural barriers and takes the difficult task of making a complicated cartoon movie into a respectable film with a followed story line. Aladdin takes a cartoon film that features more than one main characters as animals and or mythical beings and makes it relatable.<br/><br/>Secondly and more importantly, Aladdin takes a predominately Arabic cast, for the first time, and makes it appeal to the mainstream American media. As an Anglo-American Christian I find this wonderful that we can break down cultural barriers and relate more to our fellow man. I hope this provides more opportunity for more American/Arabic actors to have leading roles in films. Thanks, it was good :)."
"sweidman-28016","4","5","12","1 June 2019"," Disappointing Unnecessary Remake
","Aladdin (2019) Review:<br/><br/>Aladdin is the remake of the 1992 Disney classic and everybody knows the plot so I don't need to explain it. I don't understand why Disney is remaking classic movies lately. I know it's for money but they're so desperate they can't come up with anything original. Out of the three live action remakes this year, Dumbo, Aladdin, and The Lion King, this one had the least interesting trailer and I almost didn't feel the need to see it. My most anticipated one was Dumbo and I was disappointed by it. Let's hope The Lion King is good since this one disappointed me even more than Dumbo. With Dumbo they tried doing something new so I couldn't entirely compare it to the original. With this there were minor differences throughout and it was basically the same plot with not much fun, 38 minutes longer, a few new songs, and a couple new characters. speaking of characters everybody was nervous about Will Smith as the Genie. Yes, he did look kind of dumb with the blue skin but there's nothing we can do about it. I actually thought he was the best part of the movie. He did his best to make it fun but not too over the top. His singing wasn't too bad either. The rest of the characters I could care less about except for Naomi Scott as Jasmine. She was a fine actress and a good singer. Her new song was actually pretty good except the timing of it felt off. As the lead you'd think Mena Massoud would be a good Aladdin. This is his first big role so his audition had to of been pretty good. Well he did not deliver to me. Aladdin was fun in the original but it just seemed like he was trying to be rebellious the whole time. He was trying too hard to be perfect where it was overacting. I personally didn't think his singing was that good. Those statements go for the rest. I found that with Marwan Kenzari as Jafar. He didn't feel like a Jafar to me. Yes, his emotional dynamics were good towards the end but he didn't seem evil to me. The characters were really my big issues with it. The story was the same with a few things added which was fine with me since I'd like something a little new. It's just that it didn't need to be so long. It's 2 hrs 8 min long and some of the stuff added was just long and boring. Now I liked the dancing and songs. The production was cool and so were the costumes, I expected just a little more but that's alright. What really bothered me was instead of reshooting some scenes the match up with the tempo of the music they just sped up the video and kept the music the same. It looked awkward and something edited on a phone. That happened in one of the first scenes. I was confused at first thinking it was intentional but then it wasn't so I kind of laughed. I laughed at a lot of things that weren't supposed to be funny. Like adding more modern styles to the music and dancing. It really bothered me. Maybe put that on the soundtrack as a bonus but it felt off for the movie. Alan Menken is a great composer but this wasn't his best in my opinion. The visuals were fine for the most part but it was obvious that it was computer generated in many spots. Overall I think this was just a disappointment for me. I really started tearing this apart after I saw it but I had to remind myself that I shouldn't compare every little thing to the original. I can see why people would like this. It's just it personally lacked fun and didn't seem that magical as the original. Oh well. See it if you'd like.<br/><br/>My Grade: C"
"coombsstephen","8","17","58","23 May 2019"," A good film made great by Will Smith even for adults
","Whenever I see a remake of a classic film I prepare for disappointment but this film was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>It's a good film until Will Smith arrives as the genie then the film really takes off. He brings some good laughs and the pace really steps up.<br/><br/>Aside from Will Smith the acting is ok and the CGI and scenery is excellent.<br/><br/>It's a shame the music still leans on the original for the best song, with maybe only one of the new ones anywhere close to being one that may catch on but that isn't the end of the world.<br/><br/>This is a great family film well worth a watch."

"kiwijinxter","10","4","9","3 June 2019"," A magical experience without the usual Disney virtue signals
","I remember my thrill and exhilaration when I first saw Optimus Prime in a real life (well CGI anyway) in the movies which brought the Transformers cartoons to ""real life"". It was all in the recognition and I felt like a little kid in a candy store. I've never felt the same about any other movie. Until now, thanks to Aladdin.<br/><br/>When I was younger I watched the animated version of Aladdin three times - yes three times - in the movies. I loved the show. So I held my breath when I went to watch the real life 2019 version of Aladdin (and a blue CGI genie of course) movie. I was worried Disney would trash any semblance of the original animated Aladdin with their usual in-your-face, virtue-signalling, activist crap (like they did on Star Wars: The Last Jedi) or removing the very essence of the characters they portray (like they did with Tolkien, removing the man's Christian faith from the man himself).<br/><br/> I found myself feeling like a kid again, mesmerised by the wonder and fun that is Agrabah and Aladdin. It was movie magic all over again, all thanks to a brilliant cast and producer Guy Ritchie. The cast, ok, where do I start. Mena Massoud captured the very essence of cheeky, suave and big-eyed Aladdin - it's quite incredible that he managed to, at times, mimick the animation! Naomi Scott capably represented the beautiful, steady and confident Princess Jasmine - she had guts, she stands on her own, she is also all-heart. Both of them had a very cute chemistry that was reminiscent of the animated movie many years earlier. Will Smith truly and successfully made the genie his own, down to the funny antics. Marwan Kenzari played a much younger looking Jafar than in the movies, but this also worked alongside the main characters. Oh and the monkey Abu, is just too cute.<br/><br/>I believe what makes this Aladdin movie a real success is twofold. Firstly, it respects the original film - the beautiful songs, the familiar settings, Agrabah's look and feel, the blue genie, the young Aladdin and Jasmine - they're all there. If you loved the animated Aladdin the way I did, you'd love this live ""real"" version of Aladdin. Secondly, it also stamped it's own mark to differentiate itself from the original film. The dance sequences were a mix of the traditional and modern, a fusion of cultural dances. The familiar songs were arranged differently and felt contemporary. Aladdin and Jasmine, by virtue of being real humans, really maximised the ""reality"" factor of what is supposed to be a mere fairy tale. And Will Smith successfully stepped out of Robin Williams' genie, and truly made this genie his own - this was important because if Will Smith tried to be a Robin Williams, the genie would've failed miserably. Nah, this blue genie is a completely different character (only Will Smith can play THIS genie) at the core, yet retained the jovial, fun-loving and irreverent personality that embodies the genie. The only one who is very different in terms of look and feel was Jafar, and that was OK. This Jafar felt modern and younger, though I think they could've made him a bit more ""sneakier"" in the looks department. All in all, I loved the cast.<br/><br/>Honestly, I watched this new Aladdin movie, completely entranced by the colourful, beautiful, ""Whole New World"" of Agrabah, and yet I immediately connected with every single character as they appeared, down to the flying carpet itself - this movie is all heart, all beauty, all humour, everything you'd want in a movie. This is truly one of the best movies I've watched in years. Honestly, this was a wonderful, magical experience. I highly recommend this - well done to the cast and crew of this show. I'll be watching it again! Highly highly highly recommended."

"cardsrock","7","8","23","30 May 2019"," Better than expected, but still lacking some of the original's heart
","Aladdin (1992) is my favorite Disney animated film, so I was very much intrigued by this remake. Thankfully, the live-action film isn't as bad as promotional material would lead you to believe. The first half of the film is great and really recaptures much of the original's magic. The Friend Like Me sequence is fantastic and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get goosebumps when A Whole New World started. They smartly avoided trying to replicate Robin Williams' iconic performance as Genie and instead let Will Smith be Will Smith, and honestly it worked.<br/><br/>Where the film falters a bit is its second half. Jafar is pretty badly miscast. He is nowhere near as menacing as the original and it's hard to take him seriously as the villain, especially at the end. While I understand wanting to update the film for modern times, Jasmine's ""wokeness"" feels terribly out of place in the film and could have been handled much better. Aladdin is a dazzling spectacle, but unfortunately can't quite match the magic of the original."

","The story is originally based in China and on the big screen, it's meant to be based in Arabia. So, then, what's with the Indian costumes, Indian dances and 'Baba' in this movie ?<br/><br/>The director clearly got confused!"

"ramonatutuianu","8","3","6","11 August 2019"," quite enjoyable
","I takes some getting used to, but it certainly brings some nostalgia. Will Smith did a good job with the genie character, he is funny in his own way, not trying to copy Robin Williams, and I liked the fact that they embellished the story a little bit by adding the maid character that marries the genie. I thought the CGI was going to be bad and slow, not capturing how quickly the genie moves and does his magic but they actually pulled it off and it looks cool. Jasmine becoming Sultan broke my suspension of disbelief, because I thought it never happened in real life, but I googled it and I was wrong, there were women Sultans, so that just made my day! I actually learned something awesome because of this movie.
The one thing that could have been better is Jaffar's character, he is not that scary. Maybe that's part of his personality, he's just a creepy frustrated dude that doesn't look like he could rule anything, but I think it would have worked if they made him a bit more confident on the outside, like he exudes power but actually his biggest hidden weakness is he's afraid to be number 2.
And the song ""Never had a friend"" is so catchy!"
"BlueSkies765","8","3","6","9 August 2019"," Vibrant movie
","I must say that I enjoyed this movie. I loved the vibe of the movie. A lot of the interactions were funny and charming. The visuals were stunning it was a real treat to watch. Not only the settings but also the way they visualized the magic. The joyful songs made me feel good, I found the characters interesting (good choice of actors) and of course seeing Will Smith play a genie was awesome.<br/><br/>The downside is a loss of momentum in the second half of the movie and the movie could have been shorter. I still felt like the movie had plenty of good things for me to like it."
"kjproulx","8","3","6","6 August 2019"," A Solid Live-Action Remake
","From Maleficent to Alice in Wonderland, even though those are films that have been changed the most from their original versions, it really does feel like Disney has now doubled-down on keeping their remakes familiar, down to replicating shots and songs. Many viewers may take offence to this or find it pointless to even watch a remake that doesn't take any creative liberties, but I feel that an updated version for today's kids isn't all that bad. Aladdin is one of the latest films to receive this treatment and I believe it's also one of the better ones they've done.<br/><br/>Following Aladdin (Mena Massoud), a street thief who finds his way into the palace of Princess Jasmine (Noami Scott), eventually stumbles across a lamp that reveals a genie (Will Smith) who will grant him three wishes. The core premise of the original film is very much present here, but there are also a few welcome additions that don't feel forced or disappointing, at least in my opinion. Viewers seem to be complaining about the villain in Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) for being too soft-spoken and not threatening enough, but I thought this take on him felt very refreshing and more sly than overpowering.<br/><br/>Like most of these remakes, there are many shots that just feel like replicas of the classic animated film and the songs are exactly the same for the most part, but for me, it all came down to how everything seems to jump off the screen and if I was able to buy into it all. The short answer for that is yes, I found myself invested in everything that was going on and Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, and especially Will Smith all deliver great performances. Will Smith doesn't ruin what Robin Williams did in the past, but rather makes it his own and I really appreciated that.<br/><br/>Where this films biggest issue lies; However, is in its runtime. This version of Aladdin is nearly 40 minutes longer than the original film and while many of the scenes do add to the movie as a whole, it does feel its length at times. There are many fun aspects to this movie, so when a lot of time is taken to explore the dramatic side of these characters, it almost slows down to a halt at times. Luckily, the cast and story surrounding them are so likeable that I was able to forgive a few slow scenes, for the most part.<br/><br/>In the end, this 2019 live-action version of Aladdin could have been better and should've probably changed the original premise a little more than it did, in order to feel fresher, but I really enjoyed what was shown to me. This is the same way I have felt about most of these remakes, where if you loved, or even liked the original animated movie, then there's really no reason why you shouldn't at least enjoy watching it at the very least. It has its issues, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the movies watching Aladdin."
"jameshatfield-77323","8","3","6","3 August 2019"," They have a ""brand of magic that never fails""
","There aren't any specific negatives I can find, there are lots of positives. Will Smith was a brilliant Genie, his renditions of friend like me, and Prince Ali were good , but not as good as Robin Williams'. Where he really shone was when he was human assisting Aladdin, they had like buddy cop type relationship that caused lots of laughs. Especially where Aladdin had kind of awkward behaviour, Will Smith made it funny. He was kind of like his wing man when Aladdin was trying to ask out Jasmine. They seemed more like friends than in the original where they seemed like colleagues, people who got along but were forced to be together at the same tirm.<br/><br/>Overall, a fitting remake for a good film"

","It was nice to see that they stuck with the story with minimal alterations, but still offered their own flare. Will Smith did a great job, and those were some big shoes to fill. It is nice that Jasmine is a bit stronger in this film, even if it does not quite fit the time/location accuracy. Vocally and visually the film was on point."

","Seeing this makes me feel giddy! You know, just like watching good old Disney classics but it's much more refreshing. I love this version of Genie, Will Smith did great! Naomi Scott is just the perfect Jasmine; and gosh do I adore her maid. Aladdin is very likeable as well.<br/><br/>The only thing(s) that falters this from a 10/10 is the cgi, which I can still tolerate but still, could be better, and Jafar. He's evil but there are so much more to Jafar. Yes they explored his past a bit, but for some reason the character wasn't potrayed that good."

","The acting was superb, Mena Massoud & Naomi Scott played the role of Aladdin & Jasmine as well as you could possibly play it; they completely brought back the nostalgic magic from the original film. Will Smith is Legend and he keeps up with his track record, great role played by him. The special effects were amazing, prior to seeing this film I thought it would be difficult to bring this cartoon to life but they were able to surpass my expectations. The plot stayed the course of the original but it was extremely entertaining I found myself forgetting what was going to happen lol. A great family adventure with a good message for Today."

"aleena_candyfloss","9","3","6","27 June 2019"," Unexpectedly Magical
","I was expecting a mediocre movie with the songs not being able to meet the original standard. But I was immediately taken aback with the opening song.
Will Smith provided a fun twist to Genie, Mena brought Aladdin to life with so much energy and Naomi displayed Jasmine's strength with such finesse.
Jafar, however did not match their standards and almost never seemed villainous enough.
The movie made a few changes from the cartoon which actually make the story more sensible so I didn't mind these changes at all, in fact, it was required for the movie.
Overall, the movie is different from the cartoon in some aspects but they were pleasant necessary changes that make the movie enjoyable with its own charms."

"tinobenz","10","3","6","27 June 2019"," Fantastic movie for the Family!
","I really enjoyed this reboot of Aladdin and it's a fantastic film for the whole family!!!"
"aka-45316","9","3","6","27 June 2019"," A Slightly Flawed, But Excellent Film
","For my first noting, I'd like to start with the film's ensemble cast, casting, performances, and characters.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud, first off, was awesome as Aladdin! Extremely perfect for the part! I'm not sure how many people think this, but he looked so much like the character from the original film, and performed him so well, that it was like the actual character was in the building! To boot, Massoud did an excellent job at bringing in his own flair, personality, and dimensionalism to the character.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the Aladdin in this version certainly isn't as smart as the Aladdin in the animated film, but, he's still quick-witted, clever, and as kind as ever. The character also had some great development throughout the film, not just like in the original Disney classic, but...he developed through having to come to terms with who he is as a person, as well as trying to keep his moral compass alive.<br/><br/>Naomi Scott's casting and performance as Jasmine is another element of the movie I highly commend. I know that there was some early criticism about Scott's casting in the early stages of the film, but, in all honesty, she fit the role of Jasmine like a pea in a pod! She killed it! She was not only able to preserve the character's rebelliousness and desire for independence, she also gave her character a newfound sense of authority and leadership, not just for herself, but for others. Just like Massoud, she even made it seem like the real deal was actually there.<br/><br/>Jasmine herself even had some newfound development, building throughout the film to show the marks of a true leader.<br/><br/>The addition of Jasmine's best friend and handmaiden, Dalia, proved to be really fun too. So did Nasim Pedrad's performance and casting. I know that many have likely passed over Pedrad and her character, but...Pedrad did a wonderful job at portraying Dalia, giving her great personality and comedic-timings. Plus, Dalia proved to be such an essential part of the whole film, that you'd be left wishing the character was in the original animated classic.<br/><br/>But, perhaps the best cast member out of everyone, who also gave the most winning performance of all in this movie...is Will Smith, and his character of the Genie. Truthfully, when I found out that Smith was going to be portraying the Genie, I was a little skeptical, mainly because of how much Robin Williams truly owned the role. However, as time went on, it suddenly clicked in my head that he would fit the part wonderfully, especially after seeing his work in ""Hitch"" and recalling his comedic moments in ""Independance Day"" (both of which I deeply apologize for not reviewing yet, by the way). I was overjoyed by the announcement that he wasn't going to be directly copying Robin Williams, so it made me all-the-more interested in seeing Smith in the role.<br/><br/>And you know what?<br/><br/>Will Smith really rocked the house as the Genie!<br/><br/>He did such a terrific job portraying the character by making the role something of his own. He even brought fantastic energy and emotion to the character, as well as gave him comedic-timings and a personality that made his Genie all-the-more different from Robin Williams's Genie. Additionally, he did a brilliant job developing his character into someone really human.<br/><br/>Now if I'm going to be honest, there was one element of the casting and performances that I wasn't a big fan of:<br/><br/>Marwan Kenzari, and his casting and portrayal as Jafar.<br/><br/>I have nothing against the actor personally, he's obviously quite talented (that considering he's likely not among the most famous, such as Smith), and I was willing to give him a chance and see if he could surprise me, partly due to not wanting to judge him based on the trailers alone.<br/><br/>The problem, however (and that comes from after seeing the whole film), is that Kenzari was awfully miscast. He was too young for the part of Jafar, and because of Jafar's youth, it makes one question how long he was the Sultan's Royal Vizier to begin with. Additionally, it seemed like no matter how far Kenzari extended himself as an actor, he just wasn't able to make the character threatening or imtimidating enough. It is especially compared to Jonathan Freeman's portrayal in the original film, even voice-wise. Kenzari's efforts literally didn't make the character someone to take seriously in this movie, and translated him as more of a wimp than anything else.<br/><br/>Overall, Kenzari would've been much more suited for some other character in the film rather than Jafar, and Jafar himself should've been played by someone much older compared to Kenzari. The person that I, along with my mother and some friends of mine, thought would've fit the part of Jafar like a glove was Ben Kingsley. I know, he's white, but considering he has such as large versatility as an actor, and that he can successfully play any role he's given, Kingsley would have been a much better choice for the part of Jafar.<br/><br/>The next subject will be on the film's story, made by Guy Ritchie and John August, as well as the direction by the former. I will say that while they weren't able to measure up to the awesomeness of of the original, the two of them were still able to make the film great in its own right.<br/><br/>I get the point, Guy Ritchie is obviously quite the odd choice to some as director of this movie, but...I thought that he was perfect for the job, and that's partly coming from a guy who's a big fan of his work in the Sherlock Holmes film starring Robert Downey Jr. (which I likewise apologize for not reviewing yet, but hope too soon). The chase and action moments were astonishingly some of the film's best moments.<br/><br/>The story and screenplay by Ritchie and John August was quite an eventful one, with lots of surprises to boot. It was a definite balance of both familiar and new, in that while the concept was pretty much like the animated film, there were still things about it that made the film its own thing. Examples of that include the dance scene between Aladdin and Jasmine, which wasn't in the original at all.<br/><br/>The only thing I wasn't completely fond of concerning the story and direction was that the recreations of scenes from the original, such as the introduction to the Cave of Wonders, were too quick-paced. They needed some fleshing out, and didn't have enough time to really breathe. I know, they obviously didn't want the film to be too long, but still.<br/><br/>Likewise, the film had some pretty solid humor here and there. The best jokes in the film, especially, come from that of the Genie and Dalia. For instance, in the dance scene, when Aladdin had no idea how to dance, I couldn't help but find the part where Genie was using his magic to make Aladdin do all those dance moves to be hysterical!<br/><br/>Admittedly, the CGI in the film certainly wasn't the best, but...it was still pretty good. The effects used with the animals were certainly great. Rajah the Tiger, Abu the Capuchin Monkey, and Iago the Scarlet Macaw (voiced by Alan Tudyk, and whose character is a regular parrot in contrast to Gilbert Gottfried's character) literally seemed like real animals. The motion capture effects used with the genie forms of Genie and Jafar were all delightfully spot-on too.<br/><br/>I must say that out of all of them, though, I was incredibly astounded by the CGI used with the magic carpet. I didn't think it'd be possible to have the use of him in CGI match up to his animated counterpart, but, the effects team successfully did it. My Mom, grandmother, and I could barely comprehend how they did it and if the character was even a real carpet or not.<br/><br/>My final noting, just like my review on the animated film, will be on the music that the movie had, done by true Disney musical genius, Alan Menken.<br/><br/>Menken's work in this film was astounding! That's not to say it's even better than the original's music, but still...he killed it!<br/><br/>I love how he was able to really extend himself for this feature, giving the music a noticeably new Arabian and Middle-Eastern feeling that was wonderful for this live-action update. The songs in this version, old and new, were enormously catchy and enjoyable to listen to, bringing in faithfulness to the original soundtrack, but at the same time, bringing a flair of its own, something that the soundtrack from the 2017 Beauty and the Beast film particularly lacked (exceptions from the latter film being ""Days in the Sun"" and ""Evermore"").<br/><br/>A special credit that I'd like to give in terms of the lyrics goes to the fact that much of Tim Rice's and the late Howard Ashman's work was kept, as well as towards Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (both of whom wrote the songs for ""The Greatest Showman"") for adding in their own brilliant creativity. The best ones, in my opinion, that were sung by the surprisingly amazing singing chops of Massoud, Scott, and Smith, were ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Friend Like Me"", ""Prince Ali"", and ""Speechless"". The music video version of ""Speechless"" was what I thought to be the best version of the latter song.<br/><br/>In the end, while the live-action Aladdin certainly won't topple the 1992 animated classic in terms of sheer awesomeness due to Kenzari's casting and performance as Jafar, and many of the recreated scenes being too quick, it's still an excellent film in its own right thanks to the music, smart direction and storytelling, CGI, and terrific casting and performances by Massoud, Scott, Pedrid, and Smith, the latter whose performance and comedic-chops would make Robin Williams extremely proud. It was a great way to pay homage to the late Williams and Ashman despite the setbacks I mentioned."

","24 June 2019
First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Aladdin. I've really been looking forward to this film. Lover of Disney I'm enjoying the transition from animation to live action. I read a lot in the press and on social media about the good and bad points of Will Smith playing the Genie. He has in no way spoiled the memory of Robin Williams, instead he has brought his own level of blue to role, giving us the familiar character with the Will Smith twist. Mena Massoud who plays Aladdin could literally be the animated version brought to life, it was so like the original Disney character. The new arrangement of the songs was sympathetic to the originals, Abu and carpet were still a great double act and the opulence of Agraba was grand even in poverty. I loved this film it did not disappoint."

","I liked this movie more than the Beauty and the Beast Live action to be honest. I don't get why people are complaining so much about it. This is a live action based on Disney's Aladdin. It cannot and SHOULD NOT be the same as the original. I personally loved the changes; to me they made sense and resolved plot holes the original had. The grey areas on the wishes for instance. Will Smith is a fun and charismatic Genie, making the role his own. Mena Massoud is a rather charming Aladdin. Naomi Scott is a beautiful and intelligent queen. Yes, QUEEN. I loved that her character was given so much more depth and importance than the original. She wanted to rule Agraba and she thought she had what it took to be sultan. Loved the new song: Speechless. Beautifully performed by Naomi. A Whole New world felt a lot like the original! Seriously, it was as if Mena and Naomi were born to be Aladdin and Jasmine. Their chemistry was palpable too. Loved the handmaiden Dalia moments, so relatably funny. The dancing, the costumes, and the music arrangements were super nice too. I was pleased. I might even go to watch it again."

When Will started singing, my first thought was ""he's a much better singer than Russell Crowe in Les Miserables"" before someone told me he was/is a singer/rapper.<br/><br/>The only thing that's bugging me was Princess Jasmine innocent of how commodity exchange works and probably other basic knowledge of a ruler. She was basically stealing bread for starving children in the very beginning. And as some other reviews pointed out, she barely has any social skills. The whole movie was supposed to be a fairy tale but for adult viewers the ending was kinda scary that such person was crowned to rule."

Ritchie offers us an exquisite, multicolored look at Agraba in a high aesthetic style, lustrous costumes, unforgettable choreographies and amazing songs, an intelligent rhythm of narration and only the necessary inventiveness (remember that the films arent a contest of story reversal!)
Excellent cast choices and here we need a parenthesis ,
Concerning the interpretation of the theatrical Marwan Kozari as Jafar, it is worth to have in mind that the scripts have given a different approach to his role. In particular, the imposing dark and sardonic (self) sarcastic of the original, the live action version has a greater depth. It is about a more realistic, human character where his obsession with absolute power is in fact a human weaknesses - the slowness of the immoral personal recognition - not as a sinister malicious wicked magician but a high-ranking member of the palace of his time with magical qualities insidious diplomacy , and expansive dreams And general , he brilliantly surroundswithout overshadowing ,the exeptional star-twin (Outstanding Massoud ,Naomi Scott its a revelation) , where with delightful Smith who gives his own unique perfomance show they advocate a wonderful all-time classic fairytale where, although familiar, it continues to fascinate."

"Jerique","9","3","6","13 June 2019"," A Worthy Live-Action Remake
","I wrongfully stood against this film and take back my initial thoughts that Disney ruined the original film. If nothing else, Disney has improved upon their original version of this classic timeless tale.<br/><br/>After seeing the previews everywhere I had originally thought that Marwan Kenzari was objectively the better choice for Jasmine and that Will Smith's performance would be questionable at best. Count me surprised, and the secrecy surrounding Friend Like Me and Prince Ali musical numbers made for a truly memorable experience. Nothing, not even the original with Robin Williams, can touch the astounding effect that those two performances did in the film.<br/><br/>Although the film plays out in a different sequence, and at times in the beginning of the film some of the lines feel phoned in, the film still has a classic feel with a modern atmosphere that any audience can relate too. Even though the time period is set to a time way back when, the dialogue is fun and easy to keep up with and makes for a fun experience for any age.<br/><br/>It's only fitting that Frank Welker returns as the Cave of Wonders voice while Iago is voiced by the building legend Alan Tudyk, who is quickly becoming the voice of Disney. In a high budget, great visual effects team by Industrial Light & Magic (Star Wars team) and the wonderful costume design, Aladdin has set the bar for live-action remakes and has delivered with the perfect recipe. We will see what else Disney has up their sleeve."

","Well that was a visual masterpiece - just seen it and it's well worth seeing - now I've got to be honest I know the story , well you know the story but you've probably seen the 1992 version with Robin Williams - I actually haven't but the song 'Whole new world' seemed very familiar !<br/><br/>A huge budget of $180m has grossed over $600 - something tells me Disney made a wise decision to employ Guy Ritchie . Second boy of honesty I've never really enjoyed his films I'm not a fan of the cgi induced Sherlock Holmes franchise - but I can see Disney making an Aladdin 2 from this .<br/><br/>The story is a classic though not as old as you think although derived from the Arabian Nights it was a relatively modern day take on the classic tale by a french man which has been the story adapted over and over again that we all love .<br/><br/>It's a musical - that won't surprise many as it's a reinterpretation of the 1992 animated version in live action , brilliantly cast - Will Smith and Naomi Scott steal the show<br/><br/>It's a family feel good movie well worth the watch . You won't leave disappointed .<br/><br/>Pad.A 8/10"
"Alexander_Blanchett","7","9","27","26 May 2019"," Better than my expectations
","It was a decent adaptation. Surely not flawless and it did miss some of the magic of the original Disney cartoon however it was a worthy remake with many fine elements and actually it had some of the old magic.
The most surprising fact was the performance of Will Smith who actually nailed it most of the times and really captured some of the charmes Robin Williams gave the original. He was funny and well nuanced. A positive surprise and a really good performance by Smith. I wasnt too fond of Mena Massoud who looked the role but needed some more acting lessons. Naomi Scott was generally good and a perfect choice for the role of Jasmine (yes I know there are discussion regarding her origins but she looked the role and the performance was fine). Not a fan at all of the casting of Marwan Kenzari who first of all was too young and second really overacted the role in a bothering way.
What I liked was that the film reimagined some of the iconic scenes but also added some new moments or rather changed and modernized moments of the original so it wasnt just a 1:1 remake. The production design and costumes were great. Guy Ritchie generally did a solid job. also the Visuals worked. So generally a fine film with some flaws but definitely not the cheese fest I was expecting but rather an enjoyable adventure romance."

","I'll be honest, I was torn on watching this. I grew up loving the original and was worried it wouldn't transfer to live action well. However, my daughter loves Jasmine, so off we went!<br/><br/>My fears were completely misplaced! Not only was it visually stunning, but the characters was exceptional! Each role was perfectly cast. The actress playing Jasmine was spellbinding with an excellent voice. Powerful and as in the original a very strong female lead. The gentleman playing Aladdin was fantastic! Incredibly handsome, looking exactly like the original prince charming come to life. As always, Will Smith was charming, hilarious and I'm so happy he was cast! No one besides Will could've filled those pointy shoes after the passing of the late, great Robin Williams.
The rest of the cast was perfect also! Jasmine's handmaiden and her father really shone in the movie also.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie! My family all enjoyed it very much. My only complaint is that the soundtrack is stuck in my head again after all these years, haahaaaaaa!!"

","The best live action Disney remake to date? This team says YES! We all love the original and love how this movie paid tribute to that while putting their own little spins on it. This is the first remake that we would say is less scary than the cartoon.
We were nervous about the music, but with minor exceptions the soundtrack was absolutely fantastic! The acting was marvelous! The imagery was great and while the way it was filmed took me a minute to adjust to- I ended up loving it. This is a Disney princess movie that we want our little ones growing up with!

","Alright, I was 11 when Aladdin came out in '92 and I instantly fell in love with the film and soundtrack 😍👏<br/><br/>Now fast forward to tonight and I've now seen the live adaptation at 38. I won't lie, I was super skeptical about the film for so many reasons but the main reason was that Robin Williams could never be replaced as the Genie.<br/><br/>I was ready to leave the theater within the first 20 minutes due to the pacing of the film but I knew I couldn't do that without seeing what the always charismatic Will Smith could possibly do to fill these impossible blue shoes 🤔<br/><br/>I am SO glad that I stayed because as soon as the Friend Like Me song started the movie flipped the nostalgic kid switch in me 😃 It was such an amazing sequence and I knew instantly that Will Smith was the perfect casting for this role. I'm certain that Robin Williams would approve of his respectful take 💙<br/><br/>If you have reservations about this film, let them go. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with what entire cast and crew were able to create. It may not be a whole new world but it's pretty close 😉👍"
"PatSpringleaf","7","5","13","23 May 2019"," Pretty fun re-imagining with a very empowering Princess and well fleshed our characters overall
","Naomi Scott's performance and take on Princess Jasmine is amazing, if you have young kids whether they be male or female I would highly recommend you show them this film as I found her to be much more empowering and fleshed out than the majority of the female characters (or just characters for that matter) that I saw on screen growing up (which wasn't long ago I was born in 2001) and feel she'd make a great role model for impressionable kids. In fact while I still personally prefer he original I think all the characters in this where much more fleshed out, the music was still great (the lyrics of Arabian Nights are much more positive about Middle Eastern culture although none of the songs beat the originals) including Jasmines new songs, the new Character Daria worked great and ultimately I quite enjoyed it.<br/><br/>As for the overall movie, I'd recommend going into this film as if it's a pantomime that clearly drew from Disney's film and won't get everything right but is still fun to watch on its own merit. They knew they couldn't top the original if they just copied it, so they tried doing a reimagining that would play to its own strengths and I find it worked in its favour."
"mb_yk","8","5","13","23 May 2019"," My eyes rolled when I saw the review score
","I played the video games in the 90s and watched the original multiple times. Having come out if the cinema, I was shocked to see the review score. In my opinion I rate this 8/10 because it brought back so many good memories.<br/><br/>Let's start with the negatives. The bits where this is let down are mainly the ""street"" scenes. They could have shot it in multiple countries to give it an authentic vibe, but instead opted for a set and you can tell. At times it looks like they're walking around Disneyland rather than real streets. I also felt it was a bit slow to get going. I'm not complaining about the music, the original had maybe 8/9 songs in it, so this is a music based film so expect that if you haven't seen the original or can't remember it.<br/><br/>Now the positives. Thought Aladdin, Jasmine and Genie were excellent and the handmaiden. It also had a beautiful ending, really rounded that off well. Overall I thought the shooting of the film was great, it was just the opening scenes I wasn't keen on. The live action such as the magic carpet added some light entertainment.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is a kids film and from what I could see in the cinema, the younger crowd loved it. Kids dancing to all the songs etc. If you're expecting something like LaLaLand then you'll be disappointed. It's a great kids film, which nostalgic adults can actually enjoy."
"reagansteyn","8","5","13","23 May 2019"," Go and make up your own mind
","I think people are a little too attached to the original 92 film and I get it! In saying that, I love the fact that all these Disney stories are being recreated as live action. It's a new take on nostalgia. I'm the type of person that secretly watches cartoons, animated movies, plays video games from my childhood (really need to find an Atari now that I think of that...), anyway I love taking trips down memory lane so if anyone should be hesitant to see a remake, it's me! This movie did not disappoint at all. It pays homage to the original in more ways than one. Does it feel like a 2 hour film? Nope. It keeps you engaged from start to finish. The cinematography is brilliant however a little too much CGI perhaps. Will Smith does a good job of playing the genie despite a few ""cringey"" moments. I guess I'm just not used to seeing Smith in a Disney musical film. Overall an enjoyable movie that everyone will love if you like reliving your childhood in a modern way."
"timgames-59540","9","5","13","22 May 2019"," One. Big. Party.
","I would describe the movie as one big joyful partyy. The movie is not one big adventure, it also has a lot of comedy, but also love stories and wise lessons. Music is of the highest caliber, same goes for the special effects (CGI and practical) and the cinematography. Besides being stunning eye candy the movie has an interesting story to offer with great characters that develop graduadly throughout the movie. The content is a bit inconsistent with the source material but I learned to overlook it as it is a powerful tale on its own,<br/><br/>Besides a few minor inconsistencies and goofs that you will easily learn to overlook I think this is one of the better reboots in cinema history. It is on the same level or even better than the original movie.<br/><br/>Would I reccomend it? Yes, I would to anyone of any age."

I liked that they stuck to the original songs and storyline but changed it slightly so it really would feel like a movie on its on and not just a copy.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't expect much and with Aladdin being my favourite movie growing up I didn't think it could be redone, but this movie was great and I enjoyed it a lot.

"Alise_shenle","10","6","17","26 May 2019"," Modern Feminist and Value Adding to the original
","Aladdin is what Beauty and the Beast should have been like. Aladdin and Jasmine had great chemistry and Jasmine's singing voice is the best out of all the female leads in previous movies.
People often wonder why they should watch a live-action remake when the cartoon version is already so good. And Disney's live action were often disappointments, copy the original scene by scene. Not this one. Aladdin is the first and only disney princess movie to be named after a male lead, but it is also the most feminist and empowering one.
I was surprised to see that Jasmine is not a damsel in distress but she actually do something. She is the true star of the movie. Aladdin was a lost poor boy until he met her and unlocked his true potential.
The movie is exciting, both visually and in terms of action."
"movieman6-413-929510","5","9","29","24 May 2019"," The modernized live-action Aladdin is especially fun for the younger generation.
","Aladdin is a live-action film version of the 1992 animation film of the same name. The film is directed and partly written by Guy Ritchie, the director of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.<br/><br/>The film is set in the fictional port city of Agrabah and is about the good-natured street rat Aladdin (Mena Massoud). When he encounters undercover on the streets of Agrabah Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) and knows how to help, a connection between the two soon develops. Due to their different statuses, according to the rules, they cannot start a relationship with each other. Still, Aladdin Jasmin keeps on visiting.
When caught, Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) tries to use Sultan Aladdin's adviser to rob a cave and steal a lamp. Once in the cave, Aladdin finds the lamp, but gets stuck. When Aladdin examines the lamp, he manages to get the Genie (Will Smith) out of the lamp. The Genie tells Aladdin that he can make three wishes. With the help of this magic and some lies, Aladdin tries to make a better chance to start a relationship with Jasmine. Aladdin must now cleverly play everything right to really have a chance at Jasmine, but must also be careful and ensure that nobody and especially Jafar does not realize that he uses magic.<br/><br/>With this live-action version of Aladdin, they have created a modern version that is especially fun for the younger generations. This live action may take some getting used to for older viewers who are familiar with the Disney animation version, because the live action film has a different atmosphere and pace compared to the animation. Some extra added information makes some characters appear more dramatic. The best atmosphere in the film is the Arabic atmosphere, because the Arabic cast and film sets also make the film look like a Bollywood film.
The live action also has more songs and dance scenes in the film compared to the animation. In this way the film sometimes comes across as a musical version of Aladdin. The well-known songs from the animation can also be heard in this live-action film, but some have also been modernized. For example, they have quickly incorporated modern music genre into music. The tempo of the songs has also been set down a little faster. With some dance scenes it also seems as if they are being played faster, which may seem strange.<br/><br/>The effects are unfortunately not so good either, because you can often see where they used CGI or a green screen. Thus the non-human characters such as Abu, Rajah and the flying carpet seem fake without a real personality what they did in the animation.
In the first trailer where the Genie was shown in its blue form, the effects did not look good. This caused some concerns for Aladdin fans, but there was hope that the effects would have improved in the final film. Unfortunately, this is not really the case, because the Genie often looks a bit fake in its blue form and sometimes seems a bit unusual.<br/><br/>Most of the cast does the acting work well. Most are also cast to look realistic as people from the Arab world. For viewers it may take some getting used to seeing Mena Massoud as Aladdin. It takes a while before he knows how to put down the role in the right way, because he seems a bit uncertain in the beginning.
Naomi Scott knows how to perform her role best compared to the rest of the cast. She appears credible as a live-action version of Jasmine. Her version of Jasmine stands up more for the equal rights of women. She also sounds good musically in this film. She knows how to convey the famous Aladdin song A Whole New World together with Mena Massoud. Jasmine even got her own song Speechless in this movie.
Marwan Kenzari comes across as a bit less like Jafar compared to the animation and version of Jafar from the TV series Once Upon a Time. Both of these versions of Jafar had a more sinister voice than Marwan Kenzari's version. In addition to his actions, he does not always look like a real villain.
The one who had the biggest shoes to fill was Will Smith, because the role of the Genie in the Disney animation film was conceived and written for Robin Williams. The writers of the animation based the genius personalities on Robin Williams's comedian work before they had officially asked him for the role. With Robin Williams his unique voice acting, he managed to improve animation films in a positive way. Will Smith had to think so well and long before he wanted to play the role of the Genie in the live-action Aladdin. In the end, he agreed and mastered the role in a respectful way. He best portrays the role of the Genie when he is not in his blue form. He has managed to put the role further on his own kind of comedy and music style."
"rockman182","7","9","29","24 May 2019"," Aladdin (2019)
","We are deep in the new age of Disney. One where beloved animated features are remade in a live action format, for better or for worse. When Aladdin was announced, I was game. The animated version is one of my favorite Disney films and I liked the look of the actor they got to play Aladdin. Will Smith's genie definitely looked weird and creepy when they first showed him but I was still going to give this a fair shot. Having seen it, it was better than I expected it to be. As a matter of fact, it was thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film is a bout a poor street thief names Aladdin, who one day encounters the princess of the city of Agrabah. He stumbles across a magic lamp and a eccentric magical genie who grants him three wishes. Aladdin wants to enlist the help of the genie to win the heart of the princess. However, an evil sorcerer who advises for the Sultan of Agrabah wants to get hold of the genie to enable his evil plans of becoming the Sultan himself. The film stars Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, Will Smith, and Marwan Kenzari.<br/><br/>I thought overall the casting was solid. Massoud is great as Aladdin in this, and emulates the animated version. Scott is a beautiful and worthy Jasmine, Smith is a highlight in the film due to his bombastic and entertaining performance. The only downside was Kenzari as Jafar. Was so unbelievably hammy and a terrible fit in the role, for me anyways. Apart from that its nice to see a live action update on a beloved tale. For the most part the effects, costume design, and the fantastical world created looked wonderful. At times the CG on Abu and Rajah looked ropy.<br/><br/>This is a long film. Its a full 40 minutes longer than the animated classic. It adds new elements to the film but overall feels like a modern and fairly faithful update to the animated film. Much like Beauty and The Beast. I can see people not being blow away by this but for what it was and how bad it could have been, I was pretty impressed. Not sure how I feel about the live action Disney films in the long run but Aladdin is one of the better ones for sure.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

",""" . . . steal a kingdom, and you're a statesman,"" is how arch villain ""Jafar"" explains ""The Art of the Deal"" to ALADDIN. Jafar, of course, is an aptly drawn proxy for the Mouse House's full-on frontal assault against alleged POTUS #45 a year prior to the 2020 American Presidential tussle. Jafar echoes the rump cushion administration in continually saying ""Women should be seen, NOT heard!"" Not unlike the USA's Game-Show-Host-in-Chief, Jafar prevents the People's Choice from becoming her country's first female ruler. Using hypnotism, sorcery, and bogus nationalistic threats to rile up and control his deplorable base of core supporters, Jafar is solely obsessed with the accumulation of dictatorial powers and ill-gotten wealth. Short of reading the Emoluments Clause from the U.S. Constitution, ALADDIN could not be more specific in vilifying the rump cushion mob. Doubtless scores of movies will try to nail the swindler currently bankrupting Casino America during the next few months.

","I honestly didn't know what I was going into and it was such a delightful surprise! It really exceeded my expectations and I had fun during the whole movie. Critics are really being harsh and I can't believe that beauty and the beast was more critically praised. The movie was so bland and boring while this one has so much energy and life to it. The characters had amazing chemistry with each other and the lines were delivered smoothly. The two things I was worried about that subsided as soon as the movie started are: 1- Jafar's character: Marwan tries his best to make but the material he's given isn't strong enough. I wish they developed his character more. However, I didn't mind the change they did it with his character as it fits more with this version. 2- Cultural representation: The trailers made the movie look like a production from bollywood. Not hating on the Indian culture, but it really annoyed me as Arab to see a Middle Eastern/Arabic folk tale that we all know long before Disney introduced it to the world to be represented in a fully different culture. Fortunately, the movie looks and feels way more Arabian such Arabic writings here and there, hearing some people speaking Arabic briefly, the names and appearance of the people of Agrabah and of course the amazing score! Although there are some slight hints of India/South Asia in the clothing and dancing, but I didn't mind that at all.<br/><br/>I would've give it a 10 if the cinematography was better. This is my only issue with movie as it looked like high budget TV soap opera in some scenes.<br/><br/>Don't miss on this one! You'll have fun."

","Apparently there seem to be lot of negative reviews for this gem of a work. I personally prefer World Cinema for updating myself for works from around the world. Fantasy genre is not my type. I had watch this movie for the sake of my son.<br/><br/>But, let me put it in simple words: the movie was fully enjoyable. The music, dances, songs, extravagant sets and the 'magic' blows you away! I was smiling and laughing throughout, what more can be expected from a cinematic production then? I found the movie fits perfectly in its genre. Fine, there must have been couple of glitches - but then nothing can be 'perfect' so to say.<br/><br/>I recommend families with kids to watch this one as there is not just Aladin story but also some gems of wisdom in dialogs! I don't want to spoil it for you by quoting any, so watch the movie yourself in a cinema."

The original song they made for Jasmine really deepens her character, and all the songs are amazing.. I was mesmerized the whole time and in tears cause it's just so majestic. The last thing to say is the leads got a very great chemistry, they just so beautiful together.. Go watch it, you won't be sorry"
"tyler-catanzarite","5","8","27","24 May 2019"," So I just got back and oh boy how disappointing
","This remake of Aladdin is very disappointing, and very pointless. Why does this movie exist? Mostly just for a nostalgic cash grab.
Surprisingly the part I liked was will Smith, which us funny cause I thought the genie would be the worst part, it's the best part. He is the only thing keeping this movie from being a 3. This movie shouldnt have been made, it tries to be like the animated film, but the animated film was 90 minutes, this is 2 hours and 8 minutes and you can tell they tried stretching 90 minutes to fit into a 2 hour long movie.
The acting is also meh, naomi Scott was good so was will Smith. Jafar sucked though, by far the worst acting in the movie. Here's the thing about this movie, it tries so hard to recreate the animation. The thing with something's in the animation only will work in the animation, the giant ugly CGI genie and Jafar are two examples of things that dont translate well from cartoon to live action. Jafar looks like he did in the animation, but here he looks like from a power rangers episode and it doesnt fit.
Overall I would give this film a 5/10, the musical numbers are pretty good and will Smith is actually good in it, probably will lower it in multiple viewings who knows.
The jungle book is still the best Disney remake"
"aguti-09325","1","3","7","29 April 2020"," People stop being nostalgic!
","All I want to say is ugh! I do not fully understand the point of a remake. To copy 60% of the cartoon and change 40%. Why even bother copying that 60%.<br/><br/>Money hungry folks think it's amazing what creators can do with CGI, therefore let's make hundreds of millions.<br/><br/>Folks we need to do better as a society.

","They didn't have to come up with anything, they had a perfectly good source material right there! Yet they ruined it.<br/><br/>I believe this is what happens when people don't understand the magic of animation but try to do a movie like this anyway. Those people being Disney is painful, Walt must be ashamed and in pain somewhere, and so should be Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>Bright saturated colors in cheap fabrics, colorful tiny cardboard sets and overuse of visual effects do not look magical. An uncalled elaborated choreography every couple of minutes don't tell a story. A pretty girl is not a princess, a nice guy is not a charming hero. Will Smith is not funny for the sake of it!<br/><br/>This is all wrong. The cast is wrong, the costume and set design are wrong, the songs are flat, hell the director couldn't even use the right camera to film in those tiny rooms and maybe make it look like it actually was a city, a palace, a desert or any kind of open space! I felt like I was watching a play!"

I'm confused. What did people expect? It was fun, the soundtrack was excellent, the cast all perfectly executed their roles and I had a smile on my face through most of the film. Yes its probably 20 minutes too long but other than that...get a grip everyone. It's fun and that's what I wanted.

Both very enjoyable and entertaining.<br/><br/>If you remember we have many versions of Robin Hood, Sherlock Holmes, Batman, Superman....and the list goes on. All played by multiple actors and within their own style...some better than others, but enjoyable to each of their own degree.<br/><br/>So critics, give some slack when watching a movie, and less comparing."

","I've seen Aladdin (2019) 11 times now at the cinema! First time I saw it, I liked it but wasn't impressed, so i went to see it a 2nd time and really got hooked and obviously had to see it 9 more times! The film has an amazing cast; Will, Mena, Naomi, Marwan, Navid and the other supporting actors! The storyline is great of course, and the original songs are there and the new one Speechless, which Naomi smashed singing it in the film were amazing! Speechless is a powerful song and when Naomi performed it as Jasmine (she sung it live during that scene btw!) it just gave me goosebumps!<br/><br/>The whole cast was amazing to watch together and their character relationships (Genie+ Aladdin, Aladdin+Jasmine, Jasmine+Baba, Jasmine+Dalia, Jasmine+Jafar etc) If you watch the film as many times I did, you notice these relationships and their importance in the film!<br/><br/>The costumes and sets were impressive too, when Jasmine is walking down the stairs and her the train of her outfit is coming down the stairs it gave me chills, such perfection!<br/><br/>This film is a classic and definitely exceeded expectations! It has romance, comedy, action, drama what more could you want?<br/><br/>Definitely go see it!"
"thibault-li","8","3","7","26 July 2019"," Magical and better than the orginal
","I didn't go with great expectations to watch this movie because of the average-good ratings but I have been, hooked and amazed from the first scene to the last.<br/><br/>First I salute Guy Ritchie's directing. He made a great job for directing all the actions/VFX scenes, making the camera flit around like a margic carpet. The romantic and emotional scenes were well-directed too.<br/><br/>The first strong point of the movie is its great visuals thanks to the budget and artistic choices : The film sets and costumes were great and the CGI were amazing. All the scenes with the genius were truly fantastic especially in his first appearance scene (I particularly like a sequence where he breaks the fourth wall like it has never been done before).<br/><br/>The second strong point is the musical performances. Most of the songs are remake of the original ones but singers are great (even in the French version) and the orchestral parts are great. There are maybe six or seven musical scenes, efficiently presented and not invading at all.<br/><br/>The third strong point is the actors : Mena Massoud was OK, but I particularly love Naomi Scott who was stunning and truly revealed by this role.
Will Smith is also perfect as a genius, playing a great side kick, wingman and friend for Aladdin (he looks very young for a guy at 50). I think that's his best role since ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" and he could use his singing/dancing skills for the role. On the other hand, Jaffar looked less evil than the original one and does not even has his own song, but maybe it was to make him more serious.<br/><br/>Finally, the dialogues are quick-witted like in most of Guy Ritchies' movies, and funny especially in the romantic scenes. The film also had themes of high drama like impossible love or the restrictions of patriarchal societies.<br/><br/>Aladdin won't be remembered as movie of profound and philosophical meaning reflection, but it is great entertainement that I would like to advise you to look in a theater because of the visuals and sounds (music and souns). For me, it's the best blockbuster of the year up to now, even better than Avengers : Endgame and it is a big surprise.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10 (modified)"
"justinboy-50295","8","3","7","24 July 2019"," Best Disney Live Action So Far
","The movie was very entertaining and Will Smith does and excellent job of doing the genie role justice. I was not sure he would be able to live up to Robin Williams legacy, but he made it his own and pulled it off nicely. My only criticism is Jasmine. Her singing was very auto tuned and while she is beautiful, I think she could have been better cast."
"ashley_halloween","10","3","7","23 July 2019"," Don't compare it to the animated version
","So many people don't like the film because they want it to be exactly like the animated version. Once you see it as its own thing I think it is a great movie. I know a lot of people like to rip on disney remakes but honestly it was a good movie. The casting was great, although Jafar could have been a little bit scarier. The story was similar to the original but had some added plot points that actually fit well. I am glad they gave Jasmine a stronger presence in this film. It had good comedy and action, the romance felt very realistic and organic. The music was great and I enjoyed that there was more instrumental intertwined in the songs. The visuals were stunning and beautiful. It was a very good movie."

","Not sure where all the negative feedback comes from. Top to bottom I loved nearly every aspect here. Genie, Aladdin, and Jasmine were terrific! Only area that needed improvement was Jafar (felt like a more soft-spoken version of the character, should've had a stronger voice).
Music was beautiful much like the original and it took some slight creative liberties in an enjoyable remake. Not too far from a 10/10 in my book. Jafar keeps it from that."

I'm sure the monkey was 100% CGI as was the tiger and elephant. The magic carpet had a personality.<br/><br/>Will Smith was just as engaging as was Robin Williams.<br/><br/>Any diversions from the animated version were quite welcome.

"adriano-40012","8","3","7","20 June 2019"," Arabian Nights
","As most of the fans I grew up with Disney movies. So we can expect more adults as the main audience for this movie. The thing is people started to argue, before the movie actually hit the screen. When I heard Smith's going to play a Dschinni. I was upset cause for me Will Smith player in absolute weak plots since I am Legend and I don't consider him as a triple a actor from the top notch. If it wasn't for the trailer !!! The CGI did so well on him and the entire movie with it's choreography, decoration, costumes and CGI at all created a fantastic atmosphere.<br/><br/>I went there yesterday and I just hoped its not average. The movie was build up beautiful. From the beginning with the story telling to the finish. Sure there are a few differences. But really only a few in contrast to the classic movie: Dschinni's story about Aladdin, the girl Darlia is involved in the movie. It really doesn't change a lot and made you feel not impressed. I think it gives the movie itself its own flavor.<br/><br/>The actors were well chosen. If you ask me i think the most paid actor for the movie was definitely Will Smith. He suited so well in his role he was hilarious and adorable.<br/><br/>Aladdin & Jasmin had great representers.<br/><br/>The story was clear and known, but no way more serious that the cartoon. It's still Disney.<br/><br/>I liked the musical when Jasmin's parts started but some songs were technically from the instrumental aspect good, but the translation in German wasn't that good ( I watched the movie in Germany ).<br/><br/>Another point I like to say is that even though the actor for Jaffar was physically well chosen. I think his performance wasn't impressing and frighten enough.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment was just they forced me to watch in 3D. That's just a general issue I experienced with blockbuster movies.<br/><br/>I hope y'all understand my view and sorry if my English seems a bit average.<br/><br/>I can just put it to your heart if you love Disney movies then go watch this movie with your partner, friends or family.<br/><br/>The movie gets a 9 for touching my heart for the nostalgia, for the cast, CGI and location. I didn't regret for paying to see it. It was worth it."

I was totally mesmerized but what i saw on screen,it was magical & the entire cast was superb especially my childhood hero Will Smith,he was fantastic & even better than the great Robin Williams R.I.P un my opinion!!!<br/><br/>I've always loved Will Smith as an actor & Rapper & an icon & a man & here his performance was one of his best!!! Definitely in his top 5 greatest performances of his fantastic career!!!
Smith sprinkled Fresh Prince over his magical fun loving,feelgood genie & he was a pleasure to watch.
There's nothing like Smith completely enjoying himself on screen, his charm was there & his big smile, Will Smith is still the best movie star ever in my opinion.
After growing up watching & loving the Cool guy, it's so nice to see him still on the big screen & his fame star still hasn't faded.
Yep, Big Will is my all time favourite actor & he means alot to me as his movie's have gotten me through some tough times in my life.<br/><br/>Aladdin was also fantastic,beautifully played by Mena Massoud, this guy is excellent & will be a huge star!!!
Princess Jasmine is absolutely beautiful with a strong woman presence & a stunningly beautiful voice too, she is perfectly played by the excellent Naomi Scott.<br/><br/>The performances of everyone is spot on & perfect as is all the songs & music!!! It's a beautifully filmed masterpiece full of stunning scenery & lovely characters with morals & inner strength,there's lots of messages in this CLASSIC.

You know when you rewatch a cartoon you loved as child as an adult and realize the depth that is terribly lacking? The depth added to our beloved characters in this live action is BRILLIANT! They branched out on all aspects including on the score, the new songs, and they developed the storyline where it was desperately needed.<br/><br/>Can we also talk about Aladdin (Mena Massoud) and Jasmine's (Naomi Scott) explosive on screen chemistry? Massoud is the perfect human embodiment of Aladdin - zero disappointments there. Scott as Jasmine is a match made in heaven. ALSO! Everyone needs to stop b*tching about no one being able to follow Robin Williams as genie - it's not a fair comparison whatsoever. Will made it his own! Don't be harsh and remember he's not trying to be Robin - its The Fresh Prince version! Regardless of anyone's opinion, I think we can all agree there is no one else who could have followed it like Will! GO SEE IT! You'll like if not LOVE it!"

"Offworld_Colony","4","2","4","4 February 2020"," A weird sort of remix of the Disney classic that has the cringe and production values as a high-school play and looks somehow more artificial than its animated counterpart.
","Guy Ritchie's signature 'pave-over-the-cracks' editing and no sense of pace, rushes us around through the previous film's greatest hits in a totally awkward way. The film is too cartoony to be a more grounded reboot and is too realistic in places to have the charm of the animated version. I mean why is the monkey real except people still bounce and flip around in cartoon fashion? Why change The Sultan and take out all of his lightness, and why change Jafar to take away all of his menace? (although I sort of like his sort of sad beta male energy and street-rat backstory) It's a totally toothless film, no passion in the musical numbers, no reinvention, just a bunch of decisions made in the wrong direction. It's missing all of the magic and wit of the original in the same terrible street set over and over again and dull harsh sunlight; remember the beautiful wistful moonlight scene over Agrabah in Disney's Aladdin where Aladdin and Jasmine see the same landmark in two different ways? Both prisoners of their birth? His home more of a palace than hers? That's replaced in almost every way by a scene that looks like a Nickelodeon TV show.<br/><br/>I was nowhere nearly convinced by Naomi Scott before I saw the film and then almost immediately I was convinced at her ability to be a live action Disney Princess, her facial features, purity of look, and voice she puts on are pitch perfect Disney and reassuring. Mena Massoud as Aladdin was horrific at first, he looks like a waifish and oafish nerd and incapable of standing up for himself, the animated Aladdin was coy, sheepish but loveable and aspirational. However Massoud blossoms when he's Prince Ali, he's hilarious, it works, and his banter is on point.<br/><br/>Now, on to Will Smith's Genie. At first look, every decision to digitally animate his face is all kinds of uncanny valley and it looks like 1/3 of the performance that Will Smith usually gives and makes the Genie an unapproachable frightening alien figure. But every time he looks like Smith, despite being a cop out, you can see he's acting up a storm; a warm and human figure, I would happily see more of him free in a solo movie. He's funny and full of wisdom, it's a different approach to Robin Williams, but that's what we need in 2019. But I don't remotely believe his relationship with Aladdin due to some reshuffling of scenes and no real actual moments of warmth between them.<br/><br/>Menken's music is the real star here, just fun and modern enough and just reverential and nostalgic enough. It totally rides the line better than any other element of the film. It serves to make me ache even more for the spirit of the original.<br/><br/>This film reminds me of Snyder's Watchmen, a copy of a copy, it looks the same, but nothing of what I liked about the source material has been translated well. The film has none of the danger, magic or fourth-wall antics or lyricism of the original. It's got dodgy autotune and worse CGI. Everything is cringey about how off-brand it is. Like the Panda Cola version of Disney's Aladdin."
"Leofwine_draca","4","2","4","23 January 2020"," Why bother?
","ALADDIN is the latest Walt Disney cartoon to be given the live action treatment, although so much of it is heavily CGI animated (from the backdrops to the monkey) that you wonder why they bothered. An improbably good-looking lead works his way through a hackneyed plot with heavily-telegraphed supporting roles (the romantic interest, the evil black-clad villain) with no depth or intrigue anywhere in sight. The action is monotonous and mindless, with no realism or attention to the basics of physics, and a blue-skinned Will Smith, although out of place, becomes the most interesting thing about this (alongside a handful of songs). Otherwise, it's yet another wasted opportunity."

","Finally, a live action adaptation from Disney that is worth the watch! There were just enough changes that made it it's own while still sticking to the main story.

As rotten tomatoes slowly becomes a fallen empire the audience wins again with this wonderful movie! Even the actors sound like the cartoon singing in this.

"jannahjoy","10","2","4","23 December 2019"," I was worried... but pleasantly surprised!
","As a massive fan of the original Aladdin, I deliberately didn't go see this in the cinema. I had seen the trailers, read articles about the cast, and decided that this was going to be another failed live action remake that wouldn't do the original justice.
I couldn't have been more wrong!
Finally got around to watching it this weekend - and absolutely loved it!!! Yes, it is different in some ways to the original. But I still found it to be an awesome movie!
The music was quite upbeat, and the new song was a good addition and added to the depth of Jasmines character.
I was worried about the characters of Jafar and Genie - how can you recreate these non-animated and still capture their essence? I thought both did great. Although Jafar looked different to the animated version, he still captured the evil heart of the character.
My family watched this 3 times in one weekend. My kid/teen boys
have never seen the original, but loved this movie. I'm an original fan, and loved it."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","4","24 October 2019"," Another Disney Live-Action Adaptation. Another Downright Terrible Remake.
","Since I've already jumped into this sea of Disney's unnecessary & unwarranted live-action adaptations of their beloved animation masterpieces, might as well check out a couple more of their insipid attempts before calling it quits. Next up in the line was Aladdin. My expectations were even lower. And it still managed to fare worse on all accounts.<br/><br/>With its posters, previews & entire marketing screaming nothing but a parody, it's suffice to say that even the x-rated adaptation would've delivered better feels than what this awful remake had to offer. Devoid of all the great bits that made the 1992 original one of the best examples of its kind, Aladdin continues Disney's new-found mantra of denting their own legacy.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Guy Ritchie, the film looks awful on the outside & is hollow from within. The characters are never convincing in their respective roles. VFX is all over the place, impressive on rare counts, terrible on other occasions. Actors aren't any good, for they all chip in with bad inputs, including Will Smith who takes the role of Genie yet acts like he's playing Will Smith.<br/><br/>What it rehashes from the original looks n feels vastly inferior to the original. What it modifies or adds to the plot & characters ruins it even further. The musical numbers have the visual spectacle to some extent but not the heart & charm that made them mesmerising in the animated medium. Ritchie's direction is mediocre, performances are off-putting, and the entire cast is pretty much a miscast.<br/><br/>A ghastly blend of weak direction, poor writing, unfunny wit, substandard production values, muddled editing, laughable characterisation & dull performances that never for once realises that the real strength of the 1992 animated musical fantasy lied in its simplicity. Filled to the brim with nothing but shortcomings, this latest adaptation of Aladdin doesn't hold a candle to its animated source, and is forgettable in every sense of the word."

","I'd wanted to see this movie ever since it first came out in theaters, but all my weekends were booked. So I got the movie the moment it arrived on digital release and I was hooked. Beautiful visuals, good acting, fantastic music, and it's not too scary either. In some ways, I liked this better than the animated version. This may be my new-favorite Will Smith movie ever since I first watched his earlier work in Fresh Prince of Bel Air and 1996's Independence Day. Everyone did their job well, especially Will Smith. So far, this is the best of all the Disney remakes of the animated lineup."

","We have watched and enjoyed some of the other Disney live action remakes so did have high hopes for this one. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.

It just felt right. I absolutely love the cast, I believe they did a spectacular job choosing the actors. I think anybody that doesn't like this movie is because they forgot what being a kid is, they are watching it with judging eyes instead of just enjoying it. The songs are perfect, I love the new song that Jasmine sings! Goosebumps every time!! And my ultimate favorite Disney song ""Friend like me"" by will smith is flawless. Fun, thrilling, romantic, colorful, It has it all. I don't agree with people who are saying that the cgi genie is bad, it looks exactly like Will smith people, come on, live a little, enjoy it instead of criticizing so much! Can you do a better genie? I don't think so! I'm gonna go watch it again since I bought the Blu-ray and my daughter loves it!"

"spcmnstr","2","2","4","22 September 2019"," Just to enjoy the songs and nothing more
","Thank goodness my expectations were not high.<br/><br/>The good things for the movie:
-The environment is perfect. The architecture is correct since the original story from Arabian Nights. I like the mixture of Byzantine, India and Arabian. Even the costumes are correct.
-Songs is good. Even the additional song 'Speechless' is beautiful. I expect nothing more from Alan Menken.<br/><br/>The bad things:
-The story is too rushed and chopped off. Story line is lacking. There are no depths even between the characters. It feel like just copy-pasting.
-The characters are too shallow. For example; Jasmine's mother is nothing but a queen from a kingdom and a bracelet. They could have shown the audience her character as lovable mother to Jasmine in her 'Speechless' scene instead of Thanos-snapped people. And Jafar? He supposed to be cunning and manipulative. But we get a greedy politicians who was a thief. What of Aladdin? He's an orphan, yes but there are no small items from his parents. They could have give him a piece of his mother's shawl to make it more memorable. The Cave of Wonders are just cursed cave with lava trap. Nothing very tempting here.
-The costumes are not modest. The origin is Middle-Eastern and yet the female characters clothes did not cover their chest properly. This part of the world has Islamic influence (in term of culture and fashion). Then there's the 'ball-gown' dresses. smh
-Not very middle-east. As stated in my previous point, Islamic influence. There should not be kissing or any intimate sort between men and women who has no family relations. It is forbidden for them. I watched Bollywood movies and none of them has a kissing scene. Dancing scenes, sure but there was no equivalent of 'waltz'. If you want dancers, they're only performers to entertain the guests. While on the topic, the marriage scenes is just stupid. In this region, bride (preferably veiled and in red and gold if they using Indian customs) and groom sat on a cushion separately in a room, Imam (a priest) hold the groom's hand and recite the vow (the usual like any wedding), both bride and groom must have at least a witness (in family relation), the bride will give her consent, groom will give a piece of jewelry (equivalent to a wedding ring) and kiss her forehead."

Jafar was definitely the worst. he was supposed to be having a conversation instead he monologues. that's just cringe worthy.I blame the director on that. he can instruct the actor to not monologue but didn't clearly this was the directors move felt rushed (Jasmine and Aladdin met too quick, The desert tunnel didn't appear out of the desert, The singing during the action parts were hard to watch as well. It didn't do justice to the animation sorry to say. The visuals and costumes were good though. I felt the character development was forced and I couldn't emotionally connect with any of the characters. The only thing i disliked was jasmines new song, it was cringey for me. I feel she could've just been more action and less singing about it also she annoying. I couldn't really feel the chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine"

","In the sign of the times, fewer good screenplays result in bland remakes of classic motion picture gems. Again, Disney have done it with little integrity and shame.<br/><br/>I had low expectations for ""Aladdin"" (2019) directed by Guy Ritchie. Sadly, these were realised through loads of auto-tuned emotionless musical songs, an abundance of CGI, and a blue, awkward Will Smith casting call.<br/><br/>Yes, there were qualities to the film: the re-make boasts a strong production design, leaned on the great original score with creative input (in particular ""Arabian Nights""), and showcased excellent visual effects. Other than that, it merely seemed as a return of investment cash-grab from Disney. In spite of this, I must congratulate them on making yet another billion dollar box office receipt for one of their live-action atrocities - hooray.<br/><br/>I do not have much more to add. Not recommended - instead, (re-)watch the formidable classic animated ""Aladdin"" (1992)."

","I was a big fan of Alladin when I was a kid. There I have said it. Liked the movie, had the video game. It was a window to another culture, filled with fantasy and magic. So I was quite excited to see this movie and had my mind open to what would come.<br/><br/>There are several words that now come to mind when thinking about the movie. I promise to avoid most of them not to hurt the sensitive ones.<br/><br/>I do not understand how with such a huge budget most outfits look like they came out of a dollar tree store with a weird mix of Indian looks... Where is this magic land of poliester and autotune located?<br/><br/>Then let's talk about Jafar, that turned from an impressive character in the animated version to a normal bloke that passes the whole movie trying to look mean (and I don't think the issue is the actor). I would say he looks like a moderate leader in our current political panorama.<br/><br/>I was quite touched by the appearance of Elsa from Frozen. The sweet, charming and charismatic Jasmine was now turned into a women with a power goal, looking to become sultan and she has her frozen empowerment song. I have seen frozen, I like frozen, I singalong with frozen. Please, leave Jasmine alone!<br/><br/>With all the special effects I found the images of the movie utterly dull and lacking any fantasy.<br/><br/>The new script additions are just trash, Alladin has become a cheap pimp and the humour of the original movie toned down, as the mystery, magic or sensitivity. Most characters seemed to have lost quite a lot of their character and the star for me is the monkey. Doesn't sing, doesn't talk and resembles the original.<br/><br/>And well, I forgot to talk about Will Smith. I thought it was the best episode yet of the fresh Prince of bel air!<br/><br/>For me, the worst film of the year so far. Picking a great original movie, spending a fortune and presenting this outcome is just sad."

","I do not understand these criticisms. I don't think Disney has had a negative impact on Williams' memory. Smith has made his own thing out of it. Aladdin is my favorite children's animation film, so I had high expectations. I think it's good that they added a few new parts to the story that make a lot of sense in today's time and in the future.
The only shortcoming I have are the sometimes strange faster and slow motion-like sequences. A little weird. But otherwise the film was really successful. Good music and implementation of the actors."

","I am not satisfied with this one. It did not elevate me at all, I watched the film with a blank face except for Will Smith's scenes. It couldn't give justice to the original one.<br/><br/>The cinematography was average and VFX was a joke, I don't know where have they invested a budget of $183 million, definately on sets and costumes but surely not on VFX.<br/><br/>As far as performance is concerned only Will Smith and Naomi Scott could give justice to their characters, rest all were average and dull. Will Smith had perfect comic timing and had a charm in his performance whereas Naomi was stunning and had a great screen presence.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud didn't portrayed Aladdin well.
He was not our Aladdin we have known since decades. He wasn't adventurous, didn't look smart and moreover he was not charismatic. Manzar wasn't intimidating, menacing and never looked threatening. He was quite dull and boring, definately a miscast.<br/><br/>If it had been the original one, it would have never crossed a billion dollar mark. But it did and all credit goes to the legacy set by the original 1994 animated Aladdin.<br/><br/>It's watchable but surely not recommendable."
"belmakasumic","5","0","0","2 June 2020"," Not bad...not good either
","I didn't hate this movie, but there were many things that bothered me. First of all-I loved the songs and the casting was great too. But Bollywood? Why make Alladin and Co Indian? Wasn't Agrabah in Arabia or something? Was this decision because of growing Anti-Muslim sentiment or did Disney want a go at Bollywood. Either way, the ambient changed dramatically because of this. Alladin and jasmine dancing as in a Bollywood movie is either the funniest or the most cringeworthy thing I've seen lately. I felt like this part was a bad fanfiction. Will Smith did not disappoint though-despite the silly trailers. Maybe I'm simply not a fan of Bollywood romance movies and that's where my issues lie. The story is simple-everyone wants the Genie and his powers, like in the originals.I expected more from Jasmine-yes, she gets a song at last, but her rebellion is still simply because she wants to choose whom she marries, nothing more. I think, all things considered, I'll stick to previous versions and the animated series. But if you're looking for a PG-13 movie with many songs, this unnecessary live action will do the trick."

"Rurextrexx34","5","0","0","23 May 2020"," Not bad but not really Great
","This is the second Disney live-action remake I've seen after Beauty and the Beast and probably the last one. Just to be clear, the original Aladdin isn't among my top favorite Disney movies, but it was simple enough and had its charm in its simplicity and of course it had Robin Williams in it. Also, all the characters were unique and likeable in their own way.<br/><br/>Overall, this remake gets very few good things from the original and sadly breaks a lot. Where the remake succeeded: +Will Smith was probably the most fun and enjoyable part of the whole movie. He managed to do a genie in his own way without trying to copy Robin Williams' from 1992. You can argue he was a bit too much himself, but I see nothing wrong with that. +Mena Massound played a decent Aladdin.<br/><br/>I'm guessing he could have done even better job if his character was written better, but sadly that was not the case. Some of the songs were a fresh addition considering the original didn't have that many. I also enjoyed the visuals especially watching it in 4K, even if CGI was too obvious at moments. Where they missed the mark, but still remains watchable:<br/><br/>Aladdin feels more like a Bollywood movie than anything else - from costumes to dances. I thought Agraba was in the Arabian Peninsula but apparently, they moved it to somewhere in South Asia. Naomi Scott, even though performing well, simply was not a good fit for playing Jasmine. The romance between the maid and the genie was completely unnecessary, distracting and quite forced. As a matter of fact her whole character was not needed and could have been left out. And Iago was turned into just a dumb CGI bird and his screen time taken by the one mentioned above. Mena Massoud did a decent role at times, but the chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine wasn't really there. Didn't buy the whole flying carpet scene. The one in the 1992 version was much better. * It feels much less like a children's movie compared to the original. While it may appear more to parents, certainly won't be the same with kids.<br/><br/>Where they failed badly: The actor portraying Jaffar was what almost ruined the whole movie for me. Arguably a story is only as good as it's antagonist and Marwan Kenzari just didn't fit. He was too young to be a vizier and was neither convicting nor menacing at any point. To make bad even worse they decided to make him just another thief. In the cartoon version he treated Aladdin like vermin, while here he almost sympathies with him. Doesn't make any sense. They threw in so much needless extra stuff which made them rush the main story. The original was more fleshed out in 90 minutes than this one in over 130. What you get as an end result is a story burdened with additions that extend it by almost 40 minutes and still adding nothing of value to the movie. * How can some of the most memorable moments in the original be recreated so badly in the remake despite budget and everything. For example, the whole part of Aladdin in the cave, taking the lamp and escaping afterward felt rushed and boring.<br/><br/>Watch it on Disney+ if you have free time. It's not a terrible movie, but nowhere near a classic."

","Whatever the hell the makers were thinking while doing this movie. I haven't watched the old version so I am pretty sure my opinion is not biased. It is very sad that the director thinks that he could entice his audience with such a huge load of cheesiness and very lame phrases. The cast does not even stand up to the level, except for the Vizier. Plus it seems that they do not know the difference between middle east culture and Indian culture. I dont know if all these look the same to you but I am pretty sure that back in the days, the middle east did not resemble as it was portrayed in the movie. And the ending was so dragyyy, like just end it already but no, we have more scenes to disappoint the audience."

The performer who played Aladdin also gave me a lot of surprises. It is really an unprocessed diamond. The role of Princess Jasmine is actually limited in this story, but Disney still strives to create a relatively complete story for her, such as she read a lot of books, love the people, the world, self-awakening, etc. In general, it is a fairy tale that I enjoyed very much.

The classic tracks in the cartoons have been re-interpreted, and new music has been added, and there is a seamless dance, which is perfect. But I know that the score will not be too high. In addition to people who like Disney and like song and dance films, it is estimated that the audience will not be too much. For example, the little girl next to me will be indifferent to the whole process because she can't understand or like this type of music. But for me, this is a perfect work, both childhood memories, but also a fresh feeling. No matter how many points you score, I have a perfect score here."

These 3D scenes allow the audience to experience the scene in the cinema, and to participate in Aladdin's adventure from the bazaar, to the desert, to the cave, to the palace of agrabah from both audiovisual aspects. Using 3D technology, the Disney and pixar production teams managed to create the cave of magic and the smurf comedy scene. In this way, the director managed to incorporate elements of an action film into the comic animation, which made the tense and dangerous atmosphere when Aladdin stole the lamp even more dangerous."

As Robin Williams was so iconic it was almost scary if it went bad but as ever Will Smith is just as Iconic. Jasmin and Aladdin actors are so pure and fit perfectly it's definitely moved into the number 1 spot as Maleficent was always my favourite (and I wasn't keen on Elle Fanning either)<br/><br/>At this point I don't even think the little mermaid live action will top this for me and I very much look forward to the sequel as it's announced to be made just unfortunate it won't be the return of Jafar because a new twist on that would work very well.

","I have rated some films ten stars, but not many. I put off watching this movie for quite some time because well, yet another Disney live-action adaptation. Those are pretty hit or miss.<br/><br/>This is a hit. Throughout the film I was looking for them to really mess it up... but they just never did. It was fun, Will Smith was as enjoyable in his part as expected, and the whole movie was a real romp.<br/><br/>Downsides? None really. Two things I noticed that were basically personal impressions: I wish the main characters had a touch of accent so they didn't seem like they were actors right out of Hollywood; that was a bit of a ""reality breaker""-- hearing them constantly speak pure ""American"". Second, I wish the main song ""Whole New world"" had a little bit better voices overall. But as it is it sounded like their own voices, which I can't fault. If they'd have done a super-professional voice-over it might have sounded fake, so I'll settle for the natural-sounding, non-digitally-fixed voices in the film. Any day. Neither of those things were worth knocking the film down a star.<br/><br/>The one thing that hit a nerve was the genie claiming to be ""the most powerful being in the Universe"". That's not even kosher with the original legends; Djinn are presented as mega-powerful to be sure, but they're not ""Almighty"". Some parents might object to their children being exposed to such philosophy.<br/><br/>The remake was brilliant, the choreography a lot of fun, the CGI well-done (as would be expected). There was nothing in the film I disliked from a production standpoint, and a great deal that I liked a great deal. So ten stars it it. To those who low-starred it: you got issues. This film was a romp. ;D"

","It's a live-action movie based on animation, and it's still a surprise. The movie is not a plot to win. The picture is gorgeous and maintains a high standard in the creation of the fairy tale world. It is natural to follow the trend and add a bit of female awareness. Of the live-action remakes are of high quality.
I rarely browse any information before watching each movie. In addition to not letting my judgment be disturbed, it is more to better feel the charm and fun of the movie and enjoy it to bring you surprise, so before watching the movie I know nothing but this is a live-action fairy tale.
This is a 3D movie, so I have to mention the special effects. It is really natural and has a sense of substitution. It has a very good modification effect.
In addition, there is another feature of the movie critics. There is a musical stage drama. I think the reason why the director put the musical drama components in it is to make the atmosphere and rhythm of the movie more comfortable and become a fairy tale for all ages, otherwise it will become A revenge science fiction movie with a tense plot. The songs in the movie are really, very nice."

Sure there was a surfeit of plasticine, things on strings and dodgy green screen, but there was also a sense of authenticity and creativity - and not just the, admittedly impressive, output of a sophisticated computer programme. In this version of the tale of a street urchin, who vies for possession of the magic lamp with the ambitiously manipulative Grand Vizier - Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott and Marwan Kenzari do their jobs well enough - in a sort of off-broadway fashion. Will Smith certainly oozes charisma as the now famous blue genie but everyone is just too pretty. The production is just too slick; scenery and costumes too perfect - it isn't (and I know is will sound stupid to say of a film about a magic lamp) real! The digital mastery of the real life/animation sequences is flawless, but it has no soul and is far too long, sorry - even if it is a billion dollar movie (or because that's all it really ever wanted to be?)."

","After a lapse of twenty-four years, Disney Aladdin was staged again. Unlike the previous animated version, a lot of changes have been made. The captain at the beginning is telling the child a story, which corresponds to the final outcome. The genie turned out to be a man and had a family and two children! The song retains and also has a new Aladdin theme, ""speechless,"" and I wonder if it has the appeal of ""a whole new world.""."

","I too am one who grew up with the original animated version. I'm a Disney dork for sure and don't really care for the idea of remaking all the animated shows. It seems like a cheap excuse to not be creative and look for new stories. But I'm willing to give them a fair shake. Now if they wanted to take some of these and add to the story (a la Malificent) I would 100% back that kind of new wave of movies. (Off my soap box and moving on to the actual movie)<br/><br/>I won't compare the different actors to the voice actors from the original. They are going to bring their own flavor to the character which can be refreshing. Will Smith was great in his own right! He made good choices with delivery of lines and what he was conveying with his character. Not better or worse than Robin Williams. The actor portraying Jafar didn't strike me as someone who could carry the torch of a villain. Sure he said the right things but he lacked a certain presence that one would expect at minimum for a villain. To me he was simply there to say the next line and move the story along. I didn't enjoy him and I ALWAYS love the villains. Also, Jasmine was better than I expected. I wasn't crazy about the Bollywood feel of some of her main scenes but the actress did alright with what she had.<br/><br/>Changes in the story are expected after seeing Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast remakes. However I can't help but dislike the blatant girl power agenda pushing in all of these new movies. I'm a girl. I stand up for women's rights, equal rights, equality among the work place. But it doesn't feel like it should be in the story. Maybe I'm the only way that feels this way.<br/><br/>Overall not a bad live action. I still won't go to theater to see these as they are released but I don't think they are bad enough to bash either. Just blah until Disney decides to be more creative and come up with something unique."

I actually thought it was refreshing to see Jasmine as more than just occasionally outspoken. The only thing that was a miss was the character of Jafar, not enough evil for a villain. I love the original but this movie has been changed just enough to honour it and yet be great in its own way. If you need more, after watching it have a listen to the songs from the original to see what a difference Will Smith has made to the songs... in a good way (credits song aside).

Jafar was ok, but the acting was all right for me, I think he was just miscast. Will Smith made a solid Genie that was different from Robin Williams. He isn't as good, but that was expected. There were shots that slowed down and sped up that were annoying, but they rarely happen and that is more on the director.
For me, the main problem was that some scenes relied on having watched the original to maybe feel an impact. The introduction to the Cave of Wonders and Aladdin giving food to kids are two examples.

","Aladdin is the latest in a long line of Disney live action ""reimaginings,"" which have been a source of massive box office success, with 4 of them grossing over $1 billion. Since Aladdin was one of the most popular movies of the 90's, it was inevitable that it would be remade. While people still keep seeing them, their reception from critics has been less than positive, for the most part. Aladdin had buzz from the get go after a truly awful trailer. But all publicity is good publicity, and the movie made bank.<br/><br/>Even though this movie isn't bad, per se, it's hard to not compare it to the original, which just shows how much better the original is. Take the Prince Ali song sequence, for instance. In the 1992 movie, it's a grand scale number with a sense of hugeness and importance. In this version, it sounds fine, but just feels like a Will Smith music video, not a grand number in a musical. The problem is that it doesn't feel as magical as the animated original. The reason for that is likely because animation as a medium allows for a greater suspension of disbelief, and therefore more immersion in the magic. In that regard, the overly CGI Cave of Wonders, for instance, seems less real than the animated version. The same can be said for the Sultan's palace. The sense of grandeur from either of these places is muted in the remake, where they're massive and imposing in the original.<br/><br/>Aladdin actually did change some stuff significantly from the 1992 movie. It added a completely new song, Speechless, sung by Jasmine near the end. It's a pretty good song, and it's performed well. Some weird stuff happens on screen. Jafar's motives are changed almost completely. Instead of marrying Jasmine, he's now a political mastermind, trying to unite all the different kingdoms into his own empire.<br/><br/>Another thing that needs to be said is Will Smith. He caught a lot of flak for taking on the role of the Genie, but he isn't bad in the role. The reason for this is because he doesn't spend the whole movie pretending to be Robin Williams. He isn't and he can't be. While they both are the same character, they are distinctly Robin Williams and Will Smith, respectively. This is good, as it lets Smith be himself and present the character in a way only he could. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott are Aladdin and Jasmine. They do give good performances, especially Scott, but it's hard to see them as Aladdin and Jasmine, because they aren't the 1992 characters.<br/><br/>By the way, this movie does somewhat confirm a long-held fan theory, that the guy at the beginning of the movie is actually the Genie. That's a theory in the original but is self-evident here."
"burney-imdb","7","0","0","4 December 2019"," It was OK, but could have been incredible
","I finished this movie with the thought that it was an OK treatment of the original. Other than being a bit too long and missing some of the humor, it was a pretty good effort. Will Smith did really great portraying the genie as more of a genuine person, not just there for laughs. There was some really strong emotional moments from himbas well. The rest of the cast was good, especially Nasim Pedrad. I appreciate that they found actors with Asian/Middle Eastern heritage to play most roles. I like that Jasmine wasn't just a ""princess"" but would become a Sultan.<br/><br/>Now for the disappointments. Jafar wasn't nearly as villanious as I hoped,l. The wisecracking Iago, scene stealer from the animated film, was completely neutered.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled and I saw the wedding scene and heard the Will Smith rapping version of Friend Like Me, I was suddenly very disappointed by what could have been. Disney/Richie could have elevated this film and made it a glorious Technicolor Bollywood/hip-hop mashup, like a Baz Lurhman film, but it was just flat. I would at least like to have seen someone on a prayer rug in the movie praying toward Mecca, but that was nowhere to be found either.<br/><br/>I just wish so many punches hadn't been pulled to make the ""safe"" but average film they made."

","The live action remake of Disney's Aladdin stands pretty well on it's own. Being a half an hour longer it features new scenes and ditches some old ones. Definitely not as revamped as the Dumbo remake, but still very entertaining.
Naomi Scott is perfect (as Jasmine).
Will Smith plays the Genie and it is hard not to compare his performance to the phenomenal voicework of Robin Williams and especially Vesa-Matti Loiri, who did an outstanding regional job. But surprisingly, after the initial ""this is not the Genie"" reaction Smith grows on you. They have seriously dialed down the manic personality of the original Genie, and since Smith's Genie works best when he's calmed down, there would have been room to strip even more of his hyper active traits. And, even the song Friend like me could have been left out completely.
Of the songs the best ones this time are Prince Ali by Will Smith and new song Speechless by Naomi Scott, who's character Jasmine takes a stronger position in this movie.
Jafar the villain is the only character that fails to impress me. I can't really pinpoint exactly why, but I suspect it has to do with how menacing he was in the original, whereas this Jafar you really aren't that afraid of. He should be darker, bigger, more threatening to work better.
2019's Aladdin is a cultural mess, but a beautiful one at that."
"CabbageCustard","5","0","0","11 November 2019"," High School Musical meets the Arabian Nights
","I note that a number of other reviewers have labelled this movie as nothing more than a blatant cash grab. To be honest, after watching it, I have to agree that making a quick buck was probably a higher priority for the film makers than bringing anything new to the story of Aladdin. This movie certainly does not bring anything new to the story, other than the curiosity value of seeing how the animated effects are realised in a live action movie. The CGI boffins don't do a bad job as far as that goes either. Will Smith leads a cast full of actors of whom I have never heard. It's hard to think of another actor who could have been better in the role of the genie. The rest of the cast are passable without being outstanding. For me, this movie with its poppy but forgettable songs and pretty but bland actors had more in common with High School Movie and other teen Disney movie musicals than it had with Eastern folklore. The main actors do nothing to disguise the fact that this is a very American movie (even though they themselves are not all Americans). If you enjoyed those aforementioned movies then you will enjoy this too. If you loved DIsney's animated version of Aladdin (with Robin Williams as the genie) then you will either love this or hate it. For me it gets a solid 'meh'."

","All right, I was expecting this to be bad because of all of the negative reviews. It was actually fairly good, but took getting a little used to.<br/><br/>First of all, live-action remakes of animated classics are generally a bad idea. The animated films were so good because they were animated - the live action movies always end up with so much visual clutter. This was no exception. Expect a loud, cluttered film that will leave you a little tired by the end.<br/><br/>However, some of the action was great. The scene where Aladdin and Jasmine are being chased through the streets is wonderful, with some very satisfying tumbling and wall climbing and a brilliant escape at the end.<br/><br/>I didn't like the actors so much... but here's the strange thing. I started out hating Will Smith as the genie. Wrong voice, wrong look. But I warmed to him throughout the film and by the end I liked his genie very very much. He actually does a good job and I ended up feeling very sympathetic for the character. It just took me a long time to get over that he wasn't Robin Williams.<br/><br/>The songs were fun, with a few twists that felt fresh, such as the false start to ""You Never Had a Friend Like Me"". I love the choreography in ""Make Way for Prince Ali"", and they snuck in a new song by princess Jasmine that was all right.<br/><br/>I also thought the surprise ending for the genie delightful, albeit a bit rushed.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an enjoyable film with beautiful effects and enough new material to keep me interested.

"mlynstockman","6","0","0","3 November 2019"," A ""miss"" in the hit & miss game of live action Disney
","When Disney pulled off Beauty and the Beast (a film with several essential characters being singing, dancing housewares) my skepticism fell to the anticipation of enjoying much loved Disney films anew. Unfortunately, that skepticism's resurrection came in the form of live action Aladdin.
As others have noted, the acting leaves much to be desired & the music is ""over produced"" to the gills, but allow me to bite those and move on to another.
As we know, Aladdin involves a flying carpet, a magical genie, a highly skilled monkey, an empathetic tiger, and a malicious trained parrot. However, this film constantly attempts to explain, through back stories or forced dialogue, things most of us didn't puzzle over in the original. Part of the reason people often feel books are better than their film adaptions is that a book leaves room for imagination. That said, if the animated Aladdin were a book, the live action is it's movie. Forced explanations of the mundane abound & whether they contradict what you'd assumed or compliment, they feel superfluous regardless."
"TxMike","Null","0","0","3 November 2019"," Pleasant enough, entertaining presentation of the Aladdin story.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. Costumes are very colorful and came out great on BluRay. Plus really good sound.<br/><br/>It is the familiar Aladdin story, brought to Disney life in the 1992 animated version where Robin Williams voices the Genie. Here Will Smith plays the genie and while he is OK most of the time he also is overly annoying at times. Plus he has a couple of songs and simply is only barely passable as a singer. His 'rap' at one point is much better.<br/><br/>I was really impressed with British actress Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine. She is very attractive, sort of a younger Sarah Michelle Gellar face with a tan, an acceptable actress, but with a beautiful voice as a singer.<br/><br/>So, while the story is familiar to most of us it is still a nicely entertaining 2 hours. The disc has several interesting extras."

","For a 2 hour movie, the friendships and relationship development seemed really rushed! The casting was off as well! Aladdin and the genie were good picks I feel just really bad script. Jasmine and the rest of the casting was awful!<br/><br/>It seems very Bollywood style which just doesn't suit the Aladdin as we know it from the animation and the extra songs didn't seem to fit with the original songs<br/><br/>Honestly, will smith as the genie was the only thing enjoyable in this movie. I understand he had big shoes to fill and I loved the fact he didn't try and copy robin Williams tone and was very much the character we love in his own way.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable film but not one you would probably watch again"

","I love the original Aladdin and the stage/broadway adaptation. The guy LOOKS like the perfect choice for Aladdin, but had hardly any personality in his line delivery. None of the classic Aladdin charm! He's clearly a better dancer than anything else. Naomi Scott blows everyone off the screen with her portrayal of Jasmine, but that was mainly boosted with the ""female-empowerment"" script, although I did like Jasmine taking over her father's role. That ""Greatest Showman-esque"" song they threw in for her made no sense in the context of the moment nor did it sound like it fit with the rest of the soundtrack. Will Smith as the Genie was not funny at all... felt so uncomfortable during his opening scene where NOBODY in my theater laughed. The best sequences were the further developments between Aladdin and Jasmine's relationship that we're outside of the source material. Don't even get me started of Jafar. Terrible casting choice. I was shook out of my boredom when he started to relate to Aladdin and tell his backstory, but it was a quick line that they never elaborated on. Disappointing all around."

"deandsouza15892","7","8","30","24 May 2019"," This was a weird film
","Full disclosure, I have never watched the original Aladdin. Disney wasn't a huge part of my childhood, and my opinion is from a blind perspective. For this remake of a Disney classic, I bring no baggage to the table.<br/><br/>I found this movie very...weird. Through most of it,something seemed off; you can't really place it; all the pieces of a scene are done well,but they don't gel cohesively. This wasn't adapted well. I'm always aware that this movie isn't real and trying to be cartoony. But that's the point - if you don't believe the world you're in, you can't really buy anything it sells. The signing and music felt forced, the acting was overdone, the plot wasn't convincing, the characters weren't believable and the ending seemed rushed.<br/><br/>They give you an exact replica, which doesn't work because the audience isn't the same. This is the kind of movie, where if you stopped and thought about what's happening in a scene, you're completely taken out of it. And that shouldn't happen in a movie about magic.<br/><br/>Speaking of magic, any positive feedback I had , goes to Will Smith as the genie.
He doesn't take a Robin Williams route, but plays himself instead. Any scene with him is elevated; he holds up the entire second act. This Genie was the only believable part of this story, which kinda sucks because I wanted to enjoy everything else too.<br/><br/>So there you have it, my unbiased opinion . I can't say how this film works as an adaptation, but as a movie, it's a 6.5/10 from me."

Will Smith as Genie also had a risky task to take over Robin Williams' portrayal, but Smith is a comic blast and really outdoes himself as the classic character; you'll love him and he's a scene stealer. Mena Massoud as Aladdin is great and a perfect fit. Naomi Scott as Jasmine soars in a powerful performance. Expect to see more from this fine actress.

"Troy_Campbell","7","3","8","26 May 2019"," Flawed but fun and beautiful.
","We all have those childhood movies that hold a special place in our hearts. Well for me it was the one-two punch of Aladdin and The Lion King; 7-year-old Troy's eyes being opened to the wonders of cinema through two classic Disney adventures. There's no possible way for me to consider the animated Aladdin with any sort of objectivity - in my eyes it's perfect - which in turn makes it extremely hard to judge this live-action remake as anything but paling in comparison. Putting those impossible comparisons (and inevitable conclusion) aside, Guy Ritchie's take on this rags-to-riches tale is energetic, vibrant and largely a load of fun, albeit with a few missteps. Taking it in a Bollywood-esque direction is a great choice, allowing Ritchie to lean heavily into stunning musical set pieces with grand sets and even grander costumes; the biggest and most beautiful spectacle coming from the magnificent 'Prince Ali' sequence. There's a new song too, Jasmine's solo-effort 'Speechless' a powerful ode to her under-valued strength in a male-dominated world. It encapsulates this film's overall stronger focus on Jasmine (stunningly played by Naomi Scott), who proves to be a more interesting character than the titular street-rat. Mena Massoud is both charming and physically convincing as our protagonist, put through his paces as Ritchie bolsters the action stakes where possible; the parkour-inspired 'One Jump Ahead' a fun introduction to the nimble-thief hero despite the occasionally awkward lyric delivery. The big blue elephant in the room is undoubtedly Will Smith's Genie though. Whilst the performance is fine, the computer-generated visual execution is shockingly bad and at times downright creepy due to the dreadful face replacement technology. Smith still manages to bring a bit of his trademark swagger and when Genie and Aladdin are exchanging witty banter there are plenty of amusing moments, but these are mostly worthy of smiles rather than belly laughs. It's certainly no classic, but this live-action Aladdin is a mostly enjoyable flick for kids and adults alike."

Jafaar wishes that to be the greatest sorcerer in the whole world , how does just singing about being strong and talking with smooth way gonna effect a WISH of geni !
the song was obviously about women and being strong ( feminism I guess ) , its not wrong , but its become bulls***t when u change the story for a something does not make any since!
And why Hakeem is so thin and weak and no muscle and short , thats was a bad decision to choice him , he doesnt fit for the Role ,
Jafaar was good , Sultan i Was disappointed about him , he is a little bit funny in the cartoon movies , fat and short , Cant u find some one who fits there roles ?
And at the last , why did u change the story and how it goes !?
How JAFAAR ending was bad, U did change the story of the cartoon of something un reasonable and bad at all .
Why geni got to be human in the last wish !
And love human girl , He is geni and after being freed still a geni according to your Cartoon movies of the whole alaadin series .

"erikvalientevalloyas10","9","5","17","23 May 2019"," Fantastic live action!
","This is a great live action! Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott give fresh portrayal of our beloved lovers. Massoud does not only lift Aladdin with energetic and charming presence but also heartful emotions of Aladdin's life struggles that doesn't leave anyone untouched. While Scott takes Jasmine to a powerful and feministic level, does Will Smith too not disappoint. Even though we feared Smith being the biggest visual failure, this modern and humane portrayal of genie is the peak of this live action that doesn't infringe our dear respected Robin Williams. But the weak portrayal of the main villain infringes this Disney classic. We can't blame Marwan Kenzari's acting ability, and it's understandable that Disney want to avoid another racial controversy about Jafar being grotesquely presented, but one of the biggest Disney villains does not give an awe-inspiring performance with this live action's choice of Kenzari's timid nature. They should have given Numan Acar who played the strict but loyal right-hand guard Hakim, this villainous role.
Overall it's a great, colorful, hearty movie that's really worth to watch!"

","Who would in his right mind have ever dreamed ten years ago that a director like Guy Ritchie could do a Disney musical? I mean it's like expecting Quentin Tarantino to make a Star Trek movie. Wait a minute...
Anyhow the reality is this - a new Aladdin movie is in theaters now and it is spectacular. Ritchie's trademarks are all here: long shots, slow motion, colorful picture and eloquent dialogues but no matter how hard the master tries to reinvent the wheel it doesn't overdo the far superior original and here's why.
First, it's Will Smith and his questionable visual representation as the blue Genie. No one expected him to be another Robin Williams because it's impossible but Will just doesn't even try to be a Genie we used to know. He's simply being himself, and the superpowers don't make him any convincing as he ought to have been if only he tried a little harder.
Second, it's the actor who plays Jafar, the main villain who is there to serve its purpose of being a villain. Given the two lines of his background story I nevertheless was not able to answer why is he actually evil because of Marwan Kerzani's superficial performance.
And third, it's the length of the movie - some scenes are obscenely long and overburdened with special effects it makes your eyes sore.
But overall this is a different yet magnificent take on the beloved fairytale with great songs (especially ""Speechless"" which just won my heart), stunning visuals, stellar main cast performances and very meaningful redefinition of personal values and self-acception."

"jwwalrath-227-85487","9","4","13","25 May 2019"," Jafar is disappointing, but overall there is a lot of fun and spectacle to this
","I enjoyed myself during this. Liked it better than the Beauty and the Beast remake. Course I think this remake had the liberty of the source material being a more lighthearted comedy, giving this adaptation's writers more breathing room.<br/><br/>This movie follows the basic plot points of the original, but it does a decent job of coming up with with some fairly good original jokes and other content. Jasmine (the Power Rangers movie's Naomi Scott) and Jafar (Marwen Kenzari) get more backstory and motivation, and the Genie (Will Smith) and Aladdin (Mena Massoud) have more time to naturally build their friendship.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes or so are a little top heavy. The events up to and involving Aladdin meeting Jasmine seem to be really fast forwarded, and it seems odd. This movie is 38 minutes longer than the original. Why the need for condensation? The One Jump Ahead music sequence definitely looks like they sped up the footage. The rest of the films mostly moves smoothly with a couple quick edits that seem odd. It definitely feels like Nasim Pedrad's character, a handmaiden named Dalia, and Billy Magnusson's Prince Anders had more stuff that was cut.<br/><br/>Will Smith is his old charming self. (It's been a while since we've see him go full Smith.) Massoud is a very likable Aladdin. Scott is a good Jasmine ,but some of her female empowerment lines don't work. I don't blame her, she just has some forced dialogue. (To clarify, I'm saying it doesn't work because of the script's execution and not the actual message.) Dalia, created mostly for someone else for Jasmine and the Genie to talk with, is a funny, slightly-off kilter character. Iago's character (Alan Tudyk) feels the most changed from the original. Here he sounds more like a parrot and talks in short beats. I didn't dislike it. You're never going to match Gilbert Godfried if you try to copy him.<br/><br/>Jafar is definitely the weak point of the movie. Yes, I did give props to his backstory but that is about it. The original was one of Disney's greatest villains, A wonderful combination of cunning, droll humor, and malevolence. This guy is either dull or sounds like he's a child throwing a brief temper tantrum that's just for show. Kenzari doesn't sound intimidating at all. (BTW: Having seen director Guy Ritchie's two Sherlock Holmes movies, what is with him and low-energy villains?) He's also there as the main figure representing society's attempts to silence Jasmine's strong female voice, and he just sounds so unnatural at these moments.<br/><br/>The movie looks great; very colorful and lavish. The musical numbers were well shot. Friend Like Me may be one of the most ambitious live action musical segments in a while. Yes, many fans of the original may be frustrated that the musical numbers or action scenes just don't match the strength of the original. (Their isn't even any giant snake Jafar, although I still felt the final act's action piece worked.) That's true, but by itself I say this is a likable mvoie.<br/><br/>They keep all the original songs except Jafar's Prince Ali reprise, which is so short anyway that I'll allow it. Friend Like Me and Prince Ali get a hip-hop revision to them, which actually works better than I expected. Not so much with Will Smith and DJ Kaled's rap version of Friend Like Me during the credits. Did not care for. Did Emma Watson's weak singing voice in Beauty and the Beast bother you? Prepare to be more disappointed. Both Smith and Massoud have weak voices. Whereas B&B had three new songs, we only get one here: Speechless, a song for Jasmine and done by original composer Alan Menken with Greatest Showman's Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. I really liked this one. Unlike her co-stars Naomi Scott's got pipes!<br/><br/>Overall, if you haven't been fond of the recent Disney remakes, this probably won't change your mind. But, I think the others will have a nice time."

","Yes, there are a few cliches, but very little, and things that Disney changed a bit, tweaking and offending some of the old Aladdin fans, but very truly, this film was very enjoyable, quirky in its own fun ways, and full of music and wonders that one could never imagine. The actors and actresses performed very well, and Will Smith made an impeccable, hard to beat genie. I did not know why, but this film almost brought me to tears. Perhaps it was because it brought back fond childhood memories from the old Aladdin. But the costumes and the music from this spectacular Disney musical were all masterpieces. I enjoyed it very fondly and very much. Jafar was not as menacing as I thought he would be, but I could see that everyone put effort in, and I liked the feminism of it all, and Naomi Scott as Jasmine and Mena as Aladdin are very suitable matches, and they were truly amazing to see on screen."

"zozoenzo","6","4","13","22 May 2019"," Shining, Shimmering, not that Splendid
","I came into the theater to watch this movie not as a Disney fan nor of the original Aladdin but as a fan of Guy Ritchie. And I must say I was not disappointed. His style is recognizable in some parts of the movie with slow motion shots, running in alleys and parkour in a way that give this version of Aladdin almost a British gritty aspect as Ritchie would do. I was mostly impressed with the latter's versatility by the ""whole new world"" which he created. This live-action remake is very colorful and very pleasing to the eyes even though the cinematography is not constantly solid but it was compensated with aesthetics by the production. Also it should be noted that Will Smith's version of the genie was very unique and he was able to give it his touch making him one of the most if not the most imposing character on screen. As soon as he appears he almost gives a second life to the movie that was much needed. Which leads me to my last praise, this was wayyy funnier than i expected it to be. Will Smith's performance and lines had a whole part of the cinema laughing out loud at multiple occasions.
On the other hand there was quite a few things that could have been improved on. For example there are many instances where I could not help but pay too much attention to the CGI Abu (which weirdly actually appears as a real monkey on frame making the CGI version look even worse), or a few greenscreen shots (i'm guessing) running on rooftops being quite janky. My major complaint though would be the casting for Jafar. While i do think that Marwan Kenzari did a good job with the character i just feel that an actor with a more ominous look and voice would have definitely worked a lot better like his co-star who played Hakim ( Numan Acar). It should be noted that a few of the scenes acted by Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud were a bit cringeworthy but they did seem like they were having fun playing those characters.
Overall, i think the positives outweigh the negatives by a bit and that the movie does not appear quite as magical as the original did but that is because the bar was set extremely high.<br/><br/>I would rate this movie a 6.5/10 !!"

The movie was stunning! I couldn't have imagined the live action any other way and I believe it is one of the best live action Disney movies that they have produced. Naomi Scott was a great choice for playing Princess Jasmine, she could really see the passion she had, while playing the role of Jasmine throughout this movie, and without her, the movie wouldn't be as great! Her vocals were stunning! She was the best singer, out of everyone within this movie. Will Smith, was also a better genie than I expected! A lot of fans will never prefer him to the beloved Robin Williams, who played the original Genie in the animation (RIP, Will always be a beloved actor by many). But for the live action, I thought he was an excellent choice! Marwan Kenzari plays the role of Jafar to a really high standard, and portrays his sinister side extremely well! The cast were brilliant throughout the movie, and helped to create the colourful, eccentric, thrilling world of this Disney tale!"

"WYLION-SOTIRISKING","7","3","9","24 June 2019"," WYLION - Feel good?
","Unpopular opinion but I liked this movie.<br/><br/>Was it great? No, but it did make you feel good. That's what I class it as, a feel good movie. The acting wasn't amazing it was okay. Will Smith's performance was most certainly the best in the movie even if the large CGI version of the Genie was very distracting, over the top and took away from everything around it.<br/><br/>I think what made the movie not work was trying to transfer everything from the animation across to live action. This would be alright for something such as The Lion King (which I am very excited for by the way). The difference is that there is magic, transformation and so many effects that it removes the 'live action' from a live action movie. Not CGI specifically but all of the particle effects really just didn't make it have a real feel to it which is required for a live action movie. I think Guy Richie may have gotten carried away and because of the direction he went with the movie I think it is the explanation for why the movie and the acting came across quite bland.<br/><br/>I won't trash talk the movie too much though as I liked it a lot and I know it will be one I watch more than once or even twice."

","Unrealistic production. Most of the movie is like watching Beh-Hur (1959), mostly fake scenarios that clearly looks quite fake. The performance of Aladdin and Jafar are very week.

","I was never a fan of the original 'Aladdin'. Maybe because I was a girly girl and it felt like a movie more for the boys, but I was never attached to it like I was 'beauty and the beast' and 'the lion king'. That being said, it had great qualities. Robin Williams couldn't be replaced and the music was amazing. Well after seeing the live action, I'm appreciating the cartoon more now. Was there a rule they had to suck all the humor out? I don't think I laughed once. Will smith surprisingly was a terrible genie. He was just so ghetto, and he wasn't funny. The only person I was impressed with was Naomi Scott who did the best she could with the character she was given. Trying to 'feminize' the film and make jasmine want to be sultan Just made her come off overly ambitious which wasn't attractive. They didn't even realize the strength they had in the original jasmine like the scene in the cartoon where she seduces jafar to distract him from Aladdin. Speaking of jafar, is there a Less anti climatic villain out there? HE WAS SO LAME. I would have given this film a four but the music like I said (and the addition of 'speechless' brought tears to my eyes. Benj and Justin are kings of the anthem) and naomi Scott's performance gave extra points to a solid six."

"luisdiegoaristizabal","8","2","5","9 September 2019"," Wonderful
","Wonderful. It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so much, without worrying about elaborate plots (or lack thereof) or because such a character was a hindrance or that the script is rubbish. I want to clarify that for my criticism I will not take into account the original Aladdin movie because I remember very little or nothing of that movie, without further ado, I will begin.<br/><br/>I had a good time watching it and how not to? From the beginning it captivates you with a beautiful song and beautiful scenery, and that is just the beginning. Each of the songs is beautiful and almost all fit well with the narrative that is being told; great and professional choreographies, plus very good voices. With the only music scene that I don't quite agree with is ""Speechless, Pt. 2"", I feel that despite being a great song, it managed to break the narrative thread, I feel it didn't fit very well and I felt strange towards it compared to the rest of the music scenes, they could have done a better job of placing it inside the narrative. The scenery is perfect, the scenarios very well built and the impeccable costumes, wonderful work to portray the Arab culture.<br/><br/>As for the casting Wow! It is a wonder almost entirely. Let's start with Aladdin, the protagonist, what a good casting they did here because Mena Massoud plays a fantastic character, it's impossible that you don't like him or sympathize with him or even that you fall in love with him; he transmits something to you and Mena fulfills his role as the protagonist of the film very well; excellent choice. Now, Naomi Scott as Jasmine, another success in its entirety, she's charismatic, charming, kind and empowered, you sympathize with her, you want her dream of being the Sultan to be fulfilled; Naomi perfectly transmits those beautiful but so complex qualities of Jasmine. Will Smith as the Genie, a decision that in its beginning was controversial but now very successful, he had very large shoes to fill according to many but Will did something different with those shoes, he didn't wear them, he put on his own shoes and with that metaphor I want to say that he did an excellent job, the Genie is iconic but at the same time a very difficult character to play because he has a very strong dose of comedy without neglecting his natural charm, something that few possess and Will achieved it, he made a very good Genie, funny and charming, he clearly steals the show at times. But here comes the stone in the shoe, Jafar, played by Marwan Kenzari, this was the only casting error for me, because when I think of Jafar I think of an imposing and scary man and I think that they lacked of that in here, Marwan does not impose at all like Jafar, it feels like any other character, not as a threat (without demeriting the work of Marwan, who did it well), but I still wish it had been a different casting for this character. As for secondary characters we have Abu, Iago and the magic carpet, very good complements and endearing characters.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Aladdin is a wonderful film, with good songs, excellent performances, incredible staging, beloved characters and a captivating story. One of the best adaptations of Disney and a movie that will make you have a good time."

"werewolfeta","10","2","5","6 August 2019"," One of best Disney's ever!
","Aladdin has all the qualities a great musical should have: the plot, acting, costumes, music and direction.<br/><br/>Mr Ritchie has made a movie for all generations to enjoy, which nobody in the audience expected him to make. I was pleasantly surprised with what he did. Honestly, I did not see him as a Disney musical director (based on his previous movies).
What a great job! Perhaps he could also make The Hunchback of Notre Dame?<br/><br/>The actors:
Will Smith is hilarious as a modern hip hop Genie! He was born for it! I think they couldn't have made a better choice for that role.
Naomi was also the perfect choice for stubborn feminist Jasmine. Mena is great as a kindhearted street rat Aladdin and Marwan's Jafar is one of the most handsome villains ever. I also think that Nasim's Dalia was an interesting addition to the movie.
Tiger, monkey, parrot and magic carpet were great, too.<br/><br/>The plot is a little bit different from the original cartoon and I really liked it. It is appropriate for the 21st century Aladdin so to say. Politically correct.<br/><br/>What I especially liked in this movie are the colours. The details in the Magic Cave and the night when they fly and sing A whole new world are just beautiful.<br/><br/>The costumes are bollywoodishly flamboyant and very detailed. Some of the best scenes to watch are Princ Ali and the Harvest dance scene.<br/><br/>The music is superb and the new Speechless song should be nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>Aladdin is a movie that will be hard to beat. Compared to other this year Disney's remakes of Dumbo and Lion King I think that Aladdin is better than both of them.<br/><br/>Such a beautiful, colourful and funny movie is a true joy for our eyes and ears and minds. Go and see for yourself."

The trailer certainly doesn't do it justice, and in fact I think it contains the worst bit of the film. I think Will Smith went overboard with the black favour in the initial scene in the cave, which was the bit I didn't like. Other than that, everything is great."
"Moz_Sakura","9","2","5","19 June 2019"," Making its predecessor proud
","In my opinion, this was a great movie. They were able to bring back the best of the animated version of Aladdin, added colour and cheerfulness, to deliver a very entertaining and funny story. The scenario was stunning, surpassing my expectations for how cheerful and beautiful it was, which allowed to emulate the genie's personality perfectly. Bringing back some of the original songs from the animated version was a great idea, it gave an amazing sense of familiarity and allowed us to sing along to our favourite songs with the added magic of the new visuals. The acting was also better than what I expected. Jasmine (Naomi Scott) portrayed her character very convincingly, with the added bonus of a beautiful voice. Mena Massoud was able to emulate Aladdin's charm, bringing the character to life. But the star of the film, for me, was Will Smith, without a doubt. If the stakes were high from everyone's favourite (Robin Williams), then W. S. didn't let himself be intimidated, presenting us a cheerful, full of energy and mainly funny version of the Genie we all love, leaving no doubts about his ability to portray the character. All in all making Aladdin was a very risky task, considering the high stakes and expectations, but I think it is it was a clear success."
"Aaron1375","7","2","5","17 June 2019"," It was all right, but nothing you haven't seen before
","I am not sure what is up with the trend of Disney redoing their old animated classics and turning them live action. Well, okay, there is the whole money thing; however, that does not really explain why people want to see almost the exact same film again or why Disney is releasing so many of these live action adaptations in 2019 as there have been two so far and at least one more to go. I would probably spread them out a bit, hold one back for hard times or something. This one is the live action Aladdin, and it was okay, but nothing that will blow you away in terms of new content.<br/><br/>The story is essentially the same as Aladdin dreams of wooing Jasmine the princess. He is given the opportunity to enter a cave and retrieve something for Jafar and it turns out to be a lamp containing a magical genie. Well, Aladdin now has three wishes and Jafar has schemes of his own as Aladdin wishes to win the princess and Jafar wishes to rule the kingdom!<br/><br/>The casting was pretty good as I thought Will Smith as the genie was the highlight of the film and he held it together making it more enjoyable. The guy who played Aladdin was rather good and Jasmine was most definitely a much better looking counterpart to the Disney princess she was playing in comparison to Emma Watson's Bell. Was not wild about the guy playing Jafar though as he did not really seem all that evil and also did not really look the part to me.<br/><br/>So, this live action adaptation was better to me than the Beauty and the Beast one, it seemed more like a movie. That one seemed like some sort of special one would see on ABC to me for some reason. It was a bit tedious at first, but once Will Smith entered the picture as the genie I thought the film livened up a lot and was more enjoyable. There are a few new things added to this as the genie has a love interest, but for the most part, it is essentially the same film with not too much in there to surprise. Next up, the live action Lion King which my wife will probably also want to go to."

","The original animated Aladdin film has always been one of the best movies I have ever watched and I can still watch it everyday. The movie has impacted my childhood hugely, and I think is one of the best Disney films to ever exist.<br/><br/>The live action was a retelling of the magnificent movie that I love so much. I had very high expectations from the movie and I think this movie has lived up to those expectations. However, before watching it, I read some very harsh reviews from critics but I honestly do not understand the reason behind those after watching the movie myself. Even though I do not think one should compare this movie with the original one, but this 2019 live-action did complete justice to its predecessor.<br/><br/>Firstly, the cast was amazing! They found the perfect Aladdin after an extensive auditioning! All of the actors displayed wonderful performance and I think they all portrayed their roles very well. Each character showed their uniqueness and I loved the details they added to their characters.<br/><br/>The whole performance in general was amazing - the choreography were great, so were the costumes and the sets. The overall setting of Agrabah was fabulous! The new songs and the new addition to the original story line was also refreshing. The stunts that were performed and the computer graphics were done very neatly and the finished product is simply amazing.<br/><br/>I am no critic nor do I understand or know the technicalities so well, but as an avid fan and a viewer I can say that I have enjoyed this movie - from the very start till the end - thoroughly. That is why I have rated it so highly. I simply loved the movie!"

I definitely prefer it over the Cinderella adaptation since this one had more singing and dancing. Since the originals had lots of music, I like it when the live action ones do too!"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","5","30 May 2019"," Fun for the most part
","Well I don't think I really need to tell you what this is, but who knows. Here we have the (mostly) live action remake of the famous animated movie Aladdin from the early 90s. These remakes are a big thing now, there was Beauty and the Beast already, not too long ago Dumbo and here we have Aladdin that adds to this idea as well before The Lion King is next up. But now for Aladdin: Director and co-writer is Guy Ritchie, who is probably still at least as known for being married to Madonna as he is for his most known filmmaking efforts. And while he may be British, there isn't too much British about this film we got here. It is an American production, but takes place mostly in a fictitious Arab location. The American component is emphasized by Will Smith, who is really the only well-known actor here and honestly without him playing the genie, it would have been much more difficult to promote this film in America. But yeah, he is an A-lister and can carry it on his shoulders. Not necessarily acting- or performance-wise, but in terms of star potential. The movie runs for 2 hours, slightly over even, and I won't go too much into detail about the story here. You know it if you know the original. It's been so long since I saw that, so I cannot say a whole lot about differences and similarities either. There is animation in here, but not really too much. Of course the genie parts involving Smith and eventually Jafar rely a lot on special effects. Same goes for the animals, like Jasmin's tiger or Abu, Aladdin's little monkey. The latter is in my opinion really the best thing about the entire film honestly. His scenes and inclusions and expressions were so priceless and funny that I almost wished the whole film could be about the monkey. Sadly, he is pretty much gone story-wise in the second half.<br/><br/>As for the human character, Aladdin and his actor Mena Massoud were okay, nothing too good or bad about him that stood out. Naomi Scott was just as stunning as she should have been portraying the gorgeous princess (eventually Sultan) Jasmine. Also, she seemed very emancipated to me, I am not sure if it was like this in the original movie as well or just included to get along with the #metoo age. But it doesn't matter. I still liked her and the character. As for Jafar, tough to say. I can see why they did not want to keep him too scary, even if he kills another character on at least one occasion, because also kids are supposed to see this family fantasy film, but the looks had very little to do with the sleaziness of the animated Jafar. Same for the Sultan, who added very little really and there I thought the costume and make-up wasn't perfect. Other than that, the visual side was really good here in terms of costumes, make-up, sets and special effects. The songs did not do as much for me sadly, which may be because I watched the German dub admittedly. So I suggest you go for the original language with this one. The Hakim character I liked. And now about Will Smith's character. Well, obviously he did not look physically similar to the animated genie, but I think there is no perfect actor for that part. In general, I am not a huge Smith fan (anymore), but I think he was okay here. Also pay attention to how they include him right at the very beginning here during a time that takes place several years after the movie. Did it work? I think yes, but also obviously it was done so we see who the big star here is (and it's not Massoud, even if that one is also more prolific than you may think) because Smith does not appear for a long time afterwards again. With that opening scene and the idea of him singing the story of Aladdin to his kids, I kinda expected a bit of a frame to the film that it also ends on the ship, but nope. Then again, that was not necessary really. We know who the woman on the ship is with how the story develops and that they are his kids. Haha still could have made for a troll-like success to show us Jasmin is actually the mother of his children there. Anyway, that would have been too absurd obviously.<br/><br/>Now that is basically all I have to say about this movie. It is really what one could expect given the subject and the director and the budget I would say. There are some memorable moments like when Apu is willing to take that precious red gem or when he reveals himself that he stole Jasmin's jewels and more moments. Also some underwhelming moments. Like the big show Genie puts on in his presentation did not really wow me that much. I am curious if this film can get in in any of the visual categories at the Oscars, but maybe most people have forgotten about it until then. A real standout film that will blow you away it is not. Back to Apu, with me mentioning him twice slready you see how much I enjoyed his character here. What else can I add, let me think. Oh yeah, the parrot and the carpet are included too of course, but neither play a really big role. Or lets say neither is really memorable because I mean the carpet does a lot and is a bit of an unsung hero taking Aladdin back from the eternal ice and also saving Jasmin right away. That was surprising though that she was so confident he'd be there this quickly. Maybe the least realistic moment. Oh yeah one more thing, they somehow had to deal with Aladdin being a thief too and that he is still a kind-hearted person despite his profession as a criminal. They did that fine with how he tells Abu that some life lesson related to stealing or how he gets basically used by the guy he gives his prey to and he only gets very few dates for his effort and he gives these dates to a starving kid and his mom. And to Apu of course. We sure should not see Aladdin as anything resembling a bad guy. I think that shhould be all now. You won't be seeing any surprises with this film in the positive or negative sense. It is a rock-solid watch from beginning to end and I give it a thumbs-up overall. Go check it out unless you really hate the original material, but seriously, why would anybody do so? I think both films are worth seeing!"

","I was excited to see this movie, despite all the negative publicity it was getting. Having seen it, I can say it was worth admission at least. It's held up by the great chemistry between Mena Massoud and Will Smith. And believe it or not, Will Smith's ""Friend Like Me"" was the best part of the movie. Will Smith brings his own charm to the table that separates him from Robin Williams, and creates a new equally likeable genie. The music was just as good all around, and some new additions were welcome as well. And with the beautiful visuals, and great female empowerment moment at the end that was missing from the original, this was almost a great win for Disney. It falls short with some sloppy editing, especially when it speeds up the film during some songs. I'm not kidding, it looked like the video was fast forwarding, but the music was still on key. This was supposedly done for absolutely no logical reason. While it can never match up to the original's magic, it certainly can exist and survive on it's own merits."

"alindsay-al","7","3","10","26 May 2019"," A good fun recreation of a classic
","Disney has started recently of remaking their animated classics into live action films and the newest one of these is Aladdin. The premise of the film sees a kind hearted street kid attempt to win the affections of a proncess with the help of a magical genie. Mena Massoud plays Aladdin in this film and honestly I have never seen him in anything before, he was okay in this film, he sold the nervy awkward guy well and fit the role well. owever, I just felt like he was a bit dull and bland which made it difficult for me to really care about his character. Lets just get to the biggest part in this film, Will Smith as the genie, he really is the life of the film. I know Robin Williams is iconic as the genie but Smith does a great job giving his own version of the character, he is so charismatic and charming really owning the screen. Kristen Scott plays Jasmine in the film and she does a good job in the role, she is a strong character and fits the chsaracter very well and gives young girls somebody to root for. Though we come to Marwan Kenzari's performance as Jafar which is just so generic. he is a boring villain and isn't menacing at all. He doesn't seem like an imposing threat and really weakened the film for me. Also none of the other characters are given enough to work with to make anybody care about their characters. The story is good, its a classic tale and honestly not much is changed from the classic animated film. Though this is an issue like all of these live action remakes is that they are very predictable and it does hurt the overall experience of the film. The script is great, the drama and humour is used very well especially for the family audience that this film is clearly geared for. The style is also fanatastic, all the colours used are so vibrant and really gives this film life. The CGI is top notch and makes this film feel like a large scale film. Overall this is a good film that plenty of kids will grow up watching and that is not a problem."

But seriously guys you need to see the future.<br/><br/>Smith successfully entertain the audiences with the funny yet charismatic acts. The cgi is amazing as well. So overall its a good movie with a good effort.<br/><br/>So once more, please stop being stupid and compare all of the scenes, stories, and character with the animation."

","First words which i've pronounced after trailer were: Â«Is it Guy Ritchie?Â»
Yeah, really, it's him. Most-loved british director which got honor to create a movie Aladdin like Disney's Wheel of Fortune said.
Imagine - giant Mickey Mouse staying with Ritchie in right hand and bunch of dollars in left. And he creates Aladdin.
Honestly, first minutes of these movie makes you hide your eyes from over-bright colors but then it becomes a habit.
Basically Aladdin is a beautiful fairytale with best soundtrack for all Disney history, Alan Menken is a genious.
In remake you can listen to the greatest songs too but without chemistry and soul between main characters. Aladdin and Jasmine looks like plastic dolls just like in a weirdo old musical from Golden Era of Hollywood.
But...Genie! Will Smith in this role is a creator of best jokes, effects and stuff. He's not a wizard or ancient creature. He's joker with a simple dream. He wanna be free.
Hardest part of Ritchie's work was a translation of musical episodes from original cartoon to the boring real world. I mean Genie song, entrance of Prince Ali to Agraba and, for sure, ARABIAN NIIIIIGHT!
And Ritchie made a great work with these songs 'cause it's really hard to be a director of the scene which basically was in cartoon. In 2D-dimension you can paint whatever you want. In live-action too but it's more harder. Cause i've had shivers.
Aladdin is a still beautiful fairytale with over-bright colors, strange cut method and savior Will Smith with Menken's music."

","Better than I expected. Of course the Genie was always going to be a problem. And it's probably the main reason why this never should have been remade in the first place, but here we are, and I will attempt to judge it fairly.<br/><br/>For me, the reason why this works better than some of the most recent Disney ""live-action"" remakes, is obviously the fact that most of the main characters are human. Unlike The Lion King, which didn't stop them from making the animals more like animals, instead of humans like in the original. To the point were you are no longer able to relate to them or tell what their expressions mean.<br/><br/>Anyway, the writers made som changes to the story in this remake, which I liked, particularily relating to Jasmine (Naomi Scott). They made the character more wholesome and a lot more relevant to what's going on. It certainly gave the actor a lot more to work with, and she really shines in this movie.<br/><br/>The thing I was most worried about beforehand, was probably the songs, but I actually think they did a pretty good job with it. The song ""Speechless"", which did a lot for both the character and Naomi Scott's voice, was a particular highlight.<br/><br/>Lastly, there was only one thing I really did not like, and that was everything relating to Jafar. Just like Scar in the above-mentioned Lion King-remake, he is not nearly menacing enough. And it certainly didn't help that the actor looked like he had stepped right off the set of Jersey Shore.<br/><br/>Also, the character was sort of under-developed. Of course power was always his main motivation, but they very rarily tapped into his relationships with any of the other characters, and he didn't really stay in power long enough for it to become the movie's main conflict. Aladdin and Jasmine's inner conflicts were much more interesting. The whole thing with Jafar was just sort of background noise.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I enjoyed this SO much more than I was expecting to! In fact, an unpopular opinion of mine is that I prefer it to the original Aladdin. Or at least, I definitely prefer the characters of Aladdin and Jasmine in this one. Of all the live action Disney remakes, this is the only one that I've ever wanted to watch again, straight after having just watched it! It was PHENOMENAL! The entire cast did a fantastic job. The acting on all parts was just brilliant. Will Smith gave Genie his own style without trying to be Robin Williams. He was hilarious. Naomi filled Jasmine with such passion and emotion, and Mena gave Aladdin such fun, charm, and sincerity. I was in absolute awe the whole way through the movie. The songs are perfection in every way (A Whole New World gave me goosebumps like crazy), the extra details of the storyline felt important and very necessary, and it was overall funny, amusing, emotional, and captivating. Highly recommend to everyone (and don't be fooled by the mediocre trailers)!"

","Almost identical to the original with minor changes."
"CANpatbuck3664","7","2","6","13 July 2019"," A Decent Adaptation of the Disney Classic, No More but No Less
","With any remake, one of the key questions is: Do you stick to the source material and get called unoriginal? Or do you go your own way and get accused of blaspheming the classic property? Guy Ritchie (who pulls double duty, as a screenwriter and the director) and his team chose the 2nd option. To my surprise, the movie is better for it. They give Jasmine more depth and a stronger motivation, they add in a handmaiden character Dalia (Nasim Pedrad) who brings some warmth to the Jasmine's plight. Will Smith's Genie isn't a carbon copy of the Robin Williams version, they keep enough of what made that character so memorable but Will gets to add his flavour to it and it largely works. They also make minor changes the ending but it never feels false or unearned. I hate it when movies just ignore source material (The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies comes to mind) but I think they made some choices and most of them payed off. If you're going to make that kind of deviation, it better be good and hats off to them for making the correct decision.<br/><br/>The original Aladdin is a classic for so many reasons but I always go back to 2 things, the character of the Genie (voiced and performed by Robin Williams in a masterful job) and the music. Once again, they weren't just content to recycle the music (although every musical number from the original film is in the movie) and they tweak the numbers and add a couple of new ones. The movie is more mixed here, most of the music is alright (A Whole New World, One Jump are both done justice) but a couple of the numbers are a little off. Will Smith is a movie star and a rapper but he is still not a great singer and while Friend Like Me is still solid, Arabian Nights and Prince Ali have some cringe-worthy moments. He doesn't fail and it could have sounded worse, but I still wish it had been better in those areas.<br/><br/>Aladdin largely looks good, the CGI on it passes the test. I liked the effects with Carpet and Abu which could have been so easy to screw up. It would be more of a surprise if it looked crappy, the budget on this is high and with the might of ""The Mouse"" behind it, it looks the part. I also liked how the musical numbers and action were filmed, Guy Ritchie does a better job fitting into this genre than I thought he would of and both the action and the dancing is well choreographed and filmed. There is one moment where he has to use his slow motion effects and it just made me laugh. It was like he just couldn't help himself. But otherwise, Aladdin is well shot and looks the part.<br/><br/>Will Smith is the big name in the cast, and maybe I'm a little biased, but the most important because the Genie might be my favourite character in the Disney cannon. Will does as good of a job as could be expected, he's not fantastic but he's a lot better than people were predicting. He's able to put his spin on the character and it works more than it doesn't. I liked both Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott as Aladdin and Jasmine respectively. Neither wowed me but they both were good in every respect. Marwan Kenzari was surprisingly effective as Jafar, he chews the scenery but I think he walked that line without going too far (you could make a drinking game out of his performance, take a shot every time he yells into nothing). I also really liked Nasim Pedrad as Dalia. She's grounding for the movie and she helps keep things light. Navid Negahban gets very little to do as the Sultan so I can't really comment either way.<br/><br/>This is a decent adaptation of an animated movie that borders on being a masterpiece. I saw this with my family and everyone pretty much had the same reaction. It takes two steps forward and one step back, the movie has an odd construction where things don't always fit from scene to scene. It feels like in an effort to keep the pace up, they threw things together in the editing booth and maybe overdid it by cutting too much out. Otherwise this version of Aladdin gets the job done, the animated release is the better movie hands down but I wouldn't mind watching this again. It could have been better but this gets the job done and it was better than expected."
"riley-12591","6","2","6","20 June 2019"," Mostly good with 4 qualms
","The movie was very enjoyable and I had a smile on my face for most of the time. The actors who portrayed Jasmine and Aladdin shocked me with their acting abilities for being not well known. Finally the Bollywood/Hip-hop dance scene to close rocked. However, I had 4 qualms<br/><br/>
1. The original had some, obviously, very cartoonish movements of the characters. Specifically when Aladdin is running through the streets. This was unable to be replicated, so they used some very bad CGI to either speed him up or allow him to do inhuman motions. You're spending all the money anyway, just pay for some good freaking CGI<br/><br/>2. jazmin's song ""speechless"" was unnecessarily trying to let the viewer know that Disney is now ""woke"" and grind at the movie's plot to a halt<br/><br/>3. The original had some modern pop culture references that made the movie incredibly unique for this type of a Disney movie, and this movie did not have those. They were missed<br/><br/>4. I know that it is unfair to compare will smith to Robin Williams as an actor. But as a singer, Smith also just doesn't compare. Some of the songs such as Arabian nights and prince Ali required kind of an operatic tone which Williams had. Will smith just kind of bumbled and rapped his way through them."
"iamaaronkuhns","4","2","6","31 May 2019"," Average at best
","I have liked the remakes they have been doing quite a lot, some I find superior to the originals, but this one has me baffled. I think this movie does a lot of things right, so let's start with those. I enjoy the cast, and the singing is great. Some nice changes on old tunes, and a new one tossed in to add some much needed Jasmine character development. Jasmine as a whole I think is much more compelling in this one over the original, being more than just a plot piece for Aladdin. She has her own desires and motives in this. Our animated buddies like Iago, Abu, Raja and Carpet are a hoot, easily the best part of the film for me. Aladdin is played very well. I even think Will Smith makes a great Genie. When I heard he was cast, unlike most, I was quite eager. He is a really funny actor and I think he coulda put an excellent twist on the character. But here's where we get into bad...<br/><br/>The writing was weak. I saw glimpes of brilliance in the performance the cast was doing, but I just feel the writing side was lacking. A lot of subpar comedy. The jokes felt forced, including a Jam one that persists the entire duration of the film that is just awful. They pull a lot from the original without changing the dialogue, and it felt out of place and awkward at times. I think they could have changed more to be honest.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Jafar, although the little backstory they build is nice. He just seemed to mellow of an actor for such a dynamic villain. I expected low manipulative tones and crazy maniacal peaks, and his performance overall was quite monotone.<br/><br/>The pacing was so weird. Some character development and believability is extremely rushed. Then some moments were slowed down and gave so much depth, what we should have got throughout. There is a developing new subplot that I thought was an interesting twist on things, but toward the end it wraps up in like 20 seconds where I was left feeling like it was a cancelled show trying to shove a season in an episode.<br/><br/>And the fact that the Cave of Wonders doesn't physically talk made me sad. (but not docking points for that, just made me a sad boi)<br/><br/>Overall I just felt it was a slightly below average movie, which is why it lands on 4 for me. Some new things I really enjoyed, but a mix of bad jokes, weird pace shifts and awkward moments. Kids will love it, fans will enjoy the nods to the original, but for me personally, it just felt odd."

","One of my favorite male animated Disney characters is Aladdin. I like that he is presented as a really good person. Mena Massoud is perfect in that role, in this colorful, spectacular retelling. He is sincere and empathetic, and works well with so popular Will Smith as Genie, and impressive Naomi Scott as Jasmine. With all the garbage out there that professional critics ""have to"" praise to prove they are among ""the elite,"" ""Aladdin's"" excellence stands out."

","The film was serviceable until Will Smith as the genie came on screen.
For me something just didn't seem right about him in this role, it was not funny and painfully forced.
This film shows its directed by Guy Ritche, but there's nothing in this film that shows this, and just like the Star Wars series Disney producers just seem to hire these talented directors and have them churn out these tired by the books remakes.
I only went to see this as I have a cinema subscription, please do not go out and pay to see this because of nostalgia, Rocketman is also out which is a far superior musical biopic."
"saptesh786","7","2","6","27 May 2019"," Only for Jasmine and Genie !
","I did not see animated version of Aladdin, then I am not comparing with it. Most of viewers compared. But as me there should be not comparison between two versions of same movie or story even after a long period gap, because each has its flavour and standard with their timelines.. So Aladdin should be judged as standalone.
Firstly to mention that the role of Jasmine, as it is major attraction of the movie. Naomi Scott is perfect for this role; she looks graceful and gorgeous with her stunning outfits. Her presence will give you relief from get boring from such old times Arabian tales which are mostly from magical background. I do not hesitate to say that Jasmine gave me full value of my money and time and actually went to multiplex only for her. Second mentionable thing is Will Smith. He comically played the role of Jin. Rest are okay. The tiger, the monkey, the bird etc for kids. Only flying carpet comes for you to ride enjoyable moments. Musical story telling is a new idea, but it seems a bit boring for me. My suggestion is that if you want to see glorious & charming princess and a comical Jin then watch Aladdin otherwise leave it."
"MrDHWong","7","2","6","26 May 2019"," A fun live action update of the animated original, despite struggling to justify its existence
","Aladdin is a fantasy film based on the 1992 animated Disney film of the same name (itself based on the Middle Eastern folk tale ""Aladdin and the Magic Lamp""). Directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Sherlock Holmes), it is a fun live action update of the animated original, despite struggling to justify its existence.<br/><br/>In the city of Agrabah, Aladdin (Mena Massoud), a good natured street thief, is recruited by the Sultan's Grand Vizier Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) to search inside a cave for a mysterious magic lamp. Upon finding the lamp, Aladdin is betrayed by Jafar and is left die when he inadvertently frees the Genie of the Lamp (Will Smith). The eccentric Genie declares Aladdin his new master and tells him that he can grant him three wishes for just about anything, including the social status to marry the Sultan's daughter Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott).<br/><br/>With its catchy music and nice setpieces, the live action Aladdin is a respectful update of the 1992 film, but unfortunately this is not nearly enough. Many years from now, it will be the original animated film people will be intending to see instead of this one. While some live action Disney remakes can bring something new and exciting to the story, such as Dumbo and The Jungle Book, this version of Aladdin does very little that has not been done before. The songs are the same, the plot is the same, and the character motivations are the same. The cast does a reasonable job, with Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott as Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, respectively working well together due to their believable chemistry. Will Smith also injects his trademark wittiness and likeability into his performance as the Genie, but never once does he come close to topping the late great Robin Williams. However, Marwan Kenzari seems too young to be playing Jafar, as this role would be better suited to someone closer in age to the Sultan himself, likely around middle age. The one thing I feel this film did somewhat better than the original is the romance between Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. The 1992 version went with the typical ""falling in love after one day"" trope whereas in this one, the audience can actually feel their love blossoming over time. Aside from that, this remake is inessential for the most part.<br/><br/>I rate it 6.5/10"
"Benslie","7","2","6","26 May 2019"," Doesn't have the same magic as the original
","First of all, like all the other live-action remakes of classic Disney films, this one has changes to it and one of them was good and the rest was kinda bad. The only good one is what they did with Jasmine. Naomi Scott was incredible as Jasmine and played her to absolute perfection to her abilities. But the thing I want to talk about is what they did with her character. Instead of keeping her the same as her animated counterpart they changed her so she better fit a strong female that should be seen more in film. She also had the best song in the entire film and I hope it gets nominated for best original song for the Oscars. The set design in this film was outstanding and just looked spectacular on the big screen. All of the sets looked like it was taken right out of the animated film and just increased. The costume design was also really good. Even though we already knew who the common people were and the royalty it still showed the status difference. Although I did hate how they made Aladdin have clean clothes. Now, the original songs are classics and everybody knows them and I hate how they changed some of the lyrics mainly with ""One Jump Ahead"" and ""Prince Ali"". I do understand why they changed them to help fit the story but with ""Prince Ali"" one of the lyrics was changed and it pissed me off. I talked about how Naomi Scott is great as Jasmine but for the rest of the actors, it wasn't the same. Now, I'm not going to hate on Will Smith as the Genie because he did accept a tough challenge of taking over for the legendary Robin Williams and he did make it his own but my main probably was with Mena Massoud and Marwan Kenzari, who plays Jafar. Mena Massoud was a decent Aladdin what he lacked was the singing ability but I will give him credit for putting himself out there. But, Marwan Kenzari just didn't do it for me as Jafar. He pretty much was a boring villain who was two-dimensional. There were two big scene changes that just bugged me all because it affected the story and those were the opening scene and the ending. The opening made no sense because it was out of order and the ending just was a completely different ending that sucked. This film does keep the original message of always be yourself but it messes it up with one thing. Also, the CGI in this film is just bad. Nothing CGI really looked realistic in any way. There were lots of scenes in this film that awkwardly ended and transitioned to the next with no proper connection. I'm not sure if it was just me but the humour in this film was kinda weak. The score by Alan Menken was good at least. In the end, Aladdin (2019) doesn't have the same magic as the original animated one and shouldn't have been touched at all. It's a good kids film but for people who grew up with the original, it's not that good."

","In reading the negative reviews, I can't help but feel these are just people who love the hating game and the digital world has helped them exasperate their critical misery and shaming on everything they can. Just enjoy the story! It's fun and I was captivated alongside my children the whole time. We've watched it over and over, whereas the cartoon has only been watched by us a couple times. Here's why:<br/><br/>THE CAST IS FABULOUS. Will Smith, rightly so, does his own thing with Genie. And while different from the beloved Robin Williams, he was wonderful! Will Smith is an iconic actor and the new take on the role was VERY well done. People complained about the blue animation, but when you combine the storytelling behind why and how he's a magical genie, how else should it have been portrayed? CGI can be done in many ways, it's called imagination! This is a children's movie, and my kids loved how they did it.<br/><br/>Dalia was an AMAZING comical addition from the original cartoon. LOVED. HER.<br/><br/>Aladdin was charismatic with great chemistry between both Jasmine and Genie. The scene with him and Genie and ""the jams"" lololol! It was fantastic. Such awkward perfection. There is so much wit and banter between all the characters throughout this movie that makes it an absolute family favorite.<br/><br/>Jasmine - WOW. This portrayal was a better take than I could have ever imagined from the cartoon version. Her acting was stand out and the scene where she sings Speechless gave me goosebumps. She was absolutely sensational in her role. I cannot emphasize her talent enough and my whole family has fallen in love with her.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie a nine vs ten was due to Jafar. I feel the acting and script could've been enhanced and more dynamic with him. Maybe if they'd flip-flopped actors between who played Jafar and the guard Hakim the zest that I felt missing would have been better portrayed?<br/><br/>THE IMAGERY was some of the best I've ever seen from Disney. It was So. Well. Done. The beautiful layout and detail created a magical charm that left me feeling the awe of childhood. This, to me, is what sets the live action movie apart from the cartoon - flat animation to absolutely STUNNING depth and scenery. (And don't want to forget a special shout out to Magic Carpet! ðŸ™‚)<br/><br/>THE MUSIC, old and new, was moving and so engaging. I found myself wanting to sing along throughout. Definitely new car and shower playlists for my kids now!<br/><br/>Overall this fun, funny, and captivating retelling captured the hearts and imagination of my children and myself in a new way. I know my kiddos will be watching this, reminiscing, with their own kids someday."
"silentbobbeartank","3","1","2","2 April 2020"," Tried too hard.
","I feel as if it tried to hard. Instead of being a friendly reminder of our childhood it attempted to surpass it. Unfortunately, it was kinda sloppy. There were some things I did appreciate. For example, I do like the fact that they tried their best to cast appropriately for the region the story was based in ( unlike the live action Beauty and the Beast). Also, it was a beautiful movie. The colors were great and the animation nice.<br/><br/>I don't appreciate them casting a clueless European in the role as one of the princes when it seems it was more of a not so subtle statement rather than a casting choice that drove anything, even a good joke.<br/><br/>I understand why they made Jasmine a stronger character but at points it seemed like in doing that they held back her potential because they remembered that the movie they were trying to remake wasn't about her.<br/><br/>A love interest for the genie was completely unnecessary and kinda confusing. Just to make it work, they had to rush in some quick 20 seconds of filler to remind the audience of what we were able to figure out as soon as the movie began.<br/><br/>The new songs were bleh. Totally forgettable, and didn't help drive the movie. They actually had to stop the progress of the movie to fit them in. It was completely jarring.<br/><br/>Finally Will Smith. While he wasn't the worst I think there were other actors who could have done just as good or even better. Right off the top of my head, Jason Mantzoukas from Brooklyn nine-nine. I get it, but if they wanted someone high energy, then even Jack Black would have been a better fit.<br/><br/>There was more but at this point I think I have made it clear how I felt. I wish it were entertaining beating waiting to go from one scene to the next to see what they butchered. Despite the good, it's just not worth the watch."

","If ""Dumbo"" earlier this year was an example for Disney of how not to do a remake, this is a great example of exactly how to do one. This far exceeded my expectations. I love Guy Ritchie's other films (""Sherlock Holmes"", ""Man From UNCLE"", ""Stardust"", among others), and so I expected this film to pretty good, but this just wowed me! The film is different enough that it's not just watching the animated one again, but familiar enough to stay true to the story. I see this film as a fairy tale that has been passed down and changed slightly over time (as actual fairy tales are.) Believe it or not, there are spoilers for this movie (not this review, though). I know the biggest question is ""How is Will Smith as the Genie?"" I'm not going to compare him to Robin Williams, because that's not fair, but I will say that he is the best part of the film. He does exactly what the character of the Genie is supposed to do: Be the comic relief who occasionally gives helpful, friendly advice. It's a throwback to his ""Fresh Prince"" days. The plot does move a bit quickly in the beginning and some scenes from the original are switched around or changed slightly (Even the songs have some new lyrics!), but I felt that made the film fresher. There are some amazing dance sequences in this film that reminded me of a Bollywood flick. Also, side-note, my screening was in 3D, but it added nothing, so don't pay the extra $5 for the 3D. This is probably the most visually impressive, best directed film this year so far. I had a smile on my face the whole time and was totally enthralled.

I thought he was going to be too much Mike Lowry but he did a great job! The cgi was terrible. His head/neck was the worst I couldn't stop focusing on it, but that part isn't his fault. He kept Robin Williams spirit alive with his performance. I enjoyed him. I didn't buy into the love interest storyline but it didn't ruin the movie for me. What did was the sets, it didn't properly capture atmosphere like the cartoon did. You can see the painted backgrounds and some sets looked obviously recycled for different scenes and it was too dark. Also, I thought Jafar was too young...

","I was quite generous with the 6 rating but that's mainly due to my fondness of the original animated version and the memories that this movie triggered. A lot was wrong with this film as both Aladdin and Jasmine didn't have the ability to emit any kind of emotional connection with the audience, very wooden and poorly acted characters by both actors involved. However, Will Smith as the Genie was quite brilliant and provided nearly all of this movies highlights. Without the Genie this movie would probably score about a 3/10 but Will Smith's performance was so charasmatic and funny that he really rescued this movie from failure. Also, i didn't see the point in Jasmine's 2 songs that weren't part of the orginal. They were both riddled with autotune and didn't fit into the rest of the movie as they tried to sound like some kind of power ballad rather than an easy to listen to DIsney tune."

","Live action remake of the Disney hit, diamond in the ruff thief, Aladdin is smitten with the local princess and with the help of the genie of the lamp (Will Smith) he makes his moves much to the chagrin of ambitious baddie Jafar.<br/><br/>Extremely colourful and an on the whole fun adventure for all the family, this is hampered by questionable casting. Smith is enjoyable as the genie, but inevitably is in the shadow of the original Robin Williams and often looks a shade uncomfortable throughout. Massoud and Scott are fine if unremarkable, whilst Kenzari as Jafar is just deadly dull and is not the pantomime menace he is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Fun enough with Aladdin entering the city as Prince Ali the highlight."

","Words cannot begin to express my dissatisfaction for this movie. I was not able to finish, so I will simply state this is a review on the first hour and my input of the revamped franchise as a whole. I was initially excited that Disney was recreating the classic tales with the the hope that there were twists that added to the quality of the movie not remove the quality. Unfortunately, I have not appreciated any of the movies as a whole. There were great moments in each such as for this movie, I thought it was an interesting take to have Jasmine think Aladdin had stolen something. However, the last thing I say was Aladdin and Genie who, in my opinion, are good at off the cuff commentary were hemming and hawing about where the location of Ababwa was ""North South."" Trying to come across as or being a prince you have or should have a grasp on what you are involved in. It seemed that this movie's objective was to make men look stupid, and I must say if I didn't know any better, I don't care what kingdom you are, if a prince is trying to marry your daughter and is perceived as bad you aren't going to let your daughter marry that person: ""Ali"" and especially Anders. In addition the altering of the music, the obvious cgi for genie, and the way that they handled Aladdin and the Genie was lacking for me. Lady and the Tramp so far is the only half way decent remake. I am unsure as to how the rest of the film was, but after seeing them butcher much of the original storyline so that they could bring something different to the table infuriates me. I do believe that the original Aladdin could be better, but this was a letdown for me. I don't know if the blame goes to Guy Ritchie, the producers, or Disney but one or all of them dropped the ball with this one."

"apelieuproar-69389","1","1","2","7 January 2020"," A Disney Channel-worthy production on the big screen...
","What the ever-loving HECK? Did Disney really think this was worthy to be released in theaters {And did IMDb users really rate this a 7.0?)?<br/><br/>Honestly, if Will Smith wasn't in it, I don't think it would be. Smith is really the only one who is able to carry himself in this movie.  Naomi Scott, while strikingly pretty, doesn't really do much (besides something really stupid, which I will talk about later in this review), despite the film's attempt to empower her. Jasmine's maid Dalia, played by Nasim Pedrad does her best, but her lines just aren't funny.<br/><br/>Was Guy Ritchie really needed to direct this? I'm not saying he's a great filmmaker, but he's done some good movies. This is certainly not one of them and I don't see why he would do this one, where none of his trademarks are apparent and thus his talents are wasted.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the musical numbers are boring and the CGI is uneven. I guess the CGI budget was tied up in the subsequently released 'The Lion King'. Let's just say the tiger, Rajah, does not get the same attention to detail that that movie does, especially the three male lions. Then again, Rajah is little more than window dressing, which holds even more true for the 1992 original film; but the remake could have made him a little more useful and could have made him more impressive.<br/><br/>The rules for the Genie using his powers are a little iffy (or a ""grey area"" in his words"") in this movie (and, to the same general extent, in the original). At one point, he needs Aladdin to make a wish to save him from drowning. Yet earlier, he manipulated Aladdin like a puppet to make him look like a good dancer. I don't recall that as being part of his first wish. Also, the magic carpet has been torn at one point, and the Genie mends it without a second thought. Why doesn't he need permission to do this?<br/><br/>But the film's low point comes at the film's climax (SPOILER FOLLOWS) when Jafar has possession of the lamp and wished to be Sultan (waste of a wish right there; just saying) and has the palace at spearpoint. But then Jasmine steals the lamp from him and jumps off the balcony, where Aladdin on his magic carpet has just conveniently arrived to catch her. But that isn't the stupid part. No, the STUPID part is that Jasmine DOESN'T USE the LAMP (!). Instead we get a pointless, protracted chase scene where Jasmine actually loses the lamp a couple of times, finally losing it to Iago. What was the point of this scene except to extend the film's run time and to show Iago as a giant parrot? Why didn't Jasmine think to use the lamp even once all this time? This is honestly the dumbest moment I have ever witnessed in a film. Even if the rest of the film was even just average, this moment would sink it.<br/><br/>This remake doesn't improve on the original. I do applaud the casting of people of Middle Eastern descent (or Southeast Asia descent in the case of Scott) but none of those cast really have much present leading me to think the casting director just picked names out of a hat.<br/><br/>I also don't mind the female empowerment angle and the idea of Jasmine becoming the sultan, but it just comes off as political statement here, since her father is still alive, if I'm not mistaken. Does he abdicate the sultanship to her? Not really sure what went on there, but the moment does smack of ""wokeness""."

This is a big turn off to a whole population of viewers who do not want to see any more black men in movies paired with nonblack women. It's hurtful and shameful. It's like movie creators don't care about little black girls or women at all. When a black woman is cast as a side kick in a movie, the writers never think to pair those women with a love interest at all but all of these movies just throw black men in any movie and then to add insult to injury always pair them with none black women. Aren't the Disney princess movies suppose to be mostly appealing to young girls who are their biggest audience? Yet young black girls are erased in this movie but a black male is present.

This movie is a TERRIBLE Aladdin movie. All the changes they implemented made it so the movie doesn't work as the original easily does.. and the character of Aladdin is NOTHING like the original. In fact, it's bad.. really bad! And he is supposed to be the protagonist!<br/><br/>If you like the original, you shouldn't like this at all. And whoever does, doesn't understand why the original is good in both storytelling and character development.<br/><br/>
Here, Aladdin doesn't get the proper introduction. Instead, they jump to the meeting Jasmine scene (because she clearly is more important as a character this time than he is). He has a general awfully personality, and doesn't really earn the audience's respect at the end. It's someone else entirely.. and with that, the point of the movie (a diamond in the rough) is traded for a Jasmine-centric plot, because women are important now, and they can't be good along the man (it's impossible to write both of them properly!!).
Even Jaffar was ruined.. no song, no personality, no charisma.<br/><br/>There is nothing to care about this movie.

The villain is so cringey. I was feeling so bad for the actor. Terrible acting, very painful to watch.<br/><br/>The emotional connections between the characters seem rushed and did not convince me. Very paradoxical: the story feels rushed while being utterly boring. Nothing in the script feels believable.<br/><br/>I was relieved when the movie ended and I felt really mad at myself for wasting 2 hours. I had no intention of watching it, but gave on evening because my husband wanted to revisit one of his childhood favorite. I guess I'm the lucky one: I have never been a fan and had no expectations. My husband was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>Maybe Disney should stick to building stories around their old successes, like they did with Maleficent, instead of trying to sell us the same barely revamped soup all over again. I think it all comes down to laziness and treating the public like they're dumb. After Beauty and the Beast, I suspected this movie had a big chance of being bad; I should have listened to my guts and put those 2 hours to better use!<br/><br/>It really isn't a fiasco: it's just the pinnacle of mediocrity.

","I grew up watching the original, I knew this would be its own unique film and not a shot for shot remake and I was skeptical about Will Smith playing genie but I did my best to go in open minded, curious to see a modern spin.<br/><br/>That being said, I was really not impressed. I was really disappointed from the very beginning. I felt like I was watching a released to TV Nickelodeon movie. Aladdin and Jasmine both performed poorly in my mind, it may have been a directing decision but either way it was the kind of acting I expect to see on a kids tv show. Jafar was by far a bad casting choice, he looked and sounded like something from SpyKids 9 and didn't even feel like a bad guy except in a few parts. Though I do like Will Smith most of the time, the guy did not sing well and the animated characters Iago and Abu looked terrible.<br/><br/>I feel like Disney, long ago went away from doing justice to their classics and now they are more interested in hooking the next generation of Disney kids and creating a ""new"" feel to Disney. I accepted this long ago but it still feels like Disney today try's a little too hard to be PC.<br/><br/>The pros though, I felt like Disney tried to go for a more culturally accurate portrayal of the film and personally I thought that was great (even with a few glaring inaccuracies). The animated sets and locations were visually good to look at, I was even mildly impressed with the added songs and Will Smith's personal touch on the genies humor was a refreshingly nice surprise in this movie.<br/><br/>To make it simple, I didn't feel nostalgic watching it at all. That's ok but even as a stand-alone movie, it did not impress. The film was more of a television movie with an over inflated animation budget. If you've never seen any version of Aladdin before and don't expect much in acting, then you can probably really enjoy it."

It's sad to read a lot of negative reviews where it seemed they were over doing it to find anything negative just to be contrary. Is this honestly, the world we live in now?<br/><br/>I loved this movie and the two young actors (Mena Massoud & Naomi Scott) starring in it, who were very talented. I teared up watching my old friend from afar, Will Smith who was brilliant as his own Genie. He takes us on a wonderfully sentimental trip back to his earlier music and dancing talent career days and pays a bit of a tribute to Robin Williams, who I'm sure were friends. It was great to see and hear him like he used to be when he was gettin giggy. I'm old enough to remember those days 😉 and it's amazing to be blessed with 2 magical performances of Aladdin's Genie.<br/><br/>There isn't a better song than ""A Whole New World"" where every nostalgic dream you've ever had comes back to you in those lyrics.

","I super enjoyed this. I was really hesitant but I think it was similar but different to the original. The actors chosen for Aladdin, Jasmine, Sultan, Jafar, and Genie!<br/><br/>Will Smith did a great job. He made Genie his own but I still felt reaves of Robin William's. I think not watching it because he's not him is silly . One is a live action and one is animated. The animated film is still a classic but I also think this version was fantastic. I think its up there as one of the better live action remakes. I actually enjoyed it more than Beauty and the Beast."

","Aladdin is about a guy named Aladdin who gets hired to do a job that requires him to get the lamp of the genie. He takes the lamp realizing that his boss is a bad guy and he uses the lamp to help him like a girl.<br/><br/>Aladdin was a fine movie. I bet this is how some other live action remakes would be. I think the Little Mermaid will be like this. I went into this wanting one thing and getting another. I though the songs were good. I really enjoyed listing to them. Also the acting I thought was good. I was entertained when watching the actor. I thought will smith did a good job. When he was the genie he was acting like Robin Williams and when he was himself he acted like well, himself. It was better when he acted like himself. Those were the good things. I didn't really like the make-up. Somebody was kidnapped in a bag and he was perfectly clean. Also in the chase scenes the town looked pretty clean. Also some of the action and dance scenes were speed up. It was really noticeable too. I really don't know why they did that. Also the CGI wasn't the best. When a person was licked by a tiger they looked like they did before after he got licked. I just looked sloppy.<br/><br/>Overall, Aladdin was okay. If you are a Disney fan I would recommend it."

","Ok the original was mostly held true in this remake, the production was great, the cinematography was great, but then Disney goes all woke on us. In the original, Jasmine was a woman who just didn't want to marry to appease the law, she wanted love. In the new one, she just wants to be Sultan and rule the world... why, Disney, why??? What's wrong with just wanting love? Oh, they wanted to be culturally relative. Stupid addition to the movie... and that number of Jasmine singing her power anthem towards the end...good lord someone rub my back while I throw up the popcorn... or just lop my head off.

This one just seemed bereft of emotion or really any ""energy"", especially the genie.
Seemed a bit ""dilated in"" with sub-par vocals which use over-the-top imagery to try and maintain some sort of a story.
Was hoping for better, especially from Will, but it was just not there.
Seems the only times he really enjoys the movie was when he was talking about what he could do. A better title of this would have been: ""Genie, An Aladdin Story"""

"nasamutalisk","Null","1","2","20 August 2019"," Very pleasantly surprised
","I love the 1992 Aladdin movie (and have fond memories of the first sequel with Jafar the Genie as well), so when Disney inevitably announced the live action remake of it I was cautiously intrigued. Their previous live action remakes of their animated classics have mostly been a decent enough experience to watch but only a few of them really managed to stand out as fantastic, which in my opinion very much include Beauty and the Beast as possibly the best of them all which could arguably also be said of its animated forerunner.<br/><br/>My interest quickly faded when Guy Ritchie was announced as the director as I had a hard time picturing him slapping together anything close to what the original movie was with his somewhat unique style of directing and editing. I love some of his older movies, but besides the whole ""street-rat, orphaned hero thief"" which fit his usual narrative, nothing else seemed to fit between the two. And when Will Smith was cast as the Genie my expectations plummeted. I love Will Smith but he has zero range as an actor and never really manages to portray anything but the Fresh Prince, just in different situations (although to be fair I have seen him in a few films where he showed both range and great talent instead of smug charme, but they are few and far between).<br/><br/>However this movie turned out to be as much of a copy/paste remake as Beauty and the Beat, which is not meant as a bad thing but a very good one. The cast was outstanding, although the Aladdin took some getting used to, and the few changes the movie did to the original story was well done. All the original music remains within the new movie, sung by the new cast and while it never reach the same level as the original movie in most cases, it almost nails it but makes up for it more than once by amazing dance coordination, costume and set designs.<br/><br/>Most surprisingly was certainly Will Smith, who from the start had the impossible task of taking over Genie from the late great Robin Williams. But his natural charming persona and comedy chops serves him well here, and instead of trying to emulate Williams in his portrayal, he combines the usual charm and smug confidence of the Fresh Prince with the emotional and fatherly touch he has tapped into since he seemingly became comfortable in his role as a father in real life. And while he might not be remembered for decades for being the Genie as much as Robin Williams was, he certainly managed to create something just as memorable.<br/><br/>Taste is taste, some people seem to dislike it quite a bit which I find suspiciously strange if they enjoyed the original movie, but instead of listening to them or me, I recommend seeing the movie and make up your own mind."

That in Movie terms is more than a generation away. We, the adults, watch the original and it brings back good memories. A 13 year old watching the original today will probably think ""good god this is old""...<br/><br/>And so here is the live action epic made for them and retold for us.

","I was very tempted to watch this movie at first, but then I read the reviews, which made me skeptical. I however decided to give it a try, and I am still very surprised by all the bad reviews on the internet. The movie is an adaptation of a cartoon, of a story for children, although I, throughout the movie, didn't once feel like it was (okay maybe once). To all the poeple out there considering whether to watch or not, if you like the cartoon, you will like the live action movie: it develops quite well, it's funny, romantic, and just very well done in my opinion. I don't understand what all the fuss is about, as I personally enjoyed the story, the special effects, the songs (I was almost tempted to skip some but they're part of it, as they were in the cartoon), and the acting.
Keep in mind it's the story of Aladdin, not the Titanic, so I don't know what everyone else was expecting."

what a counter performance I must say..
I'm not gonna rant on about Disney being lazy remaking every movie in new 3D/realistic form, if only it would bring something I'd be all in<br/><br/>but Aladdin just proves the contrary
the charm is gone, the actor playing Aladdin is just some random chap that might have traits close to the cartoon one but that is it, and that isn't enough, Jasmin is off in every aspect, Jafar? let's not get started on him or Iago.. my god my favourite macaw in history, who actually sparked my love for birds when I was a kid just looks like a MEAN angry parrot now, probably the most ruined character of the whole movie despite his gorgeous 3D rendering.. it just doesn't belong in this movie<br/><br/>of course I kept Genie for last, will smith isn't even the issue per say, his acting wasn't actually bad, it's just not doing it, the blue sparkling 3D/2D genie thing feels off and awkward, I didn't get that smile on my face as when I do with the original version, and as for Apu well that's just bad, while Iago is totally out of character, Apu is just poorly rendered and I just wish it wasn't there<br/><br/>All that put together you just end up with a movie that you wish would end sooner so you can say: ""ok done, seen it, let's move on""<br/><br/>While I've been rewatching the 1992 version quite a few times I'll say for certain this was my first and last visioning.
The only redeeming factor I could see is that people watching this ""new"" version today might feel like giving a look at the old version and discover what magic feels like<br/><br/>Very disappointed in Disney on this one, made me skip Lion King completely not to ruin my childhood love for this master piece like I did with Aladdin"

Will Smith as Genie was easily the best part about the movie. He was charismatic, energetic, fun and had great comic timing. Sir Robin Williams would definitely be proud.<br/><br/>The Chemistry between Jasmine and Aladdin was great. The songs were good although the were not that well filmed ( except friend like me that seemed grand and probably i like it better than the late Sir robin Williams take on that song).<br/><br/>Jasmine's character was better showcased here.( also Naomi Scott played the role beautifully)<br/><br/>Aladdin was alright though not as confident as in the original( specially in the song prince Ali but it was better he was a bit nervous as he just became a prince) Also he and Abu were very good friends just like the original.<br/><br/>There are many things that i don't like in this like the love story of Genie with the maid of jasmine.<br/><br/>The Sultan( cause I loved the original much more, not saying the acting was bad or anything but he was not written the way I wanted) was a bit dull for me.<br/><br/>But Jafar was by far the worst part for me, Original Jafar was much more intimidating and dangerous but here I just didn't like him.<br/><br/>Also the leaving out of scenes like Jafar turning to a snake( though Iago being turned to a big bird and chasing Aladdin and Jasmine on the magic carpet was still good) and jasmine being stuck in the hour glass was a big bummer for me.<br/><br/>Iago the bird also had no real personality as oppose to the original.<br/><br/>The sets did not not look as grand as the original.(though they were still salvageable).<br/><br/>All in all the movie was quite funny and don't really deserves the hate being shown. One can definitely watch it for the performance of Will Smith"

Third, the cgi team did a fantastic job with the scenes and the landscapes. It was on point.

"reddevil-94693","8","1","2","7 July 2019"," Disney Continues to Impress Where They Shouldn't
","Everyone knows on paper these live action remakes are a bad idea. After all, if people love something, why remake it? Reboots are one thing, because more often than not, they allow for different interpretations of the stories. These remakes tell the same stories, with the same characters, with the same pacing... most of the time. And yet, with every release, Disney seems to prove that somehow, they have a winning formula.<br/><br/>Take Aladdin, for example. Came out in 1992 and was awesome. Everyone loved the style, the music, Robin Williams, etc. Nothing further necessary, right? Well, we did get two VHS sequels and a cartoon, but it still remains a classic. Well, on the heels of a slew of Disney remakes, Aladdin this year may be one of their best.<br/><br/>Like usual, there are things that the original did better, and there are things that the remake improved on. Aladdin and Genie are both equally good in both, but Jafar is nowhere near creepy and intimidating enough in the remake to surpass his animated counterpart. To give credit to Marwan Kenzari, he does fine with the role, and I actually bought him being the villain by the end. But it just felt like something was missing.<br/><br/>I do feel that the royal family is better this time around. The sultan isn't nearly the buffoon he was in the original, but he does still have his moments of weakness against Jafar. Jasmine is played very, *very* well by Naomi Scott, and her plot goes from wanting to see more to wanting to be more. It can be a little on the nose, but it works to the film's credit for the most part.<br/><br/>Will Smith is undoubtedly the best part of this film as Genie. He owns the role and makes it his own, without ever coming across as trying to take over Robin Williams' legacy with the character. He does fantastic, and I'm glad we gave him a chance in the role.<br/><br/>Overall, Aladdin is great. Not perfect, mind you. But it's very enjoyable, and does a great job establishing merit for these remakes. Hopefully the momentum continues, especially with The Lion King."

"South7th","6","1","2","30 June 2019"," For a Disney live-action remake, it was good.
","Disney has been making these classic remakes dark and Aladdin was a fresh new take, going to a more fun route. Mena Massoud is the physical embodiment of Aladdin that's for sure (the looks, the voice, the charm). I want to praise the guy for showing an absolute Aladdin persona, although there were many scenes where Jasmine or the Genie upstaged him too much. The OG Genie had a larger-than-life charisma too but Aladdin wasn't sidelined.<br/><br/>Naomi Scott was great. Jasmine was fleshed out in this ""modern"" version and the character could've easily come out as a petty feminist portrayal but it didn't. Scott showed a fierce Jasmine but with a realistic development from fearful to fearless. Will Smith had a different but entertaining version of Genie. His musical numbers were the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Marwan Kenzari (Jafar), acting-wise, at least as how Guy Ritchie interpreted his character as subtle evil, was good. He did have Jafar vibes in his voice and has a sociopathic stare. I wasn't expecting the OG Jafar persona because that's just too comical for live-action and would end up as Hook or the Wolf in their respective live-action movies which would look cheap tbh. I like how Disney are humanizing their villains, particularly showing their motivations and not just evil for evil's sake. Jafar's parallel to Aladdin was a good addition. Another change that I like is the irony in the way he requested his 3rd wish, *desperately begged* to be the most powerful as opposed to highly commanding the Genie in the OG.<br/><br/>The soundtrack instrumentals were better than the original in my opinion. The additional arabian musical elements just made them better. The vocals weren't on par to the original but compared to other remakes, they have much more personality in them. Speechless was good, although it did stick out from the other songs. It has arabian elements too if you pay attention closely but hearing it inside the movie, it felt like a Camp Rock song. ""Proud of Your Boy"" should've been added so Aladdin would have a personal goal like Jasmine. Also, if they wanted the last fight to be all serious, they could've rearranged ""Prince Ali Reprise"" to fit the new ""serious"" Jafar.<br/><br/>The CGI was fine, except for the lack of Abu and Iago scenes, and Jafar sorcery. They were obviously saving budget for specific parts and excluded unnecessary CGI. The pacing was too slow sometimes, but nothing significant to ruin the scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a movie with visuals, choreo, and music as its strengths and the impossibility to translate entertaining cartoonish personas (which people loved about the original) into live-action as its weakness."

I really enjoyed this movie being a big fan of the animated Disney movies and then seeing them live action I am impressed on how they offer those little references that help you remember the animated movie. The city of Agraba looked amazing live action as well. I wasn't really to impressed with the main actor as Aladdin I felt his acting was very dry in lots of the scenes, #willsmith was an excellent casting choice for the genie and offered his own flavour to the character. #Naomiscott looked sexy as hell as Jasmine.

","This movie really uplifted my spirit. I haven't seen a movie in a long, long time that made me feel so joyful.
There are few movies that can take me to a low to make me cry; but, not very many movies can change my
mood to an all time natural high to make me feel cheerful. I was very impressed with all of the actors/actress performance in Aladdin.
They have all did such a brilliant job! :-)"

","I watched it in IMAX and it is absolutely stunning. The visuals are so beautiful and the singing is good too. I especially love the new song speechless!<br/><br/>Would have given it a 10 but I do feel that for the high notes in Speechless, Naomi's voice sounds a little weak, only a teeny bit but enough for me to feel like the power isn't quite there."
"slytherinserpent","9","1","2","26 June 2019"," Beautiful
","This movie is amazing and the cast are perfect. Beautiful visuals, beautiful songs, beautiful choreography. It's also very funny and Aladdin as the main character is so cute and adorable. As for Jasmine, she's the same brave and feisty girl from the animation version, but sadly they don't include the iconic ""I'm not a prize to be won"" line from the animation."

"jredler1990","9","1","2","25 June 2019"," Went in with low expectations...
","So I went to this movie with low, low expectations, as how to you replace Robin Williams as the genie? You can't. Well as the movie went on and we got introduced to the new-age genie played by Will Smith, he made it his own. He used some of Robin Williams jokes and humor, but made it his own.<br/><br/>The story was really good and the colors and songs were amazing.<br/><br/>Like I said, I went in expecting this to be bad, but I was proven wrong and it was actually really good."

"florrieprocter","8","1","2","25 June 2019"," Fun family friendly movie
","Many people are comparing this to the original animated movie, however I don't think that needs to be done. This film becomes its own, this is highlighted by Will Smith's role. He did not step into Robin William's shoes however he kept the role of the Genie without ruining it, just as the overall film did. The new song additions and more complex layers to characters all help to make a fun moving.
The aesthetic of the film is also brilliant, drawing the viewer in absolutely. Mena Massoud also does well to take over the protagonist role."

"marvinorlandorodrigue","7","1","2","16 June 2019"," Good live-action so far
","The film was really enjoyable, Will Smith, without a doubt it was the best of the whole movie.
But not everything is rosy: 1 - Jasmine, that is the damn problem, I remember that the 92, was more tender, here pity that make it more feminist, and more arrogant (at least it was not much like captain marvel) 2 - Jafar, literally the one from 1992 had his songs, and is for me the best villain of Disney, here meh ... he is a dry villain, without emotions, nah 3- many things were suppressed.
But not everything is bad: 1- Mena as Aladdin I do not know if it was some extra that made the dance scenes, or he was the actor himself, but God !!!!  I literally enjoy it 2- Will Smith obviously, I always remember the robin Williams, but I really liked the genius that makes Will feel the same, without hesitation. 3- the damn songs, cry a lot.
I just hope the lion king is better or the same as Aladdin
Therefore to my personal opinion it deserves a 7/10. 7.6 / 10 to be compressible."
"takubasketses","9","1","2","14 June 2019"," It's worth watching even for adults
","At first, I thought this movie is for kids, but it's not! The song, acting,the filming of each scene is great! ( Though the screenplay is what Disney is like, as always lol). What make me rate this movie 9 point is that the sound facility of the theatre I went wasn't enough to fully enjoy this movie, it's not because of this movie itself. I want to give 10 actually. At the most famous singing scene, in which two hero and heroin fly by the magic carpet, the sound was not enough for the scene, it was small!
So I really recommend to people who's thinking of watching this movie, to take the sound facility o the theatre into account.
Sorry for my poor English, there maybe some mistakes."
"Stenun","7","1","2","14 June 2019"," It made me smile
","It made me smile. That might not sound very significant but I mean that I was smiling nearly all the way through. Once the film gets going, it is fun, enjoyable, charismatic and has a style close to the original but with just enough differences to stand out. My biggest criticisms are the ending went on longer than was necessary and some of the musical numbers didn't quite have the same oomph as in the original. But they still made me smile and I still got a kick out of them. I won't be buying any home release versions but I'm glad I saw it on the big screen and if I'm channel surfing one day in a few years and stumble across it then I will happily watch it again."

Anyways, i think the charisma of Guy Ritchie did made some remark as the story line and characters portrayal was all known. Will Smith, ofcourse, did his part well. Dance performances were good. The poetic scenes seemed a bit streched and some where, i am sorry i started comparing with the old Aladdin, Iago could have got a lot more exposure. His scenes were too funny in there. All in all, a good time pass."
"parlovechaudhary-476-893754","9","1","2","13 June 2019"," STILL IN THE AWE OF IT!!
","Usually I avoid 'rating' a video and here I am REVIEWING a Title. (I don't know how!!)<br/><br/>Aladdin, the fairy tale, we've all heard a thousand times and yet another recreation comes and takes your breath away. What an amazing work by the whole team and especially 'Guy Ritchie's' spectacular vision who immediately draws you to his world; something which many storytellers are unable to and take whole lot of time.<br/><br/>One thing that really dazzled me was the amount of detailing that Production Designer has taken care of in creating the Era. Just Marvellous! What a set! Looked so much real as if coming back to life after disappearing centuries ago. And adding layers to this Art Design was another fine job done by the CG team who made everything looked great. Plus their work on the Genie is unmatchable.<br/><br/>No point sharing views on performance front as them all being seasoned artists. (I'm in love with Will Smith again btw). Before i forget; Costume Designers around the world, now, have to definitely up their game to level up with the work which Michael Wilkinson has done for this film. Even the background is taken care of so well.<br/><br/>But what stood out great is the Choreography along with the 'full of life' music.
Extraordinary it is!<br/><br/>Please don't ruin your experience watching it on a small screen. Some films are made for Big Screens and this work of Guy Ritchie is definitely that very One."
"Homiiez206","9","1","2","13 June 2019"," Worth it!
","I thought after seeing this movie that it left me amazed, I really liked how the genie was in the movie and how the princess sung ""Speechless"" made it seem like she had a voice and felt strong, I'm the type of person to see movies with actual people then the animated ones, I really got to enjoy this one. I also liked how throughout the movie it was musical too where there were musical scenes here and there.."
"oneprettyjuli","9","1","2","12 June 2019"," Why the sucky reviews?!

I LOVED the music especially Jasmins song! Loved the costumes (they weren't trashy), the accuracy of culture, and I loved the small story twist. I thought this was an excelent movie!! I grew up with Aladdin and its one of my all time fav. Disney movies, and I still loved the remake!!
1 thing was irritating. They had a couple parts in fast forward, and so it looked weird. And Aladdin in a couple of the shots looked seriously, dare I say, goofy looking."
"redsnja","7","1","2","12 June 2019"," Family Film
","It follows true with the original in being a musical (I forgot that and groaned) I didn't know Will Smith could sing. Omg the first 20 minutes are soooo slow I almost dozed off. The flying carpet was probably the most impressive part of the movie. Bottom line is if you can entertain your kids for the first 20 minutes they will have a blast after that when the Genie comes out."

"jellsworth88","8","1","2","11 June 2019"," Better than I expected!
","I did what I think we all did and came in with pretty high reservations about Will Smith playing the genie. Funny enough, his performance is actually what I enjoyed the most! Even though Robin William will never be replaced or surpassed, Will Smith did a good job playing the part without trying to overshadow the original performance.<br/><br/>The story overall follows the original animated version. There are a few tweaks, some good some bad which I will cover below, but the songs and story are pretty much the same. But here is my overall breakdown of the good and bad of Aladdin.<br/><br/>The Good:
If you were a fan of the original, you will find this enjoyable at least. The actors do a good job vocally when covering the original songs. As mentioned before, Will Smith puts on quite a fun and enjoyable performance as the genie without trying to overthrow Robin Williams. Aladdin is great as well, mixing both charm and ignorance of higher society. Visually the movie is spot on. Overall, I had a lot of the same feelings I had when I watched the animated version as a kid.<br/><br/>The Bad:
Pretty weak performance by Jafar IMO. I felt his character was lacking in the terror and evil that embodied the animated version. I felt like there was a bit too much overacting. While I thought Jasmine had a great voice, her character was extremely annoying. I also felt (and currently feel) that Disney is going way too far with the ""Men are stupid and only women are fit to rule anything."" I won't go into a specific part as to avoid spoilers, but there is one completely out of place solo from Jasmine at the near end of the film and a strange shift from the original that I thought was Disney just trying to be appeasing and PC (women rule and men suck essentially). If those specific aspects of the film were removed, it would have been a better experience overall.<br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely recommend and I would say this is the best live action adaptation that has been done recently for Disney. I should expect all Disney films to pander to the PC culture, but I keep hoping someday society will get past this idiotic phase. If you can overlook this, it will be a great film. And finally, another applause to Will Smith's performance with I apologize for criticizing before I saw the film. Enjoy!"
"fatimabaig-98844","8","1","2","11 June 2019"," An awesome experience with nostalgic reflections.
","Watched Disney's Aladdin and I must say it was an awesome experience. According to some, the Live-Action remake was not as good as the animated version but we should realise that a lot of things that can be animated cant be done in the same way in CGI. The animals were great though, Abu, being the mischievous one, tends to get Aladdin in trouble s couple of times; and Iago wasn't very talkative as the animated one but spoke well when it did.
Although I was impressed by Mena Massoud as Aladdin, in the first scene; I did not expect that Naomi Scott as Jasmine would be able to justify her role, but she was awesome! The director took time to build the story and the plot was the same as the earlier version except for a twist in the end...no spoilers... watch it yourself ; ) The best thing was Will Smith as Genie, his performance swept me off my feet and although some might disagree but I feel that he was better than Robin Williams. The only glitch was casting Marwan Kenzari as Jaffar, he did not deliver well, his dialogue delivery was pretty weak and even with all the might and power he could not portray the evil that made me hate him when I was young, I could only pity him. :/
Overall it was an amazing experience and pretty nostalgic. For those who don't, know it's a musical...and I love the way they've done "" A whole New World"". A great effort by Disney and Guy Ritchie... you must go and watch it if you are a Disney fan in mood of a magical adventure."

","I was so amazed when I came out of the cinema... I was just speechless. The quality of CGI, acting and many more was just absurd. EVERY detail the cartoon had was in this and MUCH better. Like for example the Prince Ali song... in the cartoon the song sounds... empty. We only hear genie's voice and there's not much going on either... but in the movie it's seriously MIND BLOWING! Background sounds, every sound effect for every thing that shows up and it feels so much more alive... and I have NO IDEA why so much people give it bad reviews... most of them are probably judging it from the damn trailer...

","Is a very entertaining movie. It does not stop, and when the typical songs from Disney movies come, they are small capsules and nothing freaky and boring.
The costumes and the art direction are spectacular, lots of color and fashion.
There are two characters that steal the movie: Will Smith and his characterization of Genius, is fantastic. Too funny and with a superlative sense of humor. The other one is the monkey, great. Too nice.
If you want to spend an afternoon entertaining, with a movie that teaches you something of life, fast, colorful and musical, you can not miss it.
Finally, both Aladdin and Jazmin are very well characterized, the casting was perfect.
Mention to part is the final song of Jazmin, Speechless. Candidate for the Oscar."

"Special-K88","Null","1","2","9 June 2019"," tries very hard but doesn't really succeed
","A live-action remake--or perhaps its own film altogether--of the 1992 animated feature about a street rat with a heart of gold whose only friend is a mischievous little monkey. Despite his current predicament, he believes he's destined for a greater future and is given the opportunity to obtain it when he releases a magical genie with the power to grant him three wishes. Though watchable, this probably works better for those who haven't actually seen the animated feature; throws out lots of flashy visual effects, a few new songs, and shoehorns in some dance numbers so as not to be an exact replica, but despite all the effort it still lacks the pizazz, sense of joy, and emotional resonance of the original. Smith makes a wise decision to not try and imitate or outdo Robin Williams, instead making the role his own from the get-go, and Scott makes a strong and passionate Jasmine, but the film drastically underserves the characterizations of Jafar and Iago who were so much more distinctive and vile the first time around. It just isn't very memorable despite how glitzy and glamorous it tries to be. **"

","No matter what you do, some people will never be satisfied ! This movie is exactly what you can expect from Disney's Aladdin and it is good at it !
At first, I didn't agree with the idea of a younger Jafar, but by the end of the movie, it didn't bother me anymore. Plus, I enjoyed the fact that they decided to limit Iago's capacity to speak.
I also enjoyed the choice to place the city's culture at the crossroads of many others (the Slavic prince, the Indian dancing style, the Ottoman setting)... It was very interesting to watch and Will Smith did a great job as the Genie !"

"donteventhink","9","1","2","9 June 2019"," Shining, Shimmering, Splendid!
","A movie for everyone. This film has had quite a reputation in the media and almost every social media platform before it's release. Coming out of the theatre I realised how one can misinterpret the film and judge it based off it's trailers and marketing as being horrible. As someone who felt that way, I can assure Aladdin is an experience where the audience will cherish if you loved the animated-classic - The nostalgia kicks in from the very start.<br/><br/>Everything about this film pays homage to the animated classic yet still manages to surprise and gift the audience with a few new changes to the plotline. Among all aspects of this theatrical release, it is the cast who mainly stand out and carry the film. Mainly seen in the leads Mena Massoud (Aladdin), Naomi Scott (Princess Jasmine) and Will Smith as the iconic 'Aladdin' character, Genie, the actors elevate the film to another level of entertainment and bring more depth to the characters.<br/><br/>Mena as Aladdin is a delight to watch. His looks and singing truly revealed to the audience of what capability he has in the future of acting. Naomi Scott's performance is one of the most memorable a watcher will ever come across in Disney's live-action remakes and quite possibly the year. With the help of re-writing the character, Princess Jasmine becomes a character we wish to continuously see on the big screen through Naomi's onscreen presence.
As many had speculated to be the massive let-down of the film, Will Smith's Genie changes the character to his own style while paying homage to the late Robin Williams' take. Smith brings a slight hip like feel in his comedic timings and to the character while maintaining the close friendship with Aladdin. The one letdown in casting admittedly is Jafar (Marwan Kenzari). Kenzari proves he is capable of acting and the character has been written with a few delightful details, the only problem is Jafar is not well represented visually. The new addition of Dalia, Jasmine's maiden and friend played by Nasim Pedrad is always a treat to watch. Her awkwardness when interacting makes the character extremely likeable and enjoyable to watch. Once again the visual effects team have outdone themselves in Disney's live-action trend when it came to representing Rajah, Abu, Iago and Carpet.<br/><br/>Once again Alan Menken has returned to remaster his famous soundtrack with the addition of a new song, 'Speechless' for Princess Jasmine, and it truly is one of the memorable moments throughout the film. The background score is one reason to watch this movie on the big screen. Menken's renditions of our favourite tunes with the slight Arabian feels makes you want to listen to it forever and ever.<br/><br/>The action sequences found this film are some of the many unique and eye-catching sequences one could possibly witness. Director, Guy Ritchie really shows his passion during these momments.<br/><br/>The only issues found in this film were in the editing, CGI of the background landscapes in some scenes and screenplay, especially in a few numbers. These are extremely minor details when focused on the film's storyline.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this film a 4/5 and highly recommend seeing this film at the theatre. Give yourself an open mind if you truly want to witness the magic. It's an experience that one could only witness on the big screen."
"denisse_zaragoza","9","1","2","9 June 2019"," AMAZING MOVIE
","I went to see this movie with zero expectations and OMG is Amazing!!! Will Smith is the best of the movie, it's just perfect for the role.
Jafar by the other hand didn't fill the character, very young actor and doesn't look like a villain at all, except for this the movie is very incredible"
"gapasine","9","1","2","8 June 2019"," LOVE the Live-Action more than the animated movie!
","First off, I love the fact that Guy Ritchie decided not to copy ALL of the scenes in the animated version at whole. Especially because it IS hard to personify actual animated actions. But the VFX designers has made it possible and realistic. To the point, I myself an adult, has believed the facade of the setting. I almost believed they didn't CGI everything. And I am a video editor and VFX freelancer myself.
I remember back when Aladdin has been announced to have a Live-action movie and casted Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine. I remember twitter threads flaming Naomi Scott for having the role because her ethnicity did not fit well with the original Princess Jasmine. Let me tell you, Naomi Scott (aka Princess Jasmine) has made it possible. She played the role perfectly in my honest opinion and I can't imagine anyone else playing that role.<br/><br/>Let's not forget her most ICONIC movie scene singing ""Speechless"". She sung that song with EMOTIONS and the song itself was the most powerful. NOT TO MENTION the Thanos-like-snap when she turned around and made the soldiers disappear. THAT was ICONIC. That effect itself fits so well with the song building up. You'll be able to link the connection between the disappearance and the song when you watch the movie.<br/><br/>The Genie effect in this movie is by far the best effects I have ever seen. It captures the animated genie introduction effect from the original movie so perfectly. Critics seem to want to compare the original animated film with this live action. I wouldn't compare them if I were you. At first, I compared them myself. Until I realize that the live action has MORE emotions shown than the animated version. That's the best thing about ANY live action movie. This live action actually captures the audience's emotions to each character than the original film itself.<br/><br/>The casting seems almost perfect. I honestly did not like the character of Jafar in this movie. However, I respect the casting of Marwan Kenzari (Jafar) because they did not cast an older man for Princess Jasmine. Marwan portrayed Jafar well, but I did not like how they made Jafar more monotoned and PREDICTABLE. Like in my opinion, they should've given Jafar more emotions. Like bro if someone wants to rule the kingdom why do you have to do it without emotions man.<br/><br/>The animals. Wow. Abu actually seemed like a trained monkey. Raja doesn't look anything like a CGI either. The parrot well a good parrot.<br/><br/>Final thoughts:
Look out Frozen. I think someone has beaten your song. This is by far my number 1 most favorite movie. Especially because lots of people cringe at every live action made, hinting at Japanese animes turning into live actions. If you really want to watch this movie, I guarantee you will not be wasting your money. For those who watched the Aladdin movie right when it came out on 1992 watching this 2019 live action (I am talking about those people in their 30s), I will assure you that your childhood imagination of bringing the animation to life will come true. This has got to be the BEST Disney Live action made so far. More better than Beauty and the Beast and Dumbo.<br/><br/>Overall:
9.5/10"
"piggiessayoink","9","1","2","8 June 2019"," Made My Child Heart AND My Filmmaker Mind Happy
","This movie was an absolute dream. They changed around a few things-filled in the gaps of the original story so the progression made sense, gave a modern and fun twist to the songs, and gave Princess Jasmine the agency she DESERVES-and I only came out with a single complaint about a single point in the plot. Everything else gave me chills and made for an amazing experience. Will definitely be seeing this again before it leaves the theaters and will definitely be buying it once it's released.<br/><br/>Anyone who is saying that this movie sucks has no joy in their lives, and I wish them the best 😘"
"nancyldraper","8","1","2","8 June 2019"," A Guest Review
","Today, I have a guest opinion for my review, my companion for this movie, 9 year old, Sophie. Her favourite part was that everything turned out all right in the end and everyone was happy. She felt it was a little scary but not too scary for her, although she felt someone littler might have been really scared. She really liked the Princess Jasmine, liked Aladdin and thought the genie was funny. She thought the music was good and thought people might like to hear it over and over. She gave this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Adventure Musical}"

","I went into this movie not expecting a lot, but I left a huge fan! I like it better than the original animated version! When I leave a movie and say to myself "" I want to buy this when it comes out on DVD,"" it's a good movie IMO! I loved the female lead, she has a beautiful voice. And Will Smith did great as the genie! I really really enjoyed him and I am not a huge Will Smith fan."

Everything I read made me uninterested in his version. But I will say he did a phenomenal job as the genie.<br/><br/>This movie is stunning. Breathtakingly beautiful. The dancing, the sets, so Bollywood. Guy Ritchie really surprised me with this his shift into a Disney musical. You try not singing along to every song.

"moritzmaibaum","9","1","2","8 June 2019"," Finally a neutral review (not comparing to old movie! 1!1)
","(Skip to second paragraph for rating)
Yeah... I didn't intend to write a full review, but the comments right here are just embarrassing. I personally never watched the Aladdin cartoon version (I guess it's not thaaat big of a thing where I live, compared to other Disney classics like snow white?).<br/><br/>So I just went to the cinema without real expectations, but I must admit: it was totally worth it. And here's why:<br/><br/><ul><li>The scenery. Just wow, mind blowing. So much detail, color and creativity, that it's almost overwhelming. Disney really hit the right spot between 'not so great looking' and 'completely drives your focus away from the actors'.</li></ul>-The CG work. I just have to throw it in here. I have some solid knowledge of 3d art and this just brings it to a totally new level. No spoilers, but some of the characters are super well done, especially fur and animation are insane. I don't know on which basis people are writing their reviews, but this can easily compete with Endgame, in terms of CG (not VFX!! at some points the green screen keying is a let down, but the shots are super short and don't mess up the rest of the movie!)
Also particle animation is good, since for whatever reason it makes up a good margin of the CG, maybe because people expect some sort of 'fairy tale magic' when they hear the name Disney.
<ul><li>Music is fantastic as well. I watched the synchronised German version, but the melodies and the way in which it is integrated into the story work out pretty well, in my opinion.</li><li>Acting is good. The main actors do their job, and even though Will Smith obviously outshines them in his 'blue, flying' version at some points, Aladdin and the Princess show both character and expression more than well.</li></ul><br/><br/>There's obviously way more to review but I think I underlined why the movie definetly isn't just ""bAD cgI AnD caRtOon iS BetTEr""."

","Well for one thing; I want to put some people's fears to rest, Will Smith is a great genie, he's the glue that held this together, along with many great performances from the rest of the cast. But Smith really made it, you can't compare him and Robin Williams but I can't say he was much of a downgrade or anything, they brought some different things to the role but they both worked the role just as good.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it was good but it was a little bit hard to compare it to the original. I definitely love what they did with Jafar, he's a lot more threatening when he's got a similar origin to Aladdin (surviving as a thief and gradually working his way to the top) and it makes him craftier and more unpredictable, he's a better thief than Aladdin, he still comes off as a very sinister, not exactly as he was in the original but close, it's not like they totally tried to humanize him, but I do miss how they took away his little song number from the original.<br/><br/>I also like how he sort of has a reason for his desire to become Sultan that extends beyond 'I want to be powerful'; he sees Agrabah as wasted potential and wants to build it into an empire, take hold of the armies and invade the lands around them, he also isn't necessarily married to the idea of making Agrabah the hub of his empire; when Aladdin (in the guise of Prince Ali) and him meet for a second time; he actually offers him his assistance so he could become his vizier, presumably to expose weaknesses in Agrabah to him for exploitation, and to take over Ababwa, which doesn't really exist.<br/><br/>I also liked how they treated The Sultan, very different from the original Aladdin, he went from being the jolly, portly, oblivious, oafish ruler of Agrabah to a more stoic and tougher character who seems more like a proper leader who's had to make harder decisions, although I like how it worked out, even if it did feel awkward when put in contrast with the original. I kinda missed how Iago was in the original, he's not as chatty this time around, talks more like a real-life parrot, still he provides some good comic relief to break up some moments of Jafar's tension.<br/><br/>I think this is the best live-action Disney remake without question, the others like Maleficent and Beauty & The Beast were bogged down with extra characters, plots and last minute additions and revisions and while there are some additional characters here; they fit the story here very well, there's a good reason for them to be there and they don't feel forced or like they've overstayed their welcome; as a matter of fact, two new characters in particular: Dahlia and Prince Anders provide some great comic relief moments in the film, but Dahlia is also pretty integral to the story. I also like the new intro to the film, think it ties nicely together with Genie's story. Hakim is another new character, not focused on as much until Jafar's betrayal since he's the most senior of the Sultan's guards<br/><br/>I was slightly confused with how the start of the film was a blend of both Aladdin's ""One jump ahead"" song/intro and Jasmine's first foray into the streets of Agrabah, felt kind of rushed but the story evened out from there and it eventually worked.<br/><br/>I also felt like the relationship between Jasmine and Jafar was an improvement from the first, instead of lusting over her; he generally just wanted her out of the picture, wanted her silent because the Sultan listened to her, but on the other side of that coin; Jafar still flips around at the end and demands Jasmine marry him shortly after he becomes a sorcerer, and that felt like it just came out of nowhere, his reason not because he wanted to secure power or because he found Jasmine attractive but because he wanted to torture the Sultan, make him watch as he took away what was important to him.<br/><br/>Kinda sucked though how Jafar didn't turn into a giant snake thing, just as disappointing as he didn't get his Prince Ali Reprise, still does that same reveal of Aladdin but in a more dramatic and dialogue-driven scene.<br/><br/>That being said though, might be a good thing because some of the younger kids in my cinema were a little bit scared by the special effects in some scenes, they do look particularly dark and grim as far as Jafar is concerned, scariest things I'd list are the scene where Jafar pushes Aladdin off a ledge into the ocean and tries to drown him, the scene where Jafar chokes people with his magic, or at least I think that's what he was doing and the scene where there's sort of a carpet chase around Agrabah and Jafar transforms Iago into a sort of giant mangy-looking parrot.<br/><br/>Genie's FX aren't as bad, maybe a little bit uncanny in his introduction but they looked better as he went along, also kind of convenient they switch to his human disguise so he's not blue and huge throughout the film.<br/><br/>I'm guessing if you have younger kids it's probably more appropriate to show them the original, some scary stuff in that too but a lot easier to follow too.<br/><br/>The two new song numbers are pretty good too, just now I've forgotten the details of the first one but Jasmine's second new song is pretty great, Naomi Scott has a really powerful voice, and a really nice message behind it too.<br/><br/>Ending was nice too, Jasmine becoming Sultan, Aladdin and her still together and Genie's freedom sort of implies that he becomes human, he gets together with Dahlia and it nicely segways back to the start of the movie.<br/><br/>Some great choreography and costumes in this as well, one thing I'm really enjoying about these live-action remakes of Disney films is how well they've done costumes and choreography and still kept a really rich palette of colours in each scene.<br/><br/>I can't say it was necessarily better than the original but I think it's a pretty good film nonetheless and nowhere near as bad as people were concerned it would be."
"clairemitchell11","9","1","2","8 June 2019"," Not enough credit given...
","Saw the movie yesterday after having a rave review from my cousin. I wasn't expecting too much, as it only rated average on IMDb so assumed it would just be a watered down version of the animated version...I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>The film stays lovingly true to the original film for all those adult Disney fans who want the nostalgia of their own childhoods, but with a modern twist making it relatable and current for the younger generations. It's always a risk to put a modern twist on any classic, but it really does work perfectly in this film. They use modern choreography to spice up the dance routines, which livened up an already lively performance. The costumes gave a nod to the original film, but with added style and flare that you'd expect from a modern day performance. The character of Aladdin was kept lovingly close to the original, however Jasmine was tweaked slightly so that there was a feminist element to her. She seeks to rule herself, rather than to marry a worthy future sultan, sending a message of power and strength for any girls who are told that they can't do something. It's a refreshing and necessary twist on the original story for the old and new generations.<br/><br/>I think everyone fell in love with Robin Williams's genie, and his memory lives on in the original film. And prior to seeing the film, I was convinced that he would be a missing element in this new film. However Will Smith didn't try to imitate Williams, he brought a fresh interpretation to the character which was refreshing and actually perfectly fitting for this adaptation. Robin Williams's genie, as genius as it was, would actually be out of place in this more modern production. Will Smith is the perfect candidate and now I can't imagine this genie being played by anyone else.<br/><br/>Aladdin and Jasmine were for me, perfectly cast. Aladdin was portrayed as the loveable rogue and I actually preferred the interpretation of Princess Jasmine in this film than the original. The role of Jafar was played well, however there was a creepiness to Jafar in the original that was very much missing in this film. Jafar was a sneak and a bit of a creep, whereas this Jafar was much more aggressive and assertive. I think by strengthening the character, they actually weakened him, as the creepiness, slyness and weakness was what repulsed the audience against the character in the original, and I feel that this would have been a much better villain than the one they created.<br/><br/>Overall, I came away feeling so happy, nostalgic and fulfilled. A rare feat for any film, and should be the aim of any Disney film worth it's metal. I would actually go so far as to say that I enjoyed this film more than the original! And I don't say that lightly. I am just a little lost as to the average reviews that this film has received considering the end product. Don't let these reviews stop you from seeing this film, it's a triumph in my opinion and I can't wait to see it again."

"jackson_ro","7","1","2","7 June 2019"," Aladdin
","A faithful remake of a childhood classic that could easily be seen as cannon just like all the other remakes they have made so far. Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud's performance does the characters justice and sang their hearts out with conviction. Will Smith's inclusion, however questionable, it is also hard to come up with anyone more suitable for the role. The costumes and exotic settings makes the film more authentic and awe-inspiring than ever before. The film doesn't really do anything new, so perhaps the film is more suitable for the younger generation who is approaching these stories for the first time. But we can rest easy know that the kids of our next generation is still absorbing these wondrous stories, just through different mediums."

Honestly, just based on the previews I was like hmm that could be dope I guess but it was way better than I anticipated. I thought the roles were perfectly cast and well played (Jasmine was my favorite and the retelling of her character in this made me love her even more than the animated version!), I've already listened to the soundtrack twice today lol it's great and the new addition made me cry but i also had a little to drink and most thinks make me cry regardless so, costumes on point, cinematography gorg, and the cgi characters were done hella well like I want to hug carpet. It differs from the original a bit which will probably piss some people off but I thought it had a great mix of familiarity and bringing new elements to the table that actually made the characters and story make more sense. So yeah all in all I thought it was awesome and cute n fun and fresh and one of my favorite live actions so far. Wait idk I honestly really liked detective Pikachu so maybe my favorite Disney live action but yeah GO SEE IT! Can't beat 5 dollar tuesdays at amc theatres right now!"
"jossviolet33","9","1","2","5 June 2019"," Magical & Nostalgic
","Personally, I really loved this live-action version of the much-loved classic animation. I can't seem to understand people who criticise Will Smith's portrayal of the Genie - I mean, he may not be Robin Williams (but no one can replace him anyway?!) Williams and Smith were/are adored for their quirky, fun, vivacious personas and both of them added their own individual spin on the character which I think is perfect, because I strongly believe these live-action reboots of our favourite Disney films need to have slightly different qualities (but also need to be similar in other ways). As for the casting of Aladdin and Jasmine, I think it was perfection! So much chemistry between Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott - very impressed. I thought their singing abilities were absolutely breath-taking, (and I think a lot of people can agree with me) that Massoud's singing sounds so similar to the 1992 Aladdin; it actually brought tears to my eyes from the overwhelming nostalgia.<br/><br/>The costumes, production design, characters were all visually spectacular and beautiful. Again, I can't see why people are being so harsh about these aspects of the film (maybe because in the past high budgets seem to make things appear a bit over-the-top) but hey! It's a Disney film! Things need to be colourful and magical and flamboyant!<br/><br/>The tiniest fault I find with the film - and I am trying to not let this cloud my overall view of this beautifully uplifting movie but this is why I can only give the film 9 stars - but in my opinion, I feel that the casting of Jafar just wasn't right. Nothing against the actor as I think he has great acting skills and a lot of potential, but I just think the overall physical appearance of him wasn't intimidating enough and Jafar is possibly one of the best/scariest Disney villains in history - so menacing and brooding with his curly beard and long nose and grotesque eyebrows (need I say more?) This is either aimed at the casting directors or the hair/makeup artists, but whatever it is, I think it could have been better.<br/><br/>But all in all, I definitely recommend this film if you adore the animated classic and you want to be dazzled by a modern, magical masterpiece."
"yeehung5","9","1","2","5 June 2019"," NEVER JUDGE A GENIE BY IT'S TRAILER
","The music, CGI and almost everything is so magical. The soundtrack is great. The casting and the way they talk also suits Arabian culture. Even the genie which people used to criticize how bad it was during the trailer release is great and fun to watch. The dance was awesome but it looks like it was fast forwarded but still awesome. The only reason I'm not giving 10/10 is because of Aladdin sudden changed of character for no reason. It feels kinda rush on that part. Oh, and Naomi Scott is just gorgeous. Only one word to describe this film after watching in cinema, ""Magical""."

The music was great as well, I believe a series of awards for the soundtrack will soon appear.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed the most the story - besides bringing more modern concepts in mentality and politics, it was great that they filled the empty spots and made the story a bit more convincing and appealing to all kinds of fans and audience. The mix between tradition and progress and first version and the 2019 times only concerning the soundtrack and the ending were very well handled<br/><br/>Although I liked how Jafar was interpreted, they could have made him a tiny bit older.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film and I really am looking forward to watching it again."

The animated adventures and their accompanying soundtracks were able to permanently embed themselves in my mind, heart and soul defining what Walt's imagination established years ago.

SUMMARY:
Let's put it out there, Aladdin cartoons have set much up for quality in many ways, and yours truly is a big fan of it. Yet this spin on it managed in a way to accomplish the goal of appeasing many audience members. Guy Ritchie's take on it holds the core story with the nostalgia nicely baked in making sure to hit the highlights of each moment with a new visual style. The reimagined world holds nice visual effects and some beautiful attention to detail in the infusion of cultures bringing the beloved cartoon to life and making it semi realistic. Yet, when some people recreated these wonders, the magic of the film is lost to the darker tale and grittier atmosphere, sort of draining the enchantments the cartoon films held. Fortunately, Ritchie and his crew succeeded in keeping the funny and cute moments in tact primarily in the form of clever one liners, Will Smith's take on the genie, and relationship of Abu and Carpet, the former of which you want to adopt. Yet the film also succeeds in bringing those relationships we love to life and somehow putting some new charms to it, to help them stand out. Mena Massoud has the charm, naivety and wonder that Aladdin held to be the adventurous lad. Naomi Scott's voice and strong attitude pave a new Jasmine that will speak to the modern female audience, yet also enchant others. As for Will Smith, he makes the Genie his own character familiar yet also different to not attempt to copy the late William's work. His take was fun, almost like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air meeting Disney and it worked beautifully for me, primarily in the chemistry between him and Massoud (very touching at times). And as for the music, while not quite the same as the 90's songs in terms of energy, some of the tracks have their new spin work out well that is a blend of old and new and having charisma, my favorite being a Whole New World and Friend Like Me. New Songs by Jasmine though might be my favorite though, a new addition that fits well, delivers the messages, and showcases the Scott's wonderful voice.
Yet for all the good there are some things still lacking for me. First the world that they made was not explored enough like the original version, reduced to feeling like a close set instead of the epic kingdom of Agrabah and the Arabian desert. In fact, the movie feels very rushed at times, with the opening ran very quickly, that in no time we are at the cave of wonders instead of the buildup I was expecting. This pace sort of robs the charm of the world and characters, sometimes getting lost in the all the new political moves and new gimmicks in place of the story telling. For me this was especially true for the take on Jafar. In terms of looks, it get realism, and ambitions it is there, but this Jafar did not quite have the devious nature of the traditional villain. That suave, sophisticated and cunning air, was lost to grandiosity and whining rather than that meticulous planning of the wise wizard. And when it came time to fight him, well the anticlimactic moments were lost again to new themes and takes, including the design of his genie form. Much of these limitations came from shoving the political components into the mix that were both endearing and then forced/beaten over the head. The Dream Big Princess movement is alive and while respectable did not feel like it should have been as large a focus. As for the other songs, many of the tracks did not have the same flow, energy, and agreement with the scene like the movie, the new take changing the pace and energy of the scene that did not fit as well with the scene.
Overall, Aladdin's live remake is one of the better ones for me because it tried to accomplish blending nostalgia and yet being different to not compete with the classics. I had fun with this film, loved the relationships and acting between groups, the dynamics with CGI and some of those songs that took me to a whole new world. Yet, the movie just did not explore the Agrabah as much as I wanted, rushing through various moments to not be quite as complete or suspenseful of an adventures that the 90s version held. It's that lack of scenes, songs, and acting all working together that is probably the biggest miss for me, and while not awful, was not to the full extent it could have been. Still, the film is worth a visit and appropriate for most little ones given much of the fear inducing scenes have been removed. Overall my scores are:<br/><br/>Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7
Movie Overall 7.0"

"leoocampo","3","2","7","6 October 2019"," Embarrassing.
","This was a shell of a film. Lacking both soul and substance. The entire thing feels cheap, plastic, and shallow. The performances were universally poor, to the point where I feel embarrassed for them. Especially the sad, hallow version of Jafar, but the title character himself is truly flat and bland. The only performances that aren't complete failures would be Will Smith's Genie, which still feels like it lacks any of the life and whimsy that Robin Williams brought to the role, but to be fair to him that is a hard act to follow. Jasmine on the other hand, had a little more depth and personality to the role, but perhaps only in comparison to how robotic the rest of the cast comes across. Honestly, the acting feels like I was watching a bad Bollywood or direct to retail film from the $5 bin at Wal-Mart. Even the costumes and sets look cheap... they shouldn't considering the huge amount of energy and resources so obviously put into them, but some how they do... perhaps due to a lack of restraint... too much CGI (so much this is practically as much an animated film as it is live action) and too much fantastical embellishment in the wardrobe and set designs. So it feels like a play at Disney World, not a feature film attempting to truly remake a classic.<br/><br/>The rest of the film elements are a near perfect example of the dangers of this kind of remake. As a 1:1 redo in live action, the film fails to stand up to even a very forgiving comparison to original animated voice performances and even fails when comparing things like scene editing and pacing of the plot points. As a re-imagination, it fails to bring any imagination-nothing new or interesting. This is unlike, for example, the live action Jungle Book remake, which I was pleasantly surprised with, as it brought both a new feel and some new ideas to go along with a great cast and some great performances."

"myignisrules","6","2","7","27 May 2019"," Well it's better than Beauty and The Beast
","So, I did something I try not to do. I went into this movie with a negative mindset.<br/><br/>Beauty and The Beast was such a disappointment, I figured this would be as well. Colour me surprised, ALADDIN 2019, actually has some heart to it.<br/><br/>Up front, the strength of this film falls squarely on the shoulders of our two leads, Aladdin (Mena Massoud) and Jasmine (Naomi Scott). The former feels like the animation come to life (it's a bit scary how good he is) and the latter adds depth, development and character to Jasmine, that makes her feel like a woman of the 21st Century. It doesn't hurt that the chemistry between them is off the charts.<br/><br/>The songs are mostly, very well done, and you'll be singing along in no time and the little changes here and there to the original story, actually help close up some plot holes, we only noticed as adults.<br/><br/>It's far from perfection though. Will Smith is a charismatic guy, and he does his best to live up to Robin William's legacy, while making the Genie his own. But, there's cheese to be found on this sandwich, and some of his moments fall really flat.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the CG isn't that great, and the location does look very much like a set and not a real place.<br/><br/>Jafar was also a huge let down. He's just a villain and doesn't have any of that sly, seductive, sleazy fun stuff, that his animated predecessor did. Also, don't get me started on the giant parrot. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>I honestly don't think, any of these 'adaptations' will live up to the animated magic that Disney once bestowed on us. I'm really torn about putting my money behind, what feels like a cash grab scheme. But, I would be lying if I said, there wasn't something good to be found in this movie and if who knows, this generation may end up loving these as much as we love the originals."

Other than that I am still smiling and humming the songs two days later just like I did with the animated one."
"Anurag-Shetty","9","3","13","27 May 2019"," Almost matches up to the animated classic.
","Aladdin is a live-action adaptation of the 1992 animated movie of the same name. A young man named Aladdin(Mena Massoud), fending for himself on the street & an opportunistic Grand Vizier named Jafar(Marwan Kenzari), compete for a magic lamp that makes your deepest most desperate wishes a reality.<br/><br/>Aladdin is an awe-inspiring film. Director Guy Ritchie has stayed true to the spirit of the animated original but, he has also put his own signature spin on it. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking. Kudos to production designer Gemma Jackson, for seamlessly creating the world of Agrabah. The visual effects are fantastic. Will Smith is the star of the show, as the Genie. Smith does not imitate Robin Williams' legendary performance but instead, makes it his own while still paying homage to Williams' portrayal. Mena Massoud is outstanding as Aladdin. Naomi Scott is spectacular as Jasmine. Massoud & Scott are just starting out in Hollywood but, they will go places. Mena Massoud & Naomi Scott share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Marwan Kenzari is the weak link of the movie, because of his laughably bad performance as Jafar. Navid Nagahban is great as the Sultan. Nasim Pedrad is hilarious as Dalia. Numan Acar is impressive as Hakim. Billy Magnussen is hysterical in his cameo as Prince Anders. The songs have been recreated wonderfully. My favorites are 'A Whole New World' sung by Massoud & Scott & 'Speechless' sung by Scott. Aladdin is a must watch. If you stop constantly comparing it to Aladdin(1992) you'll definitely enjoy yourself more. Go & experience a whole new world!"

The culture of hating movies is too strong at the moment and I don't understand why, probably social media? Could just be arrogance. I mean... look at the way people have voted game Of thrones and captain marvel just of recent. However, as someone that loved the original and loves movies and tries to go into every film positive... I can tell you now that this film is absolutely brilliant. There isn't much to differentiate from the original, but what was different was brilliant and timely. It's not a deep film, but it's happy, emotional and hilarious. All of the actors are brilliant. Jafar impressed more than I thought he would... but I can say now, it's very simple. WILL SMITH IS A GENIUS. The man took an iconic role that involved so much character, and put a twist on Robin Williams version, without also killing the character he created. It was just brilliant. Very very pleased with it. Definitely watch and judge for yourself."

","Let me just first say this. NOT THE CARTOON AT ALL STORY WISE.<br/><br/>PROS - Will Smith was this movie and he did a great job! Disney needs him for roles like these. The film had its dark scenes and its light ones as well. They had really funny moments in the film that helped a lot!<br/><br/>CONS - More action on the end scene. I get where the director wanted to go, but I believe the ending scene could have more action... hint (Jasmine just froze) Thats how much danger she was in.....I like really! come on. It kinda felt more a Jasmine film in the end instead of an Aladdin film. (When you see it you know what I mean). I will say thought there could have been more passionate kisses in the movie lol.<br/><br/>OVERALL - Aladdin and the music team did great! Overall a great hard earn movie ------ the ending could have been a lot better !!!!!<br/><br/>WHEN YOU GO SEE IT - Funny - Check. Good Story - Check. Romance - Could have been better. More action at the end with more Aladdin rescue. Music - CHECK !!! MUSIC WAS GREAT!!!"

"Lost_In_Translation_","5","2","9","15 June 2019"," Pale Imitation of the Original
","Aladdin was one of the VHS' that I watched almost daily. Like it and the other late 80's/early 90's Disney masterpieces, it was a big part of my childhood. It's still an enjoyable watch as an adult, but it was it's most magical when you're a kid. Robin Williams is still the best part hands down.<br/><br/>Similar to the original, Genie is the best part....but not so much a diamond in the rough, maybe more like cubic zirconia. Will Smith does his best without aping on the late Williams, but even as entertaining as he is it's the rest of the cast that brings him down.<br/><br/>The cast of this, besides Smith, are essentially human sandpaper. Aladdin is the worst offender. He reads lines so dryly, you'd think his lungs were full of sand. Sure, he cant match up to an animated character who is extremely expressive, but he barely even tries. Lines you'd think would have character and nuance, sound like he is reading the script for the first time at the table read.<br/><br/>Jasmine is passable, though her handmaiden is beyond annoying and for some reason is one of the main characters who gets an arc? I'm fine with them adding their own touch to the original, but her addition is no more than a romantic interest for the genie at the end.<br/><br/>It picks up a little towards the middle, but holy hell is the first hour of this beyond boring. It takes forever for them to even get to Genie.<br/><br/>The sets too feel way too fake and 100% feel like a stage play with a green screen behind it. None of it feels lived in or dirty or real. Even the characters who roam the streets and deserts have THE cleanest clothes. Agribah must have stellar launders or something.<br/><br/>So just add this to the pile of pointless live-action remakes of Disney classics. They all suffer from not straying too much from the originals to be their own thing and just pale in comparison. They're all just trying too hard to cater to the people who love the originals. They're literally just watching the same movie copy and past with real people. No originality or anything that make them special. Adding new songs doesn't effect them at all, as the new songs usually are bad and don't fit with the style of the originals.<br/><br/>Disney doesn't have too many more classics to re-make, so our suffering will soon be over unless they tackle some of the early 2000's trash that the studio released..."

"jboothmillard","5","2","9","27 May 2019"," Aladdin
","Disney have been through their animation back catalogue for the last few years, with successes like Alice in Wonderland, The Jungle Book, and Beauty and the Beast, and so-so or disappointing results like Cinderella, Maleficent, and Dumbo, and the 1992 favourite, originally featuring the voice of Robin Williams, gets the same treatment. I saw the trailer, and I had mixed feelings about seeing the film at all, because director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Swept Away, Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur) hasn't made a good film in years, the new Jafar looked too young and good looking, and the lead star as the Genie looked slightly creepy being blue, but I gave it a chance. Basically Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is a kind-hearted street urchin living in the desert kingdom of Agrabah who steals to get by with his pet monkey Abu. One day, he rescues and befriends Princess Jasmine of Agrabah (Naomi Scott), who has grown tired of her sheltered life, and has snuck out of the palace dressed as a civilian. She hides her true identity and tells Aladdin she is the princess's handmaiden. Meanwhile, Jafar (Marwan Kenzari), the Royal Vizier, is tired of being ""second best"", with his pet parrot Iago (voiced by Alan Tudyk), he is seeking a magic lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders in order to become Sultan. The only person worthy of entering the cave is a ""diamond in the rough"", whom Jafar later identifies is Aladdin. During their time together, Abu stole a bracelet from Jasmine that belonged to her mother, Aladdin sneaks into the palace to return it to her and makes a promise to meet her again. Aladdin is captured by the palace guards on Jafar's orders, he is taken to the desert where Jafar offers to make him rich enough to impress Jasmine, revealing her true identity. Aladdin enters the Cave of Wonders to retrieve the lamp, inside he finds a magic carpet, and he does indeed find the lamp. But Abu defies the instructions not to touch any of the treasure, the cave starts to collapse, with the carpet rushing to escape to help them escape. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, but Jafar throws them back into the cave, but not before Abu steals the lamp back. Trapped, Aladdin gives the lamp a rub and meets the Genie (Will Smith) who lives inside. The Genie explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes, with the exceptions of wishing for more wishes, making people fall in love, and bringing people back from the dead. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the cave without rubbing the lamp and therefore using a using a wish. Aladdin is curious of what the Genie would wish for, the Genie says he would wish to be free of servitude, to be his own master, so Aladdin makes a promise to use his third wish to wish for his freedom. Aladdin tells the Genie of his interest in Jasmine, but that she can only marry a prince, so he uses his first wish to become a prince himself, hoping to impress Jasmine. Back in Agrabah, Aladdin, as ""Prince Ali of Ababwa"", arrives in a large spectacle, but Jasmine is unimpressed. Aladdin tries to make a good impression with Jasmine a party organised by the Sultan (Homeland's Navid Negahban), Genie subtly helps him with some dance moves, but suggests that he should just be himself. While Genie finds a love interest of his own, with Jasmine's handmaiden Dalia (Nasim Pedrad), Aladdin takes Jasmine on a ride on the magic carpet to see the world. Jasmine deduces Aladdin's true identity but convinces her that he only dresses as a peasant to escape the stresses of royal life. However, Jafar discovers Aladdin's true identity and threatens him to reveal where the lamp is hidden, he refuses and Jafar throws him into the sea. Abu and the carpet arrive with the lamp, Aladdin rubs it before fainting, Genie manages to find a way to save his life, as the cost of his second wish. Aladdin returns to Jasmine, together they expose Jafar's evil plan and the Sultan has Jafar arrested, but Iago steals the dungeon keys and frees him. Aladdin is offered the position as heir to the Sultan, but he fears he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, he reluctantly breaks his promise to the Genie, upsetting him. Jafar, with his own street smarts, steals the lamp from Aladdin, becoming the Genie's new master, and using his first wish to become Sultan. The guards are initially forced to obey Jafar's orders to take Jasmine away, but she finally has her say, convincing Hakim (Numan Acar), head of the palace guards who is loyal to the Sultan of Agrabah, to refuse to follow his commands. Jafar therefore uses his second wish to rule over Agrabah as the most powerful sorcerer in the world, he exiles Aladdin and Abu to a frozen wasteland and threatens to kill Dalia and the Sultan unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. However, the Genie magically sends the carpet go to rescue Aladdin. As the wedding ceremony is commencing, Aladdin returns and Jasmine helps him get the lamp back. Jafar transforms Iago into a roc (gigantic parrot) to chase them and steal back the lamp, destroying the carpet in the process. Jafar threatens Aladdin, who taunts him, saying the Genie is more powerful, and he is ""second best"". Jafar is tricked into using his last wish to become ""the most powerful being in the universe"", but not being specific with his words, the Genie transforms Jafar into a Genie himself, bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him. Agrabah and everything else is returned to normal, the Genie banishes Jafar's lamp to the cave and restores the carpet. He advises Aladdin to use his third and final wish so he can marry Jasmine, but instead, Aladdin decides to keep his promise and frees the Genie, turning him human. The Sultan declares Jasmine will be the next ruler of Agrabah and can change the law in order to marry Aladdin. Genie becomes a mariner to explore the world with Dalia, who becomes his wife, and they have two children, while Aladdin and Jasmine get married and start a new life together. Also starring Game Night's Billy Magnussen as Prince Anders and Robby Haynes as Razoul. Smith is a littlee unsettling when he's blue, but he does bring his own kind of pizzazz to the role of the Genie, Massoud is a little bland as the hero, Scott is impressive as the beautiful and outspoken princess, and Kanzari is a little lacking as the villain. It feels fresh and familiar at the same time, you know what to expect with the story, little tweaks are made here and there, it is cheesy at times, but the ""Friend Like Me"", ""Prince Ali"", and of course ""A Whole New World"" hit the right spot, plus ""Speechless"", the new song Jasmine, the special effects are good, and the family will enjoy it, I was actually pleasantly surprised, I thought I might hate it, a fun fantasy adventure. Worth watching!"

","Honestly, I am not even sure how to explain this. Zombie. The best analogy I can use for this one is that it is a zombie, a resurrected version of what once was that has no life or soul inside.<br/><br/>Aladdin leans almost entirely on nostalgia and, in doing so, gutted this film of its heart. There was no magic, no emotional investment, and no impending sense of dread or threat.<br/><br/>It trusts that you, the viewer, already know the story, love the characters, and are care about them. It makes next to no attempt at character development or getting buy-in from the audience.<br/><br/>The story was bland. The acting and singing were even more bland. Though, in an insane twist of irony, the part of this film I dreaded going in actually became one of It's highlights. Genie. If you spoke with me beforehand, I would have told you Will Smith wasn't a good pick, but he completely surprised me.<br/><br/>He didn't try to recreate Williams' Genie; he made his own thing, which was decent, but they kept putting him back in that awful looking blue CGI. He looked terrible, but when he transformed, he did great.<br/><br/>Also, a nod to Naomi, forget her last name, she was also a higher note. She sang well, and her acting had some impact, though just not enough.<br/><br/>And the monster parrot. Guys, we have to talk about the monster parrot. Haha. I mean, why? Why would you take a tense, and even scary, finale where Jafar becomes a monstrous snake and substitute an overgrown Yago?<br/><br/>Lion King was bad, from what I have watched, and this was bad.

Don't get me wrong, Will Smith was pretty much the only enjoyable thing about this movie. But mixing middle eastern music with hip hop was an odd choice, even though the dancing was fun.

These remade Disney movies should really be critiqued at face value and not compared to the original. Both are simply amazing in their own unique way.

"JKEBY","5","1","3","19 September 2019"," Some fun, but instantly FORGETTABLE
","Disney has done a lot of good when it comes to animated family entertainment. I still pick 1992s Aladdin as the best of the bunch, but I award most of the credit to the late Robin Williams (who brilliantly voiced our favorite cartoon character, the Genie). And because Robin ad-libbed so many of his lines, the script was rejected for a Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award nomination. But it wasn't rejected by the audience or critics and was the first animated film to gross over $500 million at the international box-office.<br/><br/>Sadly, Robin Williams is no longer with us, and after the success of the 'The Jungle Book,' Disney has gone from cartoon to live-action. It's worked pretty well, but without Robin Williams, the new Aladdin falls short. I've always welcomed Will Smith, but compared to Williams, his comedic ability doesn't even come close. Marwan Kenzari as Jafar is an absolute bore, and the remaining cast eventually fizzle out.<br/><br/>One note; If you've never seen the 1992 version, you'll probably enjoy the new one. But considering how many people have seen it, there probably won't be a lot of love for 2019's update on one of the best animated films now and forever.<br/><br/>Rating **1/2 stars out of ****"

","Aladdin was one of my favorite Disney movies as a child. I remember in middle school we got to sing A Whole New World in chorus.
I wasn't sure what to aspect from this movie just like any live action movie. But I must admit it was one of my favorites as a live action.
My favorite character was and still is the Genie. Will Smith was really good. Don't go comparing him to Robin Williams, go into the movie as if it's a new movie. Robin Williams posted the cartoon and Will Smith played the live action. I was very impressed with Will.
I honestly was impressed with all the characters and will make sure this movie is one I own."

","I didn't watch Aladdin in the Theater after reading mixed reviews at the time and wondering, like many, how Will Smith would be able to step into Robin Williams shoes. Thankfully I did finally download and watch it tonight and I thought it was fantastic. I didn't feel the same about The Jungle Book or Lion King, Beaty and the Beast was good and Dumbo had its shining moments though, but I loved the leads and Will Smith brought a different style to Genie. It reminded me of wondering prior to watching The Dark Knight how anyone could play the role of Joker as good as Nicholson but then watching Heath Ledger give a very different but great performance as well (let's not bring up Jared Leto though) and being able to appreciate them both."
"WatchedAllMovies","6","1","3","12 September 2019"," Good actress
","In this movie, Aladdin is actually somewhat stupid and abnoxious.<br/><br/>If I have a magic lamp I would guard it with my life; yet people in this movie just casually put it in their bag along with other trinkets, making it easily stolen or lost.
Aladdin insisted on being a prince and then in the middle of the movie, for no reason suddenly decided it's no use and gave up. I hate sudden movie personality change.
I don't see much in Aladdin that's worth pursuing. They should make Aladdin more likeable or make the princess get rid of him at the end.<br/><br/>Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) is a much better singer and actress than Aladdin (Mena Massoud). Actually he looks more like a slimy character than a hero. They should have picked a better actor to play Aladdin.<br/><br/>The genie is supposed to obey its master but it seems to be biased and prefers to help Aladdin more. Genie tried to be funny. But it only made him look like a Robin Williams wannabe.If you want to be funny, be funny your own way.<br/><br/>Jafar is the bad guy in this movie and is an important role. But he is not scary or mean enough. Something wrong with the casting director maybe?<br/><br/>It's a pity, they could have made this movie better without spending much more. All they need is better casting and better script."

Everything was such a beautiful experience. I expected much more from the critical audience. What do they think Disney is going to do? Take the original and as well gorgeous Aladdin film and reincarnate it to a completely the same film, just with real people? I appreciate Disney for now. It is trying to bring the good into the world. Too bright? Too cliche? Too dark? Too picky is much more of the word for it.

News flash, THEY ARE BOTH FAKE! Yes, I agree that Will Smith is not Robin Williams but then again who is? I once saw Robin and John Ritter (who is a pretty amazing physical comedy actor in his own right) doing improv and John was basically standing there in amazement, could not hold it together.<br/><br/>If you Hollywood to stop cranking out crappy reboots/sequels, stop paying money to see them. Remember, we go to the movies to escape reality for 1Â½-2 hours. If you want an experience that will take you back to a childhood euphoria, save up and go to Disney World and watch one of their fireworks shows set their musical storylines because going to a reboot and expecting to see something different or outdone from the original is insanity. You are setting yourself up for disappointment and empty pockets with their 30$ popcorn combos for 2.<br/><br/>All in all, good movie for being a reboot. Stop being so jaded and critical, really."

The thing with this one was it stayed true to the main parts of the original but had some added flavour in there to reflect the actors and who worked on the film. The contrast of colours were amazing, Will Smith had a lot to stand up to but I believe he did Robin William's role justice and I reckon Robin wouldn't be mad that Will made the role his own.<br/><br/>I was mad watching the trailer that Jafar didn't sound as evil and dark but the actor definitely pulled me in to just how dark he was by the end of the movie.
It was good to have more focus on the main characters and less on Raja, Apu and Carpet, although they had some special moments too.<br/><br/>Overall I was pretty impressed on the movie.

Not nearly as sinister as he should have been, he just doesn't fit the character one bit. This felt like a Bollywood movie. They're supposed to be Arabic with Arabian influences.

"monkeysgalore","5","1","3","6 August 2019"," Set Your Expectations Appropriately
","Keeping in time with their streak of completely unnecessary remakes that offer nothing new other than admittedly spectacular special effects to the legacies of their predecessors, Disney has now set their sites on Aladdin. It is essentially the original, but with Will Smith, and slightly subpar acting. So keep that in mind the whole time.<br/><br/>There was, honestly, no need for this. The film adds nothing new to the Aladdin legacy, and doesn't really bring anything new to the table, which is kind of what I expected. On its own as a film, it works, and it does respect the original and stays true to the source material. But that's the problem. It's almost a shot for shot remake, but in live action. So there's really no point to it, other than the millions of dollars to be made from it.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie is directing here, which is interesting, considering his particular style and what he's known for. Mainly known for his quirky crime/comedy/action gangster movies (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Revolver (2005), RocknRolla (2008)), and his other quirky action movies (Sherlock Holmes films, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015)), this did not really seem like something that could work. Almost like Quentin Tarantino directing a Marvel movie. But I have to say, he in no way let his track record pull strings here, and he went completely against type and tried something different, and it turned out pretty well.<br/><br/>The screenplay was concocted by Ritchie, and John August (Charlie's Angels films, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), and the two really did a nice job. The story is fairly engaging, and they have the advantage of acclaimed material to work with, and when you follow that as closely as they did here, it's hard not to have a good story.<br/><br/>The story moved along pretty well, and there was a surprising amount of character development, though obviously not as much as the original. I didn't feel quite connected with the characters near the end, but I guess I was entertained.<br/><br/>The acting was alright, and for being a family-oriented, over-the-top musical, it's what you'd expect. Ok sometimes, cringeworthy at others, it managed to be mostly consistent. The high point of the film for me, besides the special effects, was without a doubt Will Smith and his performance. He threw himself into his role and made the Genie character his own, and honestly kind of saved the movie for me.<br/><br/>The special effects were awesome, probably even up there with the Marvel movies. The music numbers were ok I guess, but Will Smith's were the best.<br/><br/>All in all, it's exactly what you'd expect; a live action remake of the original Aladdin, without much to set it apart from the original. It's not bad, but it doesn't really do enough to justify its existence. If you want a safe movie for the family, then by all means, watch and enjoy this. Otherwise, just set your expectations appropriately and know what you're getting into."
"junshiwilda","6","1","3","25 July 2019"," 👍 Very close to a total train wreck, but Will Smith saves the day.
","Aladdin 2019 is one of those live action Disney movies punched out every year. This movie was included in Watch Mojo's list of films already hated before release, and I was pretty reluctant to see it. But after seeing this film making lots of money and topping Avengers Endgame in the weekend Box Office I decided to give this one a watch just to see what the fuss was all about. Despite going into the theater with reluctance I did have a generally positive experience with this film.<br/><br/>As many point out Will Smith is fantastic in this movie. He just plays the Geenie perfectly with humor and charisma and I personally prefer him over Robin Williams. Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud did do a good enough job but their performance obviously feels a bit dull in comparison to Will Smith because he is a real scene stealer. The production design was good enough especially the looks of the street though some of the CGI was pretty bad. Most of the songs from the original is back and especially the ones Will Smith sings are really worth watching. Though many had problems with Guy Richie's direction I personally think some of the scenes were very well directed with the Magic carpet ride scene being being the stand out. The ending of Genie's character arc (which I wouldn't spoil) was actually better than the original to me. I do understand this is debatable but I think Geenie's character arc's conclusion was more emotionally touching than the animated one.<br/><br/>As you would expect from the Disney live action remakes movement this movie is a beat to beat remake of the animation. There is nothing really different except for obviously the ending as I mentioned, so this movie may feel dull to some people. But what they do add is some modern day politics. It is very clear that they wanted to turn princess Jasmine into a feminist icon and you can tell that from the new songs they added for Jasmine to sing. I understand many like the new musical numbers but to me they were just # Times Up propaganda music. They also changed the ending in a way that doesn't make sense at all just to cram in SJW politics. I would not spoil it, but you would see it no matter how non political you are. In addition, probably due to the release of Vice by Adam McKay, Disney for some reasons decided to portray the Bush administration and the invasion of Iraq in a PG rated Kid's movie through their main villain Jafar. Jafar's plans to invade some random country sounds perfectly like the invasion of Iraq by the Bush administration. Though it was amusing to see Disney lecturing children on modern day politics through a Family film it was frustrating to see that all the filmmakers were able to do was just add SJW politics and political allegory into the classic animation. As I mentioned before some of the editing was occasionally distracting especially the random slow motions and though the CGI was not as distracting I did not like it at all in the third act when Jafar turned into a hilarious CGI monstrosity. To summarize the negatives this movie suffers from being a beat to beat remake and being extremely predictable and to some very dull. But fortunately to me Will Smith saved this movie from being a dull remake to a enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of those movies that get saved from the performance and charisma of the leading cast. It is like spider man saving a very close train wreck all by himself in Spider Man 2, and Will Smith indeed has saved us from a train wreck. This movie could have been a very dull movie that offers basically the same thing with SJW politics sprinkled at the top. But Will Smith who has a great sense of humor and great chemistry with even the dullest character made this film a very good experience. I rate this a 6/10, and though this isn't a very high score this still is a thumbs up and a positive review."
"rchosen-193-5535","6","1","3","8 July 2019"," Was bad for reasons I wasn't' expecting and good for reasons I also wasn't expecting.
","As with many people the trailer made me feel weird about Will Smith as genie. I thought he would be the worst part of the movie. But I was wrong. He was the best part. He did Robin Williams justice. Obviously the genie had a few tweaks to fit Wills but it worked VERY well. Even the music with its very slight ""modern"" touch was amazing.<br/><br/>So why only a 6?
To start Apu wasn't used much in the movie and wasn't ""humorous"" like in the original with his actions. And Lago flat out was terrible. He just has a basic boring ""Polly wants a cracker!"" voice. No comedy or anything to him. He also was barley in the movie. The magic carpet was also not used alot and had no real character either. Rajah to was bland (the tiger).<br/><br/>Jafar was less scary looking and his voice didn't feel as ""villainous"". The actor who played Aladdin did a pretty good job but something still felt off. That said the actress who played Jasmine was excellent. Though the new song they added about ""women"" kind of was annoying. I get the point of the song but felt thrown in to appease certain groups of people.<br/><br/>Am I saying this movie was horrible? Its not the worst of the remakes by far. It was really good. But I don't see myself watching it again. If I did it would only be because of Will as the Genie. I'd rate it way above Dumbo and above Beauty and the Beast."

He was easily the number one best part of the movie and his musical sequences were actually pretty awesome and catchy! I did not expect his singing to be as good as it was, unless during filming it sucked and the editors are very skilled! His cgi was good, except his face just looked off....but was acceptable. He did great! Naomi Scott....she NAILED IT..... Her performance for this kind of movie was really great and her musical performances were hypnotic.... She is the second best thing! Mena Massoud also did well, but wasn't QUITE a standout.... And his singing wasn't AS GOOD as Will's or Naomi's but it is decent! His performance was pretty decent, him and Naomi did have really good chemistry, and they both played each other off during their musical sequences very well, but Naomi was better than him imo again, he was still decent.<br/><br/>Marwan Kenzari......was not....good at all in this movie.... He was VERY poor casting. I mean, he did.....okay with his performance, but he was not AT ALL intimidating....<br/><br/>The story was pretty intriguing, but nothing groundbreaking.

The lighting, atmosphere, CGI, everything was really impressive!<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10.

","What a movie, what a ride down the memory lane, what a treat, Will Smith simply wow.
Each and every word reminded of the childhood classic, beautiful presented, beautifully played and Will Smith, is simply amazing, he has brought a different flavour to the Genie, without damaging the original. He just paced it up. What a fine actor, what a fine person, he was simply amazing from the word start till the end. Good job sir.
Thank you for a lovely cinematic experience which i enjoyed fully with my family.
Must watch for everyone, everyone must must watch.
Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud, outstanding in the roles, completely justify their selection.
Guy Ritchie deserves all the applause for this magnificent direction."
"sethcook-90784","7","1","3","24 June 2019"," Did not disappoint!!'
","CGI 9/10 abu looked out of place in some shots but geni yago and raja looked fantastic
Acting 7/10 will Smith just seemed to play himself but made a convincing geni and mena massoud didn't seem to embody Aladdin as much as I would of liked
Writing 5/10 the changes from the original movie although not horrid did kind of irratate me mainly the use of yago as a deus ex machina was a bit of a cheat
Music 10/10 they had a weird mix of Bollywood and modern pop/rnb witch I actually enjoyed. Naomi Scott's speechless is a whole bop but one jump reprise is by far the weakest song in the movie (I thought it was one of the strongest in the og) and the second reprise seemed unnecessary
A couple other things jafars motivations in one scene didn't make sense to me and I don't like how some scenes made Aladdin seem less intelligent than his charter acts"

Mena Massoud looked so much like Aladdin with the charming smile and similiar attitude, Naomi Scott was so beautiful and her voice is breathtaking and Will Smith as the Genie added a really nice touch to the character and he was very funny!<br/><br/>The new songs added for Jasmin were catchy and a great addition.

"tbuchalski","7","1","3","22 June 2019"," Aladdin 2019: My Good, Bad, and Ugly
","The Good:
Disney's latest live action remake is a Colorful, and nostalgic imagining that does justice to the animated original. The use of colors in the 1992 was selective and mainly isolated to the film's main characters set against the sand tones of the desert and of Agrabah. But, in Ritchie's selection the settings and costumes both pop with color reminiscent of the films of Bollywood. With little in the way of expanded story, or more complex characters than its predecessor, this film is vibrant and kinetic and speaks to the cinematic value of live action over animation.<br/><br/>The Bad:
With about 38 minutes more runtime than the animated original, this film didn't add much to set itself above, or even apart from, the original. While it has obviously proved successful for the studio with other live action remakes, like The Jungle Book (Jon Favreau, 2016), and Beauty and the Beast (Bill Condon, 2017), these films are little more than cookie cutter copies of their originals. A few new songs wrapped in all of the familiar ones, and a lot of rehashed dialogue veils an almost complete lack of originality in a film that doesn't accomplish much more than repackaging an animated classic for box office receipts.<br/><br/>The Ugly:
One of Disney's first forays into direct adaptation of one of its earlier animated classics is Cinderella (Kenneth Branagh, 2015). Smartly, Disney dispatched with the mice and songs of the original and focused more on the characters of the story in this remake. While Cinderella's step-sisters are still very much caricatures, the evil step-mother played by Cate Blanchett is fleshed out more than her animated counter-part. Whether it's the expanded storyline, the removal of the Disney animation tropes like talking animals or catchy tunes, the impressive performance of Blanchett, or the direction of Branagh, Cinderella championed Disney's then new trend of remaking its animated classics in live action."

"helenbassett","10","1","3","12 June 2019"," Disney Aladdin Film Review - Guy Ritchie Directs Will Smith As The Fresh Prince Of Bazaar In A Whole New World - It's Quite A Ride
","Hands up I've never seen the Aladdin animated Disney film, know none of the songs, except A Whole New World, and haven't seen Robin Williams as the genie. But everyone knows the story of Aladdin and Guy Ritchie's new live action offering was fresh and vibrant and oh so colourful. So gather round children and listen to the story invites Will Smith, in a clever opening segue from Disney.<br/><br/>Some critics are seething with indignation that Disney are making money by turning their beloved animated films into live action fun for all the family films. And for today's woke generation Disney are also using actors with dark skin to play characters historically famous for being dark skinned. And women want to make their own rules. not live within those dictated by men. What's not to love about this?<br/><br/>We can almost smell the scents of Agrabah as the spice traders set up their stalls and the market is filled with fresh produce. And in the middle of this Arabian fantasy is Aladdin, played by Mena Massoud, and his partner in crime Abu. Any relation to Marcel the monkey? Streetwise Aladdin knows a little about running a hustle and helps out Naomi Scott's Dalia, a handmaiden to Princess Jasmine, who has given street kids food from a trader's stall. With no money to pay for them. Employing his trademark frantic chase and parkour action, Guy Ritchie keeps the story moving along as Aladdin and Dalia swing by to Aladdin's crib, where naughty Abu steals Dalia's bracelet, and she leaves thinking Aladdin is just a common thief.<br/><br/>But after this first meeting Aladdin is in love.<br/><br/>And meanwhile out in the desert at the Cave of Wonders a diamond in the rough finds out he was just another cubic zirconia, as the ceiling crashes down around him. And Marwan Kenzari's unlucky Jafar, Advisor to the Sultan, must find another. For there is a lamp to be found and a kingdom to be stolen.<br/><br/>Back in the palace Dalia who is really Princess Jasmine, meets her new royal suitor, Prince Anders played by Billy Magnussen, the token white guy, and royally hamming it up. Loved him in Game Night. But Jasmine is not impressed. Instead telling her handmaid Dalia about the guy she met in the street. The only way for Jasmine to escape the palace and see what life is like for her people is to disguise herself among them. And into this case of mistaken identities lands Aladdin with the bracelet. And a pot of tea. Nasim Pedrad as the real Dalia plays along as Princess Jasmine. He's cute, and Jasmine's tiger Rajah seems to like him. I likened Nasim's portrayal of Dalia to Rosie O'Donnell's Becky in Sleepless In Seattle with her quick one liners. Very funny.<br/><br/>But watching Aladdin from afar, Jafar's parrot Iago thinks he might have found a diamond. And Jafar steals Aladdin away to the Cave of Wonders.<br/><br/>What an amazing place it is, CGI'd to within an inch of its life, with incredible piles of gold and jewels as big as Abu's head, and a magic carpet. But once allowed into the magical cave, for Aladdin is the real diamond in the rough, he is told only to take the lamp. Little Abu however couldn't resist the shiny ruby and the cave crashes around them. Jafar promises to help Aladdin out of the cave if he first passes him the lamp, as only a villain would say, but with sleight of hand Aladdin keeps the lamp as he crashes to the ground.<br/><br/>So let's recap where we are, we have a thieving monkey, a magic carpet and a lamp in a cave. And maybe mimes the magic carpet, if we rub the lamp we might get out of here. And boom. The genie is out of the bottle with his three wishes. Will Smith is the Man in Blue with a song and dance routine he has been practising for a thousand years. Being the Master will take Aladdin some time to get used to. But Genie is very helpful with his guidance. And maybe the first wish is we get out of the cave. Although Aladdin's second wish to be a Prince gives Genie far more scope to shine. But be specific with your wishes, and of course you cannot ask for three more wishes. Our Aladdin is a quick learner.<br/><br/>And what a Prince Aladdin becomes, with genie magic hiding his true identity. Bringing riches to the palace, with a Disney razzle dazzle spectacle of an entrance, and lots of jam. To buy the princess. Okay so that didn't go well.<br/><br/>Jasmine and Dalia are a great double act to the new would be suitors, both looking for something else in their lives, with Genie as Aladdin's wingman and still two wishes left. Trying again Aladdin takes Jasmine on the centrepiece Whole New World magic carpet ride, it's slightly sandy to be honest, while Genie woos Dalia. And surely everyone can end up happy. But who could love a street rat and a genie?<br/><br/>And suspicious of this new Prince from an unknown land, Jafar is not easily beaten, and employs all his cunning to try to trick Aladdin, steal the lamp and become Sultan. And yes he's 'that guy' realises Genie who sees another lifetime locked up in the lamp. And Jasmine for all her royal privileges is expected to marry a prince who will become Sultan when her father dies, instead of her, when she knows so much more about her own kingdom. And could rule better. And poor Aladdin will be poor Aladdin again, if the princess finds out he isn't a prince.<br/><br/>If only there could be a Happy Ending.<br/><br/>With stunning costumes by Michael Wilkinson and Production Design by Gemma Jackson, Aladdin is a kaleidoscope of colour. To be honest I couldn't hum any of the tunes afterwards, other than A Whole New World, sorry to Alan Menken, but they worked in the film with the lively Bollywood style song and dance. As a theatrical event the film was terrific. Wonder how it compares to the stage show. And a big thumbs up to Guy Richie who managed to create the magic, with lots of action and laughs, and a talented cast who radiated such fun.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it very much and I'm already looking forward to Lion King. And dare the critics to find fault with it."
"slightlymad22","7","1","3","12 June 2019"," Against All Odds, Will Smith Makes The Genie His Pwn
","I just got out of watching Aladdin (2019)<br/><br/>I'll get the negative out of the way first. Jasmine's new song 'Speechless' is awful, (and its sung twice) and is more of Hollywood shoving this message down our throats!! The song (about a princess suffering from make oppression) is not empowering for women at all. I have no problem with strong empowering women characters in movies, but as a whole, Hollywood (especially lately) sucks at giving us them!! If they want to empower generations of women, they need to write them so much better than they are. Give us an Arya Stark or Brieanne Of Tarth from Game Of Thrones, Princess Leia or a Sarah Connor from T2, not this!! Naomi Scott is not to blame here, her performance was fine. Likewise, Marwan Kenzari. He has taken a lot of flack and I sort of get it. I didn't hate him, he tries his best with what he is given, but he is just miscast. Mena Massoud tries a little bit too hard at times too. I thought at times he was trying to copy the animated versions too much with his facial expressions.<br/><br/>On to the good<br/><br/>Will Smith totally makes the genie his own. I was really worried he wouldn't pull it off, but he does. I loved his version of 'Friend Like Me' and I have to say, the clip they have been using of the Prince Ali song (which I did not like) on talk shows does not do it justice at all!! It looked great on the big screen. Outside of Smith and Scott's performance, the only other one to stand out for me was Nasim Pedrad as Dalia, Princess Jasmine's hand maiden. She stole a few scene's for me.<br/><br/>It's big on spectacle and looked great at times, even if watching parkour (even if the character doing it is singing) bores me as much as over long car chases.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say a 7/10"

","Although there is plenty here to visually enjoy, the plot holds up, and will smith does a good rendition of the genie. There are some parts of the original that this just can't deliver on. Jafar is an utter dissapointment, turned form a quotable arch baddy into just a dissapointing misogynist on a power trip, Jasmine, despite being made into a feminist icon lost a great deal of the grit and dynamism of the original character, and iago turned from a loudmouth parrot with excellent lines to just a malignant bird. The sultan was also much less humorous, and despite the film being mostly CGI, they once again did not include jafars snake transformation, despite this being arguably one of the best opportunities for a dramatic scene. Although it was enjoyable and funny in parts, it ultimately fails to compete with the original. A remake that was never needed."
"CasualFViewer","7","1","3","9 June 2019"," Viewing this and judging it with no regard for Disney's original Aladdin, this live action remake is actually a decent watch
","Fun, exciting, dazzling...really, this live action remake is actually a fresh and decent remake of Disney's original Aladdin, albeit with a few adjustments to fit a better narrative for this film. Almost nothing can stop anyone from enjoying this film, except of course if they let the original Disney animated cloud their judgement, or take the movie too seriously, et al.<br/><br/>The story, cast, acting, setting, are all decent, maybe not much of fleshing out of side characters such as Iago, but it did a good job of entertaining and retelling the story of Aladdin (One Thousand and One Nights) with an actual live cast. Will Smith, in particular, actually does a good job of portraying a fun and playful genie.<br/><br/>Of course, musicals such as these are an acquired taste, but as much as possible, watch this like you're imagining the original Aladdin story be retold and done in another manner and perspective, with Disney's usual magical and adventurous twists. I also believe Robin Williams, bless his soul, would have enjoyed this Aladdin."

"tabuno","7","1","3","7 June 2019"," A Wil Smith Movie That Propels It
","With musical elements oddly reminiscent of the most recent and compelling James Bond's melodies along with the television hyped musical series such as Glee, Aladdin presents a sort of glorified musical version of those 50s movies attempts at ethnic diversity, but with mixed results. There are several points in the movie where the editing and transition between a some of the later scenes seem rough and uneven. Wil Smith as the genie along with his accompanying dazzling special effects really maintains the energy for this movie and offers up his own Robin Williams antics that has Smith's imprint solidly established in his own right. Jasmin's strong woman's character is undeniable and the musical and singing performances are decent from the original animated version, if not all memorable as could be said of the contemporaneous and memorable music from movie Rocketman (2019), the biopic of Elton John."

","I'm not a huge fan of Disney's remaking spree. Having said that, this movie is good. It adds on a few fun gags to the original story. However, in essence, this is the same movie. In that case, it had to be done very poorly to be a bad movie, since the story it's based on is very good. In fact, the whole first act is flat, at least, and very boring at most. It may be very similar to how the original starts and it may have the same songs. However, it lacks the heart of it. From the moment Will shows up and on, the movie gets much better. I liked the fresh take on the genie's ending on the boat, although I missed the Goofy hat. So, to sum it up, the movie's good and fun, but be prepared to watch a story you already know, probably from memory."
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","3","4 June 2019"," a wondrous crowd-pleaser that merits its Disneyland provenance
","Disney's live action rehash of its vast animation cannon unabashedly trades on its multiplex time-honored stories as good scripts are few and far between nowadays, it is a canny strategy and has paid great dividends as yet, ALADDIN, its 1992 cel animation feature is an echt corker, boasting a kaleidoscopic Middle-Eastern folktale of substantive visual sumptuosity, not to mention Robin Williams' transcendent voice work as Genie, which, as this reviewer sees it, among one of the most versatile voice-only performances ever.<br/><br/>Here, Will Smith exultantly assumes Williams' mantle in this live action, bulks ups and sheathed in all-blue warpaint, he brings down the house when actualizing Genie's multifaceted omnipotence and physical transformation at the drop of a hat, but isn't a patch on Williams for his elocution, Smith's uttering rhythm is conspicuously contemporary and self-conscious (the singing part doesn't do him much good, the reworked FRIEND LIKE ME hardly leaves an impact), shy of a freewheeling drollness that makes William's Genie such a deathless godsend.<br/><br/>Directed by Guy Ritchie, literally the last name director one can expect to be tapped into making a family-friendly Disney fare, ALADDIN more or less, hews to the original story, but retrofits a female-empowering upgrade relative to princess Jasmine (a revelatory Naomi Scott), who thumbs her nose at a doofus white-skin suitor (Billy Magnussen, mired in stereotypes and desperately wanting of a breakthrough), belts out the theme song SPEECHLESS with flying colors, and whose glass-ceiling breaking resolve of being a sultan of the desert kingdom Agrabah pays off satisfactorily.<br/><br/>By comparison, Mena Massoud's street-smart, diamond-in-the-rough Aladdin has less powerful vocal register (bespoken by their duet of A WHOLE NEW WORLD), but compensates it with rollicking, puppetry-mimicking dancing routines, and whose disarming geniality will eventually grow on the viewers. In the antagonist post, Marwan Kenzari's vile vizier Jafar is cartoonish, but telegraphing a faintly epicene charisma that may pave the way for Disney's more radical act of creating characters of heterodox diversity (a timely move too), meanwhile, pet monkey Abu, parrot Iago (voiced by Alan Tudyk) and the magic carpet, all being convincingly and anthropomorphically reified by the state-of-the-art computer-generated FX undertaking and have their own moments to shine.<br/><br/>Totally clicking the box of ethnicity-correctness, buffeting audience with its eye-pleasing 3D spectacles and sleek action bravura, Guy Ritchie's ALADDIN is at any rate, a wondrous crowd-pleaser that merits its Disneyland provenance, however, in terms of rejiggering its original template with a more topical, bolder spin, like its predecessors, Kenneth Branagh's CINDERELLA (2015) and Bill Condon's BEAUTY AND BEAST (2017), it tends to rest on its laurels and is stymied by the fear that any change might affront or displease its core audience, between having the cake and eating it, clearly Disney has made a conservative choice, at this point, not even the upcoming THE LION KING (2019) can alter that, unfortunately."

Not just because of Will Smith as the genie. He does an ok job in role most will always remember Robin Williams for, so it was always going to be tough.<br/><br/>It's more than that. They left out the best bits from the original and the one or two points that were not so good, they kept it.<br/><br/>Simply put it's a film that just lacks and leaves you underwhelmed.

","My favorite Disney animated movie is Aladdin. I was expecting this to be pretty good but I was disappointed.

"Sabaher","7","1","3","29 May 2019"," Definetly not a disaster that I worried it might be, but it's also not a whole new world
","Like Beauty and the Beast, this movie exists for novelty of seeing a Disney classic live action. But I think that this one distinguishes itsfelf a lot more for the simple fact that Will Smith is such a different genie from Robin Williams, but he's also a great genie. When they first announced this project I was just as skeptical as everyone else because I was like ""Who can replace Robin Williams?"" but then they announced Will Smith and I thought yes........ that's the best person for this role because he has all the energy and charisma of Robin Williams, but in a totally different way and that's what elevates this movie and makes it interesting. Some of the tweaks here and there I think we're actually improvements, especially involving the framing device for this new story. Now I don't want to go too much praising this film too much as at the end of the day, I'm probably just going to rewatch the animated film, but they really did the best that they could if you're going to do a project like this."

But I felt like a child again when all the old classical songs were performed. One jump ahead, Prince Ali, Friend like me, A whole new world- they were amazing. Specially loved the prince Ali part. It was basically one on one shot. Just like the animated version.

I was wrong.
He played the character well and brought a different edge to it which fitted in well with the movie.
The music and dance scenes were well produced.
All the casting worked well.
The only thing that could have been improved was that Jafar could have been a bit more menacing in places but this is a small flaw on a good fun movie."

","They used this movie as a platform to push the feminist agenda.

They pushed her agenda with as much subtly as an elephant tiptoeing. It took my back to '92 with all the CGI and flair and that's it's one redeeming quality. The film colorful, and I appreciate the cultural influences. Will Smith wasn't able to top Robin Williams' as the genie(but who could). It's great for the kids but, being that the original is my favorite Disney movie, I was unmoved aside from the truly nostalgic moments. The alterations made did not land home for me but might for others.

I though Will Smith and Naomi Scott were the only actor/actress who did a good job in the movie.
Regarding some of the criticisms regarding the lack of authentic arab culture portrayed and influences of indian culture (including Naomi Scott). I do not think that is a fair criticism. This movie combines eastern cultures because the original book was written by a french author about a guy in China (possibly middle eastern) and possibly based on the Abbasid empire so the book itself was based on a blend of cultures. So if anything it should have also included Chinese, Turkish and Iranian influences as well. Also I very much prefered the bollywood influence just like WIll Smith (which IMO much more entertaining than anything put out by the egyptian or arab film industry)."

","Minor ""spoilers"" possibly...<br/><br/>This is a tough one. On the one hand, it's yet another substandard, artificial, committee funded, market researched, and socially progressive remake...and one that gets lost in translation from animation to live action. And yet I'd be remiss to say that I didn't enjoy this movie. It wasn't good, but there were things to like, and the final feeling was an overall good one...The problem is is that certain things that worked perfectly for the animated classic don't really belong in the live action version, at least this movie made no effort to justify their being carried over (I'm looking at you Iago). The lad who plays Aladdin was likable and but somehow I feel he wasn't the best choice. He's certainly not a singer and his performance was awkward at times, particularly when he tries to be funny. He lacks that rugged scrapper quality you would expect out of Aladdin (especially Guy Ritchie street Aladdin)... Naomi Scott did a good job, she looks great and can really sing too. Although they try to give her character more of an arc this time, it ultimately doesn't work. Her arc literally interrupts the momentum of the third act just so she can have a very forced musical number that's trying to be the next ""Let it go"".... The guy who plays Jafar wasn't terribly charismatic and his take of the villain pales in comparison to animated Jafar... Will Smith was easily the best part of the movie. To his credit, he doesn't try to do a Robin Williams impersonation, he makes the Genie his own...Still certain moments were fun (i.e. Aladdin dancing at the party, anything with the genie, some of the musical numbers....some of that was really awkward though yikes)....The film certainly feels like a Disney product. Everyone is dressed impeccably, even Aladdin who's supposed to be a hobo and a street rat...the city of Agrabah never transcends feeling like a set...there is a lot of CGI and some of it is jarring when blended with the live action elements...it lacks the down and dirty grit you'd expect from Guy Ritchie...It feels more manufactured and manipulative than real, in the moment and natural. Unfortunately, its more often jarring, awkward, and disappointing in comparison....Yet Overall It's fun and enjoyable. It gives you the feels, it makes you laugh. It entertains you and takes you away for two hours... Its just In the end you can't help but wonder - what was the point of this? to remind us to go watch the original? which is so obviously superior in almost every way..."

","Very disappointing. Completely skipped character development and jumped right into the main story. ""Here I am....you already know my character so let's waste no time endearing the audience to me as the new character.""

"vtg-454-733139","6","1","3","26 May 2019"," Didn't ruin childhood

The vivid colours and superb acting from Will Smith were great! He took his own spin on the genie,- role which anyone would be highly criticized for since Robin Williams shoes are tough to fill."
"elisava-grace","6","1","3","26 May 2019"," So much potential, but sadly so poorly done
","I really, really wanted to love this movie. It had such great potential, but the end result was messy and poorly executed.
The casting, in my opinion, was excellent. Massoud and Scott were a convincing Aladdin and Jasmine, though their chemistry was best at the beginning of the film. Once Prince Ali appears, the dynamic gets confusing, with Jasmine often still reacting positively to Ali/Aladdin despite some incredibly awkward and embarrassing moments, not to mention a blatant broken promise, egotistical behavior, and degrading remarks. Their early chemistry disappears and their relationship is so sidelined that I wasn't even sure I was rooting for them to end up together.
Will Smith portrays a fresh Genie that was very enjoyable. He's not Robin Williams but doesn't try to be, and gives depth and likability to the character. My only complaint is the decision to make him blue, which brings me to my next point...the CGI.
I don't know if the CGI was lower quality than I have grown used to or if it was just so pervasive that it became noticeable, but every time I saw it I was taken out of the story...and I saw it a LOT. Abu. Iago. Carpet. Raja. Genie. Building-jumping Aladdin. Magical creatures can be inserted effortlessly into an animated film, but perhaps they should have been pared down for the live-action. Do we really need three animal sidekicks? I would argue that Raja at the very least could have been dispensed with, since the character of Dahlia was introduced, giving Jasmine someone else to interact with.
The screenplay was full of jokes, but they sadly fell flat again and again.
I was often the only one chuckling in the theater, and this was driven more by my desire to enjoy it than actual enjoyment. Rather than this movie making me laugh or cry (both of which Beauty and the Beast succeeded in), what I found myself doing most often was covering my mouth in embarrassment trying to ride out the awkward and uncomfortable scenes. Some of these are intended to be funny, but drag on for far too long to be anything but miserable.
The colors and cinematography throughout are bright and engaging, but somehow fall short of their true potential; for instance, the scene where Jafar steals the lamp in the midst of waving yellow banners was lovely, but confusingly cut. The camera angle choices during the palace dance scene also felt sloppy. And the occasional slow motion scene was just plain strange and unnecessary (Aladdin slow-mo screaming is not particularly pleasant to look at).
Speaking of strange and unnecessary, let's talk about Jasmine's final song, ""Speechless."" I cannot begin to understand what the train of thought was that produced that. Placing an extended song in the middle of an intense climactic scene was a questionable choice to begin with. Then to choose to have people disappear one by one was additionally confusing, and I'm not the only one who was questioning whether this was supposed to be happening only in Jasmine's head or if something else was going on. This was obviously supposed to be a climactic, emotional scene, but it felt out of place. Placing it literally anywhere else in the movie would have improved it.
Lastly, the additional subplot of Jasmine wanting to be sultan left me with mixed feelings. I am 100% in favor of women being leaders, but watching a main character chase power is never attractive, and I wish this had been presented differently. There's also a pretty far distance between ""don't speak at all"" and ""be the ruler of our people,"" and it seemed slightly unrealistic that Jasmine could jump from one expectation to the other relatively easily. (Though maybe I shouldn't be complaining about things being unrealistic in a film with a genie and magic carpet.) The additional sultan subplot just added to an already messy-feeling movie that couldn't quite decide what it was about. Is this about Aladdin learning to be honest? Aladdin's and Jasmine's relationship? Defeating Jafar? Setting the Genie free? Or empowering Jasmine to be sultan? The answer seems to be: Yes!
All in all, though, let's be honest, the real tragedy of this movie is that they didn't work in the line, ""And your beard is so.....twisted."" Damn you real Jafar and your boring beard!"

"jbaxenom","6","1","3","26 May 2019"," Trying too hard to be original
","Perhaps because the animated Aladdin it is one of my favourite movies of all time, or perhaps because I've waited so much for this live-action remake to be out, I could not get myself to enjoy this version as much as I did with the Beauty and the Beast live-action remake.<br/><br/>I feel the changes introduced removed part of the magic and the fun. So many of the original funny moments were removed! Neither Abu nor Iago are as funny, leaving everything to the Genie (who delivers, though). In any case, the original movie flowed with constant action and excitement, and I did not feel any of it in this remake.<br/><br/>About the music, the songs try to be too modern and add too much beat to them (even in ""A Whole New World""!! Really?!). I felt this broke the magic of an old tale in an arabic land. The new song from Jasmine is incredibly executed, but I honestly do not think we need an explicitly feminist song in each new Disney movie... Don't get me wrong, I do believe the message should be out there, but I think Beauty and the Beast made a better use of the story to empower the feminine cast without resorting to explicit messages. I mean come on, in the original movie Jasmine demonstrates Aladdin she can use the pole to jump by herself, while in here she needs him to cheer her up because she's scared... How difficult would have been to leave the original sequence, surely more empowering than a song?<br/><br/>Anyway, the Genie was very nicely done by Will Smith, and the sequence to the entrance of Agrabah to the ""Prince Ali"" song was just PERFECT. Those were the highlights for me. It's still an enjoyable movie (a must watch for kids), but I hope The Lion King is better (and that they announce Hercules soon!!!)."

"Sunnydws","6","1","3","26 May 2019"," ""Clumsy, but in a charming way.""
","The name Aladdin has conjured up wondrous imagery for generations. Stories filled with exotic far off lands, magic carpets, all-powerful genies, wishes of riches untold. The genie is sure to keep us in check though, serving the reminder that there's no such thing as wishing for more wishes. Three should suffice. And yet, despite some wonderful intentions, we are often left wishing for a bit more.<br/><br/>I'll spare the lengthy plot synopsis, and focus instead on our three main characters: Aladdin, Princess Jasmine, and the genie.<br/><br/>Aladdin has all the boy next door charms from his days as an animated street rat, but he has a more finely tuned understanding of navigating the streets of Agrabah. Like where to take his stolen goods in exchange for food, deducing palace residents like a hardened detective by their finely woven silks, and designing his hideout with engineering knack that's probably above his pay grade. After he unwittingly meets the princess in the marketplace, and figures her for a royal attendant based on her richly garb, he literally jumps at the chance to scale the palace walls to chat with her more. He explains his shamelessness, ""when you have nothing, you have to act like you own everything."" If he's willing to go through all that trouble to see her, why is he suddenly self-aware when he finds out she's the princess? He's already risked his neck at that point by breaking and entering her royal chambers, handmaiden or not. Is the girl worth the trouble? Sure, she's gorgeous. They would make an incredibly handsome couple. But is there more?<br/><br/>Jasmine is already fully fleshed when we meet her, a woman of dignity and spirit, compassionate and tender towards her people, and undeniably true to herself. She is granted a near total independent identity, defiantly able to stand on her own, perhaps a rarity for Disney princesses. Except it comes at the expense of the romance that should be at the heart of the movie. What did this journey teach her? I'm not sure. The men in her life are either stubbornly traditional (her father, who completely lacks a discernible personality like the charming naÃ¯vetÃ© of his animated counterpart), dim (the flavorless Prince Anders, who probably has 2 or 3 scenes waiting to pop up as bonus features), paint-by-the-numbers evil (the stale Jafar) or Aladdin. Sure, he's adventurous, but not in a way that would actually challenge the princess to expand her horizons. We meet her brazenly stealing food for children in the marketplace. And besides, she likes her horizons. With access to a magic carpet ride, where would you go? If Jasmine had her way, she'd end up in her own backyard, looking over her people like a loving mother. Aladdin could just as easily be caught in the friend zone by the end of the film. Her place is with her people, not necessarily with Aladdin/Prince Ali. A noble quality, but it's hammered home (including with a new song called ""Speechless"") until you begin to question why the movie was called ""Aladdin"". The only vulnerability she has as a character comes from being surrounded by men who lie to her or mean her harm. Not equals she can learn from.<br/><br/>The motivations of the genie are still as hazy as that blue smoke that trails behind him. In this iteration, his hope is not only to become free, but to be human. I suppose it's because the scenes in which Will Smith's charm shines through the most are in scenes where he's...human. He doesn't attempt the Goliath magnetism of Robin Williams' genie, but finds a nice groove as the sarcastic confidante. But for reasons unknown, he begins a romantic dalliance with Jasmine's handmaiden. Perhaps these two weren't happy enough being the wingman and wingwoman for Jasmine and Aladdin. In the end, it feels unnecessary and not properly explored, if not a little cute.<br/><br/>As you watch it, you have to be intentional about not comparing it to the wonderful 1992 version, because it would be a disservice to both. Yes, it features some incredible set design and makes use of its big budget in almost every area. But they don't have the same endgame in mind. This version attempts a balancing act between Prince and Princess, and never intends to keep the focus solely on Aladdin. They may meet on the streets of Agrabah, but you're left ill-convinced that their ambitions ever meet at a crossroads. Familiarly, the law says Jasmine must marry a prince. But we're never convinced she'd hand over the keys to her kingdom to anyone, including Aladdin. In this case, marrying him would only serve as the means to an end. It may actually benefit her to keep his deceit going as the thought of him becoming Sultan someday never breaches the surface, and she could at least marry someone she can tolerate while she wears the all-powerful pants. And for a movie that focuses a good deal on the power hungry nature of Jafar, and even Aladdin to an extent, it curiously never questions Jasmine's determination. I suppose one can only wish."

The Genie! Hands down the most entertaining performance I've seen Will Smith deliver. He does not impersonate Robin Williams but he follows on his footsteps. Remains true to the character he is and puts out a wild entertaining spin to it. Im sure Will Smith's lines were somewhat improvised because that dialogue flowed quite naturally in comparison to the rest of the characters.
The rest of the movie was a let down. Aladdin and Jafar were meh. Jasmine was alright but there was that one women empowerment part which I thought was a good idea to include... but Don't really know if that was the way to excecute it.
The animals were kinda bad. That's the thing, when you make it a real looking animal, its hard to make them likeable. I mean yes they look sweet and cute but the parrot and Abu and the tiger had so much more life to them in the cartoon.

"Hammer-Rocks","7","1","3","26 May 2019"," It's More Musical Than Expected
","I realise the original animation was a typical Disney animation musical, but I was expecting the transition to live action would have made it more realistic and reduced most of it (singing). Similar to the transition of Cinderella, Jungle Book and Snow White.<br/><br/>This version will still take you on an amazing adventure, and closely follows the animation's storyline. Which for the purist of the original animation, would love. But it lacks a little atmosphere. I mean you can't help but noticed most of it was filled in a studio. It must be the lighting.<br/><br/>But that is not a big deal. What I kinda wished was, when the movie transitioned to live action, it was less musical and more real life.<br/><br/>Sure the the dance scenes during the celebration in the palace, Aladdin's entrance to the the city as Prince Ali, were appropriate, entertaining and added to the storyline, plus somewhat realistic. The same goes with Genie's singing and dancing during his first released from the lamp. Anyway, who says Genies don't do that. In fact these scenes were entertaining and goes with the flow of the story.<br/><br/>However, singing while being chased by palace guards, or while being sent to the dungeon, or while being reflective and gazing at the horizon? Really!? Who does that in real life? The iconic scene between Jasmine and Aladdin flying on a magic carpet and singing ""A whole new world"" together could have been turned into a more realistic scenario. Maybe have the song playing in the background instead, while the scene pan out.<br/><br/>The key actors playing the main characters, all did well bringing them to real life. Having said that, while Will Smith did a superb job as being Genie, I can't help but feel that if Robin Williams was still alive (RIP), he would have done a much better job.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite these gripes of mine, I did enjoy the movie. It's just the singing at non-appropriate time just slowed the story's progress.<br/><br/>I would have scored this movie higher if it was less musical. But lovers of the animation would love it."

Aladin(Mena Mazoud) is promising and grows on you as the movie progresses but does not have screen presence and a limited range of emotions. Genie (Will Smith) and Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) have performed well and carry the movie on the shoulder.

","Since there aren't many good things about this film, that's what this will start with. Firstly, Will Smith is absolutely incredible as the genie and easily the best part of the movie. The genie is expressive, colorful, bright and very much magical. This is the aspect of the movie that matches closest to the original animation. Each scene with the Genie is very entertaining and he carries the movie in a way. Second, the musical aspect of this movie is great. The music sounds on point and for the most part performed well. Aladdin is played well by Mena Massoud and portrays the character well as matched to the animation. That's just about it for all the good things about Aladdin. The film's plot is atrocious, it is boring, uninteresting and dragging. This is mainly what made the second half so boring, it feels like you're being forced to care about a story they don't actually try to make you care for. The second half is so boring you could likely fall asleep unintentionally. Also, the movie feels insanely sped up at the start. It feels like they're speeding through important things, and many are just disregarded which brings the story down. A lot of this film just doesn't make sense, infact in some cases it seems that Guy Ritchie (director) just felt like some things didn't need to be explained because everyone has seen Aladdin before. Many things like Jafar turning into a Cobra or Raja doesn't work in this movie whatsoever. Jafar doesn't even turn into a cobra, and Raja barely plays a part in this movie other than seeming menacing to others. Jafar was absolutely terrible in this movie, they don't give you any reason to hate him. The guy is just there and is what makes the film feel so dragged. There's this one annoying way of storytelling, and it's that Jafar's parrot overhears everything in the castle and tells Jafar everything. It's overused and completely bland. CGI is also bad in many of the scenes. It's pretty obvious and used in many scenes that didn't quite need it, however it is obvious that they put most of their CGI money into the Genie scenes, and that has definitely paid off. This movie just proves that some animated movies deserve to be kept the way they already were. There are aspects that belong to animated movies, and Aladdin just shows in comparison to it's original that many of these things wouldn't work whatsoever in a live-action movie. Regardless, this movie is still a fun ride throughout most of it, and enjoyable if you're there for the Genie."

","I went to cinema excpecting less from this movie. But it was really a good. The actors were really really on point and Massoud was really a revelation to me. A lot of funny scenes and no dull moments. I highly recommend this remake and it's a lot better than Beauty and the Beast IMO."

","This movie feels more like a Bollywood movie, the music, the dresses, costumes, the dances are all very much like a typical Bollywood movie. The awkward part is all of them speaking English, most of the dialogues are bland. Will Smith's role as the Genie is portrayed more as a rapper, he even speaks English like he is from the hood, very weird. The musical parts of the movie are very boring and at times misplaced.

"watcher101","5","1","3","25 May 2019"," It looks good, but it ONLY looks good
","For live-action Disney movies, they've been pretty hit or miss for me. For example, I loved Beauty & the Beast, but I hated Maleficent. I was very excited for Aladdin though, only to be really let down. The special effects were awesome, I'll definitely give it that, but the acting was atrocious. I almost felt like I was watching amateurs who barely acted. There were also several scenes that felt very rushed just so they could move the plot along, but I could overlook that. The poor acting however, I just couldn't get past. Whether it sounded like they were reading a script, barely put any emotion into their dialogue, or overacted on certain areas, there was just so much bad acting that not even the special affects could save it as it was so distracting. I'm not saying the movie was bad, just that it could have been so much better if they actually had some good acting. In comparison, I give the original animated Aladdin a 9/10, but I only give this one a 5/10."

","Just got home from the movie theater, I'll have to admit I was not very excited about this movie. My daughter is a Human Disney Princess and my wife grew up LOVING the animated Aladdin so that's why we all went to see it. First off I was surprised at how much I really liked this movie. The guy who played Aladdin was great, Loved Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmin!! They did alot with her character and we all loved it. Even Will Smith who I was worried about because let's face it, Robin Williams Genie is legendary, But even he did well.

Will Smith is THE best as always and the cast was a great choice! I loved so much! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
"jotz_tom","6","1","3","25 May 2019"," So close, yet...
","To make things clear I came into the movie theater without any unrealistic expectations or biases against this movie. I'm also not going to compare this to the original Aladdin because I understand that this is a whole new take on the classic tale and is in no way trying to be a carbon copy of the original (nor is it trying to be). Instead Aladdin (2019) tried to focus on the smaller details brushed off by its predecesor. Smaller details like why no one recognized Aladdin when he was dressed as Prince Abubu (I'm actually disappointed that joke wasn't in the film) and also some background on Jasmine and Aladdin's parents! Now those were some welcome additions that I really found interesting. I also liked how they met right at the beginning and actually had Jasmine be there for the stealing is ok song. That kind of served as a way for the main characters to bond earlier and show us that cute chemistry they got going. Before I knew it, 15 minutes in and we were already at the halfway point of the old movie so I knew there were going to be a lot of new subplots. Which I would have been totally fine with if the movie actually executed it correctly. Since this is just a short review here are a couple of things I didn't like: Jafar random town destroying plot, annoying side character/love interest of genie, loyal guard speech, random princess Jasmine soliloquy song. Well that is all I can remember. I feel like I need to explain some of those things I didn't particularly enjoy. Jafar wanting the throne should he enough motivation for him, he didn't have say he wants to destroy some random town over and over and over and over again throughout the film to show his evilness. He's evil enough. Or maybe the writers needed to convince us more since the Jafar actor was so unconvincing to the point of cringe level video game dialogue. Don't even get me started with this new comic relief genie love interest character. She was bad, I have no problems with new characters except those that have zero chemistry not only with the other characters but with the audience. The jokes they had for her fell flat and the genie love interest was just well weird. As for the loyal guard, he was okay I mean he was just sort of there but that was okay because he did his job without annoying the audience like that other new character. But then he had this thing in the end where Jasmine talks him into not betraying the Sultan because he saw some blue guy make Jafar a funny hat. I feel like the whole premise of Jasmine using her genuine empathy for people and changing them for the greater good was okay. But it came to the point where it was too dragging and well I just didn't care at that point. As for that soliloquy song she sings before confronting the guard... Well I'm gonna skip talking about it like how the movie was supposed to. Bottomline is the third act of this film really bogged it down. It reminded me of a school play where everyone is just standing around and waiting for someone to tell them what to say or do in that moment. By that point I was already melting on my seat.<br/><br/>To conclude, I wanted to love this film. The first half of the movie was promising, Will Smith exceeded expectations. He wasn't a try hard Robin Williams nor did he try to be. Aladdin was also great and his chemistry with Jasmine was really believable. I also loved the growth of Jasmine's character. She's the same old feisty Jasmine but this time she seemed more determined than ever to be more than what she was made up to be. I feel like that is the recurring theme throughout this movie, even Aladdin goes through this as he becomes more than just a thief. Even the sultan, he's not a pushover anymore so that's a plus. Now I wish the movie just bottled up the positive things in this movie and just applied it to the whole finished product but they ended up with a pretty messy final act. I wanted to love this movie but the final act threw me off. I hate Jafar, I hate the dumb subplots and boring character arcs. That's it 6/10."
"AishaK2113","5","1","3","25 May 2019"," Will Smith or Guy Ritchie Could Not Save This Movie
","Mr. Smith you had BIG shoes to fill and you left me VERY disappointed. After going back & forth on whether to see this or not, I did it. My initial review from the previews was Genie looks weird and this looks like a Netflix movie. It's too glamorous. Growing up with Aladdin being 1 of my top 2 Disney films I told myself not to have high expectations. Robin Williams' Genie was so grand and was the best part of the original. You would have thought the movie was about Genie and not Aladdin. Of the old one, Williams voice & performance was very iconic and you just don't get that from this live action Aladdin. A) Netflix I think COULD have done better B) Genie was simply boring. To me, it honestly seemed as if they told Will to tone it down. I wanted Genie's personality to be more extra. The Arabian Nights song at the beginning was actually really good & Smith's voice was not bad. So, I was excited for my favorite songs to come. Man, y'all really let me down with Friend Like Me. Prince Ali was just... okay. C) Iago, the parrot, was hilarious and one of my favorite parts about the original. Y'all should have either not let him talk or made him funny. He was not funny at all. D) Jafar's voice was wayyyy too high and he just wasn't scary or evil enough E) Aladdin was too pretty. He's supposed to be a street rat not a movie star with a dingy hat. F) They left out A LOT of the old dialogue I love about the original.
For the things I thought was good. The acting wasn't terrible from all cast. I thought Princess Jasmine had the best performance and best voice. So, it didn't bother me that they gave her 2 new songs. I loved that the cast was not Caucasian and Indian dancing was incorporated. I really enjoyed that. After the movie was over, they did the extended Friend Like Me version and that was good."

The special effects are beautiful!"
"florentiapanaou","6","1","3","25 May 2019"," It just feels like something is missing...
","Even though I had my doubts about this film, I still went to see it. Well, my guts weren't wrong.
The soundtrack was pretty good.
The visuals are stunning, putting aside the swolen genie (which it wasn't a big problem) but I don't really think I'm the best to talk about them.
But still it felt like it had a forced vibe and was missing a lot of its charm that it had in the 1992 animated film. The beat was slower and the characters were more balnt not showing a lot of feelings and like they fully understand what's going on around them except the genie, who is literally a blue Will Smith. Some secondary characters as the Sultan , Rajah and the Jafar's bird ( O forgot its name) were merely a plain accessory, not having any sort of personality or liveliness and the role of Jasmine's handmaid was useless, only existing for being a love interest to Genie and for comic relief.
Jafar, he is on whole another different level from the animated film, on a way lower one. He has no cunningness or wickedness while portayed or any sort of charm. But it's not only him, but everyone else too. Jasmine just as Aladdin both had this cunningness and confidence (moslty Jasmine) that is completely ignored throughout the whole movie and the fact that Jafar words of underestimating Jasmine just seemed way to forced to later show that she herself has a voice, even though she had it but for some reason, just didn't use it. This Jasmine even though more explored, shows a little of former characteristics that at the beginning were kind of shown, but completely forgotten to be used in the rest, becoming just an obvious showcase of feminism. It felt like at some parts she was existing just for that.
Some plot changes were kind of interesting as ( spoilers ahead ) Jasmine became the Sultan without actually getting married but hated the fact that when Genie got free , he just completely lost his powers amd became a human.
At the end the feeling of watching it was very mixed, having most of its magic lost. I think they tried to make the plot more of a ""true story"" thing such as it told by the future genie unlike the original that, theoretically, is a fantasy story inside a story. It's forcing its way to become more humanely, losing the main concept of the original, that it was actual fantasy.<br/><br/>I recommend watching it only if you don't really care about the original or don't mind having your childhood ruined or if you see it as a completely different movie with the same main plot.<br/><br/>Sorry for my English if it's wrong"
"pordosol77","7","1","3","24 May 2019"," Look like a low budget movie.

Beat of the other songs where nice, quite catchy. The acting kinda poor. And that akward hug from Genie and Aladdin. Rated 7 because Will Smith. Too bad, Aladdin (1992) still is one of my top 5 Disney movies."

"rebecca_e_sewell","7","1","3","24 May 2019"," Pros and cons. But Will Smith takes on the Genie and does it good
","For anyone who's watched the original.
Face facts. This will never be the original.<br/><br/>However. It's a bloody good attempt.
The music performances are excellent and despite reading many reviews expecting to see a poor performance from Will smith. I was actually really happy with his performance of the genie. He doesn't taint Robin Williams classic performance nor does he make it better. Smith takes the role as his own and despite many nods to Williams, Will Smith puts his own unique qualities into the character.<br/><br/>Also a nod to both Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott for good performances and great singing abilities.<br/><br/>This is also not a complete remake of the original classic. But an updated version with a lot more depth and structure. The story is filled out more with a lot more depth to Jasmines character which in this day and age is a welcome change.<br/><br/>I have 2 criticisms. 1/ I think they missed a trick taking Iago out of the storyline as a sub character. This film he's a mere pet bird with generic parrot phrases. No humour like in the original. That for me was a real shame.
2/ At no point did Jafar come across as an evil villain. His persona and look in the original goes down in history of a fine villain. This film doesn't portray that at all. Despite the exact same aims and goals, this Jafar seems like a school child trying to impress the bullies at school by being mean to others. I'm unsure if it was how Ritchie had portrayed the character or if it was down to the performance of Marwan Kensari. All in all. I would suggest ignoring the critics and go for pure nostalgia and a great Disney film."

My daughter is six, and had I known that Aladdin was going to be thrown into the ocean from 100 feet above, strangled to a chair, and seeing/hearing him cry for help like that, I would have definitely not taken my child. I wish I would have seen the whole movie beforehand. It is not for children; it is more for adults. Parents, please watch or read reviews before you take your kids. My daughter shouldn't have crawled into my seat to cover her face and fall asleep during a Disney Princess Movie.<br/><br/>There were other scenes that simply portrayed a lot of falling/pain and elevated cruelty that was too much for a small child to handle, at least mine."

"gigitville","6","1","3","24 May 2019"," As Good as Any Live-Action Disney Remake
","There are a fair amount of both pros and cons in the live action Aladdin remake, but honestly, I wasn't expecting really any pros at all.<br/><br/>The good aspects are the movie were in fact, pretty solid. The relationship between Jasmine and Aladdin felt believable and the two actors had chemistry, and Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott were really good. There were a few new tweaks or additions to the main story that felt natural, and made it feel different enough from the original that it wasn't just a carbon copy. Jasmine wanting to become the sultan, Jafar coming from poverty and having to steal like Aladdin, and Aladdin feeling very out of place in a royal setting were all great additions that provided a little depth and character motivations. The music was pretty good, for the most part.<br/><br/>Now, Will Smith as the Genie wasn't that great. He had some huge shoes to fill considering the character was originally written for Robin Williams, and while Will Smith was charming most of the time in the roll, it fell flat for me. It lacked the same depth and genuine heart that Williams' did. This also made Genie's and Aladdin's friendship not believable, which is the foundation of the movie and gives purpose to the ending and the Genie's freedom. Also the whole romantic subplot with him and Jasmine's handmaiden felt like an afterthought and made for a weaker motivation. The fact that the movie's excuse for people not recognizing Aladdin as Prince Ali because of ""Genie magic"" was pretty lazy. Also the new Jasmine songs, while empowering, weren't in keeping with tone and style of the other songs, so they felt really out of place.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a pretty good movie. It was entertaining enough to watch, though it had it's problems like any movie. I wish Disney wasn't only rehashing their ideas and also make new films as well, but whatever."

","Was curious because of the cast and director, but this is just another fart from Disney. Sound and fury signifying nothing. Completely missing what made the original so great- magic, charm, and entertainment. This was ho hum right from the auto tune in the first song. This doesn't work as a live action, at least not as it was executed here. Really disappointing and can't believe it's so bland and misses every single mark, except maybe the sound design, costumes, and sets. Cinematography is lame, acting/casting bad, music adaptations bad... the bar is so incredibly low because this movie made crazy money. Yikes."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","1","4","21 July 2019"," A passable adaptation that does its best to improve on the original in spots.
","When the animated version of Aladdin came out in 1992, I was seven years old. As a young boy, I could finally relate to the titular character since the focus of this Disney film wasn't as much on the ""princess"" as it was on ""Prince Ali."" Consequently, this film has remained one of my favorite Disney films over the years and is one I have mostly memorized after repeated viewings in my childhood. As such, I was partly looking forward to this live-action adaptation due to my love of the original. The other part of my anticipation was because Guy Ritchie was directing it (and I've loved plenty of his earlier works).<br/><br/>Having now seen this version of the rags-to-riches tale, I'm in this weird ""uncanny valley"" of storytelling. Because I have the original memorized, this version of the story was close enough to be predictable but not a word-for-word re-enactment, which is what I found to be slightly jarring in my personal experience. This also extended to the songs, most of which felt a little flat (both tonally and energy-wise), with the notable exceptions being ""A Whole New World"" and the new song sung by Jasmine (Naomi Scott)-which was likely an opportunity to cash in on the popularity of ""Let it Go."" If there were no animated precursor to this film, maybe I wouldn't have had this reaction.<br/><br/>While there were a few scenes that had the Guy Ritchie visual charm, overall it was a passable film. I did appreciate the realism in the settings and dress of the characters, as well as the additions of the handmaid (Nasim Pedrad) and Arabic text on most of the documents shown on screen. I also could accept that the minor changes to the plot were made to make the story slightly more modern, while also filling in plenty of the logical gaps that were present in the original. Even though Robin Williams' Genie was a tough act to follow, Will Smith's performance did eventually grow on me to the point where it felt natural in this version.<br/><br/>A passable adaptation that does its best to improve on the original in spots, I give Aladdin 4.0 stars out of 5."
"mdwatkins37","10","1","4","20 July 2019"," Well Done, Disney!
","This movie was engaging and the new spins that were written were a phenomenal reimagination of the Aladdin story line. It was such a treat to see that fantastic acting of the cast, and I was most impressed by the fact that Will Smith did a phenomenal job playing the Genie! I was leery of him playing this role upon seeing the trailer--although I know that he is a fantastic, multi-dimensional actor--I was not prepared to see him in such a fantasy, magical character role."

"paligladayan","9","1","4","18 July 2019"," Mesmerizing!
","First of all, I should start by saying, that the little mermaid, beauty and the beast and Aladdin are by far my favorite Disney princess movies.. I am in love with the idea of remaking these movies ! Since I was expecting more from beauty and the beast, I actually went to the theaters for Aladdin with a little doubt.. yet this movie surprised me big time! Let us first start by costumes and sceneries! Incredible! I hope I won't break Disney fans hearts by saying even more beautiful than some of the ones in the original movie. The few new songs (sang mainly by Jasmin) had beautiful lyrics very much applied to today's world and were a nice new touch to the movie.. most of the actors were well chosen for their roles, but Will Smith is very impressive in this movie! Before watching the movie, it was really hard for me to imagine Ginnie without Robin Williams.. come on, he's the only Ginnie that can possibly exist! With all my respect to the role and character Robin Williams created, I personally believe that Will Smith did a great job recreating a Ginnie that you just cannot stop admiring! He kept Ginnie's core traits, his speed, his humour, his tonality, but he also added a touch of his own which can be summarized in a mild sarcasm (the few changes done to his script also probably helped him develop this new Ginnie). I wouldn't miss this movie if I were you! It will be 2 hours of pure magic and laughter!Reminiscent of my childhood with a great touch of humour!"
"chrinaboehler","10","1","4","23 June 2019"," Exceeded expectations.
","The trailers for this are extremely deceptive. Many critics complain that Aladdin relied too heavily on cgi, and the teasers don't do much to disprove that. However, critics are called critics for a reason, and a cover is nice but a cover is not the book!<br/><br/>Just so to make readers aware of the potential biases of the review, I'm a huge Disney fanatic and grew up in the Disney Renaissance era. I was also, like many others, very nervous after viewing the trailers. Silly me.<br/><br/>Go see Aladdin in theaters. It's visually spectacular and that's to say the very least. The acting was beautiful done with just the right twist from each character, the choreography was unique and refreshing and the score was ever beautiful as it always has been with a slightly different vibe. It's not the original, and it shouldn't be. It's a great movie all the same.<br/><br/>Starting with the actors, Naomi Scott, ever beautiful, costars as Princess Jasmine. She does it perfectly. She's strong willed and rebellious, and she handles the dynamic of the character smoothly.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud plays Aladdin, and I was very impressed with his performance. His expressions may be my personal favorite part of his performance, they hold the sincere, troubled, yet ever lighthearted street rat fantasticly. However his singing and dancing are the most notable. This is because(being the dork I am I did extensive research after seeing the movie) he has no real background in musical theater at all.<br/><br/>Marwan Kenzari as Jafar was not well portrayed in the trailers, and that's because this character has a much slower, more derranged villainy than 1992's Jafar. He has a Faraway look in his eye that only comes to surface in his intense anger, and it's a different kind of chilling.<br/><br/>Last, but certainly not the least, Will Smith's Genie. Every single review, good or bad, agrees that Robin Williams is often imitated, never duplicated. Thankfully Will Smith didn't try to duplicate it, nor did Guy Ritchie, or the writers. Because it simply can't be done and should never be tried. Enough of that, Will Smith nailed his performance. They went left field, took the genie in a unique direction that caused controversy but worked out beautifully. Charismatic and very trendy, the Genie is still Al's pal. He pays homage to Robin's performance but is different in a way that is perfectly Will Smith, still carrying an obvious hip hop vibe.<br/><br/>Abu is a little off. His relationship with Aladdin doesn't seem as deep as the original, likely because it's hard for a person to talk to nothing with sincerity, even if they are acting. Iago however, I feel makes up for that, don't let him go unnoticed as a regular parrot. For one, it's Alan Tudyk! Two, he subtly seems to act as Jafar's dark inner voice, while also still bringing occasional comic relief. Not very many lines but still a nice interpretation. The magic carpet? Well it's still a magic carpet, and still very cute.<br/><br/>The dancing was controversial among critics, however I thoughroughly enjoyed it. The combination of hip hop and Arabian dancing blends together extremely well and is very eccentric. The singing was different of course, the most classic being Mena Massoud as Aladdin. Naomi Scott gets a much deserved solo that carries a lot of symbolism. Will Smith's singing and dancing performance was expectedly fun. The musical numbers as a whole were incredibly well executed while being visually spectacular. Most of them carry a subtle hip hop vibe, and it may sound out of place but surprisingly, really fluid.<br/><br/>Nostalgia is there. Not as much as the Lion King will undoubtedly have, but it's there. With the way the world has progressed Aladdin was forced to be more original than other Disney remakes, and that's for the good.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't think Aladdin is getting enough positive attention, and if my expectations were higher going it to it my rating may have been a 9. Still, I would have given the same written review."

"lumieretrain","8","1","4","21 June 2019"," Aladdin (2019) by Guy Ritchie
","The movie Aladdin (1992) by Ron Clements and John Musker is still considered, one of the most important Disney classic animated movies. The story is filled with adventure, humor and unforgettable rhythmic songs, which is still loved by the fans as it explores different themes like love, friendship and self confidence. The filmmaker Guy Ritchie seems interested to release a live action movie version of Aladdin, by giving a new vision of the story through a new visceral direction. In 2019 came out Aladdin by Guy Ritchie with Will Smith, Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, Marwan Kenzari and Nasim Pedrad. The movie's plot: Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is a poor noble hearted thief, who falls in love with the princess of Agrabah Jasmine (Naomi Scott). The only way Aladdin can reach Jasmine is thanks to the magic lamp which when is rubbed, the Genie (Will Smith) would come out and make Aladdin's wishes come true. Even the obstacle is the evil Grand vizier Jafar (Marwan Kenzari), who wants to use the lamp to take the sultan's throne. The movie would surprise the fans from the beginning to the end, as its atmospheres are filled with humor, emotional moments and rhythmic songs, like the original movie, but by also adding new ideas to make the story original. Alan Menken who composed the old Aladdin movie version's score, is also the composer of new movie version's score which expresses the emotions and the atmospheres through new musical notes. The songs A Whole New World, Arabian Nights, Prince Ali, One Jump Ahead and Friend Like Me, have all the emotions and the amusements, to make the fans relive the nostalgia of the original Aladdin story. These songs use also a new musical style, to make them rhythmic through the pop genre. But in the same way, the movie introduces the new song called Speechless, which was elaborated to be powerful, by describing all the emotions of Jasmine, in the specific dramatic moments. Will Smith was excellent as the Genie, a funny and powerful character with great energy. In the course of the story, the Genie would make the fans laugh, through funny gags and unexpected amusing moments. But the Genie is also a tragic character, who is so powerful to not have freedom, as he has to obey the wishes of the masters, while he lives in the little space of the lamp. In the course of the story, the Genie would also become a friend and a mentor of Aladdin, as he teaches the young man to be himself. Mena Massoud did a really good performance as Aladdin, who is a kindhearted thief to live in the poor condition. The only friend Aladdin has is the monkey Abu, until he would meet the Genie as their friendship becomes special. Once Aladdin becomes a prince, thanks to one of the wishes he expressed, he would learn to be honest for who he is and not pretending to be an illusion. Naomi Scott was extraordinary as princess Jasmine, a strong character who does not want to be treated like she has to be silenced. Especially when some important decisions, has to be taken for the good of Agrabah. The relationship between Aladdin and Jasmine, is one of the most important parts of the story. To see how their bond would be close with each other, through a special connection to love each other. Marwan Kenzari did a really good performance as Jafar, a villain who was in once a poor thief like Aladdin. Until Jafar found a way to become the Grand Vizier of the sultan, he would do anything to get the magic lamp and take the sultan's throne without let anybody to block his evil way. Nasim Pedrad did a well done performance as Dalia, a loyal princess' handmaiden who takes care Jasmine, as well as she would be very supportive to the princess. Dalia would fall in love with the Genie, as their relationship becomes very special in the course of the story. Will Smith, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott were also excellent singers of the songs, by making the musical notes unforgettable to catch audience attention. The movie's choreography was musically elaborated, to maintain the choreographers' rhythm in every beats of the songs. The special effects were elaborated in every details, by making the vision of the story spectacular and visceral for the audience's eyes. The costume design and the set design were constructed, to let the audience feel to be inside of the movie. Also thanks to the story's colors and the lightenings, which help to capture the audience attention in every angle shots. The screenplay of the movie was elaborated to tell the story, from the beginning to end in the adventurous way with an energetic rhythm. It would also make clear how the characters would act, from the beginning to the end by taking important decisions. The editing helps to build the movie's narration, by letting the audience feel the adventure of the story, without ruining the narration's rhythm. Aladdin is one of the best Disney's live action movies, filled with emotional moments, humor and rhythmic songs, also one of the best Guy Ritchie's movies."

"ThomasDrufke","7","1","4","2 June 2019"," Not the Train Wreck Everyone Thought it Would Be
","I was beyond skeptical when they announced Guy Ritchie to be the director to helm the live-action version of the beloved 'Aladdin', and I became even more worried after seeing King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Not that that movie is a trainwreck, but I failed to see how Ritchie could inject his style into a kids movie. The answer being that he doesn't, he stays true to what made the original Aladdin a phenomena and adjusts certain plot elements that needed to be adjusted. For instance, Jafar doesn't need to be old man pining over a young Princess Jasmine. And you can't really copy what Robin Williams did as Genie, so you take Will Smith and breathe his charisma and charm into a new Genie, which feels even more modern than what Williams did. Not better, but still very good. The movie had an uphill climb to make from the moment it was announced, but I think it did about as well as it could have. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott are stars in the making (while admittedly it took me a few scenes to warm up to these characters), who did wonders with the roles of Aladdin & Jasmine respectively. It's worth it for 'A Whole New World' alone.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Seb-Farmer","10","1","4","2 June 2019"," Will Smith Took the Movie
","This was a very good live action version of Aladdin. I thought it would be extremely hard to fill Robin Williams shoes. But Will Smith did a fantastic job. He was able to not only do a great job but he was able to make the charector his own. I have always been a Will Smith fan. But he was amazing in this movie.
My wife and I saw the animated Aladdin when it was first released on our second date, so it was a wonderful oportunity to see it in live action.
They were able to make the movie a whole new movie for a whole new world. They had new songs and new plots. The charectors did a wonderful job. They were able to make Jasmine seem stong but yet not over powering. She was a good roll model for my girls.
That is why I gave this movie 10 stars because I felt they were able to do a good job of recreating the movie, knowing that people would probably campare it to the animated version. But it was just as good only different. It was well worth the money."

Will Smith as a genie, was great. You will see a lot of Smith's acting style from the French Prince of Belair, but is ok and you can see that there is a lot of improvisation that is acceptable in acting. The movie is very entertaining. The woman that played Jazmine is great and she did a good job. I will agree that some actors were miscasted but their acting did not take anything away from the movie.
The musical remembered me Bollywood and my son loved it. As a traveler, seeing so much diversity in this movie was great. It pictured the population type of the era, according to archeologists.
In general, the movie is a fresh movie with a lot of additions that are awesome to watch. Kids will love it. In my theater there were kids clapping. At the end of the movie, actors are dancing and singing. Few kids in my theater were dancing too. I simply love it."

","While not as great as the original (though most remakes aren't) This Film doesn't reach the heights of ""The Jungle Book (2016)"" but doesn't stoop to lows of ""Beauty and the Beast (2017)."" What I mean by this is while those films either tried something completely new or attempted to ""Replace the original"" (looking at you Beauty and the Beast) this film knows why it's here and you'll have a fun time watching it. Will Smith and Naomi Scott deliver great performances in there respective roles, with Mena Massoud proving to be a good Aladdin as well, and while the actors are okay, the performances of the Sultan and Jafar are just off due to the specific choices made with the writing and direction. The story is very much the same with a few tweaks here and there. All in all the film is a fun time, albeit nothing groundbreaking, but it's enjoyable for the family and gives you the nostalgia for the original without coming across as a replacement (Cough Beauty and the Beast Cough) the film knows it's a cash grab, but it's worth the money."

you make a remake.

","Aladdin is a great film. Also it's original predecessor is great as well. But why is Cave of Wonders so unoriginal? The Mouth doesn't even move when it talks. The cave itself looks so Minuscule.

Honestly, I am surprised that they couldn't do justice when Jafar was a sorcerer. I mean original was right on point with the fight scenes. I know Disney could do better than that. I miss Iago being sarcastic and loud.<br/><br/>The songs are truly amazing and brings back wonderful childhood memories. Will Smith made it original. Such as Arabian Nights, Friend Like Me, and Prince Ali. Job well done. Naomi Scott's Speechless song truly left me speechless. Very awesome song.<br/><br/>A Whole New World was great song, but visually it didn't felt real. Truly you can tell it is Green screen and them fake flying it through the night sky.<br/><br/>My apologies for the nitpicking. I love the original Aladdin. This movie was great too.

"tesnitaylor","6","1","4","31 May 2019"," So many moments hit, so many missed
","First off, I enjoyed this film. It's 100% worth it for anyone who loves the original and kids will be entertained.
BUT, the gimmicks are hit or miss. Some of the callbacks to the original are perfection, some just fall flat, and some are unnatural to this movie. For example, Raja roaring at the Prince is perfect, most of Friend Like Me fell flat, and Iago being pulled into the lamp felt unnatural. I would have honesty preferred a non-musical simply because the original is so iconic, and the Genie so much Robin Williams, the songs mostly don't feel right. Don't get me wrong, Will Smith is wonderful! I deeply enjoyed the parts that he made his own and the parts that were written for him. But most of what was called back to Robin just don't work for this Genie. The characterization they gave Genie is wonderful as well! I like that he has a story all his own now.
Carpet is still a mcguffin, but with less personality. Raja and Iago too, Raja being more realistic and Iago being Jafar's trained pet as opposed to a sentient being. The final battle could have been so much better. We know the outcome, you have to wow us with the path. The studio didn't do that.
It's watchable, it's sentimental, it's enjoyable. I had hoped it was spectacular..."

","It's the best version of Aladdin I've ever seen in a long time. I give it two thumbs up."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","4","30 May 2019"," The Fresh Prince of Aba Boua...
","Maybe the story of Aladdin and the Magic Lamp occupies such a warm spot in my heart than any version is likely to hit a sensitive chord at some place or another.<br/><br/>I grew up with the rather unknown French animated film of 1969, a stable in my connection with the story that made me enjoy the 1992 Disney version even more, and I guess that's the way it works and maybe the reason why this ""remaking"" trend is a sure bet for Disney studios: they work on a Madeleine Proust level. I was with my daughter and I saw many parents in the theater who were my age and were obviously the same age than their children when they saw ""Aladdin"", so for them, as well as for myself, it's a sort of renaissance (a word that used to mean something else) and for kids, it's a fun movie they'll enjoy regardless of their knowledge of the original. Yeah, we can call it a win-win effect.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie shows enough respect to the original film as if the consensus existed that nothing will replace Robin Williams' performance but it treats the material with enough special effects and costumes (obviously an Oscar contender in that category) to make for spectacular entertainment, though the singing moments proved that there's a limit to the level of extravaganza you can reach... not with special effects but with live-action looking CGI images. No matter how cute Abu is, you can't make an animal look as expressive as its cartoon version, the example of Iago is even more baffling, this parrot isn't Iago and is an insult to Iago. So that's the real problem with these remakes, the mix of computer-aided animation and live-action can create spectacular results but sometimes, it feels limited.<br/><br/>The ""Prince Ali"" and ""A Friend Like Me""... in fact, even the ""Whole New World"" singing sequences, anticipated from the minute the Genie popped up, weren't disappointing but fell flat because they could never go as over-the-top as the laws of hand-drawn animation permitted... because you just can't handle real-life characters like animated props. Mena Massoud, the actor who plays Aladdin is terrific as far his looks and his smile go (and his acting is decent) but once he starts to act like an animated character, the sight is just puzzling to say the least. This is why I actually preferred Marwan Kenzari as Jafar because he maintained a sense of self-respect even within his aura of vileness, which made him credible and oddly sexy. Even the sultan was good and wasn't treated like the buffoon of the 1992 film.<br/><br/>But I guess it all comes down to one performance: Will Smith, you couldn't replace Robin Williams but Smith proves that he's an actor Hollywood should rely on when they need a funny street-smart acolyte with a soul, that's important. There were times where he even managed to be more compelling than the original because his zaniness wasn't overplayed and because he had the features of a human being. Will Smith made the live-action more effective than the original at some parts, too few unfortunately because (and that's something I could see coming), the remake had to give a more substantial role to Jasmin, who was a strong-willed character to begin with. Indeed, the twists on the Genie were so well-thought and effective that we didn't need to have a rewriting on Jasmin.<br/><br/>The 'revisions' on Jasmin didn't affect her character anyway and Naomi Scott did justice to the first animated character I had a crush on, but it was like her pose was constantly defined under the tagline ""I'm an independent girl and no one can't fool me"" making her servant Dalia (Nasim Pedrad) more attractive through her imperfections. So I wish the film wouldn't get so overboard with Jasmin, there's a moment where she's literally pulling a 'Let it Go' and it's like the writing was so sensitive about not offending the status of Jasmin as a strong princess, especially in the one story where the princess' status is a plot point rather than a set-up, that any conspiracy theorist would believe that the sole purpose of these remakes is to serve some feminist agenda.<br/><br/>But you know what, I don't care if it's true or not, I won't pollute the review with such thoughts, I just watched yesterday a documentary about the hellish life in ISIS-occupied territories so it would be indecent to comment on the way 'women's right of speech' can be promoted in movies, no matter how unsubtly. Maybe there's ""good propaganda"" after all. And I'd rather have Arabs or Muslims be associated to the colorful though stereotypical images conveyed by these '1001 Nights' fantasy movies than any Middle-East black-clad reality, maybe there's also ""good stereotyping"" after all. And it's worth mentioning that Disney did the right choices by casting ethnic actors for the part, even though they were not names, Will Smith is big enough a name to carry the film, he's the Genie of the casting after all.<br/><br/>""Aladdin"" surprised me in the way it didn't make me complain about political correctness and could make an entertainment spectacle out of a captivating story, one that delivers a powerful message to children and adults, more sophisticated than the usual ""be yourself"", it's ""whatever you get by not being yourself, you'll lose inevitably""... with an underlying truth about the vain obsession of not being true to ourselves.
I called Ritchie a sell-out because, unlike Tarantino, he's not exactly making the kind of movies he was known for, but these considerations don't really matter as, the film didn't try to be something other than ""another of these lousy remakes"", but within that limited range of creativity, it succeeded admirably and it was fun to watch, it hit a nostalgic chord and it had the right cast.<br/><br/>At least, these three wishes were fulfilled."

","I am a huge Disney fan, and have always loved this story. I feel they did a really good job. Most of the characters were cast well, except Jafar wasn't quite menacing enough, and I feel the Sultan was very solemn. The musical sequences were done well, and the singing was excellent. Will Smith was a very good Genie. I didn't care for Jasmine's solo song, it seemed forced and didn't go with the vibe of the other songs. Also, and I know it's Guy Ritchie's style, but some of the movements of the characters during dance and action sequences seemed unnecessarily CGI enhanced. Overall, I recommend!"

"jadepietro","5","1","4","29 May 2019"," A Re-imagining of a Disney Classic Without Much Imagination
","GRADE: C<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Despite nice visuals, this movie is a lame retelling that is misdirected and generally miscast.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: In 1992, a smart little animated musical called Aladdin brought forth its magic in the form of a wise-cracking blue genie, played by the late great Robin Williams and a wonderful original musical score by the team of Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, and Tim Rice. Today, the Disney Studios rest comfortably on their previous laurels and have raided their vault to resurrect their former artistic treasures yet once again. Forsaking their hand-drawn animated talents, the filmmakers re-envisioned this timeless story to become a live action / CGI adventure fantasy, more in tune with today's modern audience with shorter attention spans and insatiable action demands. (This practice seems to a repeated pattern of late, with wildly mixed results: works like The Jungle Book and Cinderella meshed quite nicely, others like 101 Dalmatians, Beauty and the Beast, and the recent Dumbo paled by comparison.)<br/><br/>So where does this latest effort rank among all these sequels? It takes the middle ground in so many ways...entertaining but innocuous enough, a big budget production full of color and splash but lacking in grandeur and cleverness. Aladdin (2019) is re-imagining without much imagination.<br/><br/>The film essentially follows the same storyline as Aladdin (Mena Massoud), that poor lovable thief, falls in love with his princess, Jasmine (Naomi Scott). Yet, the movie sacrifices the joyous bounce of a musical for more serious action and silly thrills. Unlike its predecessor, the film is devoid of comedy and delivers only a few musical interludes.The disjointed screenplay by John August and Guy Ritchie disappoints with its lack of wit, humor, and emotion. Where is the fun, let alone, the magic?<br/><br/>Mr. Ritchie is a good director of action films, but his scope is limited with musical genres.He is certainly the wrong directing choice for any musical and is more concerned with kinetic quick cuts and non-stop action set pieces. He stages his movie with a flurry of chases and continually downplays most of the musical numbers as mere throwaways. Mr. Ritchie stresses the fancy CGI visuals and paces his movie with complete disregard for the basic elements of a movie musical. Singing and dancing are almost non-existent as filmed. (There is a nice Bollywood feel midway through the movie that hints of what could have been achieved in other hands.) The choreography looks interesting, but is wasted. So much is photographed from the waist up or edited in such a frenzy that one misses the footwork completely. The voices are uniformly weak, except for Ms. Scott. In fact, the film is seriously miscast in most roles.<br/><br/>As the title character, Mr. Massoud is bland but serviceable. Will Smith plays the genie with too much hip hop flair and not much fun. He comes off as a glib imitation, never coming near the genius of Mr. William's comic riffs. Mr. Smith's patter of jokes rarely land, but at least, he is personable. His character is more of a street-wise Fresh Prince variety than Arabian prince. As the villainous Jafar, Marwan Kenzari is one note, although he never sings one note. The actor provides the menace as if he was cast in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, or worst yet, any of The Mummy movies. His character is performed with too much evil and nary an ounce of glee, without any trance of campy wickedness. It is only a very fine Ms. Scott who remains untouched by this overproduced and underwhelming spectacle. The less said about an embarrassingly bad supporting performance by Billy Magnussen, the better.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of the film is the CGI. The visuals are extremely well done. In fact, the CGI animal creations: Rajah the Tiger, Iago the Parrot, and especially Abu the Monkey outact their human cast-mates. The Homo sapiens should have taken some acting tips from them. While no animals were hurt in the making of this film, most humans mangled their roles.<br/><br/>Blame must go to Mr. Ritchie for his misguided direction and the Disney Studios for green-lighting his action-themed concept. Moviegoers deserved a whole new movie version other than this sequel. This musical mishmash is far from shining, shimmering, and splendid."
"geramicaw","10","1","4","29 May 2019"," Better then I thought
","Aladdin and Lion King are the only Disney movies I loved. And thanks for the remake Will Smith did an amazing job"
"KirkFogg","6","1","4","29 May 2019"," It's what Disney has set us up to expect.
","Ever since Disney first announced they were releasing live action versions of their movies, I was excited for this Aladdin. After all, I was raised on the three cartoon movies and Robin Williams' classic Genie. To go off on a tangent for a moment, Beauty and the Beast is my favorite movie from Disney's second Golden Age of animation, but the live action movie was pretty rough. Aladdin made some of the same mistakes that Beauty and the Beast made. That is to say, choosing a big named actor that can't really sing well and drowning them with auto-tune rather than casting actual singers in a musical. In a world with eight billion people, and coming from an acting background, I can say with 100% certainty that there are amazing actors/singers out there by the truck load. Yet, we still had to suffer through a robotic Emma Watson trudging through ""Something There."" Now, in the same vein, we have Will Smith trying his damndest to give the Genie a fresh (prince) new take on his songs, but they fall flat and in many places made me physically cringe. That said, Will Smith still provides a lot of laughs and I found myself liking him more and more as the movie went on. To be fair, though, I've always been a fan. Aladdin himself was largely auto-tuned as well, and not a great actor. Jasmine definitely stood out as an actor, and was the best singer as well. The special effects widely varied from strange looking and odd to dazzling and incredible depending on which scene or song you were taking part in. It's hard to describe, but at certain points the speed of the actors varied, like they were sped up in some parts to better match their lips with the music? I think you'll notice it when you see it. Many parts of the movie felt and looked more like a really well done YouTube video than a multi-million dollar Disney summer blockbuster. The additional songs sung by Jasmine about female empowerment, though not my favorite musically, send a good message and seemed to resonate with some of the more vocal kids in the audience. All in all it's not a masterpiece, but I had a good time and will likely watch it again at some point."
"lr_romero6","9","1","4","29 May 2019"," Spectacular !
","Wow. I loved it. It has all the Disney magic, fun, charm, music, and visuals.<br/><br/>Although Will Smith as genie is not as good as Robin Williams, he does a terrific job. Very comical and great acting.<br/><br/>The movie gives a little twist that did not see coming in the end and I enjoyed it. Aladdin and Jasmine have such a lovely chemistry!<br/><br/>The music is amazing. The new original song Speechless gave me chills as well as A Whole New World."
"Kumarh02","8","1","4","28 May 2019"," Fresh Prince of Agra bah!
","Guy Ritchie did better than I expected and this was far better than 2017's B&TB. However, I think Will Smith let the movie down massively and if nothing else, highlighted Robin Williams original performance as a cinematic gem. A lot of the key scenes where you expect more energy and emotion were muted and rushed through, which ultimately took the shine off the overall movie. I.e. remember RW's genies reaction to being set free and then realising how much of a sacrifice Aladdin had made? - you hardly get any of that tugging at the heart strings OR, his anguish when he had to grant Jafar's wishes and see Aladdin suffering. Appreciate WS wanted to put his own spin on the role but clearly he failed in the moments that required some basic acting. Jafar was also miscast, Oscar Isaac, or someone similar with sharper features would have worn the treasonous villain part better. The two leads both glowed though and the chemistry was there, a heartwarming performance respectively. Big will, you didn't deliver this time and Guy, you should have noticed the lack of animation from the genie AND the lack of emotion in key scenes. Overall, it's good but shame, for the sake of a few lazy oversights, it could have been perfect."

"Darwinskid","Null","1","4","27 May 2019"," Will Smith Saves an Otherwise Dull Reimagining of a Classic
","Firstly, neither Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or Mulan should be remade. None of them are even over 30 years old and are still fresh in the majority of the movie going public's eye, and are constantly re-released on home video with brand new special editions and are almost always played on television. It was a bit different with your Alice in Wonderland, Maleficent, Cinderella, and Jungle Book because they were much older and not as fresh in the eyes of the mainstream so a reimagining of any of those seemed expected to happen sooner than later. With Aladdin one is left with a raised eye brow pondering its need to exist because what could you really do to expand upon or redo what was already done well to fine in the 1992 original animation? Having seen it these questions still persist as there is really nothing on display that improves upon the content of the original or does it do anything creatively new and exciting that would make one want to revisit it as opposed to its original. The characters lack the charm of their original counterparts, the scope feels fairly condensed to where obvious sets are obvious and the bulk of the action is kept in mostly one spot because of obvious budgetary reasons(odd given how much was invested into its production), the musical numbers do not feel organic to the story and often come across as very forced in, and the cinematography comes across so amateurish you're left to wonder where all the money was spent.<br/><br/>I suppose after The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and King Arthur Guy Ritchie really just needed a hit and decided to play it very safe, unfortunately he enters territories he is not well versed in such as directing orchestrated musical and dance. There are only one or two spots in the movie which feel truly like Guy Ritchie was behind the camera, but everywhere else feels like it could've been easily been someone whose biggest credit in their career was random filler episode of any season of television for The CW or Freeform. The inclusion of political mumbo jumbo to be more 'relevant' with today's cinemagoers are but more forced additions into the narrative that will date it sooner than later and cause many to eye roll in the theater.<br/><br/>The best aspect of this production is Will Smith as the Genie, he steals the show completely in every scene he is in and is doing his best to make the musical lyrics pop and energize the atmosphere. It was going to be pretty hard to step into the late great Robin Williams' shoes but Will Smith did a fine job with his take on the iconic character.<br/><br/>See it if you must, but otherwise stick to the original - its not going anywhere."

2019
PG
director:Guy Ritchie
starring:Mena Massoud,Naomi Scott,Will Smith,Marwan Kenzari,Navid Neghaban,Nasim Pedrad etc<br/><br/>
overall rating 94/100<br/><br/>Aladdin was fantastic and one of Disney's best live actions lets talk about why this is.<br/><br/>Lets start of with the fantastic musical numbers. All the songs from the original were done brilliantly and were on a much larger more enjoyable scale, it bought back so much nostalgia from the 1992 classic and none of the songs were done badly. All the cast had great voices that added to the enjoyment of the songs and also the new songs that were added into the film worked really well as well. Especially Jasmines new song which was actually very powerful and had great female empowerment messages that really added to her character arc.<br/><br/>Next the film was actually very funny and achieved a very good comedic tone throughout. this was for 3 main reasons.
Firstly abu just like the original was very funny as Aladdins pet monkey, The CGI on Abu was impressive and the acting of the monkey was fairly realistic so therefore when the monkey was messing around and being funny it connected with the audience. Next is Jamsines handmaid Dalia, she had many funny moments including Will smiths genie, They had natural chemistry and Dalia was hilarious with how forward thinking and bubbly she was so she was a fun new character to add into the film. And finally the most funny parts of the film had to come from Will Smiths genie and Mena Massouds Aladdin. These two had so much great on screen comedic chemistry they were the glue that kept this film together as well as other aspects. The most funny scene in the film had to be when Aladdin first met Jasmine being Prince Ali.<br/><br/>Next i would like to add that all 3 lead actors Naomi Scott,Mena Massoud and Will Smith did a fantastic job with all 3 of there iconic characters. I was unsure of Mena Massoud playing Aladdin at first but i have to say he knocked it out of the park he looked like Aladdin and he had the same charm and cheekiness of the original character as well as having a good singing voice as well. Naomi scott also did a fantastic job as Jasmine adding to her independence and strength as a character she was fantastic here. And finally Will smith was absolutely fantastic as the genie. He in my opinion was the best part of the film. He had so much charm and charisma throughout this film, he was as we expect from the genie charming funny and charismatic. Will smith also made the character into his own instead of trying to imitate Robin williams iconic version of Genie which i loved and he was great in both Genie form which i have to say did have fairly bad CGI for his character considering its 180M budget but you got used to it after a while.<br/><br/>Next the film had fantastic visuals. The set designs for agrabah and everything inside were so beautiful and interesting to look at the film would of still been good without as much dialogue it really made you feel part of there world ( no pun intended)<br/><br/>I also loved the further detail they added to the plot of the movie and its character arcs. I enjoyed Aladdins and jasmines backstories about losing there parents and feeling trapped. And i also loved that they gave the genie his own character arc as well as when he was set free he started a family with Dalia. But my favourite part of the new content added would have to be Jasmines character arc, like the original jasmine was a very strong independent character. But here she competed to be heard amongst powerful men and her becoming the sultan actually made sense and was a lot of fun to watch her rise to power.<br/><br/>However just a little thing about the plot i felt like the whole team behind this presumed everyone who would watch this film already knew the plot. As they rushed through some key plot points from the original this was not an issue for me and a most probably a large majority of the audience, but for some casual fans of the source material or new fans this might of been confusing or frustrating.<br/><br/>my next point is not really a negative but a slight constructive criticism. I actually thought that Marwen Kenzari did a good job at playing jafar. Despite him being fairly useless in the first half of the film he made up for it in the 2nd half, He was just so dislikable and evil with his actions which were more harsh and cruel then the original. I just thought he could of looked slightly more menacing and intimidating like the original but this did not bother me that much due to his strong performance.<br/><br/>Next i thought this film was actually very romantic, and as seen with its opening weekend numbers i think its also attracted some couples to its audience. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott had a lot of romantic chemistry in this film, and it really made you feel for there characters and made the experience of them falling in love very sweet and enjoyable to watch.
I also loved that the film incorporated a more arabian tone and atmosphere to the original. This was done through things like bollywood dancing and more extravagant colour pallets, so i really loved that they went deeper into the roots of the Aladdin story.<br/><br/>And finally the film had excellent ideologies and themes. There was many incredible messages such as being yourself and finding your own voice by rising above the people who think they have power over you. I really enjoyed these ideologies that they conveyed to the audience and this was something slightly different from disney which i am not complaining about at all.<br/><br/>Overall Aladdin was another massive success for disney turning into one of my favourite live action remakes and achieving something rare by being as good as the animated classic."

I'm fact, the movie so great, I'm going to see it again and again, in short the movie is for keeps, another classic!"

"slayer_luke","10","1","4","24 May 2019"," Amazing, yes really and here's why:
","I could write an entire specific review about every little detail in the movie that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Let me remind you that a movie is not made to perfection for the critics to review it.
A movie is made for the audience who is mostly just a regular non professional movie reviewer.
The main goal of a movie is to touch the viewer in any kind of way.<br/><br/>Don't take the ""professional"" critics too serious, they can't judge if you will like it or not. Everyone is different and have their own perspective.<br/><br/>Just watch this movie, calm down, let it come to you, don't think too much and enjoy.<br/><br/>The movie is fun, the music is good, the acting is good, the special effects are good.
Everything in the movie is good. It's a little different from how you remember the animated movie from 1992, but they really did a wonderful job.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

"nuha-28336","10","1","4","24 May 2019"," A real magic carpet ride!!!
","This movie was literally amazing, I'm beyond chocked at how many have given it a bad review claiming it to be boring and bad. I'm sorry but those people have watched this movie with a biased opinion from the beginning not giving the movie the shot it deserved. The original movie is obviously fantastic but it's okay to love the live action movie there is no need to think that you have to keep a certain loyalty to the original movie.
If you are a fan of Aladdin you will certainly relieve your childhood and experience a sense of sentimentality watching this movie. All the songs were done justice and the addition of the new song ""Speechless"" was incredibly powerful and emotional. There was not one boring moment in this movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the comedy as it didn't feel forced or out of place. The chemistry between the actors, especially Mena, Naomi and Will was so incredible to the point of making me convinced that they were the actual characters. This movie really was like going on a magic carpet ride.
I defiantly do recommend watching this movie
It's okay to not like it but please at least watch it with an open mind! :)"

"JoJotheJoseph","3","1","5","9 January 2020"," Worst Disney Live Action Remake So Far
","3.0 - Headache-inducing movies I regretted sitting through<br/><br/>Honestly I generally do not have prejudice against live action remakes - sure, most of them are heartless cash-grabs devoid of any creativity, but many could be entertaining and frankly, nostalgia sells. Yet Aladdin was the single most excruciating movie experience I had in quite some time.<br/><br/>First, lets get the positives away - Will Smith, playing Will Smith the Genie, was fine. He was fun and goofy and quintessentially Will Smith. The general plot, which was literally the same with the original, is simplistic but okay.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with the movie was cinematography. It was surprising even to me because most of the times you don't notice it, but this one gave me a legit migraine. The color correction was off - the entire movies oscillates from pitch black to grey-ish, completely losing the fantastical boom of colors in the original. The shots were forgettable and a bit awkward. The editing - oh the editing - was torturous. I had a visceral reaction to the chase scene at the beginning because of the frequent cut from different directions, I almost puked.<br/><br/>The reaction was physical. Granted, I do sometimes suffer from motion sickness but this is the first time a movie induced it.<br/><br/>Other aspects did nothing to save the movie. The characters, except for Aladdin and Will Smith, lack development and were way too cartoon-ish (duh!) for live action. The singing was grossly auto-tuned and a bit thin on the vocals and the accompanying visuals were lacking in grandeur. The classic songs were copied but worse. The newly added one was way too obvious and out-of-place stylistically and substantively. The costumes looked like they were Halloween costumes fresh off Amazon - srsly wtf was Jasmine wearing I cannot deal with those BDSM strap-y things on her waste. The sidekick animals were reduced to plot-devices with zero character.<br/><br/>All in all, I wish I hadn't ventured beyond the Will Smith clips on YouTube."

","A year of good films... OH NO NOT WILL SMITH! So in this film we get an utterly disturbing blue and unfunny character called... Blue Will Smith, that's it. We don't touch the originals, OK? I think we've all learned by now, The Cat in the Hat was better left alone, Pet Semetary was better left alone,The Lorax was better left alone. Thankfully, Guy Ritchie redeemed himself with The Gentlemen (Matthew McConaughey) this film tries to be funny but ends up being scary, I can't get the image of a blue Will Smith out of my head.

","This things is gone too far, too hype. I watch this because most of my friend watch this and told on Instagram story it was that good, they also said that they could watch it multiple times!<br/><br/>Last day, before I watch it, I do watch the trailer first and see what people said on the trailer. Really, they made me to expect that film is really good.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the movie. The story is good, really. Even some cliche plot is there, but it's ok. It doesn't distract me very much.<br/><br/>Is it supposed to be musical? I don't get any those music hit me. I'm not going to compare this to other movie, like how when I watch la la land or greatest showman, I always try to forget all the movies I watch before, so I could never expecting any every time I watch movie.<br/><br/>But really, without expecting anything, the musical still give me some disappointment. No, the problem is not on the music, the music is really great, but not on the visual. When aladdin met the genie, they really lost their charisma. Their act doesn't come naturally. This is also happen when aladdin on the magic carpet with yasmin. They loose their charisma.<br/><br/>The editing/CGI for the night sky, doesn't done well. Also when aladdin and yasmin ride the magic carpet. Does it make the film become bad? I don't think so, but it's losing the emotional feeling of the musical. And if it supposed to be a musical movie, for sure the loosing the emotional feeling of the musical makes the film become bad. Plus, those cliche."

","As being born a year before the original came out, it was one of my favorites growing up. When I heard the new version was being released I was beyond excited to see how it's brought to life and I was NOT disappointed! Will Smith as the Genie brought such a new light to the character while still giving you glimpses of the Genie Robin Williams created for us years ago, so that was so nice to see. The cinematography was beautiful and seeing shots of the entire palace gave you a feeling of nostalgia and also wishing you were there. It was just so so beautifully created. And the comedy! It was SO funny!! Take my word -- go into this with less of a comparison mind and have an open one. It's a beautiful, fun, comical new take on an old classic. You won't regret it."

","It still remains a show for children and adults. The disappointment was the lack of Arab representation as the Genie is Will Smith which is not Arabian obviously as well as the princess being Indian. Much black representation and politics for a movie about an Arabian tale. It shows the value of truth paramount in all and somehow things work out magically when you abide by truth."

I may say, i have a feeling if this movie will not going ""so well"". But, i was very wrong. Massoud and Scott bringing Aladdin's 1992 version become a better version. And their voice, unbelievable. A Whole New World in the better version. Thanks to Alan Menken. His scoring was never dissapoint me. And... When Jasmine sang Speechless, i got a goosebump. I loved their actings too. It was really good, especially Will Smith. He is funny and he could bringing the joy into this movie. The one i was concern is about the CGI. It was good, but in some part, i felt that the CGI was still very rough (especially the scene of Rajah - Jasmine's tiger). But overall, Aladdin 2019 was so emotional (i cried and laughed a lot) and i enjoyed this movie very well. Thank you Disney!"

The decision to allow Aladdin stray from being a noble character at certain points compels me to appreciate him more than just a pretty face who happens to save the day. Mena Massoud plays Aladdin with a charisma and just enough vulnerability. Will Smith as the genie owns this character with all class and culture. His comedy and drama and genie-genius come shining through. Finally, Naomi Scott as Jasmine blows me away. The introduction of her desire to be rule and stand up to Jafar is completely believable. I was not ready to like this as much as I did. Disney and Guy Ritchie did an excellent job."

","The original Aladdin movie was my favourite Disney movie of all time, so naturally I was skeptical going to see the live-action remake (not usually a fan of live-action remakes). I was pleasantly surprised! Loved this movie. I even saw it at the cinema twice and am honestly surprised at how mixed the reviews for it are - Will Smith does well as the genie and puts his own spin on the legendary character, Yasmine sings beautifully and feels like a stronger character, Aladdin himself was charming and likeable. The costumes were stunning and I liked the new elements they added to the songs. A Whole New World was beautiful.<br/><br/>I have no complaints other than the depiction of Jafar. The actor was fine and tried his best, but his voice and face just did not have that iconic ""evil"" feel of the original Jafar. Iago also felt under-utilised. That said, overall, I enjoyed this movie just as much as the cartoon! Judging from the clapping in the cinema during the credit scene I wasn't the only one who did, either."

","Aladdin, a street urchin, uses a magic oil lamp to unleash a powerful larger than life genie to makes his dreams come true and fall I love with the beautiful daughter of the sultan of Agrabah.<br/><br/>A surprisingly colourful fantastic adaptation by John August and director Guy Ritchie. Excellent effects, staging and songs etc the whole production is magical, exceeding expectations.<br/><br/>All the cast are on form, the casting is exceptional. Will Smith gives an enjoyable energetic and restrained performance as the Genie. The trailer didn't do him justice. With a great singing voice and screen presence Mena Massoud takes all the best cues from his cartoon feature counterpart and offers a likeable and memorable Aladdin. Tweaked for the better by August and Ritchie actor Naomi Scott lifts the Princess Jasmine character even more, while also giving her a social and political subtext.<br/><br/>Although a good performance, Marwan Kenzari's Jafar has been reworked. August gives him and Aladdin a commonality but unfortunately it doesn't work as well as the cartoon stereotype villain did and sadly Alan Tudyk Iago suffers too. There's not much chemistry. This aside, Abu the monkey and the Magic Carpet are finely brought to life and are just as much fun as their animated incarnations. The dance numbers are fun and wonderful choreographed.<br/><br/>Children and adults of all ages can enjoy. Thankfully, Disney have chosen the live action route and not horrid a CGI animated feature affair.<br/><br/>While nothing can compare to the animated version this is one of the best, if not thee best live adaptation of Disney's own outings to date."

","It's kinda unfair to wish this live action movie is exactly the same with the original animated version. It's an adaptation and with a little bit surprising plotline, I enjoyed it very much. Mena Massoud is the real deal as Aladdin. Naomi Scott is strong as the new version of Jasmine. And Will Smith appears as a genie with brotherly character for Aladdin. Full of CGI? Of course. If we want to see Abu and Magic Carpet and the Cave of Wonder, prepare yourself for the world of CGI. My suggestion is simple. Watch this movie without comparing anything with the original one. Enjoy it."
"scb_coldsteel","7","1","5","26 May 2019"," A pretty fun, but uneventful ride down memory lane.
","So I saw the new Aladdin at the theater. Honestly my expectations were very high. Aladdin is my favorite Disney movie of all time. While I knew it couldn't live up to the animated classic, all I wanted was a fun ride out of the film. Overall it was a pretty average mixed bag of an experience.<br/><br/>I assume everyone knows the plot of Aladdin at this point. Largely the film remains untouched regarding the major plot points. Of course the film has altered a few small things and added around 30 minutes of content to the original script. Unfortunately I can't say those 30 minutes really added anything at all but length to the movie. There is a surprise fanservice story arc involving Jasmine that many will enjoy however.<br/><br/>The animation and production design of the movie were outstanding. In every way the film and its setting were gorgeous. The movie was bright and vibrant and sure to please children of all ages. The setting and costume design were also very well done and presented a diverse and fun look into a live-action Agrabah City and its inhabitants. The movie was pure eye candy from start to finish.<br/><br/>The musical elements of the film were mostly very well done. It's hard not to compare the song to their original counterparts, but the music was just as catchy as ever. I will say the original songs designed for the movie on the other hand were just very bland. There wasn't a single memorable new song in the film. That is a shame considering how many earworms the original Aladdin had.<br/><br/>Performance-wise I honestly have to say Will Smith stole the show. I was very hesitant initially about his casting. Robin Williams performance was just so memorable. Will Smith pays respect to Robin Williams performance, but definitely makes this his own interpretation of the genie. Most of the other performances were very okay. Nothing terrible, but no other performance really stood out. I will say Marwan Kenzari's interpretation of Jafar was just bad. It lacked any bit of menace and intrigue and just came across as whiny. It is also criminal to not have Gilbert Godfrey play the part of Iago.<br/><br/>Overall the biggest weakness of the film was finding a reason for it to exist. Sure it had its fun moments, but the best aspects of the film were direct copies of the cartoon. Why bother makeing a live action version if it's going to be a near shot-for-shot remake with extra unnecessary padding? I will add the 30 minutes of padding did nothing but slow down the film and add plot points just for fan service. The film was just far too long for the writing to carry. There is some also very cringe-worthy dialogue and humor throughout the movie. Of course kids will love those moments, but for a film based upon my childhood classic I expected more.<br/><br/>Aladdin was not a terrible movie. It wasn't a disaster like Dumbo. It was however a wasted opportunity. It just feels so bland and devoid of the classic Disney Magic. Sure the film had a few strengths, but there's nothing about this film that makes me want to re-watch it over and over again. The original content was bloated and slowed the film down, plus the new music was a bore. It held my entertainment and my two-year-old loved it, but it did not wow me at all. It did however make me want to watch the original Aladdin. A 6.75 out of 10."

","Well Adapted and entertaining.. bringing a new song and making it great for the family. Whether another oscar remains to be seen but story told brings a lot of hidden messages for those adults into that. Will did an awesome job of playing the Genie and doing his own take. Was unsure how Guy would direct this but he did justice to the story."

","Directed by Guy Ritchie, the same guy who gave us ""King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword"" (by the way, that Movie is really good and you should definitely watch it no matter what others say), now gives us a retelling Of Aladdin from the Animated Disney Movie. This Movie is also really good and it's a Nostalgic Dream Come True for those who had seen it on TV years ago. The Color panels of this Movie feel spot on, the Writing sticks to the Classic Disney Storyline, The Cinematography is great, the Visuals are spot on, the Music is also really nostalgic and great to listen to, and the voice acting is great.
All the voice actors do a magnificent job and Will Smith just steals the show as always. His role as the Genie sure will never be as good as Robin Williams and he was a more believable Genie, but Will Smith pays Homage in his role as the Genie. The other voice actors also give it their best... unfortunately, Disney could've chosen a better person to play Jafar. Jafar in this Movie sounds like a Brat who needs power just to act all cool, while Cartoon Jafar is more lively, cooler, intimidating, and twice as more believable than the Live Action Version.
Overall, Aladdin (2019) is an entertaining watch, it's well-directed, the nostalgia is there and it's lively but NOT as lively as the Animated Version but it's still really good and it pays homage to the Classic Animated Movie And it's a million times better than the Dumbo Movie released about two months ago.
Go out and see This Movie if you haven't done so already, it's absolutely worth it."

"tm-sheehan","6","2","16","24 May 2019"," Aladdin or The Will Smith Show?
","My Review- Aladdin I rate 6.5<br/><br/>I really am a sucker for classic Disney films but I think this one like Beauty and the Beast and Dumbo to my mind miss the boat ,possibly because humanising animation classics or trying to bring them up to date adds nothing to the original.<br/><br/>It's a good cast Mena Massoud as Aladdin is engaging as the rascally Aladdin ,Naomi Scott is charming and feisty as Princess Jasmine and has a lovely voice .
Will Smith is very talented but at times the whole movie just seems to be the Will Smith show. Will is cast as The Genie and Mariner and just doesn't have the humour and brilliance of Robin Williams or his voice in the original animated classic.<br/><br/>Aladdin has already been humanised in the Broadway musical brilliantly but this is not a film of the musical,perhaps a pity they didn't make it one.<br/><br/>There are only 4 original songs from the musical and one good new song for Naomi Scott to belt out ""Speechless "" an anthem to transform Princess Jasmine into a modern woman of today ready to take on any man who tries to takes her power away ,which is a good role model for children watching the movie but alas I think they'd be bored by the time it arrives.<br/><br/>There are some very good scenes in Aladdin , like Aladdin's entrance into Agrabah,it's the best entrance into a city since Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra entered Rome and if it's the first time you've seen Aladdin there's lots to like but I hope this is the last version and I also hope and think the new humanised Lion King will be better.<br/><br/>I imagine when Studio executives sit around discussing these hopefully multi million dollar blockbuster remakes that the main requirements discussed are ,let's pour the cash in to get an A list Star and Director plus the latest CGI which I'm beginning to think stands for Costly Graphic Indigestion.<br/><br/>What ever happened to let's do something new and original
that hasn't been done to death before ,perhaps the last 2 or 3 poor box office performers from Disney may change their mind.
The most successful Disney revisit and not a remake lately has been Mary Poppins Returns,which cost USD 130,000,000to produce and so far World wide has grossed USD349,219,485 it out grossed Dumbo, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms ,which barely covered its production cost but I quite enjoyed for it's originality.<br/><br/>I look forward to Lion King with Avengers :Endgame director Jon Favreau and an amazing cast I hope I can give it a 9 or 10 rating."
"diabase","7","1","6","8 August 2019"," Aladdin in Bollywood
","Will Smith added his unique flair in this new to the role Robin Williams made his own, and as I mention in my title, this version was Bollywood influenced. It was nice to see a villain who didn't have that particular English accent common to Disney villains and with a little more back story. Other than a few variations to the story, its pretty much the same to before."

"persian-belle","10","1","6","6 June 2019"," Nice Step Toward the Eradication of Women's Oppression
","I should tell you that what I liked the most was that this new version empowers women, especially the Middle-Eastern ones, many of whom have started believing that they're second-class citizens and that they do not have a voice. Disney has come a long way from Ariel, who's willing to exchange her voice for a chance to be with a man.<br/><br/>I watched this film with my family. All of my friends, acquaintances and neighbours who watched it loved it. What's not to love? It's funny, colourful and entertaining. (Unfortunately I believe many of the negative reviews are not real.)<br/><br/>Some have argued about Indian or Arabian elements in this story. Aladdin's original story is one of many fairy tales of the book called ""One thousand and one nights"" to be later called (erroneously) Arabian Nights (because the Arabic translation of the book became popular).<br/><br/>The main character in the book, Scheherazade, is recounting tales to the Iranian (Persian) King Shahryar. At the time, Persia was a vast empire which included many lands on it's east and west, where many languages were spoken such as (mainly) Persian, Arabic, Hindi, Turkish etc. by many people of various cultures and races.<br/><br/>Aladdin's story, according to the original book, takes place in Persia (so this could be anywhere in this empire where many different people were bound to cross paths). Some versions have even depicted the princess (the name Jasmine is made up by Disney) as originally East Asian.<br/><br/>Political correctness aside, as an adult, a teacher and a mom, i really enjoyed this. As a woman, and as someone of Middle-Eastern origin, I enjoyed this even more. It gives more power to women than the original. I think as the comedian Maz Jobrani puts it, it's about time for the West to make a film in which you see Middle-Easterners smile, fall in love, dance and have fun, as opposed to the negative roles which are typically assigned to them in Hollywood films, stripping them of their humanity."

"eddie_baggins","6","1","7","26 May 2019"," No classic but a lot of fun
","First some context.<br/><br/>My expectations for Aladdin were about as low as they come.<br/><br/>So-so trailers, seemingly zero positive pre-release hype and a director whose sadly been out of form for time, the stars really did not seem to be aligning for Disney's latest live action treatment of a beloved property.<br/><br/>It's great to report then that against all the odds, Guy Ritchie's colourful, often energetic and sometimes brilliantly fun re-imagining of the classic Aladdin tale is more than watchable, certainly not great and not anywhere near as memorable as the classic Disney animation, but absolutely entertaining enough to justify a trip to the cinema.<br/><br/>Made for the whole family in mind, Ritchie's take on the age old tale sticks relatively close to the formula of the past with a few new additions (including an extra song for Princess Jasmine and some extended last act amendments) and while Ritchie's renowned visual flourishes and slick camera movements remain sadly mostly restrained, the renowned British filmmaker handles his first musical and family adventure with a typical confidence that ensures the buzzing sets, large-scale set-pieces and musical numbers will bring a smile to even the most hard to please of faces.<br/><br/>Another reason this new Aladdin remains surprisingly watchable is due to the casting of these beloved characters with newcomers Mena Massoud as street dweller turned prince Aladdin and Naomi Scott as Jasmine both doing fine work, even if Scott is the real MVP of the musical numbers over her co-star.<br/><br/>Both young performers share an easy going chemistry and charisma making their time on screen enjoyable, overshadowed however by the much-maligned Will Smith who silences the doubters with a great incarnation of our much loved blue Genie.<br/><br/>Derided thanks to some mediocre pre-release marketing, Smith is as fun as his been in years as the character made famous by the late Robin Williams with the now 50 year old star giving it his all. While not excelling in the singing department, Smith makes the Genie his own as he takes over the film around the half-way mark and his presence in the film goes a long way to making Ritchie's adventure yarn a simple to enjoy proposition.<br/><br/>While perfectly fun, its undeniable that Aladdin never truly soars and starts to peter out in the somewhat bloated second act that starts to lose the energetic vibe of the first half and the less said about lead villain Jafar (played rather poorly by Marwan Kenzari) the better, with it becoming rather disappointing such a bland and boring big bad was employed in the film when there was the chance for the scheming character to really chew up the scenery had it been done right.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Far from a classic new take on a beloved tale, Guy Ritchie's Aladdin is still a visual big screen delight that is a lot better than many had thought it possible to be, bought to life by some fun turns from its up and coming leads and an extremely fun Will Smith performance.<br/><br/>3 jars of jam out of 5"

The singing in the original was top notch, while most of this was mid-range Bollywood.<br/><br/>Casting was off a bit.

","I'm sorry, but I can start by saying the casting in this film sucks. The storyline follows the animated version, this is purely milking the film base for all it's worth. Following Robin Williams as Genie was never going to be easy, but Will Smith just acts like..... well.... Will Smith - with a sprinkling of Fresh Prince, you can see he is trying his best but simply the role needed a live wire; like William's portrayed. I could BMW but I'll just sound off and say they simply tried to hard and ruined a Disney classic. It's a movie we'll all soon forget."

","To start, I have to give Will Smith credit where credit is due. He had some VERY big shoes to fill even attempting to fill the role of the Genie after Robin Williams made it his own. Will added his own Fresh Prince flair to the character, and I felt that he was the highlight of the movie. With that being said, the rest of the movie was disappointing. Aladdin and Jasmine had no chemistry, and Jafar wasn't even scary, let alone menacing. Sorry Disney, this was an unnecessary remake."

"stani_cv","6","0","2","14 January 2020"," Disney sucks out the magic out of everything they remake
","This is the second Disney live-action remake I've seen after Beauty and the Beast and probably the last one. Just to be clear, the original Aladdin isn't among my top favourite Disney movies, but it was simple enough and had its charm in its simplicity and of course it had Robin Williams in it. Also, all the characters were unique and likeable in their own way. Overall, this remake gets very few good things from the original and sadly breaks a lot.
Where the remake succeeded:
+Will Smith was probably the most fun and enjoyable part of the whole movie. He managed to do a genie in his own way without trying to copy Robin Williams' from 1992. You can argue he was a bit too much himself, but I see nothing wrong with that.
+Mena Massound played a decent Aladdin. I'm guessing he could have done even better job if his character was written better, but sadly that was not the case.
+Some of the songs were a fresh addition considering the original didn't have that many.
+I also enjoyed the visuals especially watching it in 4K, even if CGI was too obvious at moments.
Where they missed the mark, but still remains watchable:
*Aladdin feels more like a Bollywood movie than anything else - from costumes to dances. I thought Agraba was in the Arabian Peninsula but apparently, they moved it to somewhere in South Asia.
* Naomi Scott, even though performing well, simply was not a good fit for playing Jasmine.
* The romance between the maid and the genie was completely unnecessary, distracting and quite forced. As a matter of fact her whole character was not needed and could have been left out.
* Iago was turned into just a dumb CGI bird and his screen time taken by the one mentioned above.
* Mena Massoud did a decent role at times, but the chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine wasn't really there. Didn't buy the whole flying carpet scene. The one in the 1992 version was much better.
* It feels much less like a children's movie compared to the original. While it may appear more to parents, certainly won't be the same with kids.<br/><br/>Where they failed badly:
*The actor portraying Jaffar was what almost ruined the whole movie for me. Arguably a story is only as good as it's antagonist and Marwan Kenzari just didn't fit. He was too young to be a vizier and was neither convicting nor menacing at any point. To make bad even worse they decided to make him just another thief. In the cartoon version he treated Aladdin like vermin, while here he almost sympathies with him. Doesn't make any sense.
*They threw in so much needless extra stuff which made them rush the main story. The original was more fleshed out in 90 minutes than this one in over 130. What you get as an end result is a story burdened with additions that extend it by almost 40 minutes and still adding nothing of value to the movie.
* How can some of the most memorable moments in the original be recreated so badly in the remake despite budget and everything. For example, the whole part of Aladdin in the cave, taking the lamp and escaping afterward felt rushed and boring.<br/><br/>Watch it on Disney+ if you have free time. It's not a terrible movie, but nowhere near a classic."
"ahelene1","7","0","1","12 January 2020"," Worth a watch
","I found this movie very enjoyable. Yes, some of the musical numbers were a bit cheesy but it stayed true to the original and the chosen actors for the main characters were spot on. Specifically Will Smith as Genie. He paid tribute to Robin William's performance without trying to recreate it. I appreciated the fact that Aladdin and Jasmine more a bit more covered up then their animated counterparts and that they used ethnic appropriate actors."
"chrissyrenaegray","5","0","1","11 January 2020"," Not incredibly strong, but it has its moments
","I have tired of the idea of Disney doing ""live remakes"" of their classics, especially those that were already successful and treasured. But there have been a few I was pleasantly surprised with. Aladdin, unfortunately isn't one of them.<br/><br/>The cons:
* Guy Ritchie's direction/camera work. Ritchie has a distinct style which can work very well in some of his films. He is noted for playing with the speed of his films is certain scenes, slowing it down, speeding it up, to emphasis a certain look or action. He does the same here, but rarely does it make sense to the story or the action.
* Jafar's casting--I do believe he did the best he could with the role, but it seems that the iconic performance of the original just can't be overshadowed or replaced. He does well with the parts that have been added to give depth to Jafar's character, but it is still difficult to see him as the threat of the animated film.
* The utter misuse of Alan Tudyk--Tudyk is one of the best voice actors out there, right up there with Bill Cummings, but he was hardly used in this movie. I am okay with Iago being less comic relief and more menace, but he was rarely used. I almost would have preferred Iago to not speak as he did not add to the story.
* CGI--This was released in 2019; the CGI should have looked better and less sloppy. Will Smith's genie in blue form is frightening, Rajah moves cartoonishly, and some of the dancing in ""Friend Like Me,"" while beautifully choreographed, gives away the CGI work.<br/><br/>Pros:
* Will Smith--Many were really wondering how anyone could replace Robin Williams's iconic performance, and I am pleased to say that Smith goes with his own interpretation, and it works well. In many ways, he nearly stole the show.
* Music--I had no issues with the music; some of the lyrics are changed to accommodate for today's audiences, but not terribly so. And even ""Speechless,"" an obvious Oscar nom grab and female empowerment number, is a genuinely good song.
* Sultan's casting--Even as a child, the sultan in the 1992 version annoyed me to no end--he was weak, childish, and did not display any real leadership qualities. I really like this Sultan. He comes across as much more of a leader, much stronger, more adept.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie isn't bad, but it does come across as mediocre, especially in comparison to its animated predecessor."

I'm so disappointed.<br/><br/>I saw the original THIRTEEN times in the theater ($5 dollar movie days and an abundant allowance) so, that tells you how much I loved it. This remake just makes me sad.<br/><br/>They did a fabulous job of remaking ""Beauty and the Beast"" and tried to ride that wave but have failed miserably.<br/><br/>Disney needs to go back to using the magnificent brains in the world to make original pieces instead of remaking classics in a lackluster manner.

"choichaehyeon","5","0","1","8 January 2020"," A good movie with a painfully shaky start
","I shall be writing this review without any regard to the existence of the original animated film.<br/><br/>Firstly, the genie. Despite being portrayed by a real life Will Smith, has an extraordinary level of animation on his blue face - which unfortunately falls into Jeff Bridges in Tron Legacy / Billy Connolly in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies levels of uncanny valley. But with that out of consideration, Smith is great in the role especially considering the shoes he had to fill.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud portrayed Aladdin adequately, however the fleshed-out core of the character was missing in a few scenes, and it made him appear slightly two dimensional.
Naomi Scott was perfectly believable as a princess making her speechless song even more powerful but Nasim Pedrad was a complete scene stealer, and her interactions with the Genie were a highlight of the movie.
Jafar was an interesting character, whilst the cruelty of his actions and ambition was well portrayed by Marwan Kenzari. The youthful, soft-spoken, manicured beard aura - did not truly fit a main antagonist, which weakened the whole film.<br/><br/>Regarding the movie itself, it started off extremely poorly and I can understand the other reviews of people that decided to leave after 30 minutes, because I almost did the same. But after the grandeur parade scene, the movie definitely raised up a few levels of quality and by the end, I was enjoying it quite a lot. Which makes it rather difficult to score, as Aladdin went from a 2/10 disaster, to a respectable 7/10.<br/><br/>So I'll go for a reasonable 5/10, but I really did enjoy the end. That said, I think children will love this film."
"Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","8","0","1","7 January 2020"," Aladdin, a whole new world?
","Today, I was able to take a stroll down memory lane and let nostalgia be my guide. Aladdin is a Disney giant that took its first magic carpet ride in 1992. Today, Aladdin knocked the dust off of the old magic carpet once again. This movie stars newcomers Mena Massoud as Aladdin and Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine. Hollywood giant, Will Smith plays the Genie. So let's see how the reboot rebounded.<br/><br/>First, let's get the cat out of the bag. This reboot hits all of the classic notes from the animated movie. However, the movie updates the story to feature current sociocultural climate notes and additional songs. This isn't just a live version carbon copy, and I'm glad Disney made changes.<br/><br/>Both Mena and Naomi, do a very good job in their roles as Aladdin and Jasmine. They both display some good singing ability and acting skills. And, of course Raja and Abu steal your hearts in this movie. Will Smith, had the hardest job of all by having to live up to Robin William's original portrayal, but he does a very good job as well. Will gives the audience a funny, high energy, charming, and current version of the Genie. As for Jafar and the Sultan, they also do a good job, but honestly the Sultan isn't really featured, and Jafar needed to be more devilish.<br/><br/>This was a good movie, but the additional parts and songs in the movie did not add much to it. People who enjoyed this movie growing up will say just ""give me the original movie,"" and move on. But those who are not familiar with the original movie, will enjoy the magic ride that Disney took us on.<br/><br/>Long story short, families with kids should definitely go see this movie in the theaters, whether at night time or matinee. Everyone else, especially those who loved the movie as a kid decades ago, I would say you can see the matinee. But, honestly you should wait for Redbox or a streaming service rental for $4.99 to see a whole new world."

"baileycrawly","9","0","1","4 December 2019"," The Best of the Disney Remakes
","The following is an unpopular opinion. If you are easily offended, please click away.<br/><br/>I grew up with the original Aladdin. I'm not original or special in that way. The stunning visuals of Agrabah and the fun, upbeat music present in the original provided the soundtrack to my childhood.
The big hang-up on the original for me was that I was never a fan of Robin Williams. I love his dramatic work in films like World's Greatest Dad or Dead Poet's Society, but I never liked him as a comedian. I just didn't think he was funny. And his performance as the Genie came off as a pretentious attempt to be comedic that just fell flat in every conceivable way for me.<br/><br/>That being said, the best parts of this remake are Mena Massoud as Aladdin and Will Smith as the Genie. They have chemistry together that works really well, I get a great sense of the relationship these two characters share in the film.
Both Mena and Naomi Scott are incredible young up-and-coming actors with a lot of talent and potential, and I hope to see them in Hollywood blockbusters for years to come.<br/><br/>I went into this movie expecting to hate it,, as I think anybody who sits through a remake of a huge part of their childhood would. But I just couldn't. The sets are beautiful, the acting is spot on, the music is much more fun and fresh than the original, Will Smith isn't doing a Robin Williams imitation (thank god for the little things)... everything about it was wonderful.
Except Jafar. Minus one star for Jafar, but only because it's not really a character that translates well to live action, and the writing of his character was quite weak, I thought."

I really like how the directors also threw in some jokes to contribute humor to the film. Guy Ritchie, director, incorporates subtle touches and clever scenes to entertain the audience. At some points in the film, you feel as if you are not watching a ""remake of Aladdin"". The movie highlights new songs that are catchy while also paying tribute to the original songs.

It is the live-action remake of the 1992 animated short film Aladdin. Arabic The Arabian Nights and the French version of Antoine Galland. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Rideback, Vertigo Entertainment, Big Talk Films and Marc Platt Productions and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, stars Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, Will Smith, Marwan Kenzari, Navid Negahban, Nasim Pedrad, Billy Magnussen. and Numan Acar. Alladin is a young thief living on petty thefts in Agrabah. One day, he helps a young woman retrieve a valuable bracelet, unaware that she is actually Princess Jasmine. Alladin soon becomes interested in her, who claims to be the princess's maid. Visiting her in the palace and discovering her identity, he is captured by Jafar, the sultat's grand vizier, who wants him to retrieve a magic lamp, where he inhabits a genius capable of granting three wishes to its owner. Simply magnificent movie, breathtaking special effects, musical was very good, chose the actors very well!

This movie is boring. The visuals are great because it's visible they expend many budgets to this movie but it is not so magical. I regard a couple of scenes from the original movie like the scene with Jazmin trapped in the hourglass and the massive fight against Jafar. SPOILER. This doesn't happen in this movie. Jafar isn't an absolute evil; he is a hot villain but is not threating at all and the visuals are not half as good as the original movie.
If you are not going to go big with the magic aspect in this movie, then don't re-make it. It doesn't offer anything new except for the Jamzin's actually good song. So don't expect much of this remake."

","Good for what it is and has some pretty good cgi. Where it looses points are the following:<br/><br/>1. Pandering and rehashing. Its too focused on making sure a certain generation is paying attention. In a world of social media, this movie has already been done through memes, through social events, etc... and at the speed social media moves, things are done in a matter of hours. Jokes in the film are almost months to years old and were also already old withing five to six hours of them just being a social joke nowadays.<br/><br/>2. The added stuff that wasn't in the original is only serving a single purpose. It shuts the door on sequels, which is good but added content needs to serve a bigger purpose than that.<br/><br/>3. We all know what's coming. We all saw that god awful #metoo music video at the end just before getting rid of Jafar. It completely ruined the pace and tone of the film. This is where it lost the most points for me.<br/><br/>4. I expected a better Iago. I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>All in all the film had some entertaining bits and handled the genie and previous content well enough, but the further you got into it, the further you felt from the original. And then that god awful ugh! Even my wife was like ""what's this crap?"" She actually asked me if she missed something and the movie was over and if this was like and ""after movie music video"" kind of thing. And I was like ""nope! Still the movie.

","I enjoyed the live-action remake of this movie. I think they did an excellent job, and it was different enough to surprise you a bit.<br/><br/>Some people have argued that it's a bit too 'Bollywoodesque', but, ancient Arabs dressed in colorful clothing, so it wasn't bad in its portrayal. I'm sure most people think they wear black, but that's a modern phenomenon, and only relegated to certain Islamic countries. There was clearly some Bollywood influence in certain parts of the movie, but they did a reasonably good job. I don't think it took away from anything.<br/><br/>The casting was excellent, and I have no complaints in that area. I'm happy to see mostly Arabs play the part since the story is based in the Middle East. There were some alterations with clothing, and certain parts were removed, but upon reflection, they wouldn't have made sense in a live-action film, so no complaints there either.<br/><br/>I've hated most of the live-action Disney remakes, but this was their best, in my opinion. It was a bit rushed, and certain songs weren't done right. I didn't mind the small changes to the story, like Jasmine becoming Sultan. I think they handled it very well. I'd highly recommend this movie, and I love Aladdin. I grew on the video games, movies, and cartoon show. I'm the first one to be critical if it was done poorly, but this was a really good effort. When I first saw the trailer, I was kind of worried, but I'm happy with it."

"eugenmale","3","0","1","7 November 2019"," In your face Autotune, lack of imagination, Jasmine lust for power almost as cringy as Jaffar...
","Its so hard to begin as there are so many flaws in this movie so i guess ill first start with the actors and then the story itself:
-Genie-
What can i say, the only reason i watched this abysmal movie was because i really enjoy Will Smith acting skills, having said that, this Genie version couldn't hold a candle to Robin Williams Genie.
Although its fair to argue that the original Aladdin was a cartoon, with all the CGI included into this genie, its also fair to say that excuse doesn't hold much water....
Will Smith worked with what he had and while he had a few good moments, for each of those good moments, the Genie from Aladdin 1992 has at least 5, having said that, i wasn't disappointed as i was mentally prepared to not expect this Genie being as good as the original one. The scenes ive found most funny were:
Prince Ali introductory song, pretty funny and at the same time good quality considering the rest of the songs on this movie.
The jams dialogue between Aladdin and the Genie,
And finally, all the random Prince Ali manipulation forcing him into Jasmine and forcing him to dance like a pro.<br/><br/>-Aladdin/Prince Ali-
For someone who claims to have never danced before (Mena Massoud), he has got some really sick dancing moves, that was actually very enjoyable to watch and for that hats down, his overall role in this movie was on point, however the singing parts sounded like the autotune machine was on steroids.
Hes pretty enjoyable to watch in this movie except for the few cringe worthy deeply exaggerated ""nervous talk"" dialogues between him and Jasmine at first & second sight as Prince Ali, i didn't find those parts funny at all, they were just uncomfortable to watch and even though i cant speak for the opposite sex, i don't really think women would find those scenes funny or interesting at all, it was so exaggerated that in my opinion didn't work out one bit.
Overall however, he was one of the better actors of this movie.<br/><br/>-Jasmine-
Where should i begin... from the very moment you see her, there's a huge contrast between this Jasmine and the original Jasmine, the original Jasmine starts at the palace, allowing the audience to learn about her and the reasons shes rebellious, naive, ignorant of her own people & the world around her, the audience also understands the reason why she gave that apple to that hungry child, and her plot is simple yet touching, she wants to find the true love of her life and not marry for interest alone, she even upsets her father by saying maybe she doesn't want to be a princess if it means marrying for interest alone.
-Lets compare that to this ""new"" Jasmine shall we?-
She's somehow very smart because apparently she read all those books in the library, but somehow, she has no idea that when you take something away from a food market you need to pay for it... makes sense... while the original Jasmine didn't care about wealth, money and power, this new Jasmine is different, her first life goal presented to us by her is to fulfill her lust for power by becoming the first female Sultan of Agrabah, leaving (finding true part as a secondary almost meaningless bonus life goal), from the beginning she came out more as a rich spoiled brat rather than a princess ""looking out for her people""... Naomi Scott acting is so generic i cant even remember if it was good or bad, she was just there... part of the movie... her emotions in the movie were so dull that the Sophia ""AI"" Robot could do a better job than her in this movie, the only part of the movie where i can say she exhibited emotions was while she was singing her song to the guards and Jaffar in the form of raging and screaming like a college girl, speaking about the song part, its probably the only song in the entire movie that isn't autotuned, a lot of people found the song to be awesome and amazing, however since song preferences are subjective i am going to admit i did not like it, its probably just my personal preference here at fault so listen to it for yourself.
Overall, her presence in this movie was almost as boring as Yaggo.<br/><br/>-Jaffar-
Im sorry to say this but no matter how good of an actor Marwan Kenzari may be, he is no actor to play Jaffar, Jaffar was one of the most badazz Disney Villains in the entire Disney movie industry, the original Jaffar had the Evil had the Power and had the Scary completely dominated into his character, Marwan Kenzari had none of that in this movie, all the time i was actually scared he might not even make it till the end of the movie and ended up seeing myself root for the guy... his presence in this movie was more like a rock in your shoe while in the original Aladdin he was as scary as a Nuclear Bomb.
Its not worth commenting about his acting skills since he was clearly the wrong person for the job.<br/><br/>-Yaggo-
How can you make a movie feel even more lazy than it already is? kill 30% of the movie funny scenes & funny dialogue by replacing Jaffar sidekick with this compiled garbage of a 3D parrot model which is neither clever, nor funny and all it can do is ""imitate"" a real parrot talking very occasionally... they say the voice acting is from Alan Tudyk, however Yaggo script is so dumb, i can claim a 5 years old voice acted it and you wouldn't know the difference.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie scenery itself...
Agrabah itself looks pretty good and colorful, exactly how i imagined it would be seeing Aladdin 1992 Agrabah in ""real life"", the crowded streets, the people attire, the market & their vendors, the palace & the guards... all spot on, i frankly could not have imagined it better myself, its that good!
It feels like they have put a lot of effort into it looking true to the original Aladdin and they have succeeded beyond my expectations, unfortunately that's where the effort seem to stop, the cave of wonders looks like its been through some serious economy crisis compared to the original movie, The entire scenery of the song (A whole new world) could be replaced with just a solid dark blue color and you wouldnt know the difference and finally, when Aladdin is cast into a far place deep into a stormy winter, they removed the entire action there from the original movie, not that they have replaced it with something else... its just gone... he gets cast in the snow, carpet runs after him and he gets back... its that bad.
Overall the scenery of the movie is good enough to suck you in and enjoy it if you can ignore the small flaws it has.<br/><br/>Last story short:
Would i see it again? Yes! i would totally see Aladdin 1992 again! this one? not so sure about it... it doesnt add anything special and it takes away alot of special things about original Aladdin so in the end, whats the point?"

"prhayhurst","5","0","1","4 November 2019"," Not bad, but didn't do as well for one reason.
","It's almost a shot for shot remake of the original Disney cartoon, with a few exceptions, and the same songs.
Smith does ok but he isn't Robin Williams, and that's not his fault, but he IS the name in the movie.
The trouble is, where in the past, you would have a big name as the baddie Jafar, such as Jeremy Irons, Ralph Fiennes or some such, and Aladdin may well be a big name as well, dispersed with other stars people know which would sell the film.
Unfortunately in this day and age, they are left casting almost unknowns in these parts, as they are the right ethnicity. They are good, but they have no oomph, or wow factor, something like Johnny Depp had in Pirates of the Caribbean, he made those films as popular as they are, people knew him and loved his character.
You need stars to carry a movie like this, it isn't a real story, having a white known actor playing Jafar wouldn't have hurt anyone!
Though I'm sure some would be up in arms about ""whitewashing"""

"butterman_1999","5","0","1","22 October 2019"," Competent but prodictable and ""upgraded"" (not always good)
","One of the only reasons I was conned into watching this movie which by it's very existance (like the previously re-re-made into ""live"" action film ""Beauty And The Beast"") is essentially a total cash cow, was because once respectable film director Guy Ritchie was attached to it.<br/><br/>Like many hyper-over-budgeted Hollywood mega productions, the level of the director's creative vision is always questionable, especially when balancing so many producers, exÃ©cutives, and other A-listers who, along with other boardroom ""alumnis"", have too many hands in the ""creative"" process.<br/><br/>They could have added something apparently ""missing ""from the 90s animated version, but aside from two new rather uninspired songs (and that's a shame because one of them has potent lyrics) and a myriad of goofy-looking CGI effects, the film's only raison-d'etre appears to fulfill this post Y2K craze of constantly remaking and rebooting stuff ad nausium.<br/><br/>What first ruined the suspension of disbelief was the rather clunky genie effect: aside from when Will Smith performs as a ""human"" and one scene where, as a genie, you basically only see his head, the whole CGI-ed enhanced blue Will Smith effect feels rather odd, like a very well make CGI model but there is still somethingg ""off"" about the motion and how Smith's performance is ""blended"" into said 3D model. This is by no means a critique of either Smith's acting abilities nor what can only be an incalculable amount of hours spent programming, rendering, layering, and texturizing the genie, but in the end is still looks like something out of a computer, and whatever real Will Smith was left in there appears to be almost ""doll""-like in appearance. Maybe most people won't notice this (like the Young Flynn CGI face over Jeff Bridges' in the modern Tron film - how could some have not noticed that?) seeing as how since The Matrix, all big budget films feel the need to oversaturate us with CGI as if attempting to subdue us into believing it to be mistakened for real action/characters.<br/><br/>There is also a few odd moments where the film (or rather digital photography) appears to be ""sped up"" - an effect more commonly used these days but in some instances, such as the first chase through the market early in the film, it feels artificial, almost like those old film reels which were shot at a smaller rate of frames per second but projected at 24FPS. Maybe this was an intentional effect that they decided to keep in, to remind us that this is, after all, a fairie tale musical and therefore should not be mistaken with reality in any way.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film isn't a total disaster, as for the most part is it competent and entertaining, but like all too many big Hollywood mega budgets, and especially Disney remakes of remakes, it comes off as un-necessary."

","Ok Disney has been doing Great with these live action Adaptations to there classics. This movie was great for many reason. The Genie Will Smith did a great job. I was laughing just enough. The songs and dances from the classics were there but some were a little to break dancing for my taste in fact there is a scene where Aladdin break dance that went to over board. Though that same scene had me really excited because it was a big cultural scene. This is something I love about these adaptations the fact the fill in the whole that were in the original like jasmine mid drift. Instead of that extreme skimpy outfit she wore the entire movie they gave her multiple outfits accurate to the culture and to her status as the princess. Which she also got a handmaid that helped give some the genie something to do. But the thing that wreck it for me was the song jasmine sing in her head that makes everybody turn to dust and bannisters stay floating in midair. This is the only song where everybody freezes which takes you so far out of the movie your out in your car in the parking lot. It wrecks the climax because your trying to figure out what just happened"

"natalielopez-01363","8","0","2","15 October 2019"," Much better than expected - Mena made this movie so lovable!
","Original Aladdin is one of my top 3 favorite Disney movies, But I saw this for the first time and watched it 4 times in a row in one weekend. I really fell in love with it. To be fair, there were some big mistakes in this film. 1. lack of any real emotion in any of the actors, there are moments where the emotion does not suit the scene, when you make a live action version of Disney, you have the ability to make the emotion so much MORE powerful, not less. Even when Will (Genie) is saying Aladdin is breakin his heart, it doesnt come across at all. Aladdin needed a little bit more passion, desperation and even anger. 2. the new songs are awful, should have been left out. 3. Jafar was a TERRIBLE cast choice. I struggle to believe they couldnt find a more dark, brooding, actor with a stronger voice than this one. He's almost fragile and soft in his appearance and voice, and wasnt intimidating at all.
now that i got that out of the way, i fell in LOOOOVE with Mena Massoud, so much so i want to find all his other movies and watch them, even without the emotion in the movie, he's captivating and lovable. Aladdin is a tough character and he killed it!! Will Smith was a great genie, of course he's not Robin Williams, but he was funny, interesting and i enjoyed him. Jasmine, the sultan, Iago, Raja, the carpet i really loved the portrayal of all these characters. Iago, Raja and Abu were not overdone or corny, they were really well done. The entrance of Prince Ali was everything I dreamt it would be in real life as a kid! spectacular, gorgeous, fun. The ""One jump"" scene with Aladdin jumping around the city was fantastic. I adored the beauty of the city, the dancing, the colors, costumes, everything was so stunning. I could watch this movie 100 times just like i did the original.

"gnasher1001","7","0","2","13 October 2019"," Fun Homage to the 1992 with Some Weaknesses
","If you come into this as an Homage to the 1992 Robin Williams/Disney animation, then you will have a nice time. It's a fun, well-made musical, with many of the original songs and a couple of new ones, and some originals slightly remixed. The sets are colourfully OTT, looking like the Agrabah of the animation, and there are some good performances.
Now the weaknesses, and my main gripe with the film - Jafar. In the animation, he was a powerful, evil, man who was well spoken, with dry humour and just wanted more power. In this version he comes over just as a spoiled brat who just moans about being second all the time and doesn't want power as such, just moans about not being 'first'. Second, much less of a big gripe is that although he never tries to replace Robin Williams, (and you shouldn't see this film to compare him to the original) Will Smith just doesn't carry the movie enough. He is competent, and fun, but just doesn't give out the classic character feeling that Robin Williams' did.<br/><br/>Overall, see this, it's a fun romp that you'll enjoy, sing-a-long to and then probably watch the 1992 version the next time you want to watch Aladdin!"

"RhapsodyReviews","6","0","1","7 October 2019"," Will Smith Save This Movie.
","Review:
'Aladdin' is an American musical-fantasy film directed by Guy Ritchie. It is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated film of the same name. Upon watching this movie, I was skeptical due to the fact I didn't believe they would be able to capture the same magic that the 1992 animated film had. At times this movie really shined, but that didn't happen until the second and third act. I was almost ready to turn the movie off after the first act. It didn't grasp your attention at all, and everything was lackluster and boring.
The film follows Aladdin (Mena Massoud) a street urchin, as he falls in love with Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) befriends a wish-granting Genie (Will Smith) and battles the wicked Jafar (Marwan Kenzari).
This movie didn't take off at all until Will Smith was introduced. His charisma and funny attitude towards Aladdin and certain situations were amazing. He stole every scene he was in and basically saved this movie from a bad review. I could care less about the other characters in this movie aside from Genie, Aladdin and Jasmine. Jaffar, who is supposed to be this big bad was not scary or menacing at all and I do believe that is because the actor did not have what it takes to pull the character off. It just fell flat. I really enjoyed Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott's portrayal as Aladdin and Jasmine. Their chemistry together was real, and it felt like the characters could come off the screen and live in the real world. However, as I said the rest of the characters fell short and you don't care what happens or even remember who they are when they come on screen another time.
I told myself I would not be comparing this to the 1992 animated film, but it's hard not to compare Genies. Will Smith did a great job in this movie and took on what was thought to be an impossible role and made it his own. I did still find myself missing Robin Williams when it came to the music numbers. I will say what I liked the most with this movie is the ending. Man did it stick the landing on that ending. It made you feel so many emotions. Now, I'm not one to complain about CGI when it's from a movie that has a low budget such as an Indie film or even a B-rate production company. When it's Disney and you see things like Marvel or The Lion King you know they can produce good CGI and this movie fell short in that aspect.
Overall, this movie fell hard in the first act and was lucky people stuck around for the second and third because the movie does a 180 turn and takes off. If you want a fun adventure film this one will do that for sure, and if you're a fan of the original this one keeps its core values as well as throwing in some fresh elements.
3/5"

"nhsportsfreak","7","0","1","5 October 2019"," Hit or miss
","The acting in this movie was all over the place. There were some moments where they were amazing, like in their new scenes, and other moments where the acting/singing felt forced and more like a Bollywood/Highscool Musical movie rather than the original Disney movie. Luckily, as the movie progresses, so does its performance. We start seeing more and more passion from the actors/actresses and even get a glimpse of some quirky Disney charm, which is almost enough to save the whole movie.<br/><br/>Marwan Kenzari's Jafar is by far the biggest disappointment of this movie. Instead of seeing the cunning and intelligent Royal Vizier, we get a very bland and boring little helper. He alone almost ruins the whole movie. He shows less facial expressions than Kirsten Stewart and is more monotone than a speak and spell. Sad to see such a great character wasted.<br/><br/>This movie was saved partially by the increased performance in the second half, and by the overall performances of Naomi Scott and Will Smith.<br/><br/>Naomi Scott, whose powerful and independent take was a bit to get used to, makes us look back to 1992 and wish they had shown more of Jasmine. We get to see how she struggles with being trapped inside the walls of the palace and deprived of the power she so eagerly desires. It was definitely a nice change of pace<br/><br/>Will Smith's version of the Genie, if Robin Williams' rendition didn't exist, was really superb and modern. Unfortunately for Smith, Robin Williams aced the Genie roll and, though he did a great job, Will Smith couldn't quite fill the shoes Williams left behind.<br/><br/>Overall, it both went above, and well below my expectations and was just a rollercoaster of phenomenal and horrendous acting."
"astoldbyissy","7","0","1","5 October 2019"," Great soundtrack, feminist themes, Will Smith is awesome and a rant on racial discrimination in hollywood
","This is my first ever movie review.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Aladdin, as a long-time Disney-fan, albeit not expecting much given my disappointment with Beauty and the Beast and Lion King (the non-cartoon versions released in recent years). This is surprising because of the three, Aladdin (the cartoon) was maybe ranked the third in my books originally.<br/><br/>Here's what Aladdin (2019) has going for it:
<ul><li>Amazing soundtrack (not just the new songs introduced, but the instrumentals) that I'm still listening to now even months after watching!</li><li>Will Smith's consistently awesome performance, both as an actor and singer. I was particularly impressed with his ability to carry off these musical numbers with such gusto.</li></ul>-Naomi Scott (Lemonade Mouth alumnus). I'll share more about this later, but she was beautiful and her vocals really raised the roof in the new song Speechless.<br/><br/>What I maybe didn't like so much was the cheesy feminist themes that were a bit in-your-face. Sure, it brought a new interesting dimension to an oldie but goldie Disney movie, giving it a bit more depth, but it was just a little too explicit for me.<br/><br/>Aladdin is ultimately a story relatable to every girl ever who has ever fallen for a bad boy (who is charming, talented, and ultimately a rascal - given how he behaved selfishly later in the show). It also goes into a story about whether a woman can lead a kingdom as a princess, without a co-prince (a role I feel Aladdin isn't well equipped to play as his talents lie more in street smarts).<br/><br/>But ok, I digress. I suppose what we should take away is more that qualities such as kindness, honesty and respect should always be the most important.<br/><br/>Now, for my elaboration on Naomi. The only thought I had was - Yet another previously undervalued non-White shines again! It brought flashbacks for me to Ariana Grande, Zendaya and now Naomi. Their similarities? They all played extremely ""supporting actress"" roles to white girls in their previous Disney lives (Lemonade Mouth, Victorious and Shake It Up).<br/><br/>And now, they're like 1,000x more successful than those white leads now (seriously, Bella Thorne)? You go girls. I just feel slightly peeved that their talent wasn't recognized right from the start just because of their race / skin color. What's with the constant need for white leads? I'm Asian and I don't watch shows with Asian leads at all. Does the White majority audience really need to watch a White lead??<br/><br/>Ok, sorry for the rant. Peace out!"

It's not a classic, ( there again neither was the remake of Beauty & The Beast), but it delivers a very good film for all audiences.
I do agree with the reviewers that the character of Jafar wasn't as pantomime-evil as he should have been. He was a bit underwhelming but it didn't detract extensively from enjoying this film. The studios must have been relatively happy with Guy Ritchie's direction, as it's made over $1bn dollars worldwide already on a $183m budget."

","27 years ago, in an unknown land with unknown magical powers lived a street rat by the name of Aladdin graced the movie screens in a new imagining and animated way all thanks the to the creator and master of the big and little screen that gave us all something to live for: Walt Disney and a man that made us laugh for a billion reasons - Robin Williams.
Now let's fast-forward to 2019, under the direction of Guy Ritchie, a new and innovative way of seeing the world in a whole new way, we travel back to Agrabah to catch a glimpse of this live action take of the classic story that we so dearly loved in 1992.
With the passing of the late great Robin Williams, who voiced the blue friend that granted 3 wishes to the user of the lamp, Will Smith, I have to hand him his props, he made this believer proud that there is no end to life when it comes to living for the future, you can't put wishes to life, you need to live life abundantly. But with this remake of the classic, it will stand the test of time in the vault of the greatest magical world of Walt Disney.
With an incredible cast comes the greatest soundtrack of singers who lent their voices to classic songs like Friend Like Me and A Whole New World, this movie will go in Disney history as one of the greatest story of all time: finding love in magical places and finding your place in the world."

"rebekahleonieee","8","0","1","29 September 2019"," 90's baby's honest review. *NO SPOILERS*
","The original Disney Aladdin came out the year I was born, so I spent much of my childhood watching and rewatching the film and it's most definitely one of my favourites.
Like others every time Disney announce they are doing a live action remake I find myself excited ,for childhood nostalgic reasons, whilst also a little bit nervous because how can they do the originals justice and WHY remake something that was already incredible? I felt this way when I found out about Aladdin, seeing all the articles about people being angry about the casting, how no one could replace Williams as the genie.... they're all valid points. BUT this film is so so SO good.
1. The casting really isn't all that bad, yes I understand the comments about how it feels like 'an all Indian cast', but I think the actors all do amazing bringing that magic of the original characters to life.
2. The cgi maaaaaaybe could have been better, but even with Abu being entirely cgi I found I loved the little Monkey just as much as before, they show his emotion and his mischievous side really well.
3. Omg the songs! The songs have been modernised in a way but they are still just as catchy and you'll definitely find yourself wanting to sing along.
4. The genie, yes, Williams did an amazing job and the genie is one of his most loved roles. But Smith does such a fantastic job, he's not trying to be or replace Williams, he's doing his own thing and I genuinely think he did a beautiful job. One of my favourite scenes is the first conversation about Jasmine between Aladdin and the Genie, it's comedic gold and just made me think of all the times me and my girlfriends would discuss boy crushes.<br/><br/>My only major criticism is Jafar.... Kenzari is an actor I've not heard of personally before this film so I can't really comment much on his acting. I thought he did the best he could do portraying the villain but he didn't feel as even as the original character, maybe it's because Jafar genuinely scared me as a child with his super long neck and overly long face. Or maybe it's because Kenzari didn't have the same dramatic flare we loved from the villain. Who knows.<br/><br/>Even if you think this film won't be good, I honestly say just give it a go, I loved it!"

They should've reigned in his ego. I think it would've been a much better movie if they had given the princess and Aladdin a bit more space to develop their story instead of blowing the budget on special effects. Some of it was quite enjoyable but if they had cut it by 30 minutes it would've been a much better movie."

","2019's Aladdin is by no means a great movie. In my first viewing I saw it as an innocent, fun, childhood crowdpleaser. But upon my second viewing it goes downhill fast. The second time around, the novelty's gone, you realize the songs aren't that good, and the casting of people like Jafar and the Sultan are quite offputting. It really dissapoints me that this movie can't be a remake the way Maleficent is a remake. I'd like to see them do something original and change the script in a way that actually matters. The 'changes' they made are trivial stuff like the Handmaiden that doesn't even have a name, and changing some song lyrics. I'd like to see something done diffirent that makes this stand out as a film. I still reccomend it because it's a crowd pleaser and I just didn't enjoy it because I prefer to judge films by the actual filmmaking instead of how much I enjoy the film. enjoyability's a 7/10 and a 2/10 in rewatches."

"mwcanadian","5","0","1","24 September 2019"," Well.....it wasn't bad
","Ok, this live action remake wasn't bad, but I can't call is great or much to remember. Let's first start off like this, the actors who played Aladdin and Jasmine did really well. It wasn't their fault, Will Smith was an ok Genie. He's not Robin, but I wasn't hating him. Abu had a bit of entertainment too. Now the issues with the characters. Iago was basically nothing in this movie. In the cartoon he had more character, here he's just a one liner. The Sultan has a performance I forgot when the movie was over, in the cartoon, The Sultan was comic relief and fun to watch. Here he's just there, Jafar was the same way. Sure he had a moment or two where he had Jafar villain moments, but I never felt legit fear he'd win. In the cartoon he becomes a snake and had a legit chance to win, here it felt rushed.
So I'd give it a C minus, i wrote 5 stars, but I'd go with 4 and a half stars actually. The main good characters did really well, it was Jafar and The Sultan that hurt this movie, the songs (especially a whole new world) were done well"

","Aladdin was my favorite as a child so I was nervous to watch this but was so pleasantly surprised. Gets extremely fun once the genie shows up. Will Smith was hilarious as the Genie, Aladdin couldn't be better, Jasmine gets prettier by the minute as you look at her. The casting was simply great with the exception of Jafar. I mean he's supposed to be older, with a snake like face. That young guy with the modern short hair didn't do it justice. And they had the perfect guy for it cast as Hakim. If Hakim played Jafar the movie would have been perfect. Otherwise all good fun, you won't regret seeing it."
"thatgirlmyra-9946","8","0","1","23 September 2019"," Different, But That's Not Bad
","I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about here. The story is different, yes, but you would complain if they made it too similar, too.<br/><br/>Firstly, Will Smith was a spectacular Genie. He put his own, witty twist on Genie, which ended up brilliantly. I'm very glad he didnt try to repeat every Robin Willians line woodenly. He was very good and very funny.<br/><br/>Mena surprised me at how well he played the classic street rat. His cute awkwardness actually makes him a lot more relatable than the original, and his singing voice is not lacking in any way. His eyes are very deep and expensive, so it was a pleasant surprise at how well he played the title character.<br/><br/>The only weak link was actually the most praised character: Jasmine. With an annoying and whiny attitude about everything and an incredibly wishy washy attitude regarding Aladdin, she was honestly barely tolerable. While acted well, the character itself was bad.<br/><br/>Overall, definitely worth a watch. This is just another movies 90s kids are mad about because they're blinded by nostalgia."

No need for him to try to mimic Robin Williams. Very disappointed with the parrot. Gilbert Gottfried was a hoot in the cartoon.

","Watched both with in a few days of each other. I can safely say the original still will always be what people think of first EVER before Disney's attempts at reinventing the wheel and with that said good attempt. Kids of today might find the original a little creepier compared to the new one but hey... enjoyed them for what they are. Singing was ok, acting was great, villian was flat compared to the original and the social justice add in was not needed; jasmin is already a great strong women character and was good as is before they added what they did. Overall... recommend... after I recommend the original Aladdin!"
"megannea","5","0","2","17 September 2019"," Could have been better, but not bad either
","Overall this movie was just...OK. It largely followed the plot of Disney's animated Aladdin, with some positive and negative changes.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people were concerned about Will Smith as the Genie, but I really think he did a good job especially considering the expectations set forth by the original. I actually think the blue worked well, as he was not blue the whole time, and they kept his amorphous shape despite the restrictions of live action. It actually kind of feels like all of their budget went into the Genie's character and CGI at the expense of the other characters (I will continue this in a bit).<br/><br/>Some of the differences I thought were overall positive changes:
-Jasmine's father is much more fatherly and serious, as would be expected of a quality leader
-The framing of the story being told by the now-human Genie
-Giving Jasmine a friend aside from Rajah (this allowed for some funny and somewhat relatable moments)
-Giving one of the guards (Hakim in this case) some character development, back-story, and substance.<br/><br/>Some of the changes I could give or take:
-Jasmine has her own song. This is nice in concept, but I do not think it was well placed in the movie. Like she did a great job with it, but it felt forced in there and felt a little bit like ""let it go"". I think maybe this would have been better had it been earlier in the movie to show her drive, or maybe if they added a scene that would allow her to have a true ""rock bottom"" that she could get out of. (I'm not a story writer, needless to say, but I feel they way they did this was sloppy and rushed).
-Iago is less of a character. I'm not opposed as largely none of the other animals actually talked, and he sounded more like a parrot to fit the live action.
-Jasmine wanting to become Sultan. This isn't a bad change, but I also like the Jasmine that just wanted to be free from the responsibilities and constraints of being a princess forced to marry a prince. Live-action Jasmine seemed more confident and less naive, but some of my favorite scenes from animated Jasmine were missing (such as when she confidently jumped across the buildings, or stood her ground against the guards when they came to take Aladdin, revealing herself as the princess). I think lacking these scenes detracted from her character and confidence.
-I neither like nor dislike freeing Genie by turning him human.<br/><br/>General negatives about the movie (in my opinion of course):
-Jafar. He had a few good moments and some improved character development, but overall he was a miss. He was not menacing enough as far as his acting is concerned, but I also think the movie-makers and script writers did nothing to help him. Regarding what I said earlier about putting all their budget into Genie, I think they could have given Jafar a little more help with the special effects. I would have loved to see him turn into a snake (or something), as he was just not threatening enough as is. The magic he used while being an all-powerful sorcerer was pretty unimpressive and didn't feel that magical. Iago turning big was not bad, but not as strong a threat as the snake or nearly suffocating Jasmine (or anyone for that matter) in an hourglass. I'm not saying they had to be the same, but the stakes were just not as high in the live action. With all the things Genie created or transformed into in the live action, I'm not convinced the writers couldn't have done something more interesting and transformative with Jafar.
-Related to Jafar, he did not have his Prince Ali reprise where he revealed Aladdin's true identity (another place I think special effects could have been improved as well). This part was quite underwhelming.
-There was generally a lot of cringey moments, mostly between Jasmine and Aladdin. I understand trying to convey the awkwardness of potential feelings, but I was almost overwhelmed with the secondhand embarrassment. The animated characters were a bit more charming and less awkward, but still believable.
-I felt this movie glossed over some major character development points for both Jasmine and Aladdin.
-Jasmine did not have a point where she genuinely feared Aladdin had been killed.
-Considering the movie is called Aladdin, I did not feel he was given a big enough hero, save the day type moment. I also feel the focus was more on Jasmine at times (not necessarily a bad thing, but it did feel out of balance at times). Other times the focus fell on Genie just because he is a more interesting character.<br/><br/>I know others have recommended that you step back and try and view this movie through a fresh lens instead of through the lens of the animated version, but I think it is difficult to evaluate how it stands on its own since so many scenes were so like the animated version. It was not a bad movie, but I still felt there were generally also pacing issues, and so many cringe-worthy moments that I had a hard time with it now and again. It certainly doesn't have the same life and fun of the animated version, but of Disney's live action remakes, this was not the worst."

"discordnrhyme","9","0","2","13 September 2019"," Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular
","Every shot of this movie takes me back to the Aladdin show at Disney's California Adventure. Anyone who's seen the live stage ""Musical Spectacular"" cannot deny the magic of this live-action movie. Many of the dance/musical numbers and stunts were rough & campy (like you'd expect from a stage show rather than a big-budget movie) but that's what made it so special (to me). There was even the musical curtain call at the end... I half expected to see an epicly animated puppeteer beneath Iago as he followed Jafar around, plotting, scheming and quipping hilariously on Jafar's shoulder! If this movie fell short in any way, it was the lack of dialogue from Iago.<br/><br/>It's true. Will Smith is NO Robin Williams. He had some enormous shoes he could never hope to fill... and, to his credit, he didn't even try. Will Smith played the Genie HIS way. Had he tried to be Will Smith being Robin Williams, he would have failed and people would have hated him for trying. Many hate his performance anyways (my husband barely made it through the first scene without chiming in his disappointment).<br/><br/>You can't go into this movie expecting a remake of such a magical cartoon classic. For starters, there's Robin Williams' timeless performance. But there's also things they can do with animation that live action just cannot replicate (even with CGI). It's an adaptation, plain and simple. It is a different spin on a classic tale (what isn't these days?) and I think it was well-done.<br/><br/>I may have some sentimentality attached to this review as my grandmother & I LOVED the musical at Disney's California Adventure (though she mistakenly thought, all those years, that it was actually Robin Williams on stage!). But, I also grew up watching the Aladdin cartoon. I remember how ill-received the Return of Jafar was when it became known that Robin Williams would not be voicing the Genie. But, truthfully, the actor who played the Genie on stage did an amazing job making the role his. There is no replacing Robin Williams.<br/><br/>So, let's address a few other arguments. I've read some reviews that disagree with Jasmine's ""sudden"" feminism and desire to be Sultan. I question if these reviewers have ever even seen (or listened to) the original. One of Jasmine's first statements is ""IF I do marry, I want it to be for love."" The key word there is IF as in she may have eventually decided to NOT marry at all if the right suitor had not come along. Many of her laments throughout the cartoon centered around her feeling imprisoned by her role and duties as a princess and how she just wanted to be free. I will admit that her song in this movie (Speechless, I think it's called) was a little much and felt a little out of place with the original music. I prefer ""Lucky Bird Inside a Guilded Cage"" from the DCA Musical to this song from the movie. But, as a strong, independent woman ) I don't see anything wrong with Jasmine's character development or portrayal as a strong-minded woman.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9 stars only because well, can it truly BE perfect without Robin Williams? But also because, as one reviewer mentioned, the movie did seem to represent more of Indian culture (many of the musical numbers are reminiscent of a Bollywood feature) than of Arabian culture. It is quite stunning though and I enjoyed every minute of it!"

","First things first: the visuals. Wow, impressive. Trust Guy Ritchie (and more than a generous helping of the latest CGI) to bring Aladdin to life in spectacular grandeur. The visuals in 'Aladdin' never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>Now, the casting. I'm a Will Smith fan. He's a versatile actor and I think he makes a wonderful Genie. He fits the profile like a glove. Pity I can't say the same about our hero, Aladdin (Mena Massoud), and his love interest, the princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). None of these two young actors have much film experience and I didn't find them (Aladdin especially) strong enough to carry the film. There was no chemistry between them. (If there were chemistry between any of the characters, it would be between Aladdin and the Genie). The acting was unconvincing and left me cold. I felt nothing. Personally, I thought Aladdin was a stupid character and didn't really root for him.<br/><br/>Will Smith was by far the main attraction, from a comedy perspective, and from an interesting character perspective. He even had the most interesting back story. Of everyone in the film, I cared most about him.<br/><br/>The production design is superb and the musical segments are stunning! The film is bright and colorful and in general has a very happy, entertaining feel to it.

"Filip_Pruncu","8","0","2","10 September 2019"," Not an easy job, but...
","Ok.

But, in my opinion, he did an excellent job! If this would've been the first Aladdin we would've seen and if we didn't see the old animated movie when we were kids, we'd definitely think better of this production.<br/><br/>The actors did a good job, and Will Smith did the best he could for a very, very difficult situation... playing the role of a great animated character which was helped by the voice and talent of the great Robin Williams. It's not easy to go up to that point, but I think he managed and did a good role.<br/><br/>We, those who have seen the animated film when we were little, surely see this one differently now, at our age.

The casting is a little off at certain points, Jafar lacks any true menace. The film is unable to capture the wonder of the cartoon and this remake is more a live action extended version."

","Woah. I was not expecting Will Smith to be a good genie at all, yet I dare say he's on par with the original."
"domtaylor","6","0","1","7 September 2019"," Make way for the Fresh Prince; Disney ain't ever had a friend like him.
","When discussing Guy Ritchie's 'Aladdin' remake, it's impossible not to get caught up on the fact that it's exactly that: a remake. This new wave of live action Disney do-overs is pretty harmful to the filmmaking industry, as the majority of them (including this) have been enormously successful at the box-office, telling behemoths like Disney that this is what audiences want. It isn't. Or at least it shouldn't be. I'd much rather watch the original 'Aladdin' (1992) and have something new to see at the cinema than have to watch every classic again in an inferior way. Thankfully, though, this version of the flick is nowhere near as bad as it could have been. It's pointless, yes, but it's here and I have to admit it's a fairly entertaining time. The first portion moves rather slowly and it's not all that enjoyable, but things really take a turn for the better upon the arrival of Will Smith's Genie. Somehow the aspect of the piece that people were most worried about is the best thing about it. He's an entertaining character and Smith really brings him to life in a satisfying way. The relationship between Aladdin and the Genie is well realised here, too, and the middle portion of the film is actually rather fun. Naomi Scott is a good choice for Jasmine, as well, and she works well together with Mena Massoud, even if the script doesn't develop their relationship all too well. Surprisingly, the musical numbers are also pretty good. While the visuals are often copied straight from the original film, the actual music is enjoyable. Despite them all, bar one which is good if a little too pop-sounding, being taken from the original, they manage to sound fresh thanks to the cast - especially Smith. The updated versions stand on their own and Smith's style fits them surprisingly well, meaning that whenever there's a song, it's a fun time - something really important considering that this is a musical. It doesn't just remind you of how good the songs in the original were either, it actually makes you like and remember these new versions. It's not all good though; the film is far too long. Somehow they managed to take the exact same story that took 90 minutes and tell it in 128, and you can feel it. Also, while it is entertaining to an extent, there have been far more enjoyable family films this year that are a lot more original than this. Overall, it's a decent, if overlong, watch that can actually be fairly enjoyable. Like I said though, it's never outstanding and it's originality is severely lacking. Without Smith, this wouldn't have been anywhere near as successful. 6/10"

","I didn't expect to enjoy this movie. After watching trailers so many times i couldn't get myself to watch it as i thought it would be a Bollywood style awful remake. Especially, after i really disliked the remake of ""Beauty and the Beast"".
But i really liked it, as well as my kids. It was refreshing and funny. Will Smith did a great job, but seriously he shoul not sing. I respect him a lot but everytime he started to sing i was laughing with tears."

","Acting was very amateur. Cringed at the leading star with his terrible acting, he had some moments but they weren't that good, script was very floppy and jasmine was ok in some aspects, but overall the entire cast sucked at acting pretty much. The villain is the most boring one dimensional half made villain since Justice Leagues Steppenwolf. The only thing stopping this film from being worse than it already is... is the surprising performance of Will Smith. He manages to carry the film on his back in some ways and works his genie magic, I also think he makes it his own, whereas the other cast either try so hard copying the original or going so far from it, which is fine, but it's not even in a good way. The magic carpet and the genie, and some nostalgia is really the only high points the movie has to offer, there's a moment with jasmine that has her singing and that was very magical too, and I can't deny the special effects and the vivid colors were like eye candy while watching it, which can really fool people into actually enjoying this, which is completely fine, I, however have seen this film and many others and just can't seem to follow this Disney live action hype train. I just cannot seem to understand why they bother remaking it if they can't even make it compelling. They've done great with live action since Cinderella 2015, but 2019 is just NOT the live action Disney movie year. Not to mention the very terrible dumbo, which was by far worse, Aladdin was better... but yet it's still not saying much..."
"wenshere","5","0","1","6 September 2019"," Not bad but not great
","Cast<br/><br/>At first before watching the film I was not fond of the cast at all, however as time passed I thought to be more open to it and see how they actually are in the film before judging. I'm not mad about the cast in terms of appearance. Naomi Scott as Jasmine is a good choice, not perfect in my opinion but still really good. Her acting was very good and convincing, as well as her singing. I really liked how she conveyed emotions in her acting.
Mena Massoud on the other hand, he had decent 'aladdin' looks, again not perfectly accurate to the original aladdin but he was passable. But his acting...oh man, his acting was so mediocre in my opinion. He seemed really stiff at times and I just was not impressed at some especially emotionally critical moments. His singing especially lacked emotions a LOT. You definitely don't have to be the most skilled singer to make a song sound emotional or 'good' in that sense, but he just didn't sound that way at all. He just did not have aladdin's natural charm at all which was a very crucial point.
Will Smith was good as genie I think and his singing wasn't bad at all, so I don't mind that part much. I also liked how in the begin it's actually the genie telling his kids about the tale, that's honestly a nice detail to show more of his life after being genie, which I like.
Marwan Kenzari was NOT a convincing choice for Jafar, he just did not have the dangerous cunning vibe at all. Honestly I don't understand how he was casted as Jafar. I'm not saying his acting was bad though, but I just don't think he was a good choice at all.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>There are a few things to say despite the live action following the original mostly.
First, it bothered me a bit about how Aladdin was introduced in the begin. He did not get enough time before Jasmine showed up and suddenly they're running away together AS he sings the 'One Jump Ahead' song.
I felt like that song was really to introduce Aladdin as a character and show off his personality in a way, but mashing it together like that by making jasmine run with him in that sequence just felt a bit squeezed together and not right? In my opinion if they did that they should have given jasmine a few lines as well and modified the song in a way, to make it fit. That part definitely felt rushed.
Besides that there were other times the plot didn't feel smooth as well. Second thing I want to say is I'm not sure if it's because of the plot or script written, but I just did not feel that Aladdin and Jasmine really had a strong chemistry/attraction? In the original film you can see even from the beginning Aladdin swoons over Jasmine the moment he sees her and throughout the film you see their mutual attraction towards eachother from begin to end, so naturally it just felt right that in the end they got together. But in this remake it just didn't have that. It felt as if they were only acquaintances for a good while of the film but then SUDDENLY they like eachother. It felt a bit forced in a way. I'm not saying it's terrible but I definitely couldn't help but to notice that difference.<br/><br/>
Music<br/><br/>I actually like the live action's take on the soundtracks for some songs, but not all. As mentioned earlier I do like Naomi's singing and Jasmine's Speechless is just phenomenal. It's great to see Jasmine get her own song.
Will Smith also did great on some songs, I especially liked Arabian Nights.
Also as mentioned earlier I don't like Mena's singing. I can tell he did try though but it's just nowhere as impressive and charming as Brad's singing, which is to be expected but still, it just lacked emotions. I still think for this reason it would have been better to cast someone with more singing experience.
Other than that I actually do like the re-arrange on 'A Whole New World', it's more modern in a way and it fits the film. It's just really different than the original but it doesn't mean it's bad.
The other tracks were good, I don't have much to say on them.<br/><br/>Visuals<br/><br/>The visuals were GREAT. I actually really loved how the characters are introduced visually at the begin of the film, as the camera moves across Agrabah you see the silhouette of each main character. I honestly liked that part.
CGI is of course great as well. The genie part however must have been tricky to do, I'm not mad about how it looked even if it's not perfect. Some parts did make me think twice a bit but in the end it didn't bother me too much.
The costume designs were beautiful as well. Even if it has a lot of indian influences I really liked the designs especially for Jasmine. Her outfits varied in palettes but it always had turquoise touches in them, staying true to the original Jasmine's color.
Aladdin's prince Ali costume design was perfect as well, I loved how it really looks like the original but only more realistic and more detailed and enhanced, it looked great.<br/><br/>Overall<br/><br/>Overall I'd say it's an ok remake of the original, but I won't be rewatching it anytime soon because I'd much rather just watch the original. I don't understand how a lot of people were hyping so much over it saying it's the best remake ever. Even if the movie had lots of good points it had lots of flaws as well, so it just didn't really have the 'wow' factor for me overall.
It's not a bad film, but it's also not a good film."

"SilverOrlov","7","0","2","5 September 2019"," This film in itself is relatively normal. But no more than that.
","The first half of the film looks like a very bad attempt to imitate the original Aladdin, with very flat and dumb jokes and very strange songs. Because what sounded in the film, my language will not turn to be called songs. There is such a thing that many creators do not want to understand: what looks beautiful and interesting, and appropriate in the drawn form in cartoons, will look wretched and ""wooden"" in the performance of live actors.
However, the second half of the film already looked normal. Not good, but just fine. Having corrected the idiocy of the first half, it still did not stretch himself out so much that one could say that he was not ashamed of having pulled that original story from the past."

"gyotter","8","0","2","5 September 2019"," Great movie! Best of the Disney Remakes.
","Aladdin (2019) is one of my favorite movies I saw this year, no it's not flawless and yes still one of the Disney remakes but I enjoyed it a lot.
First off I'm not a big fan of the Disney Remakes so I came to the theater with lower expectations (even though it's one of my favorite Disney movies). The movie starts with Will Smith as a mariner telling his kids about the story of Aladdin and sings ""Arabian Nights"" which i enjoyed better than the original (my opinion though) the sequence showing all of agrabah and setting up the world was absolutely amazing one of my favorite shots of the whole film. After that ""One Jump"" happens and the song is good but the sequence is kind of a mess with a mix of slow motion shots and fast speed shots and normal shots it's a little weird but enjoyable. Aladdin is a bit bland at times but I thought Mena Massud did good in the role. And Jasmine is a good character but kind of stubborn at times which (to me) is a little annoying but she's great overall. Jafar is a bit underwhelming compared to the original Jafar but isn't a bad character in this film when you don't compare him to the original. Genie..where do I start Will Smith is back and he absolutely KILLS IT in the role he's hilarious witty and has all the best songs. The Genie CGI is hit or miss, mostly the cave of wonder scenes have the most worse CGI but once he's outside the CGI gets much better. The movie has great songs as I already mentioned ""Arabian Nights"" and ""One Jump"" are both pretty good but Will Smith's ""Friend Like Me"" and ""Prince Ali"" are so great and fun. ""Speechless"" is beautifully sung by Naomi Scott but the scene is very out of place and pointless which is unfortunate because the song is great. ""A Whole New World"" is good I'm still not sure that it's as good as the original. Also probably the most hilarious scene in the movie is the introduction to Prince Ali to The Sultan and Jasmine, let's just say Aladdin gets into a Jam. The Climax is suspenseful and very different from the Original. The Original had Aladdin against sorcerer Jafar who turns into a giant Serpent and has Jasmine stuck in a hourglass for a ticking clock and suspense. The Remake has Sorcerer Jafar takes over Iago and turns into a giant monster bird that chases Jasmine, Aladdin and Abu on carpet flying through Agrabah. Both end with Genie granting Jafar's final wish to be the most powerful being in the universe. Both getting sucked into their lamp and thrown into the cave of wonders. Jafars genie form design in the remake was very weird looking aswell (just a side note). The film ends with Aladdin setting Genie free but the remake has him turn human as well not just free from the lamp, which makes a sequel difficult to write (if they do). In conclusion, Aladdin (2019) is a enjoyable fun exhilarating magic carpet ride that is full of catchy songs, humorous and likable characters and great designs for pretty much everything! I recommend this Disney Remake 100%."

"rickpen","3","0","2","5 September 2019"," UGH!
","I was actually kind of looking forward to this movie. I like Will Smith and was looking forward to seeing how he handled the role of genie. Sadly I didn't make it that far. I had totally forgotten Disney's drive to add songs to movies so they can sell sound tracks. The telling thing is I have watched the old animated one with Robin Williams many times and the music never bothered me that much, perhaps because it was done so well. This cannot be said of this movie. This show actually reminded me of a stage play, and not a very good one. The actors were adequate, but only barely. I don't know what was wrong with the guy who plays Aladdin, he looked sickly to me. The constant interruption of the plot by the actors bursting into song put me off so much I gave up.. I might have to watch a bit more though just to see Will Smith as a quit before he entered the scene. Perhaps kids will enjoy this though as their expectations are much lower."

"nomisz1","8","0","1","3 September 2019"," Best Disney adaption!
","I was sceptical before seeing this one but it ended up being my favorite Disney adaption so far! The harsh critics of this movie were probably hoping for TRUE to the original movie with no new scenes added and probably hoping for award winning performances by the cast. Get over yourselves, this movie is made to be fun and fun it was. The chasing scene in the beginning was great, Prince Ali's entrance to Agrabah was great and Will Smith was a terrific genie. Of course he had big shoes to fill as (RIB Williams) but Will did his part extremely well, acting very similar to the animated genie.
The only problem I had with this movie was Jafar, as he was way too young and not as evil as he was in the animated movie.<br/><br/>... and remember... it says before the final scene... ""Based on Aladdin"", not ""A direct live action remake"" so please don't be too harsh and simply enjoy the movie!"

","As someone who finds the idea of Disney 'live-action' remakes (read cash-grabs) loathsome, and as someone bored to death by their previous Cinderella and B & B live-action remakes, I was very pleasantly swept off my feet by just how much I ended up loving this movie! This is particularly surprising since I watched the movie with the sole intent of hating on everything, only to fall in love with it in just the first few scenes.<br/><br/>When it comes to remaking a classic, there's always a catch-22 : make zero changes and have it be a soul-less redundancy, or make changes and have everyone call blasphemy and hate you. Aladdin succeeds however, by clever story-telling decisions and creating a fine balance between freshness and retaining the essense of the original that everyone loves.<br/><br/>This ingenuity is evident in the very first scenes. I was all prepared to be bored by an egoistic attempt to rehash the introductory scenes of the original that we have all watched 100s of time. Instead, they jumped right into the essence of the story - a sense of awe and wonder that they helped us channel through the kids who wanted to hear a story, following by taking us to sweeping shots of Agrabah drawing us into this magical orient, and finally focusing straight on the story by showing us how Aladdin and Jasmine meet without wasting any time.<br/><br/>Apart from the story-telling, I loved the costumes and sets, the music, the humour, and found all the added elements, like Jasmine's maid friend etc, very entertaining. I think all the cast memebers did great justice to their roles and found the more subdued Jafar somehow more sinister."
"Tahnie1","9","0","2","1 September 2019"," Surprisingly very good!!!
","When the trailer for this live action Aladdin came out, I wasn't so sure if I wanted to see it as I was loyal to the cartoon and Robin William's version of Genie.
But after finally watching it, I was surprised by how well done everything was from the acting, singing, storyline, and Will Smith's version of Genie. It was like the original cartoon only with MORE story. We got more background on Aladdin and Princess Jasmine stories and ambitions. I actually liked the guy who played Jafar. It made more sense that Jafar was younger and more attractive than the cartoon version. Especially since he wanted to marry Jasmine when he became a powerful sorcerer.
In the cartoon version, Jafar was much older and ugly, that even the sultan thought the marriage was inappropriate before being put under Jafar's control with his snake staff.
In the live action, each of the characters were given more story, ambition, and some original songs!
One of my favorite scenes is the dance scene with Jasmine and Aladdin! Both actors did such an amazing job and looked like the cartoon versions of their characters.
I think what impressed me most was the cultural reality of the characters. There was like only one white person in the whole movie and that was one of the visiting princes.
Overall very well done! I was super surprised by how good it was. So don't listen to any naysayers. This is a live action version. So think of it as ""if these characters were real and not a 1992 cartoon version, what would they be like? How would the story be told?""
A solid 9/10. Only reason it's not a 10 is because it was kind of a long movie."
"outcastprincerhone","8","0","1","1 September 2019"," Good remake live-action of the classic.
","As a remake, I would say the deviations from the original was well-thought of. I believe in the idea that films must represent social issues of the present and must deviate in the extreme views of the past. As this aladdin live-action goes way beyond that, I think it exceeded my expectations of what a live-action film of the classic should be like.<br/><br/>Of course, backward thinkers would still think that the animated classic is better. But as a fan of both disney's classics and the disney of today, I am very proud that their classic can be twisted, deviated and can even stand and teach lessons appropriate to the test of times."

","Dont listen to the bad reviews, you know a movie is great when you come out of the theaters smiling and laughing and spend the next week or so revisiting all the songs.<br/><br/>I actually didn't set my expectations high at first because i was never a fan of remakes especially of an already successful and great classic. but i was actually amazed by how well crafted this movie was , they put a lot of passion and care into the details to recreate the original as best as they can in a live-action movie with some pretty enjoyable additions along the way ; the songs are better, the plot was further explored to fill some of the plot holes in the original, and the acting ..GOD! i guess they couldn't find a better cast for this movie not in a million years<br/><br/>Mena is like born to be Aladdin his voice is almost the same as aladdin from the original, Marwan the actor who plays Jafar really stole the show in every min of his screen time , and Will Smith was a solid genie given the responsibility to replace the late robin Williams ..i cant say which genie is better but believe me when i tell you Will Smith nailed it in this movie ..and then comes Naomi Scott ...i think I'm gonna refer to her as Jasmine for the rest of her career ...she was just amazing; her acting her voice her looks... simply amazing<br/><br/>The chemistry between characters was great the atmosphere was awesome and the overall recreation of a Disney animated classic and a fairy tale world was so decent that it left me hungry for a sequel or maybe a genie prequel if they want to ( i would definitely pay to see a will smith genie origins story that's for sure ! )"

"jlevac","6","0","1","27 August 2019"," Enjoyable, but not unique and somewhat disappointing from a nostalgic perspective.
","While enjoyable, and definitely fresh for children/adults who have never seen the original, as someone who grew up with the original Aladdin, and it being one of my favorite movies as a child, I couldn't help but be left with a certain sense of disappointment from this version. I'm ordinarily a huge Will Smith fan, but he just didn't fit the role of the genie for me. Will Smith is many things, but a Disney song singer he is not, and as a result the songs sounded a bit whiny/nasally, and just over emphasized based on his vocal abilities. More importantly though, I would have liked to see them put a bit of a fresh spin on the original story line, not to make it better but to make it their own. You're welcome to not agree with that, and prefer to have it closely resemble the original, but the one thing I can't agree with would be how eerily similar Will Smith portrayed the genie as compared to Robin Williams' version so long ago. For me, out of respect for the great character Robin Williams created for the genie, watching Will Smith try and exactly duplicate the mannerisms and comedy of the original was simply...uncomfortable to watch. If in no other respect, I would have minimally preferred to see the genie character be it's own new spin on it, and at most feel like it was paying homage to the original rather than be a exact but sub par duplication. Do I know what that would have looked like? No. But I'm not a director/producer, so it's not my job to know what that would look like. Like I said, if you haven't seen the original and are being introduced to Aladdin for the first time, this movie is fine and enjoyable. But if you're very familiar with the original, this isn't going to introduce anything new, and frankly the cartoon was able to be way more entertaining in many respects. Take the character of Iago for example; in the cartoon he had complex facial expressions and dramatic flair, whereas in this version he's just a bird that flies from point A to B. And if you were a Robin Williams fan, and are familiar with his unique comedic genre, Will Smith's version of the genie is going to feel like you're watching a Vegas strip lookalike attempt to stand in a shadow that he just can't come close to filling."

","So i sat down to watch this movie with a friend. I loved the original animated version as a kid. Genie was always super fun and made a lot of magic happen. Will Smith as genie was a good cast. He is a great actor. The only thing that was missing was a bit of the magic. I felt the original genie had a bit more POW and FIZZ. And was a bit more like clowny? But you gotta remember that the original was a animated movie made for kids, which of cause gives a lot more freedom to do that sort of thing more easily. But Will Smith still made it work. And he made the songs into his own. Aladdin and Yasmin and the sultan was very good in their roles. They looked right and did a fine job acting. Carpet and Abu was good too. Where i felt it was missing a bit was with Jaffar and Iago. It was like they wherent evil enough, there was not enough battle between Aladdin and Jaffar. And Iago actually being just a parrot without the real ability to talk normally was also a bit of a let down. But the scenery and colors and setting was very well made. So its still well worth a watch, but its not a 10 out of 10."

"ibrahim-abdalaziz","8","0","1","26 August 2019"," The movie was really great, but I have some notes to declare
","The movie was great and I very enjoyed it,
As an Arab I noticed a lot of things that made my experience in this movie so good and made me feel that the movie is really talk about ""Arabic"" story.
I actually felt in several scenes that I watch an Arabic movie that dubbed in English (: .
Like using Arabic in background dialogues really made me felt that it is an Arabic movie.
And using Arab origin actors in some main parts was smart idea, because they can pronounce the Arabic names 100% correctly, but they still never pronounced ""Aladdin"" correct, Aladdin actually pronounced like : ""Ala'a Addeen"" , first name ""Ala'a"" , last name ""Addeen"" , just to know /:.
Also using Arabic ""and real Arabic not just random pushing at an Arabic keyboard like I saw in a lot of non-Arabic movies"" scripts in some scenes . Rarely I see non-Arabic shows show a whole Arabic sentence without a typo or Grammatical mistake but in this movie the whole Arabic scripts that used were right and it is so impressive to see that , even in the scene when the genie shows the rules of the kingdom it was really talking about ""A member of the royal family should just married from a royal family"" and not ""just random pushing at an Arabic keyboard"" like I said.
Back to the point about using Arabic in background dialogues I noticed that they used Arabic nowadays dialects especially Levantine and Egyptian dialects which weren't existed yet in the time where the story happened, if they just used MSA would be more realistic and convinced.
And dress style for girls and dances were actually more Indian style than Arabic , when they started dancing I felt the movie started to style a little bollywoodian way and not Arabic, but rather than that the movie made me really feel ""that the movie is really talk about ""Arabic"" story."""

"charlesuniversity","7","0","1","25 August 2019"," Poor Nostalgia
","Disney has been making their previous 2D films to live action films and Aladdin is one of them. The live action Aladdin is just a copy of the 2D film, i.e. there is no new themes added to the story, except for some frivolous details. The film's magic is not close at all to the original and shows how some movies cannot be easily adapted to live action. Aladdin had a cast that was very disappointing except for some like Mena Massoud. He was charming and funny in the film, I would also say Will Smith was casted well as genie, he was zany but showed a sensitive side like in the original. Nasim Pedrad was quite a good addition though I feel her potential was not at all used to full extend. Actors like Naomi Scott tried their best but it all felt staged, Naomi does not look at all ethinic and right for the time,but the brunt of the movie was undoubtedly Jafar, played by Marwan Kenzari. The British accent and not at all charming or wicked face just made me want to watch the original. The setting was very well done and the dances was choreographed very well. However, the transitions to the next scenes was so poorly done. I wish Guy Ritchie studied more about the culture because middle eastern culture is very fascination and the movie did not showcase it. history and Now the songs were well sung and I like all of them except speechless it felt like very stupid addition. It felt like the movie was trying to scream that Jasmine was a strong independent woman, also the tune was not memorable for me.My favorite part of the movie is when the genie sings ""A friend like me"", it was super entertaining. In conclusion, this was successful romantic Disney movie though I would prefer to watch the original movie."
"charlesuniversity","7","0","1","25 August 2019"," Not Revoloutionary
","I think Aladdin did not get the perfect crew. They have not handled this story with care. However, it is still a good movie due to its acting and aesthetic. Mena Massoud was the best in this movie, he was a charming and funny street rat. However, Naomi Scott was not as great as Mena. The problem is that the casting of Jasmine was wrong and I wish they used a more ethnic Arabic actress. The genie ( Will Smith) was actually well casted, he was zany and emotional like in the original. The villain (Jafar) played by Marwan Kenzari is what made the movie not good. Jafar was forgetful in this movie. Marwan did not study Jafar very well and he felt very one-dimensional. The editing was not perfect either. It shows that Guy Ritchie (director) has not studied musicals very well. A whole new world was sung very well but the video was not breathtaking, it was not scenic at all like the one in the original. The additions to the movie was also frivolous and forgetful, like the song solo, which was not memorable."

The Great and wonderful Robin Williams can never be replaced, so thankfully Will didn't try, he just did his own thing and did it well. I'd agree that at times his acting seemed awful, really awful. But I think we can put that down to CGI. He did look as out of place in some parts as Carrie Fisher does in the latest Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>Overall, watching it with my 4 year old, who, in all honesty is more the target audience than most people complaining about the movie, we loved it.

","Initially put off by an early teaser trailer with Will Smith as the blue genie (his face didn't quite track with his muscular body, which is CGI), after the movie's release I heard that Will Smith is in human form half of the time, too, and it was fine. An additional trailer was later released showing Will Smith in his human form, too.<br/><br/>Now, many reviewing the film say actually Will Smith was the best rather than the worst part of the movie, and he carried the film. For me, however, Will Smith's performance as the genie was typical of the actor, a return to early career performances like in ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" ""Wild Wild West,"" ""Men in Black,"" ""Hitch,"" ""Wild Wild West,"" and so forth. Will Smith is a charismatic and likable actor, and I like this side of his persona, but his role in ""Aladdin"" was nothing groundbreaking for him. So in this sense I wouldn't say Will Smith as the genie was the best or worst part of the film.<br/><br/>I did however appreciate the remix of the genie to suit a more hip hop style, with the baggy pants and the break dancing and so forth. But even though the filmmakers did change genie's role to suit Will Smith, it still seemed as though they tried to get Will Smith to match Robin Williams's frenetic energy at times, and it was to me a partial remix instead of a full remix, and there was an inconsistency in that. Will Smith is a calmer, down to earth genie, who doesn't quite have the range to hit the mania Robin Williams might.<br/><br/>In many ways the movie ""Aladdin"" is like the almost debacle of Will Smith as the genie, and his there-but-not-quite-there redemption. How do you please a fan base of ""Aladdin"" (1992) movie fans, while offering something new, while not being able to be offensive to children or to Arabs, while not being able to be truthful to Arab culture as a powerful patriarchy, while also supporting Disney's female empowerment agenda?<br/><br/>With these constraints, what Disney came up with is something neither here nor there, while often skirting the bounds of the powerfully wrong and then sometimes the amazing but also ridiculous (the odd placement of Jasmine's ""Speechless"" song and her arc afterwards), but then also hinting at some of the truer realities of Islamic culture (while ""women should be seen not heard"" is not something only particular to Islam/Arab culture, it is part of their doctrine much of the time) which is pretty ballsy of Disney you have to admit.<br/><br/>The experience of watching ""Aladdin"" is sometimes bizarre because it's like watching part of Arab culture but then like a constant backpedaling so that we know we're watching fictional Arabland ""Agrabah"" rather than any real place, so it's impossible to give criticism because Arab culture is alluded to but never referenced.<br/><br/>However, despite the mish-mash of ideas, and the generic not-Arab allusions, the powerful story of magic, and love, and control that is the story of Aladdin and the genie still comes across. More than the other Disney remakes I've watched so far (""Cinderella,"" ""Beauty and the Beast""), ""Aladdin"" has real dramatic tension still in a way that wasn't completely flattened out. Here, Aladdin could potentially have turned into someone like Jafar. In other films, Disney heroes don't have quite this chance to become someone real and disappointing. And you get why. If you really had a genie, who would let him go?<br/><br/>Disney had a challenge, and at least this time they pulled through. I say Disney had a challenge rather than Guy Ritchie, the director, had a challenge because ""Aladdin"" is compromised and patched together in a way I don't think a guy who has made intelligent hustler or heist films like ""RocknRolla"" or ""Snatch"" or ""Revolver"" or even ""Sherlock Holmes"" would've wanted.<br/><br/>This isn't the first time Disney cast the right director then (likely) contradicted their vision enough to make something unrecognizable of them. Kenneth Branagh, who directed ""Cinderella,"" had successfully adapted many Shakespeare films to the screen, like ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and ""Henry V,"" often writing the screenplay himself and acting, too. You telling me the guy who managed to make ""Much Ado About Nothing"" fun and watchable, even using Shakespeare's original poetic language, couldn't make a bare bones story like Cinderella? Please. For me, Disney really has to be getting in the way because the directors so far have all made much better films prior to their Disney remake movies (Bill Condon directed ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Chicago;"" Jon Favreau directed both ""The Lion King"" and ""Iron Man"").<br/><br/>But anyway, with ""Aladdin"" you have a movie that is average, and not excellent, but is not as flat as other Disney remakes so I'm giving it a better score. 7/10"

","Aladdin was one of my favourite animations that I love when I was a kid. As English language isn't my mother language, so, when I watched the animation when I was a kid, I didn't get the plot that much. So, without understanding that much, it can be said that I watched blindly. Even so, I kind of loved Aladdin. The main thing why I love Aladdin animation is Genie and magic carpet which are really cool. So, when I saw that the live action was coming out, I was kind of exciting to see it.<br/><br/>Aladdin story is based on the love story, but what made me interest in the story was Genie and magic carpet. Because of the power they have, they are really cool. I kind of sometimes wonder why Genie only grants for three wishes? Why not two or four wishes? 😁 And also I always wonder if I got that, what would I wish for? 😁<br/><br/>The casts are basically fine, but it's kind of weird to see Will Smith as Genie. Although Genie's body is kind of big, but I didn't expect that big. That's why I feel like it's kind of strange to see. And also I don't quite like Naomi Scott as Jasmine. I don't know about her acting in her other films, but she's not that good as Jasmine. I feel like she doesn't fit in the role. So, I prefer the animation for this part.<br/><br/>Although Aladdin is a fine film, but there's one biggest flaw. ""Do you trust me?"" part is the most important part of all. That was how Jasmine recognised prince Ali is really Aladdin. In the animation, it was fine. But in the live action, there was no the first ""Do you trust me?"" part in the scene where Aladdin and Jasmine tried to get away from those guards. If there's no that part, how the hell Jasmine recognise prince Ali is Aladdin? And also saying ""what did you say?"" (when Aladdin invites her to ride on the carpet with her) becomes nonsense. So, I'd say there's a big flaw.<br/><br/>All in all, Aladdin live action is quite similar to the animation version. There's no difference between them and it can be said it's a fine film. So, I kind of loved watching it."

","I guess everyone will have to come to their own opinion as to whether it was any count. This is just mine.<br/><br/>Aladdin is one of my favorite Disney films. It came out when I was a teenager but it was so magical and had such great songs, I don't see how anyone couldn't have like it.<br/><br/>Robin Williams as the Genie was absolute genius. He was the stand out from the film and there would have never been anyone else that could've done it better. It was HIS role. Knowing that, who wasn't worried about how Will Smith would do with his portrayal of the character? I know I had my doubts.<br/><br/>There's no way he could've topped Robin Williams. He just couldn't do it. He was going to have to make it a role that was reminiscent of William's yet all his own. He did just that.<br/><br/>I must say that when he made his Genie appearance, I was a bit underwhelmed by it. However, further into the film I found myself feeling more and more better about it. It was hard because even while I was trying to judge the performance in comparison to William's, there are just some moments that I just couldn't help myself.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the rest of the film for a moment. I thought that the choices for Aladdin and Jasmine were well suited. My only problem with those roles were that Aladdin, as weird as it may sound, didn't stand out as much as I felt he should have and Jasmine seemed to have a bit too much sass. Neither of them came off as vulnerable as I wanted them to.<br/><br/>The rest of the film was vibrant, had a few new songs and some of the details had changed. There really was a great effort to keep it just as magical as the animated while making it a film all its own.<br/><br/>Some folks may want to complain about the CGI stuff but I didn't find it all that bad. It was going to be hard to create the magical aspects and I felt that the things that used CGI for things like Raja were kept as minimal as possible.<br/><br/>Considering how challenging it was going to be, I thought it was well done and I personally liked it. Will Smith didn't top Robin WIlliams and I'm glad he didn't. Robin Williams left us with some awesome performances that just shouldn't be topped and Genie is one of those performances. It would've been amazing to have seen him in this live version but I'm thankful that he left us with all he did. I appreciate that Will Smith didn't try to over do a complete cover and put his own twist on it. Props to him. It was big shoes he was trying to fill and he gave us a decent Genie."

"EDiepenhorst","5","0","1","10 August 2019"," The few goods things came from the original
","Aladdin has always been one of my favorite animated movies, I know it by heart and thought perhaps that this might influence my judgement. I went in with an open mind and tried my best to view this without remembering the old however I felt this movie was not meant for people who had NEVER seen Aladdin before.<br/><br/>The storytelling is paced, some parts are done at the same time which takes away our ability to relate and understand these characters and thus make us think they are real people. While at some points and especially at the end things get dragged out too long, by the time they do this as a viewer you don't really feel anything for the characters and just want things to hurry up already and end.<br/><br/>The songs are good, as in the original songs are that have been remuxed and perhaps changed an octave every once in a while. All the newer bits however; you recognize them right away as non memorable and forgot about them soon after they are sung.<br/><br/>Will Smith is pretty okay in the film and he's the only memorable character IMO in this entire movie. The CGI is great but the city still feels small and more like a theater stage.<br/><br/>I am not sure what this film tries to be; one side is a children's movie for kids that however is fast paced and unemotional and on another a nostalgia movie for kids who have seen the animated film but who are now adults and tries to lure us in with the exact same tricks and not adding anything up par or higher compared to the 2D movie. If anything the original is still a 100x better, this is an okay attempt but so unoriginal that I seriously wonder if Disney has too much money that they are spending it on such expensive CG when honestly I would rather see it spend on something good instead."

The animation movie was really funny, I've enjoyed that a few times. It has a good script and 3 main characters that make you laugh: the genie, the monkey and the parrot. This movie lacks two of them at the least. I have to admit, Will Smith does his part, but still can't keep up with the almost 30 years old blue cartoon genie.
Having seen what CGI is capable these days, it's sad to see how little the creators have utilized from that.
If I have to choose which one to watch again, I'd choose the old animation anytime without doubt."

"IrisHale24","6","0","2","17 July 2019"," Mixed Feeling about the new movie
","I rate this movie to 6, as it was a bit disapointing since i am a disney old classic.
Nevertheless, i realised that Disney, had in mind the Broadway Musical and a lot of scene seemed similar to the musical. Moreover, the movie invested to give Princess Jasmine finally a song, that was accordingly to her character and a feministic turn. The creators, though, didn't include Prince Ali(reprise).. I mean seriously? It's the ultimate villian song after Be Prepared(Lion King). What about the sand glass?
Finally, i got that the creators of the movie wanted to create a new legacy for Disney, which was interested and enjoyable fro some points. But one thing it's true. Jafar was like a last minute casting choice and the writing of the character was not flattering his acting as well. No motives in his actions, just a sudden outburst for power.
I loved the Will Smith's Genie and the carpet as well! Finally, the new additions to the movie, like Princess Jasmine servat girl (we saw her on New Girl and loved her), was an amazing touch to a final happy end for our genie.
Furthermore, Disney's choice for traditional dances was terrific and it's something to expect in Disney's future movies!"

"gambitxmn-99928","6","0","1","12 July 2019"," Some good, some bad
","How can a movie possibly be so good to some and so bad to others. Makes one stop to question motive for the review. Anyway.....<br/><br/>To be fair, I'm not a huge Aladdin fan to begin with, so going to this movie wasn't high on my list of things to do today. Nevertheless I went. Entertaining? Yes it was. Choreography was particularly impressive, and not just the dance scenes. The opening scenes of Aladdin at work as a thief was actually fun to watch.<br/><br/>Casting was superb, though Mena Massoud had the look and dance moves of Aladdin, but missed on most everything else. I didn't feel like he (the actor) had a firm grasp of who he wanted his character to be. A thief, especially a good thief, is usually confident in himself to a fault. A good thief would believe he could pull off the rouse of being a prince. I get the story line - an otherwise sure-of-himself kind of guy is caught off guard by love, but in the scenes where Prince Ali meets Princess Jasmine - there was no hint of any confidence ever existed in Aladdin., which made it sound well, bad. Could be the impact of micromanaged directing, hard to say. Either way, it was excruciating to watch him in some scenes.<br/><br/>Naomi Scott turned in a very good performance as Jasmine. Most will talk about her solo ""Speechless"", and deservedly so. Unlike Mena, she seemed to have a clearer understanding of her character and played it well.<br/><br/>Will Smith was fun as the Genie, and I thought he did very well for what he was asked to do. I'm not sure he was the best selection for this role, and in fact, I think he's the ""American hook"" - the A-list star who will draw people to the theater no matter how good/bad the movie is. Surprisingly he sings - and raps - but even the rap is sung a little bit. His singing is not the best, but kudos for stepping outside of his comfort zone and trying something new. This fact alone may turn off people.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was put together as if Disney has been paying attention. All of the main characters and a good number of the supporting cast looked like people who would have been from that part of the world (exception of course is Smith). Kudos to Disney.<br/><br/>Costumes and scenery were quite colorful and pleasing enough to watch. You'll know what I mean when you see Prince Ali's grand entrance.<br/><br/>As for the story - meh at best. I didn't really feel the tension between the Sultan and his number 1. You know it's there but just not enough attention paid to that dynamic. The blossoming love affair was a bit hard to watch, mostly due to Mena Massoud's portrayal of Aladdin. Awkward is one thing. Awful is another.<br/><br/>Would I go see it again on my own? No. Would I take my grandkids - absolutely. Which leads me to this advice. If you LOVED the animated movie and you want the live-action to follow the same script - then save your money. This movie is not for you. This movie is for a new generation or those who can accept a different interpretation that the one you're used to. So, take your kids, or anyone who's never seen Aladdin before, and just let them enjoy it (i.e. keep you opinions on the movie to yourself)."

"cupofsoulshow","7","0","1","11 July 2019"," We Miss Robin Williams
","Aladdin debuted in 1992 to great fanfare mainly because it was revealed that Robin Williams would portray the Genie. The role was tailor-made for him. The comedic genius that was Robin Williams not only embodied the Genie, but his performance was so worldly that the Golden Globes created an award for him.<br/><br/>We fast forward to 2019, and a new live-action version of Aladdin is released. This movie wasn't exactly receiving the positive anticipation of the 1992 version. The trailer of a very blue Will Smith as the Genie certainly didn't help matters.<br/><br/>Aladdin the 2019 live-action version isn't horrible. A couple of things to keep in mind to give this live-action version a fair shot doesn't compare it to the 1992 version. Second, keep in mind that Robin Williams was a comedic genius and that Will Smith could never duplicate that performance. If you accept one and two, then you're in for a fun time.<br/><br/>Things I loved about this new version is that they cast actors of middle eastern/Indian descent. Mena Massoud is charming as Aladdin. Naomi Scott is a powerhouse to contend with as Princess Jasmine. Her voice is out of this world. Her and Mena have a natural chemistry. Marwan Kenzari as Jarfar was one of the new changes to this version of Aladdin. He is younger, more attractive, and not as mean. One can't fault Kenzari for that, but I was expecting more darkness. Navid Negahban portrays The Sultan. This time around, he's more serious, and I wish they would have kept some of the humor. Naims Pedrad as Dalia provides the comic relief that missing at times. She is the perfect wing woman to Princess Jasmine. The role of Hakim also has been upgraded and is nicely played by Nusman Acar.<br/><br/>I purposely saved Will Smith as the Genie for last. The smartest thing Will did upon accepting this role is to carve out a new identity for him. He created a Genie that infuses his strength. Will Smith is charismatic and funny in real life. Those are the traits mainly featured in this Genie. I also liked that he stayed in his musical zone. It's not that he's a lousy singer, but it's merely not his strength. He also infused his hip-hop background into the musical portions; this makes his singing more enjoyable. I still feel that the blue coloring makes the Genie look second rate. The effects aren't flattering.<br/><br/>I wish they incorporated more of the Bollywood style throughout the movie not just in the musical numbers. Speaking of the music, Speechless is a new song that was added and is beautifully sung by Naomi Scott. Alan Menken collaborated with Benji Pasek and Justin Paul for this new song. Menken also updated the score to reflect the scenery displayed in this movie. Even some of the lyrics in the songs were updated to reflect today's environment.<br/><br/>Is the live action version of Aladdin a home run? No, but it's also not horrible. This movie will introduce a whole new generation to Aladdin while helping an older generation reminisce. The songs are still catchy, and you will find yourself singing along. Aladdin is not excellent, but it's a solid effort by all involved, including Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>Diversity: This movie receives a 7 for diversity. All the major characters were portrayed by people of color. I wish more of the extras were of middle eastern/Indian decent.<br/><br/>Scale: This movie gets a 7 for sheer fun"

"wesleyarledge-86836","8","0","2","9 July 2019"," Fun, Dazzling and a True Wonder!
","I'll admit, I went into this with a little apprehension. The Original Animated Version is one of the standout pieces of the Disney Renaissance, mostly because of the standout performances, the scenery, and the songs. I went in wondering how faithful the filmmakers would be to the original animated film.<br/><br/>Within the first 5 minutes, my worries were put to rest immediately. I was in awe of the Scenery, the music, and the colorful costumes and characters! The music is a return to the classic songs from the original animated film, but each song also is composed a bit differently, and sounds slightly different than the versions from the animated film, which is also a good thing!<br/><br/>Will Smith thankfully does an impressive job as The Genie, the role made famous by Robin Williams. However, Will Smith doesn't try to be as funny or quick witted as Robin Williams was in the role, but he shines in his own unique way, bringing some of the same rapid fire jokes, but ultimately playing The Genie in a loving homage to Robin Williams' portrayal of the character! The other two standout performances in the movie for me were Naomi Scott as Jasmine, and Marwan Kenzari as Jafar. The filmmakers really took steps to really flesh out those two characters this time around, with Princess Jasmine feeling trapped but ultimately wanting to stand up for the common people of Agrabah, and Jafar wanting to turn his seductive powers to conquer other Kingdoms.<br/><br/>This film also mentions other Kingdoms, and how Agrabah and the surrounding Kingdoms are almost ready to attack each other in a war-like standoff. Which explains why the Sultan wants to have Jasmine marry a Prince from a different kingdom: for the promise of Peace between Kingdoms.<br/><br/>What makes this film special is that although parts of it may be familiar, and is a retelling of the Animated film, there is an expanded story and there are parts of this movie that aren't in the animated film, and like the Cave in the movie, a true Wonder to behold! Disney has truly done it again!"

","I can only repeat what so many other reviewers have written. Robin Williams left a deep footprint in the Aladdin story. Robin had a larger than life personality that made his characters come to life. Any other actor would pale in comparison. That being said, Will Smith is likeable, he's a good actor, and he absolutely bombs (stinkbomb) in this movie. In watching any of his other roles, I haven't cringed nearly so much. I'm not sure who to attribute blame to. I'm hesitant to blame the cast. Most of these people have truly excellent voices, yet their singing feels wooden. The songs are heavily recycled from the original cartoon. I had actually hoped to see some creativity there. Jasmine is very loudly declared to be the next ruler of Agrabah because.. uh.. wouldn't she have been in the first movie as well? You know because Aladdin isn't royalty so.. ah well, gotta virtue signal.<br/><br/>Fun fact: 'A friend like me' nearly mirrors the original 1992 version.

","Aladdin (2019) has had a lot of problems going into its release. A poorly-received initial trailer/teaser was the starting of a press run that frankly, made me nothing but uninterested for the film.
Needless to say, I wasn't planning on watching it but due to certain circumstances, I ultimately wounded up seeing the movie dubbed in the local language with a couple of my friends.<br/><br/>So.....was it worth the $5? Umm, kinda.<br/><br/>You see, it's a Disney live-action film through and through. It's a crowd-pleasing cash grab. The Mouse has made sure that your eyeballs are glued onto the screen for most of the runtime. It offers enough musical interludes and dances to sustain the attention of the 12 year olds that comprise the movie's target demographic. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about the film per se, but I cannot help but notice the sheer amount of hard work that has been done by the production department. The costumes, props, etc. were all A+. But that's all a given considering it's Disney money.<br/><br/>The director has done an 'okay' job and the actors are all pretty fine. (pun intended)
Interestingly enough, Will Smith was probably one of the best things in the movie. He has the perfect amount of charisma and bravado to pull off the role of the Genie!<br/><br/>The writing is sloppy and the story runs out of steam rather quickly as the villain is so poorly-written, in comparison to the Jafar of the original Aladdin, who was so much more menacing. The ending doesn't have the required tension and emotional weight, either. Really bland, imo.<br/><br/>Regardless, Aladdin (2019) is clearly a good business decision on Disney's part as live action remakes seem to be their thing as long as they keep doing well at the Box Office.
Ultimately, it's a good time with the family and has enough frills and fancies to keep those little ones engaged.<br/><br/>PS:- Don't watch the original before going to the cinema. You would only be disappointed with how certain elements don't really pan out well in the live-action."

","I wasn't impressed with the trailer at all.
It just passed me by, actually, while watching another movie, it was so forgettable (for me) that I actually forgot that I saw it - I remembered the trailer while watching the movie itself.<br/><br/>My girlfriend made me go see it.
She never saw the animated version, so I said why not. I usually picked every single film we've seen thus far, so I really couldn't object much.
We are both way into our 30s, by the way<br/><br/>And from the first scene on, I was blown away.<br/><br/>I have no idea what made me love this film so much.
I like it more than every other life version of their cartoons, and even more than the animated versikn of Aladdin.<br/><br/>It's so well made, colourfull, and magical.
I even liked the songs, which I usually don't.<br/><br/>I felt like a little kid again.<br/><br/><ul><li>I must add that this is not my type of genre usually.</li></ul><br/><br/>But there is just something here that is so beautifull, and it really works.<br/><br/>Go see it.

","A disservice to the original masterpiece - kind of like an overpriced fancy restaurant (appealing on the surface but lacking substance).<br/><br/>Here's why:<br/><br/>Pros (slightly above average): 1) good visuals, 2) decent remix of the original plot, 3) good choreography, and 4) SOME decent quotes/dialogue.<br/><br/>Cons (extremely below average): 1) horrible directing (film felt long yet rushed) and 2) horrible casting (Will Smith is capable but missed the mark in terms of combing humor AND empathy and the casting/acting/chemistry between Aladdin/Jafar/Jasmine/Sultan was horrific)."

"waitandhope","8","0","3","17 June 2019"," It's good but not great!
","The visuals are amazing but in 2019 that's to be expected with all the technology at their disposal, especially Disney! So that leaves us with the acting and storyline, which unfortunately felt rushed in the beginning and led to a rather poor energy throughout the entire story. They made the main characters get close to fast without enough time spent developing them beforehand. I understand it's following the original story closely but I have a hard time believing the connection was so strong and it shows onscreen also as they seem to be following one-another in shock most of the opening. I'm afraid the actors didn't have the required chemistry early on and it led to a poor start.<br/><br/>The thing is Aladdin got better as it went on, but Jasmine I felt was looking through him the entire time, it felt she was acting rather than really there. Similar to Will Smith's acting, I felt like it was him acting not the actual genie. That's why most of the film is miscast, they chose people who are good singers or popular talents but not good actors, I can guarantee if this movie was cast based on acting talent it would've been 10x better.
I was never afraid of Jafar like the original, here he felt like a bully and not dangerous in anyway. I kept thinking just push him off the building and the stories over, come on!
I am not sure how they picked the actors for this but it's just not working, Will Smith can't sing this part that well, it sounds pretty bad IMO, maybe he sings ok other times but here it's to low and gutteral for me to buy it. I also already said I felt it was him acting or trying too rather than the actual character.
I give it 8 stars for being fun to watch but -2 because it should've been 10 easy but the lack of good casting and choosing talent over other concerns led to a movie I won't rewatch, the original is so much better!"

They are probably just disappointed that Robin Williams can't be in the new one, seriously Robin was great in the first one, he was a great actor!!!! But Will Smith is also a great actor and when he plays any character he puts a million percent into it. And Aladdin is no different. He put his own spin on the part, he did things differently because he knew he wasn't Robin Williams. Will deserves recognition for doing such a great job of being the Genie. Time to stop with the bad reviews, if you don't like Robin Williams not being in the movie, don't go see it, you know darn well he isn't in it."

"Riley-H","6","0","1","16 June 2019"," A Delicate and Faithful Work
","Well, admit it. There are undeniable charms in animations that cannot be matched, compared, or imitated. Disney's remake of its 1992 masterpiece 'Aladdin', however innovative, lively, and visually stunning, proves insipid in the grand shadow of its former original. There is no denying the great effort the film crews dedicated in the making of this 2 hours live-shot feature, in the face of such subtleness and devotion in the aspect of editing, production designing, cinematography, custom designing, and of course, visual effect. Despite a few flaws that might be there in the actors acting and the structure of the story, if one wants to look too critically, the 2019 Aladdin has presented us a whole new world. But in the amazement it has to offer, I still miss the purity of animation, where Genie can do whatever magic tricks that even the best of nowadays CGI technology finds difficult to oblige, where Abu and Iago can do the funniest facial expression with their hand-drawn eyes, where the film set can switch from concreteness to abstraction as will. The same thing occurred to others of Disney's adaptation as well, such as 'Beauty and The Beast'. The limitation of live-action forces the film makers to alter the script to great length, changing 90 minutes into more than 120, while trying every effort to outshine every original detail and element, which the fans would be so agitated to miss. Every song in the 1992 animation was inserted perfectly in place, some slightly recomposed, some adding new lyrics and instruments, rendering brand new musical effects. I am thrilled to see Alan Menken back to the studio once more. After all, edition of the script means the needs of a entire set of scores to be recomposed. Menken even added a new song - as well as a reprise - for Jasmine to sing solo. A very beautiful song as it is, however, it is not hard to see from which the great length Disney would go to voice the now prevalent theme of feminism. This is of no doubt important, but is it worth compromising the layout of the entire art piece? Altering an already well-laid story is risky enough without the burden of conveying public messages. Feminism is a good thing, but why cannot it be inserted flawlessly like that in Frozen and Moana? Overdoing it at the expense of losing grip on the story is, if anything, a dangerous sign."

There are several moments when the camera are just not in the right place and not showing the perfect view. I guess the director had few experience in capturing the emotional aspect from a certain camera perspective. He didn't zoom in the camera when he's supposed too. Instead the camera positioning is just quite far that it shows the ackwardness of actor body movement or gesture. Hey dude, ZOOM IN the camera during the emotional singing scene!"

"raptorcruz-91826","5","0","1","13 June 2019"," Entertaining as a whole, but Disney dropped the ball on this one.
","Maleficent (though a completely new story) was amazing.
Cinderella was just bad.
Beauty & The Beast was a masterpiece.
Jungle Book (my absolute favorite Disney film) was a complete let down.
Now Aladdin.<br/><br/>As a whole, the movie was entertaining.
I was concerned about casting Will Smith as Genie because even though I like Will Smith movies, he usually tends to want to make things about himself when he's not the leading role.
However, I will admit that Will Smith and Mena Massoud (Aladdin) saved the movie. While there was a lot to like, there was much more not to like.
Overall, the production seemed rushed. I feel that had Disney separated Aladdin and Lion King on different years, they could have done a better job. But as usually, Disney = $$$.
My biggest complaint isn't the story itself. My biggest compliant is that all the actors were soooooo bad. I understand Disney trying to make a full cast of Arabic descent, but it was hard watching them.
Naomi Scott (Jasmine) was just so gorgeous in this movie. She looks ok in the trailer, but she is just so beautiful throughout the whole movie. However, she was so robotic.
Jafar's character actually had the most interesting character development which made the movie a lot more interesting. However, even if the goal was to give a serious sinister type character, Marwan Kenzari did not pull it off.
I can go on and on talking about every character. While I understand Disney's motivation, and think it is nice that they wanted a full cast of Arabic descent, but they could have done a LOT better. There are a lot a lot of talented Arabic actors. And if not, there is always Bollywood.
I just think they dropped the ball with the casting choice.
Though Mena Massoud wasn't too great of an actor, he sounded so much like Aladdin and really felt like Aladdin.
Will Smith wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. He definitely can't sing. His singing was pretty bad! But he was ok. They could have done better with a really animated comedian like Jim Carey or Jimmy Fallon. But Will was ok. However, I don't know what was up with the cgi. For 2019, genie's cgi was really dated. His face movement was really weird.<br/><br/>The music part was outstanding. Though Will Smith was bad at singing, with the exception of Friend Like Me, I found all the musical performance to be incredible.
I didn't like that they added a hip-hop beat to all the Will Smith songs, but it's ok. Prince Ali and the dance between Jasmine and Aladdin were just WOW!! It was super impressive!<br/><br/>In comparison to the original movie, there are a few points that really made the movie two dimensional.
Abu, Iago, and the final fight.
Abu and Iago really made the original animated movie funny and fun. Both of these characters in this version movie were just.. props.
The final fight between Jafar and Aladdin was super rushed. It was very disappointing. There was no build up at all.<br/><br/>And lastly, one aspect that was really missing in this movie was the relationship between Aladdin and Genie. In the original, they formed a bond. Which is why Genie saved Aladdin from the ocean. And why at the end it was emotional.
They never really form that bond in this movie.<br/><br/>Sure, it's worth watching. But Aladdin being one of my favorite Disney movies, it just didn't do it for me."
"thebricks","6","0","4","13 June 2019"," Disney's ""Woke"" Nonsense starting to affect the quality of their movies
","The live action adaptations of the Disney movies are a great idea being ruined by the social justice warriors running the company now. Beauty and the Beast was set in the 18th century and featured minorities all over France in the town Belle lived in, some even in high-ranking posts they had no chance of realistically holding in those days. Princess Jasmine all of a sudden has her eyes on becoming a Sultan and even has a ""girl power"" musical number? Really guys?<br/><br/>Now, you would think that Disney would follow the formula in Beauty and the Beast and cast all sorts of races as the townspeople in Agrabah, right? Nope, everyone is either Middle Eastern or black, which is believable for Arabia in the Middle Ages. So why get so militant about blatantly misrepresenting 18th century Parisian town demographics and history but then faithfully cast Agrabah with historically accurate demographics? Practice what you preach because you're hypocrites.<br/><br/>The Jasmine ""girl power"" nonsense didn't sit right with me either. I wanted to walk out. It was so obnoxoius. It may be a good reason the box office as well as the reviews for this movie suffered. It was just incredibly stupid and unrealistic. If Disney continues in this direction, I will not watch their movies anymore. I'm not paying money to be lectured by liberals.<br/><br/>I felt Will Smith was miscast. I love him but this wasn't right for him. Mena Massoud as Aladdin did a great job, Naomi Scott was upstaged as Jasmine by Nasim Pedrad, her handmaiden. That's not supposed to happen! Nasim was a far more believable Jasmine than Naomi. total miscast! The rest of the casting was spot on aside from Disney's hypocrisy with casting the townspeople. If you're going to set the tone that it's a fantasy and people of all races can be anywhere, do it in all of your movies or you will look foolish, thanks."
"zuben-95852","7","0","1","12 June 2019"," Aladdin - A timeless classic attempted to be reimagined
","Fist let's start with the positives, very nostalgic making me want to go back and watch the original. The climax itself did not live up to the build up in my opinion. Also random musical numbers (two by Jasmine) that were not in the original which had nothing to do with anything which did not contribute to the story. Another negative was the fact that the whole theme of the movie is you have to speak out. That's not a bad thing it's just not like the original where it was just a harmless Disney movie with a message in itself that wasn't so blatantly obvious as this one was. But back to the positive there were some very nice references to Magic Kingdom at Disney World in there which I liked. There were also some recognizable lines in the background if you were listening for them like I was.

Casting the genie was always going to be difficult after the pure genius that Robin Williams poured into it, and I personally never bought into the Will Smith character. Aladdin grew on me during the picture. Jasmine was the warrior the feminists needed, but I personally wouldn't have fallen for her.<br/><br/>The sets were pretty glamorous, but the scale of the movie felt vastly inferior to the original. Nowhere was this felt as fully as on the magic carpet ride, which is the original's exultant moment, touring the world's wonders. Here they went on a little spin around the neighbourhood and decided the local bazaar was the best place on earth ... please!<br/><br/>It's rare that repeats match their originals, and unfortunately this one fell considerably short.

They get some new characters or replacement characters and they're honestly quite good. The Genie gets a human love interest and it's resolved in a very clever manner. We get more insight on Jafar with how he wants to conquer other kingdoms.<br/><br/>Now here's the negatives. Iago was one of the funniest characters in the original and he's waaay less entertaining here. I remember the awesome climax in the original with Jafar turning into a giant snake and the Genie rooting Aladdin on! Here, none of that happens. The pacing isn't that good as it's too spread out for a two hour movie and probably could have been the length of the original film. Well, those are the goods and bads for this movie! **1/2"
"jaycwilson93","6","0","1","10 June 2019"," As a movie its good, as a Aladdin remake it dropped the ball
","The acting was fantastic for the most part.
The music was subpar, it felt super slow and not the right upbeat pace for the movie. Jasmines two extra songs were basically the extact same and didnt quite flow right.
The storyline felt rushed in some parts and to slow in others. I really wish theyd kept the storyline the same as the cartoon.
Overall it was a good movie but I left the theater not feeling 100% satisfied."

"mark.waltz","5","0","3","10 June 2019"," Colorful combination of the original animated production and the Broadway hit that works except on two levels.
","For the remake of Disney's Aladdin, the filmmakers get pretty much everything right with the exception of the photography and one major piece of casting. Much of the photography resembles the Universal films made in the 1940's with Jon Halll, Sabu and Maria Montez, and for that reason in many places it is beautiful to look at on a nostalgic level . But as with many films of this type today, the editing and camera work is frenzied and often too fast-moving, and at times, the film becomes extremely blurry. This makes it difficult at times to pull up many of the major details and in some of the musical numbers, particularly the ensemble numbers, trying to capture every element of it becomes difficult.<br/><br/>For example, in a friend like me, so much is happening that when you want to see everything, it begins to become difficult to do that and that makes it both frustrating and headache inducing. However, on the other hand, the Prince Ali production number is beautifully put together as if it were Elizabeth Taylor arriving in Rome as Cleopatra and every element of that is a 10 out of 10. For a whole new world, while it is said at night, much of the effects are set among photography that is too dark and certainly the lighting could have made it more profound.<br/><br/>Casting wise, it took some doing but I found Mena Massoud charming as Aladdin and Naomi Scott appropriately feisty and strong as the independently minded Jasmine even though her actions would have had her imprisoned within the castle walls in real life. The evil Jafar, as played by Marwan Kenzari, has incredible magnetism, even sexier than Massoud, but he is lacking in the humor of Jonathan Freeman animated villain. Of course there is going to be a comparison of Will Smith to Robin Williams, and in avoiding doing so, I still found his performance to be bland and basically just phoned in. He has no sparkle and seems to be just there, only briefly coming to life such as the finale where Aladdin grants him a gracious final wish.<br/><br/>There is so much to like here, but it is also too much of everything to try to capture in one viewing, and it really isn't worth the time or cash to go back to the theater to see it again. It might play better on video where the details aren't as huge. The opening scene makes it seem like you're about to see something out of pirates of the Caribbean, another Disney franchise, and ironically, part of the ending of this film made me think that they might try a sequel. Disney, please leave well enough alone and let sleeping Jafar lie."

"irfanreviewfilms","5","0","1","8 June 2019"," This live-action remake is not able to deliver the same original magic seen in its animated predecessor, but when it does, it felt more like a romantic comedy - when it is bus
","If you thought that director Guy Ritchie would bring no small amount of grit or courage to the fairy tale world of Disney, you would be mistaken. His take on the live-action remake of Aladdin, the latest in a series of remakes - we've just had Dumbo and Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King joins this list in July - is a big-hearted fantasy musical with a gorgeous color palette and a strict moral code which tries very hard - but sadly does not quite succeed - in improving on the studio's 1992 animated original.Despite a couple of large, genie-blue stumbles along the way, Guy Ritchie's live-action version of Disney's ""Aladdin"" is on balance a colorful and lively adventure suitable for all ages and a touching romance featuring two attractive leads - Aladdin & Jasmine - and has enough creative musical energy to introduce this story to A. Whole. New. World. Before anything else, there is, of course, the titular, Aladdin. He is a kind-hearted street urchin with a panache for stealing and a natural skill for parkour that seems ripped out of the otherwise charmless Assassin's Creed. Aladdin is both scrappy, determined and smart, and when he runs into a beautiful new friend who has gotten into a spot of trouble at his local market - a vibrant, colorful set which is obviously crafted on a soundstage. Obviously, he will help her get out of the situation. Soon enough, the pair are running, swinging, and singing their way through their home city of Agrabah, all to the catchy tune of the soundtrack of One Jump Ahead. While the mechanics of the meeting have been slightly altered and changed from the original animation film, even audiences who are not familiar with the 1992 animated hit will surely see what Aladdin does not: that is no regular gal, that's Princess Jasmine.Despite a few adjustments, the plot of the animated story remains the same: Aladdin is dispatched and sent off to a terrifying cave to retrieve a gold oil lamp for the crafty Jafar, who promises the young ""street rat"" a chance with Jasmine for all of his hard work. Aladdin finds the lamp, only to unintentionally keep it for himself. Will Smith's Genie comes into existence and strike up the insane song-and-dance sequences, and get jamming on a concealed identity narrative device that drives forward a zippy, lively and fun second act. While Will Smith does not appear as the Genie until the first hour, the propulsive nature of the film before he arrives on the scene keep things pumping right along until he arrives to blow the whole thing up with humor, charm, and astounding sequences that looked, quite frankly, totally insane when they were edited for television advertisements. The genie is not gay per se; in fact, the Genie gets a romantic subplot of his own, involving Jasmine's handmaiden, Dalia. Watching Smith's performance, one could certainly make the case that the closet can be even more confining than a magic lamp, although kids will see the character's prancing as a kind of silly clowning, which it certainly is. Halfway through this film, the titular character sits uncomfortably on a Rose Parade float while the Genie in his human form leads a ramshackle and tumbledown chorus in a spirited but mediocre rendition of the beloved tune, ""Prince Ali"". It is not the best scene that this new Aladdin remake has to offer, and it is certainly not the worst, but it is probably the key to decoding and unraveling the entire production. To be straightforward and harsh, this is not a movie. It is a cheap and of poor quality revival, specifically designed to appeal to audiences who think that, ""that looks familiar"" qualifies as entertainment. 2019's Aladdin looks so familiar that, if anything, it is hard to imagine why Guy Ritchie wanted to make it. Disney seems to have smoothed out all the wrinkles in the director's familiar, if sometimes oppressive style. Textured lighting schemes, dynamic speed-ramps, and energetic montages are omitted. In their place are flat pastels, straightforward action, and long-take musical numbers. If you did not tell anyone who directed this version of Aladdin and surveyed the audience afterward, no one would have guessed it came from the director who directed 1998's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, RDJ's Sherlock Holmes or even 2015's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. The whole production seems to take place in a forgotten hollow space within Disney's Adventureland, a highly sanitized faux-urban sprawl where the poverty-stricken look fancier than anybody reading this review right now. It is a nice place to visit, the port city of Agrabah, but if you lived there, you would be bored now. Nonetheless, most of this new Aladdin is tolerable, even inching toward borderline entertaining. The musical scenes are decently shot and staged with a light, bouncy energy that almost justifies the film's bloated run time - 128 minutes is a stretch for any kid, let alone an adult stuck in a theatre full of kids, but everyone just might make it out of this one alive. Each frame is drowning in vibrant colors and packed with so many decked-out extras to the point that Aladdin's environment seems less like a typical CGI-enabled sound stage, and more like a real, actual, if bombastically stylish, world of its own. If you don't think about it very hard - although you probably should-, the remake of Aladdin might entertain you. But you would be a heck of a lot more entertained by watching the original films again. Or by going to a real-life parade. Or by watching Netflix. Or by reading a fictional book. In spite of that, there is ultimately nothing here that overshadows the original and plenty that will haunt my dreams forevermore. I suppose that in the current situation, where Disney's market dominance and supremacy is unavoidable enough to inspire any further Disney productions to be misfired, this counts as a win. I wish it were not so, but then I'd be down to just two wishes. I will save all three for something special instead. Haha. But honestly though, Jasmine for Sultan of Agrabah? I concur. She is the right leader at the right time!"

But Marwan Kenzari as Jafar gives the most underwhelming performance. He just isn't intimidating enough, and isn't that interesting to look at. Everyone else doesn't really go much of interest.
There's only one new song (which is just there for that Oscar nomination), ""Speechless"". And as far as emotional power ballads go, it's not bad. Most of the covers of hr original songs, are good, but nothing special. Visually, everything is alright, just very bright and a little harsh on the eye.
Overall, Aladdin is good enough, but is just another bland Disney Remake. Is there any hope for ""The Lion King""? We'll just have to wait and see."

Despite that, the new Jasmine felt a bit forced to be this independent woman, but that's not Naomi's fault. The writer forgot to put a likable trait other than her being independent, so it felt a bit stiff. The speechless part was also kind of unnecessary, for it to play twice.<br/><br/>Mena (Aladdin) has ups and downs, some scenes he's good, some looked like he's just acting. Will Smith was actually not that bad, I can see kids will remember him as their Genie. He did not try to be Robin Williams, and Instead put his own personality into the character.<br/><br/>This movie is targeted at kids, so I will see it as a kids movie. It was because of that fact that maybe the director decided that it should be less serious, and more entertaining for kids. And it did achieve just that.

Will Smith will always be Will Smith, cheerful and funny.<br/><br/>Some of the visuals are really incredible, with the introduction of the city Agrabah, we can feel the liveness of the city and how beautiful it is. Now I can't compare it to the genie itself. I would prefer to see will smith as normal will smith than a weird ass smurf as a floating head. Our minds can detect these things when we feel something is off and when we see something that is trying to resemble another actor with different proportions it will trigger our minds to say that it feels weird, maybe rubbery or even not even close to what we expect. There were a few shots like when we see the genie for the first time and I will be honest they were amazing, but when we see him as almost human size, it really turns it off that magic of him.<br/><br/>Taking that aside, I would suggest you watch the animation. Until now, it still feels incredible with good storytelling, building up the characters, such as the importance of the magic carpet and Abu, and the amazing Robin Williams as the genie. The Magic on the animation feels stronger in this one.<br/><br/>** SPOILER FOR THE FEWS **<br/><br/>I felt really sad when I saw the magic carpet dying on the animation, it made me really care about that object. But in this movie, they already killed it before its own magic and couldn't care less about it when it died in this movie."

The story has been refined further than before, less cartoonish while keeping the charm of having a flying carpet and a genie (well played by Will Smith).
Still little goofy things such as Indian dance moves passed as Arabic, no biggies.
Except for one thing; The royal scroll has the text written in Arabic which is normal since the whole story is supposed to take place in a Baghdad like place, but they used the font ""Arabic transparent"".

","Nothing will ever compare or come close to the magic of the original, but this was a job well done. The casting was about half way. Mena Massoud was fantastic as Aladdin and Will Smith brought his own to the genie. The main problem with the movie is that it was too ""Indian""! Aladdin is Arabian. Two very different cultures and mixing them is no better than white washing. I'm not normally one to complain about this sort of thing, but it was so blatantly obviously wrong! From the dancers and costumes to the casting, they completely missed the mark on Arabia and instead delivered an almost Bollywood rendition. The bigger problem with the movie however, was that it was not really ""Aladdin""; it was ""Jasmine""! The movie tries to do feminism and makes a bold statement with ""Speechless"", but it doesn't really deliver. It did not fit into the movie's original storyline and seemed quite out of place and very overdone. The movie ends with an ""all about Jasmine"" theme and if the movie weren't titled ""Aladdin"" I would have thought it was done from her perspective. If it were more subtle and woven better into the storyline it would have made for a better fit and not stolen the spotlight off Aladdin."

Smith gave his own spin on Genie and I think he would've made Robin Williams proud with his portrayal. Where the film has issues is in the CGI and the direction. Will Smith's blue genie CGi didn't look great and some of the shots with Abu and the carpet didn't look the best. Guy Ritchie's direction didn't really go well with the film. For example, during the One Jump Ahead scene, his directorial style shines through and it doesn't work well with the song or sequence. Also one major note was Jafar's portrayal. Nothing against Marwan Kenzari's performance, he did fine, but with the way Jafar was written he wasn't menacing and creepy like he was in the original. He was just a guy trying to rule. Also Iago looked fine but I just couldn't get behind Alan Tudyk voicing him. Aladdin was a fairly good remake, but here's hoping that The Lion King beats out The Jungle Book as the best Disney live action remake."

","Let me make a break down of the political (Social) agenda of ""Aladdin"", a continuation of The Year of The Empowered Woman, and how she will make the world a better place. The name of the of the story is ""Aladdin"" but the story is really about Jasmine, and how she yearns to rule her father's Kingdom.
There are four main characters. Three men and one woman. All the male characters are weak.
First Aladdin, a ne'er-do-well who aspires to be a better thief, until he inadvertently takes control of the Slave of the Lamp. Then Aladdin wants to be a Prince, with little ability.
Then we have the Evil Jafar, the Grand Vizier who wishes to take The Sultan's place, through Magic. With not a care as to who he kills to get there.
Then, The Sultan. A weak man, easily hypnotized, and with no idea he is being manipulated. There is no back story here, to see what he did to achieve his leadership. But I'm guessing he had a strong father, from whom he inherited his position. The Sultan wishes for his daughter to marry another Prince, that can then take his place.
Then there is the beautiful Jasmine, the brave, outgoing, rebellious girl, who would like to become The Sultan herself, with no regard for an arranged marriage. With no apparent training or education, to handle the job of ""Sultan"".
There are two more characters in this story, the Genie and Jasmine's servant girl, but since they are both slaves, Greek Theater dictates, they are of little consequence.
This story takes place in the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah, but in the source material ""1,000 and 1 Arabian Nights, I think it took place in Baghdad, which is in Iraq. Is it cultural misappropriation for there being no Iraqi actors in this movie?
There is also the pile of peasants living in the Arabian city of Agrabah, all owning wonderful washing machines, how else to explain the bright vibrant colors of their clothing.
SPOILER ALERT.
It is the Genie's infatuation for Jasmine's slave girl, that causes things to happen.
Jasmine, in the end, does become The Sultan in the Arabian city of Agrabah. A continuation of The Year of The Empowered Woman."

The CGI was obvious but did not disrupt the flow of the natural characters and events. The music was on point and each character has a wonderful singing voice.
This is a 9 star review so there really isn't much to say for negatives in my opinion. I don't think the ""Wont Go Speechless"" song was necessary the second time. It is essential for establishing the strength in her character but it comes across as a temper tantrum the second time.

It made sense that he became human after he was set free and it works better in a live action setting, and as a way to frame the story<br/><br/>-I think Will Smith was at his best, humor-wise, as the genie during the parts where he was giving Aladdin relationship advice<br/><br/>Some of my critiques, which did not really ruin the movie for me, but I just thought these could've been done better:<br/><br/>-Jafar's wish to become the sultan I thought was pretty weak. He could've just wished to become a powerful sorcerer right away without wasting a wish on a title<br/><br/>-the ending, I thought, could've been better. They could've done more with the ""grey area"" thing that the genie hinted at, like maybe having the genie sabotage Jafar by misinterpreting his wishes<br/><br/>-this is just a nitpick, but I felt in some sequences, they were using visual effects to match the animated version instead of just generating original visual effects that look great in live action. What looks great in animation might not necessarily look great in live action - like the genie's hand making a walking figure in the ""Friend Like Me"" sequence, and Aladdin being treated like a puppet on a string.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was pretty good. I give it a 7.5 but it could very easily be an 8."

","SONGS, SONGS, and SONGS.
The whole movie travels with the songs, starting off with the kids' storytelling hence it gives a bit of the fairy tales feels.
This clearly indicates that it was purely targeted for the kids whose native language is English.
But, why did they copy the Bollywood formula? Yuck. Bollywood is going down the lane, boss.
Although it has some of the finest animations and is definitely a visual treat to have watched in IMAX, the core concept being one of the renewed, the movie could've been made much more interesting by introducing few more characters like the naughty monkey and with few more twists and turns and instead of showing the mouth's of the characters singing, the scenes could've been elevated by showing something else and combining all of these pieces of advice would've kept the audiences engaged."

","As the name suggests, this movie was a remake of the famous animated story of a poor boy Aladdin who falls in love with a princess and tries to win her using a magic lamp. As far as remakes are considered, this is by far the best remake I have ever watched. The musicals, the magic, the screenplay, everything was completely enthralling! And Will Smith just added his perfection to the movie. Mena and Naomi also did justice to their respective roles, especially durung the musicals. I tried for hours in finding out some lag in the movie and the only shortcoming I could find was that there could be more importance given to the lamp and genie so as to make the story more logical. Ignoring that, the movie was a perfection. 9/10 from my side."

"dinesh-mungra","7","0","2","3 June 2019"," Fun enough
","The filmmakers profit from the story development of the 1992 movie, not a lot is changed so they had the wind in their backs as ar as making the story work (Thank you Jeffrey Katzenberg?). Acting is decent enough across the board. Naomi Scott shines as Princess Jasmine. The Prince Ali number is well executed and is one of the high points of the movie. Will Smith seems to hold himself back a little compared to the Robin Williams version of the Genie, but he is still funny enough. I think Marwan Kenzari did well as Jafar. His take on the character is more subtle and nuanced, but less humorous than the animated version. Iago the parrot is also not very funny and a step back from the Gilbert Gottfried version. For some reason, a lot of the action plays in and around the royal palace, making the movie feel constricted. More exterior scenes could have made it breathe."
"southdavid","7","0","3","3 June 2019"," You better rub me the right way.
","This really felt like a hiding to nothing. A largely unnecessary remake of a classic animated feature, full of classic songs and featuring a paramount performance from Robin Williams. Add to this that Guy Ritchie's recent run of films has not been good, and the shaky images of Will Smith as the Genie that were released a few months bank and it felt like a recipe for disaster. But ... I'm happy report that though not without flaws, I enjoyed ""Aladdin"" a lot.<br/><br/>Aladdin (Mena Massaud) is a thief surviving on the streets of Agrabah with just his wits. The Sultan's advisor Jafar (Marwen Kenzari) sends Aladdin to the cave of wonders, to retrieve for him a magic lamp. However, Aladdin becomes trapped and once accidentally rubbing the lamp himself frees a magical Genie (Will Smith) who grants Aladdin three wishes.<br/><br/>There is lots to love about ""Aladdin"". The production is great, with Agrabah feeling like a real city. The effects are actually pretty good too, the single still of the Genie didn't do it any favours but as in the animated film, he's constantly changing size and shape, particularly during the musical numbers, and for much of the film he pretends to be a regular human too, so loses the blue altogether. The cast area really good, and there's a nice chemistry between Massaud and Naomi Scott, who plays Princess Jasmine. Though rewriting the Genie's style of humour helps a lot, Smith doesn't really come close to catching Robin Williams version of the character, and the songs style don't suit him either. (I winced a little at the start of a couple of the genies numbers).<br/><br/>If, for whatever reason, you're only allowed to see one version of ""Aladdin"", the animated version is still the way to go, however, as a companion piece or curiosity, there is much to admire in this version."

","If you are thinking of watching this movie based on the original, pls don't.
I honestly was expecting a Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland type of crap, but i think this is an actually amazing film.
Its so different to the original, yet so similar.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of this film is definetly the cast. They didn't try to remake the original characters.
Will Smith is absoluetly amazing and i loved how he made his own version of the genie. He pulled it off perfeclty without messing w/Robin Williams Character. My absolute fav of this movie.<br/><br/>Naomi Scott had a difficult Job remaking one of the original Disney princess, but i think she did an amazing Job.
This new feminist/strong/humble princess is amazing and specially really inspiring to young girls. The message in this character is powerful and i think that its a really cool way to teach girls that they can be pretty and a super badass at the same time.<br/><br/>Massoud was my biggest fear of this movie, but he really surprised me.
As much as i wanted Avan Jogia to play this role, now i truly prefer Massoud as Aladin.
He takes the bravery and awesomness of the Cartoon Aladin to a whole new level.
Hes super sexy, funny, goofy but in a really cute way. I loved him.<br/><br/>The music still gives me goosebumps.
The colors and all the details make this movie one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>I think its really hard to make an amazing movie when the original is already a masterpiece, but this one shines in his own way.
Just beacuse it lives by the same storytelling, it doesnt mean it had to be identical to the original.
Im so glad i watched and i hope everyone who saw it, ejoyed it as much as i did."
"meghac23","8","0","2","2 June 2019"," Has an identity of its own!
","Absolutely loved this movie. The feminist message rings loud and clear. Naomi Scott puts in a fantastic performance as the independant minded Princess Jasmine. Aladdin is charming and nimble in the well choreographed sequences. Will Smith reminded me of his role in Men in Black with witty one liners and ample enthusiasm. The chemistry between these three actors was wonderful. ""Speechless"" should be the next ""Let it go""! So far Perfection.
Now for the drawbacks. Jafar Jafar Jafar! Where do I begin. The actor playing the role was completely miscast. He neither had the look nor the voice to play the evil and greedy Jafar. The animated version had a compelling and hypnotic villain. Except for the lines spoken by the live action one, there is nothing in his acting and body language that justifies those lines. I actually believed the actor playing the role of Hakim would be better playing Jafar. The second half also seems to drag a bit in parts. A tauter screenplay would be better.
My advice: The positives far outweigh the flaws. Go watch it!"

The film is enjoyed from beginning to end, with good musical numbers, magic and the best performances by Will Smith, Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud, they have very good chemistry. Everything that the trailers see is different on the big screen, with respect to the genius CGI and the VFX, visually stuning. Enjoy the character of Dalia, funny, sympathetic. With respect to the new song ""Speechless"" I thought it was a good addition in this live action. Naomi's performance touches the heart of anyone and it really comes. ""Prince Ali"" different, colorful, splendid. Undoubtedly, until now one of the best live action.

","Back for the 1st time. The 2019 Aladdin pays homage to it's 1992 animated counter part. If you are a fan of Robin Williams and are put off by Will Smith's take on the character, take solace in the fact that Will Smith clearly respected his role of Genie. Aladdin, Jasmine and the whole cast had took this movie to a whole new world while keeping you grounded on the original Disney story. It was like seeing the tale through a vague deja vu. Meaning, you know the plot and story, but there are subtle differences that keep entertained. A brilliant family film. Take your kids ( of all ages.)

"burnsgalen","8","0","3","2 June 2019"," I Will Not Be Speechless
","At first, when I realized that Aladdin was being made into a live-action film, I was extremely skeptical because of the most obvious thing... you can't replace Robin Williams. His role is so iconic that I always felt no one could touch it, but I went in because Aladdin was part of my childhood growing up with the Disney classics.<br/><br/>I am pleased to say that the movie surprised me and made me very happy to have seen it. As Will Smith promised in many interviews, he did his own thing and never tried to step on the toes of the original. I believe that there is something to be said about the live-action remakes. Disney never tries to replace the original, maybe modify it, correct some mistakes, but do something fun with great material from the Disney Renaissance.<br/><br/>Will Smith did get me to laugh, in fact most of the jokes in the film landed well with the entire cast, with the exception of the now awkward and infamous ""jam"" scene, it was rather cringe inducing.<br/><br/>I loved how colourful the movie was, it made it eye-popping and interesting to watch. The costumes were fairly culturally accurate for a story representing Middle Eastern and Arabic cultures, although I cannot say much on that myself. I believe the crowning jewels were Jasmine's dresses were beautiful and amazingly detailed, I especially liked how her iconic turquoise outfit was made to represent a peacock.<br/><br/>The CGI was well-done overall, despite the uproar that fans had when seeing Will Smith as the blue genie. The effects helped the story stay true to the magical elements of the story; I especially loved how they kept some of Genie's fun antics of duplicating himself and other magical tricks in the story.<br/><br/>The chemistry was on parr for all the characters and I loved how they fleshed out Jasmine further; her power ballad is beautiful and I suspect it will be nominated for an Oscar in the future. I liked how she had more to contribute to the climax and wasn't a helpless damsel in distress the entire time like in the original. I also enjoyed that the Sultan also attempted to help in the end and didn't just sit around and do nothing like in the original. I would like to have seen Jafar fleshed out more, agreeing with several other reviewers, but if they ever made a sequel, we could hopefully explore his life more. I'd also have loved to see the Genie and Dalia spend more time together, further enhance the relationship, even if it was in the background of certain scenes.<br/><br/>However, if I had to pick something that I didn't like, it was Iago. No one else could play him except Gilbert Godfrey and Iago was also a comic relief character who is now just a standard squawking parrot who repeats and sometimes says his own thing. If I could write a sequel to this, I'd have it so the Genie could modify Iago's voice to become Gilbert Godfrey again.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed new and small details added into the movie such as Carpet building the Disney Logo, Genie putting DisneyWorld on the map, Jasmine's iconic blue dress being meant to represent a peacock etc. When I see it a second time, I'm sure I'd catch a few more Easter Eggs.<br/><br/>And lastly, if you haven't noticed already throughout my review, I would like there to be a sequel, and usually I can be pretty picky with those. I believe that there is more to be explored and most of us know that the Return of Jafar sequel leaves a lot to be desired. While King of Thieves is better, it could still be improved. I wouldn't object to mashing the two sequels together by Aladdin's father accidentally discovering Jafar's lamp and the villain attempting to get his revenge. I know since the changes made in this film would cause for some further changes in the sequel, like the Genie now being human, and the forty thieves crashing Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding, but it could be made to work.<br/><br/>Some suggestions could be with Jafar back, Genie is forced to become the magical entity again to stop the villainous deity. Perhaps Aladdin and Jasmine are expecting their first child and with Jasmine ruling Agrabah, Al feels overly-protective of her and also shoved to the side as he doesn't understand the royal life. There are many possibilities.<br/><br/>Don't let the nostagia and love for Robin Williams stop you from seeing this film, it marches to the beat of its own drum and is worth the price of admission"

","I loved this movie! Everything was amazing! The visuals were stunning and beautiful. A Whole New World had some of the most beautiful shots. The cast was also well picked. Mena Massoud was so charming and reminded me of the original Aladdin. Naomi Scott as Jasmine was gorgeous and brought a lot to the character. she was really relatable and had an amazing voice. I also enjoyed the Sultan and the handmaid Dahlia. She was hilarious and her relationship with Genie was cool to watch. Will Smith was the perfect choice to play Genie. He wasn't trying to replace Robin Williams but instead made the character special in his own way. Robin would be proud. Carpet, Abu and Rajah were also really cute. The songs were also really well done. Jasmine's song was really powerful and I felt nostalgia with the others. I actually sang along with the movie.<br/><br/>Now, we must talk about Jafar. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM??? WHAT HAPPENED TO IAGO???? Jafar is my favorite Disney villain of all time and they RUINED him. Not-Jafar (what I'm calling the live-action version) is so boring and monotone. He has this actually pretty relatable backstory that's similar to Aladdin but they do nothing with it. Remember how Jafar had some really funny lines in the original movie? Remember how he turned into this huge snake and was literally insane? Remember how he and Iago kept going back and worth with each other? Well, Not-Jafar is none of that. He's not even that sinister. And Iago? Well screw him because he only speaks when it's convenient to the plot. Where's the Iago who kept complaining all the time? Not-Iago is so dull. And Not-Jafar's ""genie"" form, if you could call it that, is hideous. It reminded me of all the times a movie just enlarged a person who's character was supposed to be a giant or a god from the Percy Jackson books. I was visibly angry during the movie. I yelled at the screen because Not-Jafar was so awful.<br/><br/>conclusion: love the movie but Non-Jafar and Not-Iago suck."

"JurekK","6","0","2","1 June 2019"," Aladdin
","This is a pretty good movie as a standalone. But as the live-action version of the beloved original Disney animation, it is sorely lacking in several areas. Firstly, the cast. For one, the whitewashing is pretty bad, such as with the actress who plays Jasmine, and her acting left a little to be desired in the way of portraying Jasmine's initial irritation with Prince Ali. I don't feel Jafar was encapsulated that well at all. The Sultan was a decent choice, and for Aladdin, Mena Massoud was pretty all right, and was at least from the correct region of the world. His singing and performance were pretty good overall, though I still felt something was missing specifically from his portrayal of Aladdin.<br/><br/>The worst part of this movie is it's rushed. It rushes through parts that have the most charm in the original, and Aladdin realizes the errors of his increasingly power-hungering ways far too quickly. There was also no iconic fight with Abu as Aladdin temporarily became more selfish in the original. This leaves the movie feeling like it's missing a lot of heart.<br/><br/>As for Will Smith as the genie... Overall, he's got the spunk for it. But not the theatrics. When he sang ""You're gonna love this guy"" from the song ""Prince Ali"", he had none of the jazz-handy finish that Robin Williams did, nor did it even feel close in a lot of moments. He certainly was not a bad choice, and hardly anyone could've done Williams's genie justice, but regardless, it is noticeable that genie just isn't as kooky as in the animated version, and it leaves the film feeling less crazy and lively.<br/><br/>Also, what on earth was with the dancing that genie made Aladdin do? I get it, it's modern and a joke, but break-dancing? Really? It completely ruined any immersion to see such modern takes right after what had been a more old-style dance.<br/><br/>The live-action version of Aladdin is neither here nor there. Ultimately, I'm not a big fan of it as an Aladdin movie, but it stands okay on its own."

","I was defenitely not expecting this, Guy Richie never disappoints and neither did Will Smith. I usually don't write reviews but I just had to. It was so wonderful to see this story from my childhood become real life action. The colors, costumes, music... a whole other level. It's funny and heartwarming. The performances were brilliant, coming back to Will Smith, I was not ready to see him as the genie but this exceeded my expectations. Mena Massoud is the most perfect and charming Aladdin and Naomi Scott is a powerful beauty. I totally recommend this film!"

","This was a fun movie, all the singing was great, stayed true to the original in most ways, funny at times and never really felt slow. However the third act was meh. It almost felt like they started getting carried away with having too much fun then we're like oh gosh we have to finish this soon. Will Smith was fine in the jokes and acting, and not being blue he was great. However his face on the blue genie was not right and looked straight up bad to be frank. Disney has cgi source material like Thanos to use as an example and they came up with that? Either way though kids and a lot of parents won't care. There was a few scenes of cgi elsewhere that looked rubbery but overall a fun great movie. Just don't get me started on Jafar. Great actor but he sucked in this movie."

Aladdin and the king of thieves.
She loved seeing the Aladdin the musical and when she heard that this was coming she was so excited.

"Magow-Intermean","9","0","2","30 May 2019"," Aladdin Review
","A notorious 'street rat' Aladdin, feels a deep sense of connection with the Princess of the kingdom he resides in, but upon reaching her palace, he realises that winning her over is going to be tougher than he had imagined.
A local thief Aladdin (Mena Massoud), from the kingdom of Agrabah, falls in love with its princess - Jasmine (Naomi Scott) - and decides to persuade her, but the evil Grand Vizier Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) and chief advisor to the Sultan (Navid Negahban) put forward this condition - Aladdin must bring him the magical lamp and its Genie (Will Smith) that grants three wishes.<br/><br/>The story of Aladdin and the Genie is known to one and all and this live-action adaptation of Disney's animated classic by the same name, which has originally immortalised this legendary tale, is no exception to that phenomenon. The fresh pairing of Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott works and is a welcome surprise as the duo share an amazing chemistry on screen and pretty much hold on to the likeability factors of their respective characters till the very end. Will Smith, the Genie, is a straight up natural as far as tickling our funny bones is concerned but again, it would be criminal to compare him to Robbin Williams's 1992 act in the original movie as the standards set by the late actor-comedian are pretty high.
Jafar - the vengeful villain - is so bad in the movie that he's actually good, and brownie points to director Guy Ritchie for fully exploring and bringing to light the twisted psyche of this greed-filled character, which ultimately makes you wonder - who's the sinner and who has been sinned against.<br/><br/>However, the downside of the whole direction process is that it is somewhat mixed and some of the song-dance sequences look & feel forced and could have been avoided. Despite its grandeur and larger-than-life cinematography-animation, at two hours and eight minutes - the film starts to feel bit of a drag. The momentum, at which the film moves, is yet another problem that cannot be overlooked - all the characters are given ample time and attention to grow and develop, while the ending is wrapped up in a tearing hurry.<br/><br/>Kids born in the 90s, who have watched the cartoon version of this story, will find 'Aladdin' a bit too hard to get accustomed to in the beginning, but otherwise, the film - sans its minor hiccups - is congenial and establishes the 'feel-good' factor from frame one and maintains it till the curtains are drawn."

","I am so happy this movie exists! Way to go to the fantastic young actors, Guy Ritchie, the crew and Disney. My only criticism is I was really hoping to see a tribute to Robyn Williams but Will Smith was exceptional. 15 minutes into the movie I told my son this was a 10 and that Smith would be the only thing that could screw it up. He did not. Massoud as Aladdin was so so good. Didn't think they could copy the smoothness of his character because this movie wasn't animated but they found a way. The real star in the movie was Naomi Scott though. She brought Jasmine from a really cool Disney Princess to a heroine that has a great new song of empowerment and standing up when everyone around her is telling her to be quiet. This is a wonderful movie that should be in award consideration. Take your daughters."

","Aladdin was a fun movie that although took a more realistic approach, stayed true to its source material. Aladdin and jasmine's character both had great chemistry and fit their roles well. And although it is impossible to beat Robin Williams' performance, I felt that Will Smith did a great job. The story was essentially the same, with a few small changes, but those changes felt natural and did not ruin the narrative. Most of the songs were pretty good, even the couple new ones they added still for the most part fit into place. Overall Aladdin was a fun movie that still suffers from the same thing as the other live action Disney remakes; being in the shadow of the original."

","This live-action version of the Disney animated musical based on the story from the Arabian Nights provides enough spectacle and drama to please the eye and mind. Mena Massoud is a very winning Aladdin; the character's singing and choreography are impeccable. Will Smith is brilliant as the Genie; Robin Williams did a great job voicing the character in the animated version, and Smith takes that job up one level. Marwan Kenzari is a suitably threatening Grand Vizier; it is delicious watching him lap up the role. And Naomi Scott and Nasim Pedrad make a delightful pair as Princess Jasmine and her handmaiden Dahlia. Oh, and Abu the monkey is super great fun to watch, even for one who is generally not fond of monkeys. My three favorite songs in the movie -- One Jump Ahead, Friend Like Me and A Whole New World -- were well-executed and did not disappoint.

I may even suggest this surpassed the animated version upon which it was based.<br/><br/>Everything was in place, brilliant casting, brilliant CGI, brilliant music, the monkey the carpet wow. I really cannot find fault anyway in this great movie, except for a strange and inappropriate insertion of some liberal values.<br/><br/>If I was giving out Oscar nominations, one for the director Guy Ritchie and one for Will Smith, best Male supporting actor, for his high camp genie. Not that I'm an expert but the editing was brilliant to.<br/><br/>The whole cast was good but displayed a limited range of acting skills solid but nothing special.<br/><br/>Overall a 9/10 for this charming family movie.<br/><br/>I will however call out the political indoctrination to liberal authoritarianism that has been inserted at places in this movie, this is a result of Hollywood's latest fashion trends of ""Me Too"" and ""Times Up"" movements, these were not present in the 1992 animated version and why have they been inserted here. This is ugly to see in a children's movie where minds may be suceptable to this liberal world view, this aspect is shameful for Disney and needs to be called out for what it is. The song Speechless was just misplaced and cutting out Jafar's banishment song was a mistake. The movie was so much heavier that the original and just not as much fun, Disney must really stop trying to be all things to all men and stick with the story telling."

The movie comes to life when Will Smith's genie hits the screen. He's outrageously funny, and honestly kills this role. DO NOT try to compare to the late Robins William's genie, as they are not remotely the same, and that's the beauty of it. Will makes it his own, and honestly made this movie so much better. The actors picked for the main roles are perfect, and the overall acting was surprisingly good.

I for one like the new scenes and story lines. Admittedly, some of the singing sequences were awkward but what do you expect when non animated characters start singing in the middle of a scene. However, there was some new songs mixed in with the originals and they were all fun to listen to. I absolutely loved Will Smith's Genie!

","This version of Aladdin basically the same as the original, with just a few little changes. I like how in this version they make the princess stands up more for the equal rights of women. But unfortunately the song ""speechless"", imo felt terribly forced and misplaced.<br/><br/>I LOVE Smith's genie in its true form, when he is not big and blue. I can see he is doing his best to differentiate his Genie from Robin Williams'. And i know this is unfair to compare since both was/is amazing actors. But sadly his blue form genie easily overshadowed. For me, Williams' genie still irreplaceable, thus made Smith's seems.... flat. And to make it worse, the CGI was so bad that i cringe inside (Lol) whenever he made any facial expression.<br/><br/>Other low down for me is Jafar. I remember as a kid i could shiver just by hearing Jafar's voice.

"christianolivarez-78828","7","0","2","29 May 2019"," Jafars Face
","Aladdin<br/><br/>Okay so I saw the original Aladdin sometime ago before I turned 10 years old so this review is pretty unbiased. Aladdin is played by Mena Massoud and Princess Jasmin is played by Naomi Scott. It goes without mention that Will Smith plays the iconic genie that was previously played the late Robin Williams. There were some surprising elements in this movie so let's get started.<br/><br/>The movie jumps off pretty quickly. I was surprised that Aladdin didn't get much of an introduction to who and what he is. I was ironically also fooled that Princess Jasmin made such a quick appearance and believed when she said she isn't the princess and is Dalia. The introduction to both characters and love interest all happens in about ten minutes which I thought was pretty quick. It was like somebody put their hands up and said whoa whoa whoa because the movie does slow down quite a bit. Aladdin is charismatic and his bond with the monkey, Abu, really shine through and you clearly get that Aladdin is a good dude and only does what he can to survive. Basically he's not greedy despite the monkey taking Jasmin's bracelet that her mother gave her.<br/><br/>The same is true for the Villain Jafar who is played by Marwan Kenzari. He's introduced very quickly and I wasn't sure what his place was in the kingdom. As mentioned, the movie does slow down a bit and the characters arcs are well established. We know what they want and we're locked in for the ride. In comes Will Smith. I was so surprised by Will Smith. He got so much backlash from the media, but honestly, i think he was the best part of the movie. You can accept this if you accept that this isn't Robin Williams. Simple as that. It was definitely an uphill battle for him and he clearly earned his paycheck. It was a little odd seeing him blue, but it's really not that bad at all.<br/><br/>This does bring me to the set and wardrobe for the movie as well. This is totally a Disney movie in the way that everything is perfect. Despite the set of the scene being sandy and dirty (he is a thief) everybody is spic and span clean. That's probably being petty and I agree. The Set is something that kind of takes away from the movie for me. The set was so pristine that it didn't allow for the disconnect from reality that we crave when watching a movie. Rather than a film, it was almost like a play. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful movie to watch, but the attempt to make it like the animation didn't translate so great film wise if that makes sense.<br/><br/>This brings me to the acting. Now I know that acting is an extremely tough job but some characters fell short. Aladdin for example is charismatic and the skill is obviously there, but the clumsiness and not knowing what to do kind of drags for a while and begs for a relief. Naomi Scott however does a very good job in the acting as well as the singing. She has a great voice and shines in the song A Whole New World. Hands down a great performance. I also felt that Mena and Naomi did have some great on-screen chemistry. I have seen better but it's nothing to complain about. On the other hand, I'm not sure what was going with the close ups and camera angles. It may have been the wardrobe and play like set up that made this feel a bit corny. There's a couple close ups of Jafar that are almost comical and over the top. The cinematography of the film really gives this movie some extra lives. Especially in the climax.<br/><br/>Overall this was a good movie and i did enjoy it a lot. I was pleasantly surprised by Will Smith's performance, Naomi's voice and acting, the brightness and vivid cinematography and Mena's and Naomi's chemistry made for a good movie. With all this in mind I'm going to give this movie 6.8/10."

","A remake done right can be a great thing. Sometimes it can take an already great film like Infernal Affairs and expand on the concepts to make a classic like The Departed. Other times it will only take the base elements in a complete reimagining like John Carpenters The Thing. But any good remake relies on originality, otherwise you just end up with the Psycho remake, where nobody's really sure what point of making it is. But recently Disney has been attempting to copy some of their classics, using our nostalgia for the originals to make millions at the box office.<br/><br/>This brings us to their most recent remake, Aladdin. Odds are you'll be familiar with the story: a thief falls in love with a princess, finds a genie and wishes to become a prince to win the princesses love. Just like the other recent Disney remakes, there's not much new here by way of stories or songs and the focus is more on reliving the highlights we loved from the original classic, whilst adding just enough to the film to keep it technically original.<br/><br/>For the most part, the film is well made on a technical level. There's some great sweeping shots of Agrabah, including a great introductory shot which swoops over the city to provide an introduction to all the main characters in a single take. It's the kind of creative filmmaking that Ritchie has always excelled at, even if he can't always quite find the substance to support his style. And unlike the recent Beauty and the Beast remake the music sequences felt surprisingly lifeless, Aladdin has much more creative movement on screen. Through a mixture of creative camerawork and big dancing set pieces, we're provided with enough visual eye candy to live up to some of Aladdin's most memorable songs.<br/><br/>As for the songs themselves, these are done with varying degrees of success. Will Smith's version of Friend Like Me is able to leave it's own mark with an energised sequence and is quite possibly the highlight of the film. Plus the Arabian Nights intro is redone with some incredible backing music in a way that even surpasses the original film. But other tracks like Prince Ali just lack that same energy and the new tracks feel out of place or completely forgettable.<br/><br/>The rest of the new additions to the film work pretty well, with some extra scenes between Aladdin and Jasmine which helps to give them a more natural on screen chemistry and they give Naomi Scotts Jasmine a far more engaging personality, actually showing her going out of her way to do right for her kingdom and playing a much more active role in the story. Though the best addition ends up being Dalia, Jasmine's handmaiden, who ends up stealing some of the films funniest scenes.<br/><br/>In contrast the rest of the supporting cast like Iago, Carpet and Abu are all entertaining, but never live up to their charming personalities from the original. But the only character who was done poorly was Jafar. The original Jafar is arguably one of the best Disney villains, striking the right balance between being goofy whilst still maintaining a creepy and intimidating presence. In contrast this version of Jafar has neither of these personality traits and is not given anything to replace them either. You know the filmmakers messed up when a rug has a more interesting personality than your main villain.<br/><br/>But the most challenging part of an Aladdin remake was always going to be the Genie. So much of Robin Williams personality was infused into the role that it seemed like it would be impossible for anybody to recreate it. Even Dan Castellaneta, arguably one of the best voice actors working today, couldn't capture the unique spark of lightning Robin brought to the role. But they took the best approach they could have in readapting the character, building the character around Will Smith in the same way that the original film was built around Williams. And in his own rights Will Smith is able to deliver a fantastic performance. He brings the same level of charm he brings to all of his memorable roles and combines it with some solid comedic timing to become the highlight of the film. Smith is not able to live up to Robin, but given that Robin's Genie is an icon of cinema that's probably an impossible feat to pass.<br/><br/>But that's ultimately the main failing point of most of these recent Disney remakes. They rely so much on the ideas created by the originals that they're never able to escape the shadow of the originals. Which is a shame, because with the effort that was clearly put into this film along with the small sparks of originality scattered throughout the film makes me think that if Guy Ritchie and this crew were to have been given more freedom without being restricted by the original Aladdin, we could have had a very memorable film. But instead the film is so restricted by copying the beats of the original that it fails to find its own voice."

Their performance was nice. They changed the attitude and style of Jafar (I do not bother so much) and gave another focus to Jasmin which I liked a lot.<br/><br/>In scenography design was neat, but it felt that Agrabah was small and the Palace too, that was the ""feeling"" that created the atmosphere. As if it had been done in a Broadway theater.<br/><br/>The dances and the songs were ...... meh. Maybe was too frequent and very little ""Flashy"" for how it felt in the animated movie. The same with the parts that should be funny they were (hehe). And the scene that should have been the most romantic ..... weeeeeeeell. Ok I'm not satisfied and I think it's already clear. ðŸ˜…<br/><br/>They left details that were cool and they added others that were not soooo bad.<br/><br/>OVERALL, it is not a bad movie at all, good to see it with the family.

","As a long time OG Disney Aladdin fan (like, I can cite the movie line by line), I found the movie to be pretty damn good. I'd say I was 95% pleased with what it offered.<br/><br/>I think the biggest concern any OG fan has is how Will Smith fills the shoes of Robin Williams' Genie. There are parts where I thought Smith did a good job, I thought there were parts where he tried too hard, and I thought there were parts where they left something ""Genie"" out that really should have been there. Overall, Smith does a good job of not being Robin Williams while keeping the personality with that tinge of Smith personality.<br/><br/>The story was morphed in areas to better suit the movie and it's live action settings and the handling of the adaption was well done. Alan Menken of Disney music fame returns to bring the musical score of Aladdin (which for me helped to define OG Aladdin as a great piece and my favorite) by recreating a score and songs to match the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>While there are things I would like to have seen done, things that could have been done better, and things that shouldn't have been done, I believe this version of Aladdin can live next to the OG Aladdin on my shelf. Many of us will never see another RW Genie nor accept one, I was torn as many are, but the movie, definitely worthy of a watch and the title."

","A lot of people were nervous about this one, myself included. However, it exceeded my expectations. Don't go in with an angry mindset against Will Smith, of course no one will ever replace Robin Williams, and Will Smith never intends to throughout the film. If anything, his portrayal of the genie was all his own with some inspiration from the late actor, but that's exactly what it is, inspiration, not imitation, so relax. They even pay tribute to the classic Genie with a drawing that's shown when they're still in the cave of wonders - I really liked that. Now there's two genies to love.<br/><br/>The movie is different from the original in many ways. There's more to Jasmine's, Genie's and even Jafar's characters. One thing I wish they did was Jafar's snake and genie transformation. He turns to a genie but not red like in the animated film. If Will Smith could be blue, why not make Jafar red ? Jasmine's father is different too; he's not the plump, child-like character from the animated but it still works nonetheless. He's actually more understanding than the original dad, despite that, which is good. The music was done really well. The cast did a wonderful job bringing the classic soundtrack to life.<br/><br/>I can't say enough how much I loved this live action retelling. Well done to the cast & crew who worked on this film !"

The actors did a great job with the material they were given though Jafar was very lacking. Now for the elephant in the room: the genie. I love Will Smith don't get me wrong but his version of the genie just feel short for me. I think the director wanted Will to be Robin Williams. But guess what he's not. And we have to remember that the character of the genie was specifically written for Robin Williams. Will Smith had big shoes to fill and he did a good job but it just left me with wanting more.

","I would like to start out by saying Aladdin is one of my favorite Disney classics. Due to ,in large part, to Robin Williams' genie. I also loved the music as well. This movie sadly never reached the level of the cartoon for me. I'm a little annoyed by the fact they keep remaking these movies for no other reason then for the almighty dollar. Although it was pointless I did enjoy some parts. Will Smith was great as the genie. He made it his own and I appreciate that as a fan. His rapport with Mena Massoud (Aladdin) was hilarious. Mena Massoud did a good job as Aladdin. The real MVP was Naomi Scott in a star making turn as Princess Jasmine. I recognized her as the Pink Ranger from the Power Rangers reboot. She does a great job here with making Jasmine a more thoroughly fleshed out character. Other than just a princess looking for a suitor. In this version she wants to be the first female Sultan of Agrabah. Look for her in November's Charlie's Angels reboot as one of the new Angels. The fan favorites of Abu and Magic Carpet are wonderful as always. Iago and Jafar were the weakest links for me, And the finale being a little lack luster.
This film brings back feels from classic technicolor musicals with grand costumes and sets and plays out more like a stage play than a big budget film. The music was good as the original. There is even a new Jasmine song that was pretty good as well. This movie is kid friendly and kids will love it. While I did have fun with it ,this movie landed in the middle of the road for me."

The jewels were no were near arabic style...they prefer big chunky jewels.<br/><br/>What took me by surprise, was white statue of a cow and calf in the desk of Sultan, it is a very Tamilian hindu belief(south indian), placing that statue in a home brings positive and good vibes to the home. Why I was surprised was when traders came to india, it was mostly the northern parts, the Southern parts were not much sort after.. so the detail to include this was surprising!! I loved it!!

","My wife and I just took our boys to see the movie. Before going, I read the numerous reviews, even though it took me to my younger years and I still wanted to see it. The first piece of advice I can give anyone reading is this. You have to separate Will Smith from Robin Williams before you try to compare the two. Much love to Will Smith beforehand for acknowledging the shoes Robin Williams left to fill. Sadly, if you compare the two, you will be slightly disappointed. Nothing will ever be as good as the original in this case; however, I think Will Smith successfully pulled it off. The songs took me back to my childhood, even though they were given a modern tempo. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges! This version definitely came through for me though and didn't disappoint the least bit."

"Ryan_Barbakins","7","0","4","27 May 2019"," Aladdin 2019: A Whole (Remastered) World (with some new stuff)
","Aladdin 2019 is actually a lot more different than the original than I thought it would be. Sure it has the same songs, and the same plot, but it is different, and good enough to take a look at.
All of the songs are musically alright. I think if they had a little less auto-tune and more personality, I would have enjoyed them more. However the visuals that go along with the music are actually really awesome. The opening montage of the characters during ""Arabian Nights"" was a great way at setting the tone, the exciting chase of ""One Jump Ahead"" had me on the edge of my seat, the pleasing and jumpy visuals of ""Friend Like Me"" was very faithful yet unique to the original, and the Breath-taking ""A Whole New World"" visuals contain Disney's magic.
Will Smith as the genie was a good call. Sure, he is not Robbin Williams, but he really made the movie hilarious by doing his own thing while staying faithful to the character.
This film was definitely a lot more comfortable to do new things (unlike Beauty and the Beast). Jasmine's character was expanded upon in a way that is quite fitting and emotional with the story. The pacing is either too fast or too slow. There is a lot (especially in the beginning) that is very quickly thrown to the side such as the first encounter with the cave of wonders, and Jasmine deciding to go into the town. I think these should have been given their own scenes, because they are big character and plot moments. However there are some parts that really didn't have to go on for as long as they did, and as a result, the film ends up being more than 2 hours. I feel like the original really nailed it's pacing. It knew what kind of a movie it was, and went with it. This movie felt unnecessarily slow or fast at points.
The special Effects aren't really all that good. After a while you get used to the genie's strange look, but when you are forced to look at him for more than 5 seconds it can be kind of laughable in the wrong sense. Also Jafar genie is so hilariously bad, even the kids in front of me were laughing. When the cave of wonders starts exploding with lava, the lava moves so unrealistically fast to the point where it takes me out of the movie. The animals look like animals. Not characters. This is one of the biggest problems that I have with these Disney Live Action remakes. No matter how hard they try, they can never make an animal look better than the animation, because in animation, you are able to personify the animal's looks. If you try to do that with CGI animals (which is something they lightly tried with abu) they look very weird. This is the reason why I am very scared for the Lion King remake.
None of the things I said above were a problem in the original, because you can get away with so much more in animation, and it will look real, because what you're working with isn't real in the first place.
Overall, this was a very enjoyable movie, however it doesn't captivate me like the original does mainly because of the special effects, and because you can't replace Robbin Williams."

","I wasn't expecting much from the movie because the original was never one of my favorites, but woah was I blown away! From the perfection that is Will Smith as the Genie to the absolute beauty of the production I was in awe from start to finish! The vocals in this movie were crystal clear and took my breath away!!! I can't believe the chemistry between the characters and the updates to the story, I mean the new song Speechless sung by the beautiful and talented Naomi Scott has been on repeat for two days now and the magic and legacy Robin Williams left was not destroyed, it was only enhanced. Will Smith made the role his own and really changed the essence of the genie, in a mot necessarily better but just different way and it did NOT fail. The updated depth of each character and underlying feminist message didn't feel pushy but rather a refreshing surprise! Thank you for presenting probably my favorite live-action movie to date! (surpassing even Beauty and the Beast which was another favorite haha)"

"Mike_Devine","7","0","5","27 May 2019"," Not even a horrible Jafar casting can bring down 'Aladdin'
","Another year, another live action remake of a Disney classic. In fact, 2019 sees another three entries in the catalogue, from 'Dumbo' to 'The Lion King' and of course, 'Aladdin.' In Guy Ritchie's take on the 1992 animated classic, we get to see how the timeless story holds up after 27 years. And, not surprisingly, it holds up pretty well<br/><br/>While there was much to be skeptical about based on this take on 'Aladdin,' it actually delivers in a number of ways. For one, there are very few departures from the original. A lot of the action unfolds the way it's expected to, and there are nearly all of the familiar faces that you'd expect to see. The soundtrack is perhaps the highlight of the entire film, with most of the same showstoppers (""Friend Like Me,"" ""Prince Ali,"" ""A Whole New World"") and a few new numbers thrown in, as well.<br/><br/>But it's Will Smith's Genie who really steals the show. No, he can't hold a candle to Robin Williams' portrayal, but he clearly exceeds expectations and injects enough quick wit and wisecracks into the script. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott give great performances, and Nasim Pedrad shows she can make it on the big screen just as well as she can on the SNL stage. The one weak link, however, comes in Marwan Kenzari's Jafar. Talk about a horrible miscasting - Jafar is supposed to be a snappy, devious, crafty villain...perhaps Disney's greatest of all time. The declawing of Jafar is a travesty that never should have happened.<br/><br/>But be this as it may, it's still worth taking a magic carpet ride to see 'Aladdin.'"
"josanjaskirat","9","0","2","27 May 2019"," A warm hug from nostalgia
","Storyline: A street wise boy falls in love with a princess. A power hungry villain bribes to give him everything he wants in exchange for a magic lamp that changes everyone's lives forever.<br/><br/>Characters: Mena Massoud (who is Canadian btw ) as Aladdin is charming and watchable on screen. He gives Aladdin an extra layer of smoothness which resonates well on screen and gives Aladdin that likability that everyone remembers and loves. Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine is spectacular and PERFECTLY cast. She's beautiful, strong, fearless and gives her character the updated feminist flair that everyone needed . Nasim Pedrad as Dalia, Jasmine's handmaiden has a small but extremely memorable role. She nails the nuisances of her character and the scenes with her in it were some of my favourite scenes. The lady is a true definition of having her work speak volumes . Will Smith as the Genie is, as expected, perfect in every way . I love the emotional depth that was added to the character of the Genie and Will Smith carries it spectacularly along with the main comedic essence of the Genie. He lights up the screen every time he's on it and he does complete justice to Robin Williams original Genie character. Marwan Kenzari as Jafar is great. I love the way Marwan delivered his dialogues as Jafar, there was a slow stealth to them that enhanced Jafar's villainous qualities.<br/><br/>Set Design: I'll be straight up and just say the truth: I FREAKING LOVED IT! Whether it was the winding streets of Agrabah or the majestic royal palace, it was all so perfectly magical and sucked me into the Aladdin universe. Honestly I expect nothing less from Gemma Jackson, the award winning set director of Game of Thrones. She nails it yet again .<br/><br/>
Dialogue: Okay, so I love how the Genie has spent thousands of years trapped in a lamp yet comes out knowing and quoting all the recent pop culture references . Makes you live the Genie even more than you did before .<br/><br/>The dialogue has been updated for Jasmine to make her even more of a badass while being a 21st century woke female aware of her rights and freedoms to express and speak . QUEEN!!!!!<br/><br/>
Music: To review a Disney Movie and not discuss the music is the biggest unjustice! Guys, I LOVED THE SOUNDTRACK!!!!! It's very rare for me to continue listen to Soundtracks after watching the movie but after this one I literally can't stop singing it and listening to it on repeat. The soundtrack is magical and updated to suit the current music scene, without loosing its core essence. Will Smith's ""Friend Like Me"" is an earworm and I garuntee it will be stuck in your head too . Naomi Scott's original soundtrack for Jasmine called ""Speechless"" is perfect in every way. When she performed it on screen, it gave me goosebumps...that's how powerful it was . Everyone's favourite ""A whole new world"" is splendid and gives you a warm nostalgia feel . This section could literally go on forever considering there are over 30 soundtracks in the film , so I'll leave the rest for you to discover and experience .<br/><br/>CGI: I honestly don't know what everyone was creating a fuss about, the CGI was great and created some lovely characters like Abu and Raja flawlessly. It's sucks you into the universe and that's what you need .<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Watching this movie made me get in touch with my inner child and experience true joy from seeing a Disney movie after so long. This movie is now in my top three Disney movie and I'll be watching it again and again for a great, stress free time. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone that likes having fun, has a sense of humour and can appreciate great work. Go watch it, love it and have a great time!"

","If you have watched and loved the orginal then this may not fill its boots. But it gives it a great try.<br/><br/>No idea why people are being full on negative about it as its a fun film to watch.<br/><br/>The elephant in the room is obvioulsy Robin Williams is not the Genie. But Will Smith plays it remarkably with his prior successful music career and him obvioulsy being a great actor.

"noir_weizz","6","0","2","27 May 2019"," Just an OK movie
","Probably kids who never watch this movie will like it. As for me, although the movie is neat but it's lacking certain feel (maybe because I always compare it with the cartoon one that got more wacky/vibrant vibe). The songs that good are the ones with intense sounding drums, Naomi Scott's part and some of Mena Massoud's.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses are doing a great job. Will Smith is great as a genie (still cannot help to compare to the energy from the cartoon one). I love how Mena Massoud portrays Aladdin and how Naomi Scott portrays Jasmine, their chemistry is great. But Jafar's portrayal, not so much. He lacks certain sinister/evil aura.<br/><br/>The plot itself more or less the same with the cartoon, except the part where Genie and Delia (handmaid of Jasmine) got hitched and when Sultan make Jasmine as Sultan.<br/><br/>For such a big production, the props sometimes feels tacky or cheap. The hypnotism effect thingy with Jafar's snake staff does not look well executed (looks like a bad soap opera effect). Some of the costume are great but some are just not working out.<br/><br/>Therefore this movie is okay but feels kinda flat compared to the cartoon ones."

I do think they could have cast Jafar better but he did a lot better than the previews made him look.

","When I first heard Disney was going to remake Aladdin, I was upset. I mean, how can you have the genie without the late Robin Williams? The honest answer is that it is extremely difficult. If you get someone who can sound and look like the late Mr. Williams, then that is probably not going to work for a live action movie, no matter how much I missed that voice and those impressions. What works about this movie is the fun you will have when watching it. You will want to sing along and dance. Seriously, Jasmine's voice is wonderful and we all know Will Smith can dance. (Aladdin dances great too!) The only thing I really need to happen is for WDW to give Aladdin a better ride than just the magic carpets, I want to animatronic it through the Cave of Wonders to the lamp, then 3-D it out of there! Why not? Imagine how awesome it would be to see Abu touch that jewel and know that you are going to have to escape and hopefully see the genie at the end? C'mon, Aladdin deserves better than Avatar! At least Generation X got this movie."

Will Smith did a fantastic job portraying the genie and did not soil the role whatsoever. The story was almost completely spot on to the original but still had its own quirky twists.

","ALADDIN is beautiful to behold! I was grateful for its generosity. Imagine if Cecil B. DeMille, David Lean, George Lucas, Bob Fosse, and Busby Berkeley had all teamed up to make one movie. Director Guy Ritchie has created an overflowing treasure chest of a film: the rewriting, editing, design, wit and fleet cleverness, yearning, joy, delight, and didactic uplift are potent magic! And casting Jafar as a dangerous tiny dopplegänger pipsqueak á la Stephen Miller was the most brilliant twist of all. (It's a political film. Just please don't argue in front of the children.)"

I laughed, and I felt the more serious moments. I wasn't feeling any cringe. I didn't see anything as cheesy. I think people need to remind themselves this IS a Disney movie.

The film had many new additions. They're good additions that make sense anyways. This live action version was more detailed. Its not a carbon copy from the animated version. It's more modern but it is still charming and magical!
What I liked most about this version is the costume designs. Especially, Jasmine's outfits, because there were more outfits compared to the original. I liked how it stood out. Another thing I enjoyed was the opening how it had a more cultural vibe. There were more cultural details in this version.
The chemistry between actors/characters was another favourite thing I enjoyed with this version. Both sang and acted well. The actors knew how to interpret the characters in their own way but still keeping that Disney vibe.
From this version, you could tell Disney took some notes and criticisms seriously when Beauty and the Beast came out. (not just the amount of autotune and lack of creativity)

","I was a bit apprehensive before going to see this remake of one of my childhoods absolute movie highlights. But the apprehension turned out to be misplaced, as I ended up getting blown away by the experience. I felt 11 years old again, and totally spellbound by Disney magic.<br/><br/>The plot, of course, I's the same, but with added character and plot depth, and a feministic nod I really appreciated. The musical scenes were well executed and even goosebump&tear-inducing at times. I was awed by the sheer entertainment factor, and very happy to see the magic also worked on my two daughters (10 & 11 years old), who both had a somewhat tepid relationship to the original."

"coreenscott","9","0","2","26 May 2019"," Classic Disney fans, fear not!
","I was very, very, VERY skeptical. I am a 90s kid, but also a huge Disney fan, so this remake was close to heart. i was hoping it would be as true to the original as possible (we saw the Broadway production, which was too off script for me, though I did still like it!). This retelling DOES deviate from the original (as it must to be live action), but they were true to the spirit and storyline. adding a few extra messages, such as Princess Jasmine's role and the Genie's as well. When I first heard months ago that Will Smith was the Genie, I didn't know what to think. However, he was excellent. He didn't try to imitate Robin William's, nor one up him; he made the character his own, and nailed it. I definitely recommend this to everyone, especially fellow Disney aficionados. keep and open mind, and it will fit right in your heart alongside the original!"

"floobstoob","8","0","2","26 May 2019"," The trailers did not do this movie any justice!
","The trailers did not do Aladdin any justice, whatsoever. The trailers were bad, period. I was not expecting this movie to be incredible.<br/><br/>One of the important aspects in the movie is the music. I got to give a huge thanks to Alan Menken, the original composer, who returned and brought the music back to life. Alan knew the characters so well in the animated film which made it amazing. The original songs in this live adaption hit me in the feels, to be honest, and it felt genuine. I can tell that the actors, especially Naomi Scott, went all in. She did a fantastic job as princess Jasmine. Of course, Will Smith will never top Robin Williams, but his rendition of the Genie was great. Mena Massoud was a surprisingly good Aladdin. The chemistry between all of these characters made the movie enjoyable.<br/><br/>I knocked off a few stars because some of the directing decisions were a bit iffy.<br/><br/>-----SPOILER ALERT: ----
Director Guy Ritchie totally butchered the camera work on some of the key moments especially during/after the Aladdin's reprise version of One Jump Ahead. And... although, the new song, ""Speechless,"" was an eh/okay song, the second rendition/reprise version just didn't feel right. I knew what Guy was trying to do, but It felt way too forced with the premonition aspect because it stopped the flow of the movie. Naomi Scott sings and acts incredibly well in the scene, but I got to pin the problem with Guy Richie's directing decision.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this movie. It's a fun experience."

So just save your irrelevant nit-picking and take the movie for what it is - a great live-action remake.<br/><br/>It was delightful watching my memories of scenes from the original animation come to life on the cinematic screen; the treasure cave, introduction to the genie, and so on.

","Don't you love it when Disney redoes a movie AND changes the moral of the story? Me neither. If they had just changed the title to be ""Jasmine"" it would be fine.<br/><br/>Two differences between this more and the original:
1. The villain (Jaafar) is no longer just a power-hungry psychopath. He is now a power-hungry, psychopath, nationalist. Not so subtle Hollywood.
2. Jasmine is the new protagonist. She steals the lamp back, she convinces the guards to help her, she gets the only new song, she becomes sultan, it's Jasmine who shows any real character development, and it is her who chases down Aladdin. She was the worst part of the movie and I nearly walked out on her second solo.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7 just because of Will Smith and amazing cinematography."

","Vaguely knew (didn't read) that some critics were a bit negative and some fans thought their childhood was destroyed or something. But I wanted to see this for Will Smith (who IMO is scarily talented in this, esp. when he sad great actor doesn't overdo or underdo) .<br/><br/>So I'm there with other folks who are kinda dubious, and none of us are into musicals so much (one of them wears a lot of leather and rides a motorcycle that kind of thing) and - we ALL enjoyed. Light and charming with some good underlying messages; Jasmine is fiery and believable; and Will Smith works his &ss off but at the same time seems like he is having a good time. I especially liked an insanely lavish dance number - there's a bit of Bollywood here and that's a GOOD thing. They used REAL PEOPLE, not CGI peeps OMG!<br/><br/>Noticed in the credits that a bit of this was filmed in Jordan; don't usually pay attention but a great mixed cast who IMO did a fantastic job. Maybe the villain was a bit quieter at first - but there are scenes where he has to be incognito so u just couldn't have Darth Vader type with A VOICE it would never work LOL.<br/><br/>IMO this is a great complement to the original, and Disney did real good. I'd happily see this again, and will buy when released. Kudos to Will Smith esp. as far as I know he dealt with the fan base with grace who were complaining. He's a great choice and all the cast is appealing IMO. Finally, IMO the ""genie"" CGI was excellent. I was fascinated how well that was done. Everyone left the theater smiling!"

I was so fascinated and moved that I couldn't stop smiling all the way home after coming out of the movies. Had it been any other movie, I would be put off by the minor differences, but I loved it so much that I didn't mind at all. Now I'm looking forward to cry a river when the Lion Kings comes out

","So you think you are about to watch another Disney debacle -ever since the Jungle book (Jon Favreau is your excellence guarantee right there) they can't seem to make it right. The Beauty and the Beast horrid attempt set the bar so low, you question the whole project -storytelling, music, casting, everything.<br/><br/>But still, it's Disney. You're still gonna watch the upcoming remakes hoping for a miracle. And Aladdin delivers it out of nowhere. Well... when you see Guy Ritchie in the opening credits, you have your first indication it's gonna be good. Then Mena Massoud shines he's big Aladdin smile, Naomi Scotts eyes are burning with Jasmin's intelligence and you're drawn in without realizing it.<br/><br/>It's impossible not to compare to the original - but at the same time the whole point of the Disney Second Wave (as i call it) of movies is to take the story and the characters one step beyond -present it with today's backload of knowledge and cultural/political aspects. This movie is balanced -not excessive changes but crucial and yet true to it's core story. Jasmin gets the chance to be as dynamic as they always intended her to be, Aladdin has the time to demonstrate the human struggle of values vs desire and Jafar truly represents greed, in an almost terrifying way towards the end. The actors not only justify the characters but they are now part of their evolution -they are, one by one, the characters' true form.<br/><br/>I left the Genie for the end as it was my own personal fear that the character will not come off as he should. Robin Williams not only set a bar but he WAS the Genie. Will Smith knows that, he works on that and takes the Genie one step ahead. He might be blue, he might be singing the same songs bit he's not the 1992-Robin Williams-Blue Genie. He is a different character, an entirely new Genie. He pulls the same magic that transforms Aladdin to Prince Ali, you think you see the 92 Genie but he's a new one. And boy, isn't he magical! He brings the story to another level.<br/><br/>There's no point mentioning the songs -Alan Menken is the master of his art. New ones are amazing and tie to the story seamlessly. Which Directing makes sure the whole 128 mins viewing is as colorful and magical and exciting as a magic carpet ride. I know people say just that because it sounds like a tagline but that's exactly what it is: a magical, mind blowing movie just as unexpected as a magic carpet ride would take you right now."

","This is such a great movie. Disney's Aladdin is my favorite movie ever and I must say I was skeptical about the live action, especially because I was letting myself be influenced by the negative reviews from people who think that giving voice to an animated cartoon is the same thing as acting, dancing, and singing in front of the camera. When people learn to recognize the difference between animation and live action, maybe - just maybe - they will start appreciating the work and effort of the actors of this beautiful rendition of Aladdin. Will Smith did an amazing job as the genie and deserves an apology from those who were so harsh criticizing him without watching the movie in its entirety and from those who can't get over the fact that Robin Williams is sadly not with us anymore. Robin Williams is not replaceable, true, but neither is Will Smith. As a fan of the original I must say that it shows that Will Smith respects what Robin Williams did when he gave voice to the jinn, yet, at the same time, he made this character his own, and I really appreciated and enjoyed it. But I am someone who didn't go to the theater expecting to see Mr Williams or a copy of the original. In my opinion, this movie is the best remake Disney has done so far."

","So this is JM's all time favorite disney movie and I gotta be honest, we walked into this movie ready to hate coz the trailer didn't really impress us much. So while watching, I kept on looking at him and telling him to give it a chance because his face was really serious and concerned. The first part actually was living to our expectations but as the movie progressed, all I could say is... it was AMAZING. It's funny and refreshing to see Aladdin's comical side which for me is better compared to the original film, especially the Jams scene which was very hilarious. Another concern we had was Will Smith's version of the Genie, and once again we were proved wrong! He was amazing, he was funny in his own way. Yeah it's hard not to compare it with the great Robin Williams but I gotta say he made it his own and his chemistry with Aladdin was superb. As for Jafar, uhmm not everyone will come around liking his portrayal for there are some scenes where his presence is not as intimidating as the original.
Overall the movie was very enjoyable, quirky in it's own fun ways and was NOT a copy and paste of the animated film. It preserved what made the movie good and made it better by improving other aspects to make the movie even greater."

Mena also does a decent job as Aladdin. The star of this movie is truely the Gennie captured by Will Smith. I don't know what this movie would have been without him. The movie did a great job of rendering Agrabah but it feels like it's a part of Morocco more than a fictitious city in Iraq.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives. Some of the scenes looked CGI heavy in an unnatural way. This particularly comes though in the cave and the final wish for Jaffar scenes. They both looked amateurish for what the movie needed them to be. Otheriswe, the visual effects looked great and especially on the (friend like me) song. It was a lot of fun. Which makes me wonder why some of these scenes fell short? On the topic of Jaffar, his character falls short in comparison to the others in this movie or in comparison to the original. He is not the menacing evil Jaffar you'd hope for but overall becomes easier to live with as the movie progresses. The dancing had some Bollywood elements in it which takes you away to India for a few moments. This also comes through the costume designs especially for Jasmine as a lot of her wardrobe was heavily influenced by Indian rather than Middle Eastern colours and aesthetics. Overall the movie holds its own as a live action version of Aladdin and I would be looking forward to a sequel to see more of this world and I hope the issues above get fixed for the Return of Jaffar."

","I don't even know why i went to see this movie. The trailer was bad, wasnt fan of the casting and Will Smith as the genie sounded like a dumb choice. Verdict: from the very beginning, when somebody started singing ""Arabian nights"" I to knew the movie was going to be good. Mena Massoud make a charming aladdin. Naomi Scott was a beautiful Jasmine, wonderful voice and she showed strength when she had to ( obligatory feminist message we are used to these days, but it didn't feel too cringy)
I really loved what they tried to do with Jafsr and his story, but the actor wasn't the ideal choice for that role imho.
And Will Smith, well I guess I should have remembered his bel-air prince days because Idon't think it was possible to make a better genie. His genie with his urban touch was just spot on.
The costumes were wonderful, the songs were good some new one, i really liked ""speechless"", and ""a friend like me""was literally better than in the cartoon. I really didn't expect to like it, well done Disney."

To be frank, the trailers were giving out so much Bollywood vibes that I was very very sceptical but I can say I like it very much.<br/><br/>We can argue on whether Robin Williams or Will Smith is the better genie, personally I would say Robin but it was a freaking high bar and Robin Williams is Robin Williams, and that is nothing against Will Smith.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw of the movie was the scene of the most important part of the movie, A Whole New World. I didn't want to compare but the scene was very significant to my childhood and I can't un-remember the scene and I was surprised that they didn't put that much effort into that moment. It was supposed to be THE moment but it became the meh moment....<br/><br/>The CGI was good, the set up was good, the story telling was OK, the directing is questionable but still the movie touches a lot of good old memories.

"popstar-95206","9","0","2","25 May 2019"," You're Gonna Love This Guy
","It genuinely makes me mad that this movie has a 54 on Metacritic and a 57 on rotten tomatoes. This is a GREAT movie- one of the better movies Disney has put out recently. And this is by far the best live action adaptation that they have done so far. In my opinion Aladdin beats out Beauty and the Beast (2017), The Jungle Book (2016), and Dumbo (2019). It is a fun movie that moves along and modernizes the classic story told in the 1992 animated version. This film is alive and in so many ways it blew me away. The musical numbers were fantastic. The acting, the cinematography, the special effects, the sets, and the costumes are all superb. I genuinely teared up during the "" A Whole New World"" scene. Will Smith was the perfect choice to play the Genie- it is crazy to me that people judged his casting before even seeing the film because he does an amazing job. My ONE and only complaint is Jafar, the actor was in no way intimidating and he was easily the weakest link. But over all this is an amazing film that stands on its own and shouldn't be compared to the original film so much. If you truly love Disney and good story telling, you will enjoy this film. It is new and fun and Mena and Naomi are going to be big stars after this. Don't listen to the critics, go see this movie, you'll be glad you saw it on the big screen!"

"pluem_chaisiri","8","0","2","25 May 2019"," What a pleasant surprise
","The original animated Aladdin is one of my favorite film from Disney. And because of that, I didn't expect much from this live-action remake since the original is already perfect. However, this film is great. I'm quite impressed. Every scenes are spectacular and Agrabah looks amazing. And I personally think that the minor changes in the storyline is good as it makes the story more suited for live-action.<br/><br/>The music is amazing, as expected from Disney, after all it's the same original songs from the animated Aladdin. There is also a new song called Speechless, which is sung by Princess Jasmine. While I think that it's a powerful and a great song for Jasmine to express herself, I felt that it's a bit too pop and lack the classic feelings to it.<br/><br/>As for the casts, I actually think everyone did a great job, even Jafar who everyone seems to think is not menacing enough. I think he did fine. As for the others, Mena Massoud is mischievous, courageous and sweet as Aladdin. Naomi Scott shines as Princess Jasmine, beautiful, classy and intelligent. And last but not least, Will Smith did a fantastic job as the Genie. Even though, the blue Genie is a bit weird looking, it's acceptable and it didn't bother me that much.<br/><br/>All in all, Aladdin is wonderful, however by the end of the film, I felt a bit unsatisfied. I was hoping for something more. I can't quite describe what it is, but I think it's lacking something, a magical touch maybe. Of course, it's not as good as the original and the original will always have a special place in my heart. Still, it's a wonderful remake, worth watching."
"donz-8","7","0","2","25 May 2019"," Better than I expected, and a worthy 'reboot'
","Honestly, I wasn't expecting much going into the theater and only purchased the movie tickets because nothing else better was playing at the time (earlier today), especially after the utter disappointment of the last two Disney musicals I've watched, including ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Mary Poppins Returns"". Also, I felt it would be rather difficult or (let alone) even match the charm and magic of the original 90's animation. That was certainly a Disney classic, and during the peak of their earlier hay-days. But, I was quite pleased with the direction and musical quality of this reboot/remake of ""Aladdin"", featuring Will Smith as the Genie. At some points, the acting was either too weak or overdone, but nothing deal-breaking at all. Also, the camera work and flying scenes made me feel much more excited than the animated film from the early 90's. That, in itself, was a major accomplishment, making the viewer (in this case, me) feel a genuine sense of flying. My only complaint would be the very obvious additions/changes to the ending, creating a slightly feminist tone to the theme of the movie. I didn't feel like this change was anything necessary and the director/producer should've stayed true to the original ending, yet I respect their effort in trying to change the attitudes towards male/female gender roles in movies. Having said all of that, ""Aladdin"" had a few faults and minor disappointments, but was (still) a lot of fun and I loved the musical quality from beginning to end."

"bankofmarquis","8","0","6","25 May 2019"," Succeeds, mostly, thanks to Will Smith's charm and charisma
","Unnecessary...a money grab...what was Will Smith thinking...why would Disney do this?<br/><br/>All complaints that were written regarding the live action remake of the beloved 1992 Animated classic, ALADDIN.<br/><br/>And...they would be wrong...as this ALADDIN is fun, fanciful, fast(ish) paced and fantastical. It also has something that I was surprised by...heart.<br/><br/>For those of you living in the ""Cave of Wonder"" for the past 20+ years, Aladdin follows the adventures of a street urchin who falls in love with a Princess and battles the evil Vizier, Jafar, for power via an enchanted lamp that houses a Genie that will grant 3 wishes.<br/><br/>Disney has shown it can do these remakes well when sticking to the source material (as was evidenced by the 2016 live action remake of the 1967 animated classic THE JUNGLE BOOK), but also has failed when it takes the characters, but not the story (the recent DUMBO), so Writer/Director Guy Ritchie (of all people) was smart to ""just take the animated movie"" and remake it as live action.<br/><br/>And...it works! Ritchie (SNATCH, the Robert Downey SHERLOCK HOLMES) seems to be an odd choice to helm this film, but he acquits himself quite well, relying on the pageantry and spectacle of it all to carry the day. The chase scenes are serviceable, but Ritchie's direction does get a bit clunky when the film slows down and focuses on the central love story.<br/><br/>Using performers - for the most part - of Middle Eastern descent, Ritchie coaxes ""good enough"" performances from Mena Massoud as Aladdin and Naomi Scott as Jasmine. They are pleasant enough on screen but was stronger apart than together. I wouldn't call it ""lack of chemstry"", but rather, ""medium chemistry"". But when they are paired with others - or get the chance to shine on their own - they do quite well.<br/><br/>Scott plays well against Navid Negahban who brings a deepness of heart to his character of Jasmine's father, the Sultan and, especially, Nasim Pedrad (so that's what she's been doing since leaving SNL) as her handmaiden, Dalia (a character not in the animated film).<br/><br/>Massoud, of course, spends a great deal of this film playing off the Genie character. So let's talk about Will Smith's performance in the iconic Robin Williams role. EVERYONE (including myself) was asking why Smith would take on this role. It's a ""lose/lose"" proposition, trying to fill the shoes of one of the wildest, wackiest and most frenetic performances in screen history. So Smith does a very smart thing - he doesn't even try. He makes this Genie ""his own"" not trying to mimic Williams' performance, but rather creating a charming, friendly and funny Genie with heart (there's that word again) behind his eyes. It is a strong performance by Smith - one that only a performer with his charm and charisma could pull off. His presence in this film elevates the proceedings and I wanted more of this character.<br/><br/>The music you know and love is all there - and they are welcome presences in this film - though they felt abbreviated (maybe it's just because I'm more familiar with the Soundtrack performances of these songs and not how they were used in the original film) and there is an Original number, a ""girl power"" song for Jasmine that felt a little too ""Disney Channel"" to me - but I don't think I'm the target audience for that song, so I'll cut it some slack.<br/><br/>A slight downgrade in the final rating of this film needs to be made because of the ""meh"" characterization and performance of the main villain, Jafar. As played by Marwan Kenzari, this Jafar was seething and menacing but never really bigger than life and threatening - qualities that make Jafar one of the better villains in the Disney animated canon.<br/><br/>But, ultimately, this film will succeed or fail, I think, by your reaction to Smith's interpretation of the Genie. It's NOT Robin Williams, and that's a good thing. For me, Smith...and this film...succeeds.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"

"narendradewo","10","0","2","25 May 2019"," Such a heartwarming, beautiful film!
","Aladdin is truly charming! The chemistry between leading actors, especially Aladdin and Jasmine was amazing, not romantically overdone but on the right dose. Genie and Aladdin's relationship was of a father and son, it made me tear up a bit at the end of the movie. Now I understand why they make Jafar this way, because he is a real human, not a sort of a over the top villain with obvious evil grin everywhere he goes, he would look crazy, and a crazy person could not be a vizier. In real life, cartoon Jafar would absolutely be put into a mental health facility rigt away, but this Jafar, just a right dose of evilness or must I say ambition while being a believable vizier. And the subtle hint of him sharing same background as Aladdin? Marvelous details.<br/><br/>The set is amazingly well done, Agrabah is beautiful. While I saw some criticizing it for being too colourful, I do not understand why they want an ancient middle eastern-south asian mix kingdom to be dull in colour? The perception of Agrabah as something dull is a white orientalism at its best, perceiving them as barbaric, dull society. Have you ever seen morocco, Iran, and their work of art like the tapestries? Yes they are super colourful.No reason for Agrabah as a flourishing port city to be dull.<br/><br/>About the music, wonderfully done, except that A whole new world that sounds a bit too pop-ish, and 'speechless'. Speechless is wonderful but the sequence was just a bit rigid and not as strong as expected. I expect her to do some actions while singing tho. The rest? Beautiful and truly fit the movie. Naomi has golden pipes, Mena Massoud sounds truly Aladdin-ish, and Genie own the song . Prince Ali was amazing, the snippet makes it look bad because they take it out of context, you have to hear the beginning and the climax to understand what kind of nuances the song trying to deliver. Prince Ali song is as narrative as in the aniamation, while avoiding from being over the top. And the dances? I could not forget the harvest festival dance, it was beautifully choreographed!<br/><br/>Extra characters like Dalia was truly outstanding, such a spot on comedic relief, and Sultan? Not a clown anymore, he is a real Sultan(thank God). I always hated how the animation portray Agrabah as a Kingdom have a clown for a Sultan, that is condescending and orientalistic at its best.<br/><br/>Abu was cute and fun, thankfully Rajah act like an actual tiger pet, and Iago, he can be a bit more naughty.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a beautiful, heartwarming film and truly entertaining!"

If you check the original version you will noticed that they kept as much as possible to the original.
Starting the movie from the genie view. Excellent"
"ghoshbiswadeep","8","0","2","25 May 2019"," I like the film very much
","Aladdin is my second favorite disney film after The Lion King. So this live-action version is one of the most anticipated film for me. First of all the trailers are not do justice to the film. I really enjoyed it. The film is really funny and also the bond between aladdin and genie is very good. If you just forget about the original version and don't constantly compare this two then this is a very good film. Meena masood as aladdin is very good. Also i like the zafar because he is now more political and also he has a little bit of back story. Also you have to remember that bad guys don't always look like bad guys. That worked in the original version because that was a animated version. Naomi scott as jasmine is awsome. Very confident. Will smith also as genie is very charismatic and charming. He did not try to imitate Robin Williams. So i like his portrayals. Honestly i like his ""human form"" over the ""blue form"" because i did not like the CGI. In this version some changes are made and i think they are really good and really worked. Also there has been few new songs and that sounds great. specially ""Arabian Nights"" & ""Speechless"". Naomi scott has a beautiful singing voice. I say that if you watch this please don't compare this to the animated version. I don't say that this is a perfect film but i say that the film is getting so much hate because it constantly compared with the animated version. Also this time genie gets a love story and live his life and that i very much adored."

","This movie takes you back to the 90s childhood filling your heart with nostalgia and wonder. A good thing done by Guy Ritchie is that he didn't change the original story plot a lot.
The movie has a beautiful scenery and animation, but most of all the genie played by the legendary Will Smith takes the whole movie to an other level. His way of playing this role but yet keep it so natural and hilarious, Will Smith gives the impression of that he must have been a real genie in his previous life..
Overall, it is a great movie and the 90s child in me did not get disappointed."

","#1 Disney movie remake I've ever seen.
Will Smith was terrific playing Genie and so as the other characters as well. This movie reminded me of my childhood days when I used to watch Aladdin over and over. Every scene was just like the original Disney cartoon. I didn't see any flaws. Yes okay we lost Robin Williams and his funny moments but Will Smith is still a funny character too and he did a great job playing the Genie. Every actor or actress in this movie did a great job. Thank you for bringing back my childhood memories. My wife and I enjoyed it."

I went open minded and not with high hopes because I know if I were to have done that then I would ruin the experience. But as I was watching the film. I really got into it. And the music by Alan Menken brought me back to the classic 1992 Aladdin . It had a lot of fun action, drama, comedy, everything all in one. I would definitely want to watch it again. Keep in mind , I was doubtful at the beginning , But I fell in love with the cast and the music ."

","To be honest, I was sceptical coming into watching this movie as I haven't really enjoyed the other live-action Disney films that have been made, but I was really pleasantly surprised!<br/><br/>Aladdin has been superbly cast and kept to the original animated version well whilst incorporating new elements that really elevated the movie.<br/><br/>The music is BEAUTIFUL - the actress playing Jasmine has a stunning voice (and face) and the rest of the actors do a great job on their songs.<br/><br/>My only critique is that I feel Jasmine's 'Speechless' solo near then end felt a bit cringey...but her voice kinda made up for it and overall, the movie was so well done and had me smiling from ear to ear."

","Don't listen to the negative reviews. You know the ones I'm talking about. The reviewers that ask questions about whether or not it was necessary. The ones that compare it to the original 1992 classic, featuring a Robin Williams. The reviewers that moan about all our favorite Disney animated films being made into live action films, then proceed to complain that it has somehow ruined our childhood. Don't listen to those guys. They are a miserable lot! Guy Ritchie's interpretation of 'Aladdin' is faithful to the original, without feeling like a boring rehash. Will Smith adds his own personality to the Genie, and it feels very genuine and refreshing. He makes the roll his own, rather than a cringeworthy imitation of Williams' performance. Mena Massoud brings both swag and adorable awkwardness to the roll of Aladdin. Naomi Scott gives us a confident princess Jasmine. The supporting cast is delightful, as are the costumes and musical numbers. It manages to feel familiar and warm, whilst allowing itself to be its own thing. I quite appreciate that. 'Aladdin' Is just as magical in 2019, as it was in 1992."

They do a phenomenal job of hitting all the big plot points of and paying hommage to the original animated movie while adding their own flair and injecting new material.<br/><br/>Naomi Scott pulls of a strong independent Jasmine wonderfully and has a beautiful voice through some amazing solos and scenes, Mena Massoud completely embodies the role of Aladdin and hits every beat as the wonderful street rat prince of thieves we all know and love, I had my doubts but Marwan Kenzari is the epitome of evil and power hungry as Jafar and really fills his role well, and to top it all off Will Smith plays a perfect Genie by making the role his own but still making it completely nostalgic with more than enough nods to our beloved Robin. Will takes the role in stride at his own pace so well that I loved every minute of his on screen time. The movie was fantastic and will definitely go onto my rewatch list."

This is a live action REMAKE. I love that they followed the original story closely instead of trying to change it, you can't change iconic Disney classics. The music was great even with the remixes, the colors and dancing were beautiful, and the casting was spot on. Our whole group loved it and would recommend it to anyone!

"phil_doucet","7","0","2","25 May 2019"," An absolute classic!
","I did not enjoy it as much as Beauty and the Beast but it was still good. Had some big time interest in the casting seeing how Aladdin is from Markham, Ontario and a graduate of Ryerson University (my dad worked there for 25+ years and my brother is also a graduate). He was fantastic and so was Naomi Scott as Jasmine. The casting for these two characters was phenomenal. As for Jafar, wasn't a huge fan at first because of the actor's high pitched voice and how young he was (I always envisioned Jafar having a deep voice and being an older dude) but he was just as evil as one could be. The biggest surprise for me was Will Smith. He was great. I though it was the dumbest idea to cast him as the Genie but he quickly changed my mind and was perfect for the role. A fun move I would love to watch again. The main characters have a great connection together and these remakes are always fun."

"gyotter","8","0","2","25 May 2019"," A Magical Film for the whole family
","The film was hated on immediately as the first trailers released, and clearly the CGI was not finished in any of the early trailers because this movie's special effects are stunning. Acting was good all around, Mena Massoud (Aladdin) was the biggest surprise as I didn't expect him to be such a charming Aladdin. Jafar had a very different take in the film, not a bad route just a different one, he was still menacing as he is in the original just in different ways. Jasmine was good, Naomi Scott has by far the best singing voice in the film. Abu and Carpet were handled well and we're animated good and still pulled off the realistic look. And last but not least Will Smith's Genie brought life to the whole film, from his hilarious humor to his very different (but amazing) versions of ""Arabian Nights"", ""Friend Like Me"", and ""Prince Ali"". The overall film is a very good adaptation of the 1992 Film, my personal favorite out of the Disney Remakes. So rub the lamp, wish your wishes and ride on a magic carpet ride to this unique and beautiful reimagining of Disney's ""Aladdin""."

"cuervo-87728","8","0","2","25 May 2019"," Different but good
","First off, I was completely not sure about Will Smith as the genie, but, I was pleasantly surprised with him as the genie. Robin Williams left big shoes to fill but Will Smith did good. There were parts of the movie that were very true to the original like some of the songs.<br/><br/>I think my only complaints are the lack of Gilbert Gottfried as Iago the parrot. His character definitely added a unique dynamic to the partnership between Him and Jafar. Although this parrot in the new film talked some...it lacked a real character development behind it that made the first film a success. Also I believe the Sultan needed to be a little more silly and naive like in the original. It is small things like that that make the film memorable.<br/><br/>Other than that, it is understandable that not everything translates well from animated to live action but there were parts of the original story that didnt need to be changed or were missing.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting was decent, Will Smith was great, and the story remained close to the original. If they would've had Gottfried it would've been 10 stars but overall solid family fun."
"Eskuppe","10","0","3","25 May 2019"," Best remake of a Disney classic!
","People are letting false nostalgia dictate their perception of this movie. For whoever thinks the original was better, go back and watch it - yes it was good, but your memory is making it out to be more than what it was. It's been 27 years. Other remakes have been disappointing, but this is far from it!<br/><br/>It is a wonderful film with all the heart of the original! Very funny, heartwarming and reminds you how great the Aladdin story was. Cliche? Maybe it's because it's the same as the original!<br/><br/>The visuals are spectacular. For fans of the music of the original, you will not be let down! I was singing along to each song (it's okay, the music was loud, I didn't ruin anyone else's experience). Mild changes to lyrics (no cutting off ears), but mostly the same.<br/><br/>Robin Williams did leave some big shoes to fill, but, dare I say it, Will Smith has done a remarkable job as the new Genie! One of his greatest performances! The rest of the cast did an admirable job, capturing the spirit of the characters, especially Mena Massoud (Aladdin) & Naomi Scott (Jasmine). You can pick at accents til you're blue in the face (no pun intended), but remember the original cast were mostly white US Americans - this is an improvement.<br/><br/>Try to enjoy the movie, you might actually like it. I've never rated a movie 10/10, but I can't fault this one. Brilliant!."
"adog2001","9","0","2","25 May 2019"," The Best Live Action Disney Remake So Far To Me
","There are plenty of good things in this remake. The casting here is perfect; yes, Will Smith was also perfectly casted as the Genie, the music is perfect, especially since they added I believe two new songs, I know one of them was a song sung by Jasmine called ""Speechless"" that wasn't in the original movie. And let me say, she blew it away! And I love the added plots like in the beginning when the Genie talks about his experience with Aladdin. And in this new movie, Jasmine actually has a maiden, who I am not kidding, the actress playing her actually looks like she could be Jasmine's sister. I also loved the scene where Genie makes Aladdin dance real weird like and everyone when I was there including me died of laughter there! Overall, the movie was a lot more funny than the original and the story was done a lot better in the live action remake. If you love Disney, the live action Disney remakes, or Aladdin, go watch it! It is really good and I gotta say it is now my number 1 favorite live action remake so far, but we'll see if it still is once Lion King comes out. 9 out of 10! A must see!"

","Look - we all know the backlash that this movie received when the first teaser trailer dropped a few months ago. People were terribly confused about the production (or lack of) shown in the brief glimpse. I'll admit, I was terribly worried and was not planning on seeing it in its opening weekend. However, I am so glad I did! Now, this is not the animated Aladdin, in fact, it is much different! There several welcome changes to the animated Disney classic.<br/><br/>There were 4 shining stars throughout the film.
1. Naomi Scott - WOW! What a fantastic performance as Princess Jasmine - she proved to handle the role with grace, but also a toughness that the animated Jasmine simply did not demonstrate.<br/><br/>2. Mena Massoud - at first, I was not feeling his performance of Aladdin, but once he met Genie, I was sold. He has the look and the personality down perfectly.<br/><br/>3. WILL SMITH - Like everyone, I was mortified when the first look at Genie came out, he looked awful. There was some concern he would let down the role made so famous by Robin Williams, but he excels in it! At no point does the Fresh Prince attempt to be Robin Williams, he makes the Genie his own, and it is spectacular.<br/><br/>4. The Music - the new arrangements of classic songs, plus the addition of new ones made this movie feel fresh.<br/><br/>The movie is by no means perfect. At times the CGI looks weak, and some of the performances are uneven. All that considered, I do believe this is the best live-action remake Disney has put together yet!"
"lbomke","9","0","2","24 May 2019"," Quit comparing, just enjoy!
","To start...I think anyone reviewing comparing this movie to the original has missed the mark. Of course it's not going to match the magic you remember as a kid. Walt Disney said it himself, ""animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive."" - the animated version has its place in history, it did what no live action movie could ever do.. and that's okay!!!!
When you see this movie, just watch it and clear your mind from your nostalgia clouding your judgement. It's a good movie! It's funny, the acting is incredible, the songs are fun (maybe one jump was missing a few musical elements that made it ""jump"" out- it fell a little flat), the visuals are outstanding. I base a good Disney movie on if I cry, and I cried twice. Princess Jasmine blew it away, she finally gets something she has deserved for a long time (a song and a place of power). Her performance is something every young person needs to see. We should not be shocked that jasmine has a power ballad about being forced to stay silent. Don't make it political. Go see this movie. Seeing this movie will not ruin the masterpiece that is the animated version. You will not explode and the old Aladdin will not be wiped from your memory. Just have fun, people!!!!"

Will Smith was extraordinary as Genie, at first it was a little awkward to be honest...but then he just makes you smile and laught at the whole movie. Really enjoyed and loved the movie."

","When it comes to the 1992 Aladdin, it is considered to be one of my favorite animated Disney movies of all time, next to Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. It was straight-forward full of action, comedy, well-crafted colors and animation, memorable songs, and much more. But, when a live-action remake was announced, audiences were worried. For me, I always reserve judgement till the final product.<br/><br/>So...is it as bad as everyone thought it was going be...? ...No. Does it pay respect and love as the original provided...? ...Yes...mostly.<br/><br/>To kick things off, the story is what everyone would expect when coming on: peasant Aladdin (Mena Massoud) falls for the beautiful princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). Soon, he finds a magic lamp with a Genie (Will Smith) and makes three wishes to win Jasmine's heart while the royal vizier Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) plots to steal the lamp for total power. Conceptually, the same story but executed differently. To the movie's credit, it is not a complete shot-by-shot remake and it maintains the spirit of the original. That is what I expect from these Disney live-action remakes nowadays. With having an extended running time, it fleshes out more of the primary characters and their motives, which works to an extent. Since the movie is directed by Guy Ritchie (whom I have little knowledge of) and producer Dan Lin, the movie provides a little more emphasis on action and chase sequences during key scenes. There will be moments where you will feel an adrenaline rush when you see Aladdin running and jumping through the streets of Agrabah. Though for others, it would make them feel a little weird out after a while.<br/><br/>The visuals are usually a challenge since there are elements in the original that stick out like a sore thumb. But, to be fair, the movie does provide its own visual identity. Lavish is the best way to compliment the looks. Thanks to the nicely built sets of Agrabah and the vibrant, detailed costumes of the characters, I felt comfortable and became basked into the Arabian culture throughout the film. As for the CGI, it is average. There are times where it works well on emoting the animal characters and the matte landscapes. Then again, there will be times where the CGI would become noticeable and uncanny. The original still had more of an artistic advantage due to being animated. The colors easily visualize and establish the mood of the characters. The character animations and visuals also gave the animators more freedom to express their creativity and imagination.<br/><br/>The performances are a huge mix. I'll start with the blue elephant in the room: Will Smith as the Genie. I admire Robin Williams and how much he made an impact he provided to his character with fast-paced energy and improvisations. Yet, it is worth noting that everyone has to understand and accept: no one could copy Robin Williams and his comedic influence. Disney knows it; Will Smith knows it. Even other animated Aladdin projects had their own comedic genies and no one complained about it. With that said, Will Smith did a pretty good job. Whether in his standard CGI genie or human form, he is pretty likable thanks to his own style of humor and relationship with Aladdin. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott maintained their charm and chemistry with their characters from the original. My personal highlight is Scott's breakthrough, original solo song called ""Speechless"", which was written by Pasek and Paul, from La La Land. Nasim Pedrad is a nice new addition to the cast and gets an occasional laugh.<br/><br/>However, Marwan Kenzari never convinced me once that he was Jafar. I'm sure he's a decent guy and acted fine in other movies. Even when the movie gives him a backstory and I'm not say he has to be a carbon copy of Johnathan Freeman, he is missing something very important: acting evil. Sure, in hindsight, the original Jafar would be characterized as a one-dimensional villain. But, at least, he was cunning, sneaky, master of tricks and disguises, and a psychotic threat. This guy, however, is a complete joke. And when does gain power, his performance becomes laughably bad.<br/><br/>Iago is nothing worth mentioning, either. He's basically acts and talks a like a real parrot, that's it. Granted, Alan Tyduk's voice was serviceable, but nothing beats Gilbert Gottfried.<br/><br/>Lastly, the songs and music provided again by Alan Menken are ear-pleasing to listen and recapture the Arabic feeling despite the tempo is being slower than the original (i.e. ""A Whole New World"" and ""Prince Ali""). The main stand-out songs are ""Arabian Nights"" which sets the story-telling mood well and ""Speechless"" thanks to Naomi's surprisingly powerful voice.<br/><br/>Overall, despite a weak villain, average CGI and nothing special added, Aladdin is a pleasant re-telling that retains the original's sense of wonder with great performances, lush visuals, and nice music.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of **** ( MARGINALLY RECOMMENDED)"

","Aladdin is a great movie! Some might not feel it to be as impactful as the original because we all know the conflict and story but overall a very delightful watch. Visuals and graphics are eye candy and music is wonderful!"
"alyssasieb","8","0","2","24 May 2019"," Iffy start then Will Smith shows up
","It was so, so at first. Marwan Kenzari was strong throughout, but both the story and everyone else's acting felt a little off at first. Then Will Smith shows up and seem to fill that missing piece and everything just got better from there. Ended up really enjoying it and loved how they kept Jasmine as the fierce princess."

"manmadan-1","9","0","3","24 May 2019"," Fantastic Movie
","I have watched this movie yesterday in IMAX 3D without any expectation in fact I didn't see the previous Hollywood version, But I have watched some Indian version couple of decades back..hence I liked this film.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie, the pace and action sequence of the movie is just a non-stop ride until Aladdin gets a lamp. It's getting some lag after that but not boring.<br/><br/>Its a real talent from the creator of the movie since almost everyone knows the story of the Aladdin, still it should look fresh. YES this move is looking fresh with Naomi Scott. She will be the reason if someone wants to watch this movie again.<br/><br/>Mena Massoud and Will Smith have given their best in the comic hero role. The CG seems to be perfect, yeah its Disney's product. I want to watch the making of this film which shows the tiger, flying carpet.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a must watch, but you won't regret after watching this movie."

","I read the reviews and went with low expectations, I enjoyed it and my daughter loved it. Its Aladdin, can't see the problem."
"CoolKid23","8","0","3","24 May 2019"," Like watching broadway with cgi!
","First off if you're going into this movie trying to make it exactly like the original one then you might as well just watch the original one. As far as an adaptation goes Disney went all out to try and make the experience come to life and it's amazing and by looking at all the colors you can feed they spent a lot of money and resources trying not to make anybody mad that is in love with the original Aladdin.<br/><br/>Jasmine and Aladdin are incredible in this movie and they really make you feel like a kid again. For Will Smith to be able to pull this off at his age just shows his professionalism and true nature of acting. The only difference between Will Smith and Robin Williams is that Robin Williams was good with voice impressions that's pretty much it. The movie has its basic jokes for a Disney movie and I think kids and families are going to enjoy it the most. Don't listen to the people who are saying that it's the worst movie they ever saw they are absolutely lying because they prefer their original cartoon version.<br/><br/>I only gave the movie an 8 instead of a 10 because it's a remake so it kind of takes the magic of way of something new. Had this movie never been made before this would have easily been a 10 out of 10 in a Smash Hit so with that being said go see a great movie with your family or be a hater and don't LOL"

","Totally amazed this is super good adaptation great cast, great visuals, goosebumps everywhere, tears, and smiles. a must watch movie of the year. you did it again Disney!âœ¨"
"sulav_karki","8","0","3","24 May 2019"," Wonderful movie
","Just a day before watching this movie, I again watched the original Aladdin and I loved this movie. Lots of similarities to original movie but there was some difference as well. Songs in this film were great, loved every one of them. Actors are great, esp Naomi Scott who knocks it out of the park as Jasmine and her singing skills are great. Aladdin actor was good too and i also like the villian Jafar. Will Smith is great as Genie as well. The visuals are also good.<br/><br/>All in all, loved this movie and it's very different from what was expected."
"markteddybear","9","0","3","24 May 2019"," Delightfully Tacky
","If you go into the movie with the understanding that nobody is going to replace Robin Williams as the Genie and that live action characters are not as flexible as cartoon drawings then you will enjoy yourself. It was wonderfully done! Will Smith put his own spin on the Genie character and had me laughing the entire show. The storyline was delightfully tacky just as the cartoon version was."
"rayianindya","7","0","3","24 May 2019"," I enjoyed it!! xx
","Loved the songs and I also laughed at some funny scenes. Sure there were some parts/scenes that could be done better and that's including the magic carpet ride scenes of Jasmine and Aladdin, but I overall enjoyed the movie. Aladdin is better than Beauty and The Beast."
"psyche765","9","0","3","24 May 2019"," Concerned....but not anymore
","So let me start off stating that I went in concerned how the live action would do. Half way through, I was no longer concerned. Will Smith is really good as the genie. He puts his own spin on the role. There is even a small homage to the original. There are additional songs and the story line has a couple of twists from the original. But the extra items made you more invested in Aladdin and Jasmine."
"fatmovieman","10","0","4","24 May 2019"," Best Disney picture of the year so far
","Okay if your looking for a memorial day weekend treat this would most definitely be it the movie made me smile and laugh there was plenty of action for boys and romance music and costumes for girls the movie is so much fun to watch the only two problems I for see is the fact that there's shots of swinging breasts due to the dress of the time and some of the action may be a little much for the smallest of kids but aside from that I thought the movie was fantastic"
"alicandis","10","0","5","24 May 2019"," Perfect!!
","It was everything the animation was and more, each character was played beautifully, funny, witty brilliant! I felt as if I was watching the genie in the animation, Will Smith did justice to character as well as Aladdin, the moves the voice everything, Jasmine was breathtaking as well."

"shenyce1-952-371485","9","0","3","24 May 2019"," Magical experience
","I was so surprised with how wonderfully magical this movie was. Will Smith nailed the genie on the head with his own quirky rendition of the Robin Williams iconic character. He was so different that it was just an absolute joy to watch. The lack of whitewashing of actors was great and the actors themselves were perfect choices for all of their roles. Will definitely be watching that more than once and can not wait to see what other live action remakes Disney has for us."

"ptyg","10","0","4","24 May 2019"," Disneys BEST REMAKE EVER!
","I have to say that I cannot understand the poor reviews given??? This is a PG film!!!!! so don't expect to much on the dark side. I do feel the casting for jafar could have been better however the songs, the music, the sets. All awesome!!!!
The relationship between Al & Jasmine feels somewhat rushed but who cares!!! its a PG film. Plus Jasmine is constantly having to choose between nincumpoop princes and along comes this legend! Will smith is outstanding. The visuals are incredible. bravo Disney! Fantastic job! you've shown me that a remake can be better than the original. I'm sure Robin Williams would be proud! good job!"
"shoei907","8","0","2","24 May 2019"," Not sure why they remade but nostalgic fun
","This movie was much better then I expected. I didn't hate Will Smith but I miss Robin Williams. They changed some stuff and I missed what was removed but at the same time I enjoyed the additions. I'm concerned Disney has an evil lab because that girl is Princess Jasmine. Somehow they cloned Aladin, Jasmine, and Abu. I wish they had cast someone else as Jafar, maybe an old ceepy guy. The genie was much better then I expected, Will Smith was quite funny, but would have helped if he sang better. I'm a Guy Ritchie fan but this had me nervous for him. I'm pleased to say he pulled it off. There was so much that was the same and the songs came through. If you love the original Aladin, I don't see how you could hate this movie."

It was an hommage to Robin Williams.<br/><br/>The movie was very good, I liked the new parts in it"
"akaankshdr","8","0","2","24 May 2019"," Clumsy yet charmful
","Guy Ritchie's version of the classical Aladdin tale takes off the ground in quite mesmerising way, surpassing all expectations put on this Disney venture.
Surprisingly, Will Smith's navy blue skinned Genie was as good Robin Williams' version in the 1992 animated film of the same name. The other actors, though were dull at times manage to hold their own ground in a movie were everything is happening without a break. The major disappointment was the villain 'Jafar' whose voice wasn't as nearly intimidating like the original one.
The cinematography, like all other Guy Ritchie movies was colourful and great to watch. While the musical part had great singers, the on-screen lip sync by the actors was bad. Other than that, it was the same age-old story with only a slight change in its climax and that's it. The film respects the material of the original one and follows beat to beat.
While it isn't a must watch film this summer, Will Smith's Genie is entertaining enough for this two hour film."
