","Not as fun as the first one, but definitely a step up from Revenge of the Fallen and a fine way to end a trilogy of Shia Lebouf."
"devolucija","2","594","890","30 June 2011"," Ugh...
","// Minor spoilers and bad guy ultimate plot revealed in last paragraph, but it's so stupid you want to know it. Long and rant filled review.<br/><br/>Let's start with 10 stars.<br/><br/>Rosie and Shia wouldn't know how to fake chemistry if someone wrapped a lead pipe in the periodic table and beat them upside their botoxed faces for an hour. The romance part is so awful, so cheesy in this movie, it takes down a star right off the bat. I will also mention the ""romance"" between Optimus Prime and America - the ""one and only real and holy country in the world"". *puke* <br/><br/>9 / 10.<br/><br/>Rosie has to be mentioned again as a standalone entry. I can imagine how the casting went.. Bay walks into modeling agency, closes his eyes and says ""Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, you're the clone that comes along!"", thereby picking out the 403rd pair of tits in the lineup. A horrible actress, pretentious character and a so obnoxiously unnecessary role the movie would have been two stars better if she were not there at all. Also, lips are not supposed to look like that. If I was Shia, I'd worry ""Are you sure your lips don't hurt? Can we kiss? Won't a stitch break or something?""<br/><br/>7 / 10.<br/><br/>At one point, a guy ""hacks"" a bridge. He logs into the ""bridge control"" , and lowers it. Hollywood, bridges do not have an open internet connection with a designated port for ""Bridge Control API"", otherwise every hacker would be lowering and raising bridges everywhere.<br/><br/>6 / 10.<br/><br/>Since the black guy stereotypes in Transformers2 got some bad rep, Bay went the other way this time - Irish and Scottish. Yes, there is a green robot with an Irish accent, and a red robot with a huge belly and a beard, with a Scottish accent. How did that happen? Did they scan an Ire/Scot when they landed instead of a car? If so, weren't they supposed to turn into the robot-terminator-chick type from Transformers 2?<br/><br/>5 / 10.<br/><br/>Physics. Oh god, the physics. Dear Michael Bay, please realize the following: a) Moon sand is a highly corrosive and metal-unfriendly substance. Any kind of moving metalpart coming in that much contact with it would self destruct by the time it made 3 steps. b) One plane was enough to collapse a Twin Tower into dust. A seventy million billion ton robot shooting and crashing into a building will not make it ""tilt slightly"" and when that building falls, it will not get stuck between two others like a bridge, ever, regardless what it's made of, especially if that same robot is still crawling through it and destroying chunks. c) When stuff explodes near people, people tend to be stunned, burned and / or get shrapnel shot into their spines. They do not sit idly by and contemplate the situation. So if a grenade explodes in an office cubicle next to the one where the protagonist is standing, he will most probably DIE. d) You cannot grab a SHARP, MAD, DANGEROUS robot by the neck and keep it in control. You will LOSE YOUR FINGERS. e) Do you have any idea how much extra it costs to send an extra kilogram into space in a shuttle? Now imagine how much fuel and money you would need to send 10 million-ton robots into space with a regular human space shuttle launcher. f) When people fly through glass, they ALWAYS get cut. When they fly through 10 panes of glass, they DIE. When they fly through 20, they DON'T, because they got impaled on the 12th or 13th.<br/><br/>4/10<br/><br/>Stealing characters from other franchises just for the kick of it is not cool. You have a predator robot, a robot that is ""Q from James Bond"", etc. What...?<br/><br/>3 / 10.<br/><br/>Plot: If I was an evil genius and built a war-turning technology, I definitely would not build it so that it has exactly one weak point that, if struck, undoes absolutely everything it ever did, and I would definitely not leave it exposed. The bad guys' ultimate plan was to teleport their PLANET to Earth's atmosphere in order to rebuild it. This raises several issues: 1) You would have approximately 10 minutes to live, before Earth and Cybertron collided due to gravity. Those 10 minutes would be filled with an apocalypse due to uncontrollable floods caused by tides. 2) If you want 6 billion people for the sole purpose of slave labor, you should think about point 1). Also, it is stupid to believe 6 billion people could rebuild a robotic planet sooner or better than 1000 decepticons - you not only have to accommodate and feed the people, but also modify the planet's surface for them to be able to move on it. 3) There is a part where Megatron is chillaxing in an alley after a big fight, and the flat-lipped wonder of a model-clone that is Carly comes up to him spewing some bullshit about the other bad guy getting ready to betray him. Now, even if she made a point, I would still CRUSH that human insect. A meaningless pretentious bitch telling me what to think? I'm a god damn eleventy billion ton robot, you skank! *crush* The other critically stupid thing is the fact that Megatron then prevents the other bad guy from killing Optimus. If you have two enemies who are fighting, it is generally not a good idea to prevent them from killing each other! And while we're here, the decepticons could have won if the bad guy had just used one of the 994208 chances to kill Optimus he's had up until this point.<br/><br/>This brings the movie down to 1/10, but I'll give it a star for excellent special effects. 2/10."

","Having watched this film I think Michael Bay definitely learnt from the mistake he made in ROTF. He cut out all of the stupid comedy e.g the twins.<br/><br/>He also made the overall plot a hell of a lot better, the way they linked in the moon landing to Transformers was fantastic I thought, and additionally the old footage they used was clever.<br/><br/>The action scenes were pumped up so much more, and I felt genuine sorrow when IronHide died, and BumbleBee was going to be executed. The background music composed by Steve Jablonsky was fantastic and never so more appreciated during the car chase scene when they are tyring to protect Sentinel.<br/><br/>People will criticise because it is a typical Hollywood block buster but if you want pure escapism then watch the film"
"thegoods7","8","32","44","17 January 2012"," Awesome!
","Transformers Dark of the Moon being the third movie of the Transformers series you wouldn't think it would be as good as the first two, well it is. In this movie Megan Fox is no longer to be seen but we are gifted with a beautiful Rosie Huntington-Whiteley playing along side Shia LaBeouf. This movie added some serious effects to it with the robots. just like the first two it combines an action/love/comedy attribute. The action scenes in this movie are without a doubt awesome. The effects they used are amazing and to sort of let you catch up with whats happening they use slow motion to let you see things that are going on. I like how they've taken something that has actually happened like the moon landing and have put there own twist on what actually was happening. this was a very good movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing robots you played with as kid come to life."
"goldwriting","3","274","437","8 July 2011"," Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Some Things Never Change
","I'm going to commit what to many will seem like film geek treason, I will now connect Michael Bay and Terrence Malick into one theory of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Yep, deal with it.<br/><br/>Malick and Bay share one important thing and that is a completely unabashed tunnelvision for the type of film they want, damn the naysayers, critics and crowds. They both make movies mainly for themselves and in truth, there is nothing wrong with that. As an audience member you need to know going in exactly what you are going to get. It is the only way to really enjoy anything that falls from the cameras of these two (and some other notables). With that said, let's dive headlong into the metallic masterpiece of summertime popcorn, Transformers!<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon continues the story of Sam Witwicky and his Autobot friends. While Sam struggles to gain a purpose in life outside of Decepticon attacks, the Autobots are off helping the government on secret missions. Then everything is torn apart by the discovery of the original Autobot escape ship, known as The Ark, and the captain of that ship, Sentinel Prime. He alone holds the key to technology that could either help reshape the Transformers home world or completely destroy ours. The Decepticons, completely aware of this discovery, make an immediate power play and the war is back, bigger than ever.<br/><br/>Kids buying the Transformer toys today only want one thing, huge robots in spectacular 3D slow motion destroying each other and every building in sight. From this narrow viewpoint, Bay delivers in bulk. The highway fight sequence brought back memories of other high-speed terror scenes like in Matrix Reloaded and The Island (maybe a little too reminiscent of that last one according to some eagle eyed movie nerds). Since Bay actually filmed these scenes in the latest and greatest 3D technology, it was admittedly pretty amazing to watch. In other scenes, some of the CGI was so intensely crisp that it actually started popping too far from the live footage, making it stand out, which ruins a little of the illusion.<br/><br/>So the special effects is where it was at. Big robots, big explosions, big buildings falling down. Those were the high points.<br/><br/>The low points were pretty much everything else.<br/><br/>Standing in the center of all the toys-on-roids insanity is Shia LaBeouf, who in my opinion is a really good actor banking inside really bad movies. I can't fault him for taking parts in some of the biggest franchises in movie history (Transformers and Indiana Jones) because the exposure and paycheck are nearly impossible to pass up, but in terms of showing his skills as an actor, those hefty titles have done him nothing but a painful disservice. He made his big splash on the scene in the Disney TV show Even Stevens and then on the big screen in the Rear Window update, Disturbia. Many people also don't remember one of my personal favorite performances in the Project Greenlight-sponsored film, The Battle of Shaker Heights. Shia has the chops, but gets surrounded by weak emotional performances, both from CGI and real people. In this outing, Megan Fox's eye candy character was replaced by Victoria Secret's model (and current Jason Statham girlfriend), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whiteley was an improvement in sense of acting ability, but the part was written levels below what Fox was given. The original love interest had layers, depth and some edge, while Whiteley was given virtually no background, no emotional outlet and nothing to do but stand there and be hot. Sure, the 12-year old in the audience doesn't want or need more, but to them I say, ""Go grab a Victoria Secret's catalog from your parent's bathroom and stay out of my movie.""<br/><br/>Beyond the magical pair of leads, Bay brings back the regular tough guys, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, to keep on keeping on. They both do fine jobs and don't try to make this more than it is. Coming in for the first time in the franchise is Frances McDormand, an Academy Award winner to class up the joint. While she was amusing and brought a little more skill to the screen, her part was borderline over-the-top, even in a movie with three story tall robots, because she had to balance out John Tuturro who drifts somewhere off to Hunter S. Thompson land. As if they weren't enough, Bay decides to bring in an unusual amount of big name cameos, including John Malkovich (who does a decent job in his few scenes) and Ken Jeong (who seems to be acting in a completely different movie, possibly thinks he's filming Hangover 3). I saved the best for last though, my personal favorite and the only person I was actually thrilled to see appear on screen, Alan Tudyk (who plays Tuturo's assistant/bodyguard). Tudyk is a cult TV and film legend to his legions of fans spanning from the days of Firefly, Dollhouse and other projects not created by Joss Wheedon. Tudyk was the one person I actually cheered form when he magically appeared on screen.<br/><br/>I could go into a section now where I talk about the story, the plot lines, the connective tissue of the writing, but in reality, Bay didn't really care and neither do the younger members of the crowd, so let's just skip it.<br/><br/>The End of the Page recommendation: Transformers: Dark of the Moon starts slow, goes out with a bang and delivers surface entertainment for the middle school crowd."
"Hamzakhalid","5","24","32","3 January 2012"," Well I pretty much got what I was expecting.
","I'm seriously surprised at most of the reviews that streamed about this movie. I think that critics and movie reviewers need some perspective, this is a Michael Bay film about transforming robots that kids used to play with (including me), so I went in with the right amount of expectations and got a very impressive visual experience. Now I'm not giving Micheal Bay an excuse to make a bad film but as far his movies go, this is definitely one of his finer ones.<br/><br/>It has both its pros and cons. Pros: The story is a HUGE improvement over the second one, with some good twists added there and then, albeit a bit long. Now it's not Phenomenal story telling but acceptable enough for a good fun summer action film. The character development is able to keep me watching since the second one had absolutely NONE of it. The SFX are fantastic. This movie has the best CGI out of all 3 in the trilogy. Even the smallest robots look very realistic. The action scenes are AMAZING. I could actually differentiate between the good guys and bad guys this time, its amazing how much more depth it adds to the scenes. The highway scene is my favourite from the movie. The robots also get a lot more screen time and pay a more important part to the story than before. Unlike in the second one, each robot gets a fair amount of screen time and does something useful instead of just being the military's attack dogs.<br/><br/>The cons: The humor is unnecessary and unfunny, although it has been cu down to minimal amounts .The romance is useless and awkward. The two main leads don't have any chemistry and I don't see why Shia needs to be paired up with a hot supermodel every film (or why he still even needs to be there at all). The acting is meh, shia and josh are great but the rest of the cast is pretty...meh. Rosie has very little acting talent, although she is a slight improvement over megan fox in terms of acting. The soundtrack is awesome but it sounds very very similar to the scores in the Dark Knight and Inception. The decepticons are still portrayed as mere evil destruction machines who hate everything, i wish they were more developed characters and that the relationships between the robots were explored more, I mean, whenever any bot dies, the others are literally cool with it two seconds later and do not mention the incident again. (SPOILER) Megatron is no longer the evil villain bent on dominian, instead he's simply the anti hero who is solely focused on saving his planet, HE EVEN SAVES PRIME'S LIFE at the last second simply because Rosie called him sentinel's bitch(SPOILER).The biggest problem which I had with the ending is that it is wrapped up too quickly, another 2 mins would have been fine. The movie's run time is very long, the first hour could've been done in 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Overall I think the movie is able to deliver a very entertaining experience. Yes the trilogy would have been better in different hands but I was able to enjoy it as much as I did the first one. Just don't go in expecting anything revolutionary or brilliant, turn of your mind, ready the pop corn and enjoy.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10"

","Now Transformers Dark Of The Moon, is something that you like or hate, Me, i love it. Now, i see why people hate Transformers 2, but i like it, it's not perfect, but i had fun with the movie, a solid 8/10. So what did this movie did right and wrong in my opinion. Let's take a look, shall we?<br/><br/>Pros -Best Acting -Best Action -Has a surprising depth of emotion if you look hard enough -I enjoy Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly, more than Meagen Fox -Most Epic -The humor is cheesy, but so is the original Freddy Kurger, and i have not met anyone who hates him. I like the humor. -Best story <br/><br/>Cons -I like the ending, but a little too abrupt, and that what can set a balance from a perfect score, or a near perfect score.<br/><br/>Overall: It depends on your expectations, but i love this film. It's the best of the 3 movies in my opinion. This is a movie that you need to see for yourself.<br/><br/>Finalll Verdict:9/10 Outstanding"
"rawpow192","7","43","62","28 November 2011"," Good considering what it is
","I have to say I enjoyed watching Transformers 3. If you take it for what it is, a Michael Bay movie with awesome, epic visuals, an over-the- top weak plot, not very deep characters, and classic 'Bay' humor, then it's great. Not as good as the first, but easily better than the 2nd one. <br/><br/>First off, the visual effects are amazing. One of the best, if not the best, that I've seen, both in details on the transformers, in action/fighting sequences, and in more general landscape shots - the views of Chicago when it was being attacked by decepticons were great. I watched it in 3D in the theater, and it was arguably the best 3D effects I've seen, and best use of 3D cameras, and that is including Avatar which i also saw in 3D. This is what Michael Bay is really good at, and this movie shows he is arguably the expert in visual effects and composition.<br/><br/>visual effects and presentation - 10/10<br/><br/>The plot isn't great. When it starts out, it seems like it might develop nicely into a moderately complex story rooted in some historical events that happened very differently than how we thought (kind of like the hoover dam part in the first transformers), but in the end not much is made of that and the plot is relatively direct and over-the-top. However, it does have a few good moments that offer a bit more complexity or emotion, and anyways I didn't watch the movie hoping for a subtle, complex, and nuanced plot.<br/><br/>Plot - 6/10<br/><br/>The characters and acting aren't Oscar-worthy either, to say the least. Rosie Huntington-Whitely is not a great actress, in fact she isn't really an actress, and it shows, but, to be honest, I have seen worse performances. Shia Labeouf is decent in his role as usual. and again there are some new characters, including some for Michael Bay- esque comic relief (which in my opinion is actually funnier than much of the humor in revenge of the fallen, which felt a little too forced to me).<br/><br/>Characters/acting - 6/10<br/><br/>Fun - 8/10<br/><br/>If you're expecting a layered, nuanced movie with deep characterization and a complex and well-written plot, well, then, don't watch this. If, though, you want a fun blockbuster with truly amazing visual effects, a decent (but forgettable) storyline and characterization, and an easy to follow dynamic, well you'll probably like Transformers 3."

"mmcqueenbey","9","5","5","23 May 2016"," Transformers never fails
","Transformers is by far a classic. Every little kid growing up wanted to own a car that could transform in to a robot/super awesome car. If you never grew up watching transformers, you should take a step back in time and relive your childhood. When they made a real movie I was more than excited, I wanted to go to the movie and watch them all day because my childhood heroes finally became realistic. The first 2 movies was definitely a bang and I anticipated this movie just as much and maybe even more than the others. Once it came out I went to the movie theater just like I did with the first 2 and once again Michael bay and Shia Lebouf never fails. The animation and graphics for this movie is just out of this world. All of his story lines was always on point and you just learn more and more every movie. Optimus prime will always be number 1 and he just takes over each movie. His supporting autobots get better and better each year. As they transform you get more and more details. I love this movie so much. If no one hasn't watched it, turn your TV on and proceed in searching for this movie."
"tbmforclasstsar","2","217","358","28 June 2011"," Where will the explosions stop?
","Around a half hour into watching the third installment in the Michael Bay driven Transformers franchise, a very serious thought entered my head.<br/><br/>""What the f*** is this movie?""<br/><br/>I really am not sure where to begin when discussing such a chaotic mess that seemed like a 6 hour movie stuffed into a two and a half hour potato sack and beaten repeatedly with a pillow case filled with bars of soap.<br/><br/>I guess we can start with the goals that seemed to be laid out in making this third film.<br/><br/>First off, action and CGI were, without a doubt, the number one priority in this film. This makes complete sense. The action and CGI is really exciting to look at and a getaway for some viewers when they see a film; robots transforming from cars, buildings collapsing from the sky, soldiers flying into battle in wing suits, and what must have been thousands of explosions all in 3D.<br/><br/>The next objective had to be comic relief. If you are a minor character, you will say something funny. If you are a small transforming robot, you will definitely say something funny. Don't forget to make the jokes a little more vulgar than the first two films and even a little cheesier. Cheese sells.<br/><br/>The last major objective had to be how much sex appeal can we put in this movie. I suppose when you cast the likes of a Victoria Secret model in her first role in a film (see my previous article about Ms. Huntington-Whiteley from yesterday) and the hunky doctor from Grey's Anatomy your film is set to draw boys and girls alike.<br/><br/>The film accomplishes all of these goals, but at what cost (now it's as if I'm talking in an Optimus Prime voice). What about story? Coherence? Character development? Audience to character relationship?<br/><br/>It seems like I am just beating a dead horse over and over again (or a horse that surely does more coke than Tony Montana when directing his films), but I am more and more offended each time I see a Michael Bay film. Even more so, I am offended every time some moron in the theater tonight started clapping when Bumble Bee had a stellar looking upper cut kill or Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stood slow-mo with explosions blasting all around her (not joking, they clapped).<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a bumbling mess of fire and loud noises and is just another film for Michael Bay to add to the references on his resume for most ridiculous director of all time.<br/><br/>Even worse is the flow and logic of Dark of the Moon. I have seen plenty of films to accept that not understanding what is going on doesn't really matter, but it is different with a mainstream blockbuster. When watching a David Lynch film, you can expect something like this. When watching a film about transforming robots, coherence should be somewhat standard.<br/><br/>For the first hour and a half of the film I had no idea what city the film was in. I heard Sam (Shia LaBeouf) say ""DC"" early on, so I assumed that was where we were. But then his girlfriend Carly (Huntington- Whiteley) worked at the Milwaukee Art Museum (it took a while to realize that the museum was now fictionally home to her boss) and a fight takes place on a highway listing signs to ""Aurora"" and ""Rt. 20"" (names that any Chicago kid would recognize). Hell, the headquarters of NEST is clearly the downtown loop area.<br/><br/>So after a certain transformer leaves the NEST headquarters and is next to the reflecting pool in DC moments later, I thought ""either Bay has decided his audience will have no idea what length of time passes from cut to cut or Milwaukee and Chicago are now Washington DC."" I think the answer is the latter, but I am still not sure.<br/><br/>This is just one example of the incoherence that can be found in this film (like how Bumble Bee saves Sam in the middle of the battle and moments later is on his knees for execution by the hands of the decepticons). It is bewildering how unorganized this film is.<br/><br/>Maybe the final goal of Michael Bay in this film was to bring back memories of some of the most significant events in the United States since the 1960s. The film includes the Apollo 11 story, a rocket ship blowing up after take off that is extremely familiar to the Challenger explosion in 1986, and, as if the event being referenced wasn't fresh in many minds, sky scrapers tumbling to the ground and characters falling out of windows to their death.<br/><br/>There seemed to be no goal to the film other than mind fluff; expensive, loud, and annoyingly repetitive mind fluff. As a major credit to the special effects and CGI team, the film's action is a tremendous accomplishment. The problem is the success is contained in a film that has absolutely no other redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon is almost too bad to describe. I would like to say it contains the worst story and flow in any movie I have ever seen, but that would just seem overly dramatic. <br/><br/>I will say this, there were much better ways I could have spent my $15.50 and two and a half hours of my life than seeing this film. There have been enough films with explosions in the last five years to not have one for another 50."
"joefitz60","4","408","691","28 June 2011"," Amazing visual spectacle but tedious and full of clichés
","This film is certainly an outstanding visual spectacle that boasts some of the most impressive, fluid and stunning cgi sequences I've ever seen. The photography is fantastic and the 3d technology is used effectively to create stunning, visually amazing scenes. However, that is the only aspect of the film that I believe deserves merit at all. <br/><br/>Despite the continuous action, destruction and battles, I found this film to be extremely boring, and the final battle, which claimed the last hour of the film was far too long and drawn out and it greatly prevented me from appreciating the visual spectacle that is the final battle as it's so long it becomes tedious and I couldn't wait for it to end. <br/><br/>The extensive use of cgi action scenes was what ruined the film for me, and although I never fully agree with the typical view that modern films have too much cgi and effects and not enough good story, this film certainly presented a convincing case that the above statement is true. As there is so much shooting, exploding and fighting in this film there is relatively little time for dialogue, which was largely, poorly written, and full of clichés. <br/><br/>Finally, I didn't rate the casting of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or her performance. She has clearly been chosen for the role for her good looks and her great sex appeal although I think she shines brighter as an underwear model than blockbuster film actress. Also, It seems unbelievable to me that Shia LaBeouf's character, although not a bad looking guy, has been in relationships with 2 characters played by women who have both topped the annual FHM 100 sexiest women in the world poll. Rosie has clearly been cast to attract more male viewers, bring sex appeal that the film didn't really need and throughout struck me as being far out of Shia's league."

","Just been to see it at the odeon in Liverpool switch island in 3d, wow fantastic movie, i need to see it again to take it all in, full of action and a far better story that the previous one although i liked the second one, i was somewhat sad at the end to see a lot of decepticons killed off, but we all know they can be brought back to life. Don't miss this in 3d its one of the best i have seen so far.<br/><br/>its got lots of laughs and a few new autobots, although a lot of people did not like the twins in the last movie, i felt they should of been included in this one even if it was a small appearance.<br/><br/>Lets hope they don't stop there and bring us more of the transformers."
"usskirkncc3001","1","350","597","30 June 2011"," I have seen the future of horror, and his name is Michael Bay
","He has now made two blockbuster movies which make no sense no matter how many ways you try to put them together, and people don't seem to care. The critics have brutally trashed both this movie and ""The Fallen"" movie, yet audiences love both films although they seem to have been put together by a group of 2nd graders who playing out randomly strung together old cartoon episodes with their toys. <br/><br/>I am an old school fan who liked the first two movies, but ""Dark of the Moon"" makes ""Fallen"" look like Shakespeare. It's incredible how many people are saying that this movie is better than ""Fallen"". With all its faults, at least ""Fallen"" had humor, some incredible action sequences and effects, and an interesting, if incomplete, script. This movie has none of these things. This is a very long and boring movie that wastes the talents of good actors. The attempts at humor are painful to watch. The three Transformers movies cannot be connected now no matter how hard you try. To make another sequel would be ludicrous, but seeing how much money this drivel is making already, I bet they have already taken the five minutes needed to write the next one. The original writers were smart to bail out of this train wreck after Bay made them write ""Fallen"" in a couple of days and went on to butcher the little that they had time to write. This time there was no writers' strike, so I expected better--like explanations and connections across all three films. You'll get none of that here, just more incomprehensible nonsense that ignores the other films. You don't know what's going on half the time, and the final battle has no pacing, motivation, or orientation--it just drags on and on and on---like that 20 minute desert sequence in ""The Fallen"" multiplied by 10. <br/><br/>What happened to the Cube's knowledge in Sam's brain? Why was Sentinel Prime's ship shot down by the people that were working with him? How was Megatron going to rendezvous with him if they ended up finding earth in different time periods? Why did Megatron go after the cube if the original plan seemed to be to enslave earth and transport Cybertron there using the space bridge? How did Sentinel's ship crash on earth's moon if it was shot down over Cybertron? Why didn't Megatron go after the Space Bridge parts when he awoke in the first movie? Why didn't he after he awoke in the second movie? Why didn't they use the shard in the second movie to activate Sentinel on the moon instead of Megatron? How did Sentinel, the Cube, and the Sun Harvester all end up on earth? Why are the Transformers not even bothering to project human images in their car modes anymore? Why does Prime carry The Matrix of Leadership (a key to activate the Sun Harvester) inside of him and use it to energize Autobots which it is not meant to do? When, why, and how did an entire army of generic Decepticons hide inside of the moon? Why do the Transformers transform? These are just a few of about a hundred questions that this movie brings up. I suspect that not even Michael Bay knows the answers, and he doesn't care. it's insulting.<br/><br/>There are some good ideas, but it's all put together very badly, and not much is explained. Watching this movie gave me the feeling that Bay and the actors are here to wrap this up and are not interested in this material. The studios will be pressuring him to make #4, so he can get some 3rd graders together to write a script again---yet another group of Autobots has been buried in a volcano for 4 million years! They can transform to dinosaurs-- no explanation is necessary. Out of all of the planets in the infinite universe, their ship crashed on earth because...well because the script says so. They were looking for the cube, no-- the Harvester, no-- the space bridge, no wait...they were looking for the ancestor of Michael Bay. If Bay is never born, these movies would never exist and we can reboot."

Spread over a bottom-numbing two-and-a-half hours, ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon"" can also induce mental and metal fatigue, especially with the clanging robots smashing one another - and the whole exercise making little sense.<br/><br/>Technologically, however, ""Dark Of The Moon"" is Bay's best work so far - and action fans looking to be awed by scenes of massive mayhem and destruction in 3D should be satisfied. Story-wise, this one is better than ""Revenge Of The Fallen"", but not as fun and emotionally-connecting as the first.<br/><br/>The film opens with a flashback to the Sixties Apollo landing mission where history is rewritten (by Ehren Kruger) to incorporate the cover-up of an alien spaceship crashing on the moon. That spaceship, of course, is one of the remains of the epic battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and its 'discovery' sparks off another war that threatens to destroy planet Earth. Or at least the face of Chicago as we know it.<br/><br/>On the human level, we find that Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has traded in his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) for a newer model (a Victoria Secret one, to be exact) in the shape of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly). Sam is being offered a job by Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich) but we soon learn that Carly's boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) may be up to no good. Then, when the conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons hots up, Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) of the elite Government squad NEST are summarily called into action.<br/><br/>We get lulled into believing that there may somehow be an intelligent plot coming from the conspiracy of the NASA lunar-landing cover-up which also involves the Russian space program and Chernobyl. These turn out to be just an exercise in 'historical name-dropping' to spur our interest before we get to the demolition derby created by the Transformers. Indeed, some of the robots seem to emote better that the live cast. Cybertron leader Sentinel Prime, for example, is even designed to look like Leonard Nimoy (who provides its voice), complete with stuff that looks like beard. Again, the problems of the previous installments recur - like the confusion between the good and bad robots in the clashes.<br/><br/>Unlike the first two movies, there are no more gags about the shock of humans interacting with the mechanical 'bots. Bay, however, insists on some comic sequences and he has hired Ken Jeong to do his in-your-face shtick as Jerry Wang. John Turturro reprises his role as former FBI agent Simmons but this time around, Turturro finds it fit to clown around with his role. The most striking inclusion to the cast is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam's love interest. However, with limited acting talent, she provides only eye-candy and beside her, Megan Fox would look like an Oscar-caliber actress.<br/><br/>Like the first ""Transformers"", this one is also a live-action cartoon on a grand scale. Scenes of Chicago buildings being toppled and destroyed can be as spectacular and brain-numbing as those of September 11; and the wing-suit flying sequences are breath-taking. Indeed, these are what most of Michael Bay's fans pay for and they will not be disappointed. The only problem for me is that Bay prolongs and repeats the robotic clash sequences to the point of being self-indulgent. Technically brilliant and visually arresting, ""Dark Of The Moon"" lacks heart and soul. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"
"xaositect-93-977101","2","176","294","29 June 2011"," terrible, stupid, ridiculous
","i checked IMDb today after i came home from the cinema, and saw that the movie has almost 7 points... i just had to register to write this review.<br/><br/>It was absolutely terrible. In advance, i'd like to apologize for using the world ""ridiculous"" too many times, but that's the best one to describe this masterpiece. of course one would expect that a story about 30 m high robots is a little bit ridiculous, but it was really over the top. After things started going, there wasn't a single minute in the film where something utterly ridiculous did not happen. So many examples... I'll list some of them and some of my problems<br/><br/><ul><li>the chick checks the 2 evil robots with the spyglass, sees that they have an argument. later on, she decides to turn megatron against the bearded guy (the super villain high tech robot megatron), and she persuades him. yeah, that's right. that's some neat intrigue you might expect from hose luis Fernando from a Brazilian soap opera, you get it here with a super robot in a 100 million dollar budget film with Steven Spielberg's name. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>they don't stop telling each other secrets of the government. no question, no reason, it's needed because the story can't progress, so why not tell something that's been a state secret for 30 years, or even yell it in front of 30 people. every time this happens, you just ask loudly in your chair: WHY THE HELL DID HE TELL THAT? but there's never an answer</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>no one thinks forward in the movie, not even the decepticons. the bug just came off the main guy's wrist after the decepticons thought the auto bots left.why the hell did it come off and just left the guy that has been a major pain in the ass for the decepticons in the past decade? why didn't it stay on him or kill him? humans don't kill each other, even if it would be in their best interest. no, they let the hostage live and tell secrets so he can escape and ruin their plans. the robots somehow avoid killing humans until the last part of the movie </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the movie has some weird comical parts, some of them childish, and they don't kill any humans in the first half of the movie. but then there is a gay joke and at the end the human killing strangely begins, decepticons shoot people to ash and their skull rolls on the ground after they evaporated. so please mr bay, decide if you want a movie for the audience of spy kids,and don't show sexual/violent stuff, or make a scifi for adults, and don't make it retarded. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>they replaced Megan fox with this blonde chick, a significant portion of the movie was centered around her ass or boobs. this was actually a semi-valid reason to look at this terrible piece of a movie, but is this really justified in a sci-fi?. and btw she's 10 cm higher than the protagonist and she can't act. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>they keep fighting with idiotic weapons, optimus even has a flame ax or what the heck now. really. super high tech robots equipped with huge ass cannons fight like tom cruise in the last samurai with close combat weapons. optimus prime even had some kind of fight position at the start of one fight, like a martial artist, which looked really stupid.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>they couldn't think of a decent new villain, so they just repeated the one in the last episode. an ancient robot on top of a big building doing some kind of intergalactic mambo jumbo for half an hour. pretty lame, also what's up with robots having beard mustache hair out of metal, it isn't bad ass it's idiotic</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>starscream has the ability to shoot a missile that utterly destroys a gigantic space ship full of auto bots. meanwhile throughout the movie the high tech super intelligent robots keep fighting with knives and swords. no comment </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the trend continues, new robots appear that resemble some ridiculous characters. we have a fat robot now, old ones with beard and male pattern baldness, troll doll robot, an eagle robot (that flies with metallic wings, not engines), megatron gets a hood and looks like some dark wanderer now, and my favorite, his lackey, the HUNCHBACK robot. yeah, that's right. megatron has the robot version of the hunchback of Notre dame. that sole character, that they attempted to take it seriously made the whole thing retarded, even without the countless other stupid characters and scenes of the movie that would only satisfy a mentally handicapped teenager</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>laws of physics work differently in the movie. collapsing buildings/robots avoid humans, a metallic building structure hangs in the air in a ridiculous position, the scientist robot sucks a whole metal PLANET through a portal right next to earth and nothing happens (and btw first the summoning is interrupted and there is a planet cut in half near earth, with a plainly cut surface at the intersection, and then the summoning is restored and it CONTINUES to come out of the portal.). somebody before this planet-portal scene mentions that they wanna make the humans slaves to rebuild the planet.later, robots are slaying humans left and right, killing everyone. that's clever, killing your slaves </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>full of idiotic clichés like the grand American speech of the commander to talk soldiers into impossible mission, ""we only need one shot"", etc, really anyone finds these cheap and bad</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the protagonist's parents are so annoying, they make you wanna kill the writer of the script slowly and painfully</li></ul><br/><br/>-etc etc<br/><br/>could go on for about 3 pages... really, don't watch this movie if you want yourself good. visuals make it a worthy 2/10"
"jamieadd38","1","63","99","8 July 2011"," Dear Mr Bay - Transformers 3
","Dear Mr Bay After recently viewing your latest movie I couldn't help but feel you need a few tips on: a) General movie making and plot writing b) Making a Transformers movie Although I know nothing of these I feel I could still do a much, much better job than you did with your latest movie. So here goes.<br/><br/>To begin with, when writing a plot it is often a very good idea to stick with a few simple ideas, unless you're making Inception but please don't try this, as I'm already cringing at thought. As you have probably found, or will soon find, people don't like it when you try to add little pieces together to make one big whole, this just doesn't work out to be a good story, or a very well thought out story. Hence the gaping plot holes in your latest story. For example, if the Decepticons had been removing pillars from the Dark Side of the Moon years and years ago what was the point of the first two movies? With a movie it is also a good idea to not try build suspense at every turn, have massive pivotal moments that last 5 seconds and insignificant pointless moments that last 15 minutes. And just because you found a girl that you thought could replace Megan Fox doesn't mean that she needs to have long freeze frame shots, heroic moments or even to be in the movie. And not every character has to be a hero. Optimus Prime definitely, Bumble Bee understandable, Sam Witwicky...maybe in a human kind of way. But not every character with a small speaking part needs to be a hero and change the course of history, if that was the case then everyone would just be normal and there wouldn't ever be heroes right? Also when casting characters don't pick every minor comedic actor that auditions, because similar to the piecemeal nature of your story line, lots of minor comedic actors don't make for a funny movie. And when I went to see the Transformers 3 movie I didn't say ""Hey, that'll be hilarious"" I said ""Awesome, I can't wait for epic fight scenes and intense visual and audial effects that make me excited for days after"" Which leads me to my next 2 major problems.<br/><br/>I understand that you just make movies but you'd think that you'd understand the two things that made the first Transformers and saved the second. Epic Autobot/Decepticon fight scenes and amazing transforming sounds. Both of which your movie lacked or pretty much ignored. The only reasons I said I'd return to a Transformers movie after the failure of the second one but for some reason you thought it's be fine without these things and that you could fill the movie with ridiculous amounts of human characters, explosions, and epic moments.<br/><br/>And to top it all off you make 2 little pet transformers, that annoyed the audience throughout the movie, have one of the most pivotal moments in the victory of the Autobots! And then the new Transformers girl, who should stick to modeling by the way, convinces Megatron, the absolute evil and most powerful Decepticon, to kill Sentinel Prime! Why the heck wouldn't he just squash her? This would probably have saved the movie in my opinion but sadly we can add this to the long line of missed opportunities in your movie.<br/><br/>But the worse thing that you could have possibly done...is killed off Ironhide in the way that he was killed. You're talking about the weapons and combat expert of the Autobots, the heavy unit, second only to Optimus and you kill him off like he was one of your several other dispensable characters. How do you sleep at night? I just find it hard to believe that after the last Transformers movie you actually managed to make a worse movie. I mean here was your chance at redemption, something simple, maximum transformer fighting, maximum transforming sounds! It looks so good in my head! But then I think about what you did...and it all crumbles and my heart dies just a little more.<br/><br/>So my advice to you is maybe you should really try and understand what the Transformers is all about, it doesn't have to be complicated, you don't have to have 5000 transformers, or characters for that matter. Keep it simple stupid. Fewer characters, fewer epic moments, more transforming, more transformer fighting, Optimus blitzing it out with any Decepticons who cross his path, awesome Bumble Bee/Iron Hide combo kills, Sam calls his girlfriend to say whats up but nothing more from her because she can't act very well, Ironhide dies a noble death if needs be (although questionable), no comedy, and just one epic world saving moment not 50.<br/><br/>And my advice for anyone going to see the movie...don't.<br/><br/>Make up your own ideal Transformers 3 story line and watch Transformers 1 again.<br/><br/>I wish I had.<br/><br/>So thank you Mr Bay, for ruining something I held so dear.<br/><br/>Yours totally and utterly sincerely Jamie Stronge."
"Loving_Silence","7","401","704","15 June 2011"," A Big Improvement from Revenge of the Fallen
","As a huge fan of the Transformers animated series, I like the first Transformers film. The visuals were spectacular and so were the fighting scenes When I saw Transformers 2, which is a HUGE mess of a film, I was really angry. I vowed never to see a Transformers film ever again. But when the trailer of Transformers 3 came out, I actually got a little interested. I mean the special effects were pretty much great as usual. But this time, it seemed they took off the annoying little robots and that annoying mother and replaced them with good old fashioned action.<br/><br/>When I went to an advanced screening yesterday, I still came in with relatively low expectations. I have to say, that Transformers 3 is an overall improvement from its predecessor, Transformers 2. The film was pretty much at level with the first film, though. The action scenes were highly extravagant and at times, pretty epic. The movie had a lot less lame scenes, which is always a plus. The acting was okay. Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was okay, but she's certainly not a good actress, but a mediocre one, actually I liked her more than Megan Fox. I liked how the movie used the Apollo landing as a part of its story, like in Forrest Gump. However there were so many characters that were extremely thinly written. John Turturro's character was definitely not needed and some of the dialogue was incoherent and very messy, at times. The movie is also way too long, at 157 minutes, wow. I thought the last scene with Megatron was completely rushed and so was the ending. Although the last hour of the film is pretty epic at times, so I was fulfilled with the visual effects.<br/><br/>Overall I rate Transformers 3, an 7/10. Don't go in expecting a Best Picture winner/nominee. With the right amount of expectations, you will probably be fulfilled. A definite improvement over Revenge of the Fallen, which doesn't say much. But at the end, the great special effects and extremely extravagant action scenes more than make up its flaws. I'd recommend this film if you like the franchise."
"limoncella-641-42235","6","238","414","28 June 2011"," Transformers 3: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
","Man, so much stuff happens in this damn movie. One can only scratch the surface of what the movie has to offer when reviewing it. The best I can do is list the best and worst of it.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>The best thing about these movies is how they look, how well the transformers integrate into the real-life footage to make a compelling action sequence. Here it's cranked to eleven, and the CG is very impressive. On the larger shots, even tiny transformers far in the background look convincing.<br/><br/>There a several action set pieces (specifically towards the end) which are easily some of the best of the trilogy. The whole scene with the collapsing building and the tracking shot of Optimus slicing and smashing his way through a bunch of decepticons are colossal showstoppers.<br/><br/>This is also one of the best 3D movies to date. One major critique of 3D is that 3D glasses make the film darker, but here they do a very smart thing, the film itself is brighter than your average movie and this problem evens itself out. Another thing that worried me before I saw it is that if there was so much high-speed action maybe that and the combination of 3D would give me motion sickness, end of the movie: no problems.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>The villains suck. Megatron does absolutely nothing throughout the whole film until right at the end, and even that was a let down. Shockwave appears briefly at the start and vanishes for two hours, he himself doesn't actually do much, it's all down to this big nameless tentacle-clad decepticon he works with. Starscream does nothing, but then he never did anything anyway. I'm not even going to mention Patrick Dempsey. But the biggest let down is with the movies main villain ""Sentinel Prime"". Basically he is Optimus' predecessor but he changed sides to the decepticons and made a deal with Megatron to bring life back to their home planet Cybertron. This is the driving element of the movie, but there are many plot holes from this. Early in the film Optimus basically says he wants to make Sentinel Prime leader of the autobots again, and offers him the matrix (an item that brings dead transformers back to life) but Sentinel Prime declines. Then he changes sides. Why did he decline taking the matrix? it would in definitely be a help in his ploy. Sentinel Prime gets numerous chances to kill Optimus once and for all, but like all lousy villains he delays his hand and Optimus lives.<br/><br/>The product-placement is out of control. I am not joking when I say there is a scene where Shia LaBeouf stops the movie to recite a Mercerdes Commercial<br/><br/>The annoying characters from the last movie are gone, save one. The little autobot who humped Megan Fox's leg makes a return. Just be thankful there's no Skids and Mudflap<br/><br/>The Down-Right Ugly<br/><br/>The acting here is a range from Tolerable to Impossibly-Bad. There are actors here that have been in some high quality material that just blatantly signed onto this because A) they wanted a paycheck B) they have nothing else on their schedules I mean John Malkovich and Frances McDormand are Oscar nominees who are so unbelievably bad in this movie they make Shia Lebeouf look like Laurence Olivier and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is the stiffest most wooden actress i've seen in ages. John Turturro is awkward but after three movies I don't care anymore.<br/><br/>Stereotypes a-hoy, not as prominent as before but it's here. We have: Tyrese Gibson and some other black guy fist-bump and ridicule one another. We have LeBeouf call a Japanese man ""Moto-Mushi-Ichi"" and decepticons with dreadlocks. Plus that gay guy from the hangover makes an appearance as some loony scientist, but luckily Michael Bay had the sense to drop him out of a window.<br/><br/>Some visceral ""American"" moments, like using the moon landing to spark the movies plot. Also blowing up the statue of Lincoln to let Megatron sit on the chair instead. Since i'm British I didn't care for these scenes that are obviously meant to say to American audiences: ""These decepticons are blowing up America! Damn Them!""<br/><br/>In Conclusion, I may have some major complaints with this movie but it is a ton of fun. The movie delivers on everything it promises and everything you expect and not a single dull moment. If you loved the first movie, and loved the second movie (god help you) I can guarantee you will love this movie even more. I'd say the definitive summer film this year has been made clear.<br/><br/>So.. Viewing Audience.. Roll Out..."
"corneliusdion","8","18","25","10 November 2011"," Not Perfect...But the Best of Three
","I've watched it for almost 5 times, so I think, now I can make the best review of mine based of experiences from watching Transformers: Dark Of The Moon.<br/><br/>Starting with an eye-stunning movie in 2007 (Transformers), a pure summer blockbuster in 2009 (Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen), and an epic in 2011 (Transformers: Dark Of The Moon), Transformers hit the world, attacked by the critics, and rise again in 2011. When this series come to an end, people will be expecting more. Yes. Dark Of The Moon is the sweet finale of the series. Rumor: there'll be TF4, but I thought TF3 is the best way to end the series.<br/><br/>The duration is about 152 minutes, it's the Avatar's duration. But when I watched this movie, honestly, I hoped it will last longer, especially the duration of final fight in Chicago. It really made me forget to breathe.<br/><br/>It's 3D, no doubt, it's better than Avatar, giant alien robots on earth cooler than blue aliens in Pandora, it's more realistic too. And the actions were unlike the other 3D action movies, TF3 used many of slow motions in action sequences and a perfect lightning, so they wouldn't make you dizzy and surely: an eyegasm.<br/><br/>The graphics, especially the CGs, surely the best of three, the robots, even without 3D, looked so real, for me it's the big improvement from TF2's CGs.<br/><br/>The story, I liked the story, not too noisy like TF2, and not too plain like TF, the mystery was quite smart, and it's darker, and it's cool. The acting of Shia was the best, I thought his goal to controlled the emotions of his viewers was achieved, and Rosie, she's more likable than Megan.<br/><br/>The movie was nearly perfect, it could be 10/10 if there's less scenes of Sam and Carly, I thought they're unnecessary, if the scene of highway battle last longer and added, it'd be so cool, so it's become 9/10. And what makes the movie's score become 8/10 is there're many unnecessary Carly's sexy scenes, the main base of the movie was epic, but that sexy scenes make the movie just like a simple blockbuster movie like TF2. And the dialogs, it could've been better and more lovable like in TF.<br/><br/>So, TF3 is not perfect, but it's very entertaining, it's the best action movie ever, and by the way, what do you expect from Michael Bay's movie than CG and explosion?"
"elkabong-dd","2","165","285","11 August 2011"," Product Placements and Ducklips
","OK, let's be fair to this movie. The special effects were great -- assuming you can suspend your belief in physics long enough to enjoy them. The rest of this movie was awful. <br/><br/>The product placements for Lenovo, Cisco, Waste Management and Chevy Impala were overwhelming. There was a product placed in almost every scene, and the sheer SIZE of the logo overshadowed most scenes. It was brutal, even for Michael Bay. <br/><br/>And the leading woman (I refuse to look her name up for this review) - the giant implants she had in her lips gave her that permanent ""duck- lip"" look. Gross. <br/><br/>It's sad to see so much of Hollywood's money go to tripe like this. There must be better things to fund. <br/><br/>2/10, and all of the ""2"" is special effects."
"marksheehyagencies","8","29","44","29 June 2011"," A solid entry that, much like its female star, is nice to lack at but lacks real substance. Skip the first hour and its incredible.
","After the critical back-lashing Revenge of the Fallen, Michael bay stated that the third and possibly final Transformers would take away everything that failed in the last movie and give the audience what it wanted. But has he learned his lessons? Yes and no. Gone are the racially insensitive robots, the incredibly messy and clumsy plotting and much of the dizzying, incomprehensible camera-work. What remains is the poor geeky humour and questionable performances from the leads. Shia Labeouf was very enjoyable in the first movie but here has gone into overdrive, and his character Sam Witwicky has become much less relatable and interesting. His home life in particular (of which the first half of the movie focuses) is getting irritating. His girlfriend problems and embarrassing parents boring and we really couldn't care that much about how he feels unappreciated for saving the world twice. Then there's Megan Fox's replacement: Rosie Huntington-Whitely. She can't act. At all. It wasn't expected that the former model would be that great but she really is poor.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is much like Rosie. Nice to look at (especially in 3D) but lacking any substance at all. We are left with Ken Jeong doing his Hangover thing in a 12A film, and not being funny, just very annoying. And John Malkovich doing his thing but really just embarrassing himself. There are reams of exposition, while the plot is better than the last two films it is still handed out poorly. Bay won't let the action tell the story, it has to be action, break, story, break, action. The rest of the first hour is just CGI and Shia going mental while Rosie watches blankly.<br/><br/>But all of a sudden the supporting comic actors are dropped and Michael Bay does what he does best: Explosions and fighting. An impressive freeway chase leading into a fight a plot twist (yes a plot twist in a Transformers movie) and a death of a significant character. The whole film gets better from here. The plotting gets tighter, John Tuturro and Frances McDormand are given more screen-time (there were so many Coen favourites in this movie I was expecting John Goodman to be voicing an Autobot) and the action is dished out in spades. Whe the decepticons invade Chicago all hell breaks loose. And we are given fights, battles, explosions and collapsing buildings galore. Robots kick, punch and rip each other apart. And this is where the third dimension comes into play. This is definitely the best 3D experience since Avatar. Watch in awe as Optimus Prime tears chunks of metal out of other giant robots and chucks them at the screen while in the depths of the background, aerial battles ensue. It is breathtaking and a triumph for 3D, proving that it can be done properly and amaze the viewer.<br/><br/>If you went an hour late to the movie, and make sure it's a 3D screening, this would be a 5 star experience of pure entertainment. But as it stands it's still a solid closer for the trilogy, an improvement on Revenge of the fallen but not as good as the first."
"zkonedog","6","4","4","8 March 2017"," Still Entertaining, But This Time Lacking In Punch
","I have to give director Michael Bay a great deal of credit in this Transformers series. He manages to make three movies that are basically all just carbon copies of each other and make them all at the very least entertaining. That is no small feat. Thus, although the luster of the franchise begins to wear off (especially towards the film's conclusion) in this installment, ""Dark of the Moon"" still is an entertaining romp that won't leave you bored.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Dark of the Moon"" formulates the notion that the Apollo 11 moon landing was merely a ""smokescreen"" for the retrieval of alien (i.e. Transformer) technology. Many years later, this technology predictably falls into the wrong hands and leaves the fate of the world to Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his military buddies (Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, & John Turturro).<br/><br/>The positives of this movie are the usual: the special effects are a spectacle to behold, the action/adventure is pulse-pounding, and it is just a visual treat to watch. More importantly, though, is that the franchise still goes as LaBeouf goes. Though his exuberance for the Sam Witwicky role seems to have diminished just a bit (and perhaps that can be attributed to the character's aging as well), but his scenes are still the best of the experience.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie also has a few notable ""misses"" that render it only slightly above average. First of is the utter exclusion of Megan Fox's character. I realize that Fox had a falling-out with Bay and wanted nothing to do with this movie, but the fact remains is that her stand-in (supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) has nowhere near that great romantic chemistry with LaBeouf. Rose is just as ""bombshell"" as Fox, but acting-wise it isn't even close.<br/><br/>Also, in this third go-'round, the general plot begins to get the slightest bit old. It is never boring, per se, but it doesn't have that ""edge"" like the first two did when the characters were still fresh.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Dark of the Moon"" is a decent effort that doesn't end up boring in any way. The exclusion (and no explanation) of Fox is the biggest missing piece here, but other than that it is pretty much ""same old story"" (with just slightly less enthusiasm all around)."

","Transformers Dark of the Moon! was to me The Best Movie ever! and i did hear about the 4th sequel Age of Extinction but Haven't seen that recent Transformers movie but anyways. Dark of The Moon was Not that bad of a movie it seemed pretty good. and it was listed at Number 2 of The Highest Crossing Movies of the year 2011. so anyways the Plot of the Movie starts off with In 1961, the Ark, a Cybertronian spacecraft carrying an invention capable of ending the war between the benevolent Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, crash lands on the dark side of Earth's Moon. and you the Cast too doesn't Star Meghan Fox she was replaced by Rosie Huntington- Whiteley and also her boyfriend Sam Witwicky. so anyway the auto-bots of transformers are also in it like Bumblbee Optimus Prime and the rest of them. and the Sound Effects was pretty good and decent and the good fight scenes and even towards the End of the Movie was great too. This Movie deserves a good rating for a Transformers movie I Mean it didn't seem bad at all. but what Dark of the Moon could have improved was the casting or the minutes of how long the movie ran. that's all but still Dark of the Moon was not a bad movie and i Think it surpassed any 2011 movie."

","This movie series finally got really good in comparison to the first two.<br/><br/>The opening was pretty cool because the Transformers' home planet Cybertron was shown. It really showed the origin of the conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons.<br/><br/>Shortly after that, there was too much of the human element in the first quarter of the movie. It gets kind of annoying when the human characters are being developed instead of the Transformer characters developing.<br/><br/>But despite the overwhelming time spent with the character development, it was made up for by the second half of the movie. It was almost non-stop action and fighting sequences. Megatron, once again, really did not have that much influence on the plot of the movie.

It is my second best favorite Transformers movie in the series. I enjoy this movie so much and I just wasn't bored. I have enjoyed about anything that has to do with big robots and even bigger explosions! I know people will disagree with me and put my review down, but this movie was OK and it was far from disappointment! It was Miles better than Revenge of the Fallen and Age of Extinction those two movies were just awful horrible. This one was just big improvement over the second one and the next fourth one sequel. I could really got in the story. It was about Autobots who found Sentinel Prime Optimus the last predecessor and the leader of the Autobots, who later betrayed Optimus Prime and Autobots by making ages ago a deal with Megatron, he formed alliance with the Megatron and Decepticons who wanted to re build Cybertron with pillars that could open a bridge through space and time on our planet and enslave all humans on our world. Together with Megatron they would rule the planet and all Autobots would be exiled from the planet Earth. Sam and Autobots must fight once again. I love the music that they put it in this movie, action and I like the scene with Patrick Dempsey and Sam fighting each other, that was GREAT! Other than that though, as far as entertainment and emotion goes, this was a perfect movie. CGI of robots were good, they weren't bad. I know everything about this movie what is about. It is the last good Transformers movie and the last time we see the crew from the previous movies together. The action was really great, I love the action scenes, the explosions and the story, the plot about this movie isn't terrible or confusing at all, it is good. <br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky did outstanding job as always it is the last time in the movie we see him. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly Spencer did a wonderful performance as Sam's new girlfriend. She wasn't annoying, or such a bimbo diva like stupid shallow Megan Fox, she was beautiful and her performance was outstanding. She wasn't hot, she was convincing actress and I didn't thought anything bad about her. Thank god for Michael Bay replacing Megan Fox with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, I am so glad Megan was gone. Rosie was miles way better than Megan Fox was. John Turturro as Seymour Simmons did a fantastic job portraying once again his character, he gave us an outstanding performance. Patrick Dempsey as Dylan Gould as the main antagonist did an outstanding acting performance as the second villain and Megatron's second in command henchman. This is the second time Patrick Dempsey reunite and work together with Ehren Kruger. He already worked with Ehren Kruger on the third slasher horror film Scream 3 (2000.<br/><br/>Critics are way too hard on Michael Bay! He has said himself that he just wants to make crowd-pleasing movies, and ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" has done exactly that! This film has made 1.1 BILLION dollars at the box-office; and for a good reason. So what if it doesn't have Oscar-worthy performances, and had a few bad jokes here and there. I LOVE those two movies. And the fun part about the latest entry in the series is that I actually did find something deep with it. This film had several emotional moments, and I found myself welling up with tears. And the fantastic score by Steve Jablonsky fit in very well with it.<br/><br/>The movie had a lot of mistakes and holes that I didn't understand. I thought the mythology of the Autobots was already explained in Transformers (2007). Megatron and Shockwave did not had enough screen time in here. The blond women Frances McDormand as Charlotte Mearing Director of NSA was annoying, she annoyed me too much. She blamed Optimus Prime for Sentinel Prime destroying NEST's base and making off with the five pillars. She had no respect to Autobots at all. They saved Earth twice and that was a big thank you for it. I did not like that. When the shuttle Xantium rocket was shot down and destroyed by Starscream, in which one of the booster rockets where the Autobots hidden? Because I only saw one rocket taking off in the air and not two. And in what Ocean the rocket fall? And how did the Autobots come back from water if they can't swim and than they mystery appeared in Chicago so soon, this confuses me so much. <br/><br/>A mysterious event from Earth's past threatens to ignite a war so big that the TRANSFORMERS alone will not be able to save the planet. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and the AUTOBOTS must fight against the darkness to defend our world from the DECEPTICONS all-consuming evil in the smash hit from director Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg. That is the main plot of the third entry of the action sequel science fiction film! The rating of this film I gave is 8/10 this film deserves it! <br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a 2011 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line. First released on June 23, 2011, it is the third installment of the live-action Transformers film series. <br/><br/>8/10 Score: B+ Studio: Paramount Pictures, di Bonaventura Pictures Hasbro Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand Director: Michael Bay Producer: Don Murphy Tom DeSanto Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Ian Bryce, Steven Spielberg Screenplay: Ehren Kruger Based on Transformers by Hasbro Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 34 Mins.

","After the box office success and almost critically panned Transformers film that was REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, that was released in 2009, Paramount Pictures announced that they would be releasing future films in the Transformers saga.<br/><br/>The third film was titled DARK OF THE MOON and the film was released in the summer movie season of 2011. The film was the last film to have Shia LaBeouf in the film as Sam Witwicky and the end of the original trilogy of films.<br/><br/>The film is set three years after the events of the 2009 film, with the Autobots, during the collaboration with the NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers) military force, discovering a hidden alien technology in possession of humans, which had been found by Apollo 11 on the years earlier. However, the Decepticons unveil a plan use the technology to enslave humanity in order to restore Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers.<br/><br/>The story was a really good story and it took inspiration from a novel called Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday, written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel was a prequel to the 2007 film, TRANSFORMERS. Due to the critically panned REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, the Twins were cut out of ""Dark of the Moon"".<br/><br/>The acting is just amazing, but can get dreadful. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky one last time and he does a great job. Megan Fox was originally signed on to play Mikaela Banes in the third film, and Patrick Dempsey's character Dylan Gould was to be the employer of Fox's character, but she was fired, instead Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays Carly Spencer and she does a great job.<br/><br/>She is not as good as Fox but considering the shoes that she had to fill, she could have been a hell of a lot worse. Josh Duhamel, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and the rest of the cast are great in their performances, especially Tyrese Gibson, who was also in another 2011 film, Fast Five, which I previously reviewed.<br/><br/>The CGI is amazing and the action is so fantastic in this film and the best part is at the end of the film, and it was so long but I enjoyed it and the film is 154 minute long feature film.<br/><br/>The music by Steve Jablonsky is fantastic and much more cool and amazing was Linkin Park's song at the end of this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON is not the best Transformers film, but it could have been worse.<br/><br/>8/10."
"CinemaCocoa","8","4","4","12 July 2014"," The Witwicky Trilogy goes out with an indulgent, flawed BANG
","After their disastrous second outing, few people had faith in the third part, but Dark of the Moon rights a lot of the narrative faults and feels like the sequel the first film deserved.<br/><br/>A despondent Sam finds himself out of the limelight as the Decepticon threat appears to have lessened, Mikaela and Bumblebee have left him and he struggles to find a job and direction in life. But when Optimus Prime learns that humanity had found a vital Autobot ship crashed on the Moon, he rescues Sentinel Prime from the wreck, just when the Decepticons return with a plan to restore their homeworld of Cybertron.<br/><br/>Watching Dark of the Moon feels like an endurance test by the time it finishes, this is due to a ridiculously drawn out battle set in Chicago for the climax. While it makes up for Revenge of the Fallen's terribly underwhelming finale, it does become a blur of insignificance after a while because there's simply too much happening! But if there is one thing done right this time is a correct use of characters. A lot of the ludicrous padding and fluff from RotF is completely missing; our human characters are involved but not excessively (ie. Sam's parents hardly feature at all!) and let's say this film provides us with humans who aren't noble and just. There's a lot more of the Transformers too (you would hope so) and it feels like they have a lot more respect shown to them now. Decepticons genuinely appear threatening and the Autobots are shown to have personalities again, continuing from the first film's groundwork (a scene with a silent, brooding Optimus-in-truck-mode is a favourite). The action is off the rails too. More in keeping with the original film we see them transform during battles.<br/><br/>There are some deeply unsettling scenes too. The setup involves assassinations against humans who knew about the mission to the Moon, executed by Decepticon Laserbeak (great to see him too), one where he infiltrates a family's house by pretending to be a friendly Autobot playing with their daughter. Woah, woah! RotF was too cheesy, but this is really dark all of a sudden!<br/><br/>As a fan of the Transformer characters, this film sees a lot of deaths. Some are most unforgivable. We haven't seen this many prominent robot deaths since the slaughter that was the 1986 Transformers: The Movie! The only other gripe I mostly have about this film asides deaths and a bloated finale is Carly, Sam's new love interest (the forgettable Rosie-Huntington Whitely) who is given things to do thanks to the plot, but is far less notable than Fox's Mikaela (I cannot believe I just wrote that) but I do believe the film would be stronger without a love interest. But it is Michael Bay, we need a girl for those slow-mo shots.<br/><br/>It is a vast, vast improvement and a faithful sequel to the 2007 film. It is too long, and it does make some unforgivable decisions regarding Transformer characters, so it feels less perfect in those regards. It is still a fun film though."
"TourettesPersonal","4","235","422","2 July 2011"," Witwicky The Movie!
","Witwicky The Movie! Once again, Transformers is not focused to the Transformers but focused to a human being named Sam Witwicky. This is why I never liked Michael Bay's Transformers. This is why I already predicted ""Revenge of the Fallen"" will fail two years ago because the movie is not interested with Optimus. How can this series be called Transformers if it doesn't have enough Transformers? The Autobots only appear when there are Decepticons attacking and the preachy scenes about them. If there's no action, there's the life of Witwicky. His life is never interesting but the film just wants us to show how important it is. How about less Witwicky and more Optimus? Would it make the film better? I guess so.<br/><br/>Transformers movies never gets a good story. But we still watch these movies for the Autobots and the explosion and the loud noises. Fact: The scenes of the Autobots only exist in the action scenes and the important scenes about them. The rest is all Witwicky and his chick and his uninteresting & unimportant life. There are new Transformers in this film but we never get to know them because it doesn't only have new Transformers, it also have excessive cameos. These celebrity cameos has more screen time than the robot newbies.<br/><br/>The special effects were the only merits of this trilogy. All the transforming, all the robots, all the explosions, all the stuff jumping off the screen. Another Fact: The 3D is ""DARKER of the Moon"". We sure love the action and the explosion but the climax is focused to Sam Witwicky's survival again, and the soldiers and Witwicky again and his new girlfriend and Witwicky then Patrick Dempsey(not spoilers dude) and Witwicky. It's all Witwicky! Yeah, there's Optimus and Bumblebee but mostly focused to Witwicky and the humans.<br/><br/>Saddest thing is, the scenes of Bumblebee were also moderated. He is the only Autobot in the series we know the most and loved but here he is now like Optimus and the rest of the Transformers. Why can't they just call these films ""Sam and the Transformers"" or ""World Invasion: Chicago and Egypt and LA and other places where the Transformies went""? Sounds more credible than ""Transformers"". I'm not really trolling Shia LaBeouf but him as Witwicky is like playing the same roles all over again. I bet he love Michael Bay for giving him these hot chicks. Rosie Huntington-Whitely was only cast for her sexy body and giving Sam a backup. She doesn't improve Megan Fox's Mikaela Beans.<br/><br/>Transformers is supposed to be about the Transformers. But it has more humans, and Witwicky, and Cameos and Witwicky. I think Michael Bay is getting lazy. He's not taking this movie so seriously and the movie ends too quickly and he throws a lot of humanity and celebrity cameos in his excessive runtime. By the way this movie is called ""Transformers"" not ""Human Celebrities"". Well, Bay made a grave mistake."
"dannywales93","8","51","83","4 December 2011"," Why so much hate? this is really good!
","This is really good movie and yes it does have its flaws, but what movie does not? These films are more focused on CGI and action. The plot is smart and is not to hard to follow. I think all of the people are likable in this film. Even though i do miss Megan Fox. As the new actress who plays Carly adds nothing to the film, but like in most action movie, you need a bit of eye candy and a female lead. The action is amazing in my eyes. And the script is not as bad as people make out. But i think it suits the film. People slate this film for all reasons. But is a classic in its own ways. It is just a good fun film. If you want you want a serious film, go watch inception or the godfather. But if you let yourself get in to this film, you will have a blast. I would say its one of the best films of 2011."
"aquin-dmello","1","148","265","15 July 2011"," A good demonstration on how to destroy a movie.
","What an Awful display of commercialized cinema, playing to the tunes of all the wrong stereotypes. A horrible waste of time, effort and money, specially since a lot of effort must have gone into the graphics only to produce this distasteful parody of sorts. This is what you get when you make a movie without passion or substance. Anyway, I intended to ask this question since the first part. What is the point of having a chick running around in these types of movies? Really, is it necessary to have some chick in skimpy clothes romancing around with metal crashing on metal in the background ? Unless off-course you wanted to woo schoolgirls in to watch the movie. My serious advise is, if you have to finish with watching the 3rd installment, rent it. That way you can fast forward through all those disgusting chick flick scenes and watch what you paid for."
"leroyjansen","8","10","13","13 May 2012"," Combination of special effects, sounds, Shia LaBeouf, budget & quality makes this movie amazing.
","Its not the story or the fantasy sci-fi that makes this movie great. Its from beginning to end the special effects that get you trough the movie and the beautiful soundtrack of transformers that sound so familiar every part that comes out. And the epic scenes that start very normal with one object ready for deployment and getting filmed from so many different angles and all of a sudden a 5 minute scene of destruction comes along and boom we are at the next scene where shia labeouf is being funny and a really good actor. For me transformers is all about mind blowing special effects with robots and humans, the story doesn't interest me at all, if i wanted to go for a really good and mind blowing story and transformers would be that, i think the average reviewer would have given it a way higher score. I found it very hard to give this movie a lower grade then a 9 because if i can see a movie more then 5 times were you almost don't see any mistakes with special effect, great humor, great sound animation etc. it deserves a good vote. a 8 is to low for my standards, a 10 is to high.<br/><br/>// Leroy"
"tray8376","10","23","35","29 June 2011"," Great end to the Transformers trilogy!!!
","Despite the negative reviews by critics, this film is packed with classic Michael Bay and Transformers action. From start to finish a great movie, it has great chemistry between the characters and the robots, with an awesome storyline that really makes you think. There are several minor blips and mistakes I noticed, but they do not take away from movie at all. I would say it is slightly better than the first film and a lot better than the second one. Like Michael Bay said the film could go bigger than the second so bringing it back into a small arena was an added bonus. the 3D was also a nice addition to the movie added to the immersing experience. Nonetheless I am a fan of the trilogy and plan on seeing it again. I recommend anyone who is a fan of explosions, non stop action, and comedy to see this film, maybe even twice!!!"
"n-tune1234","8","8","10","4 June 2012"," long movie
","the transformers series is going a little too far now. this film like all the transformers films are is long. there are some bits that aren't necessarily needed. don't get me wrong it's a great movie it's just that it's on for hours. the films ending seemed to me like it was a bit of a rush to get finished but i still like it. <br/><br/>the story line to this movie in the franchise is the best for me. out of all the transformers movies this one has to be my favourite just because of the amazing special effects. i think that they should ma'be start coming to the end of this franchise now because every new plot has a complicating story line to it. if you watch the movie from start to finish you'll be able to get it but if you have a break you are bound to miss an important key to the story.<br/><br/>watch it if you like apocalypse type of movies as the ending sort of seems like it's going to head that way plus watch it if you've watched the rest of the series as you won't be disappointed"
"oziris-gosdem","8","8","10","25 May 2012"," Amazing film
","I'm a really big fan of transformers . The movie had the best action scenes of the Transformers. There are some fabulous action sequences and epic battles that take your breath away. It's technically sublime, but if does go on a bit. After two and a half hours I did feel as If I was suffering from metal fatigue. Incredible visual effects !!! Outstanding. I waited for a long time to see it and after seeing the movie I could only say 2 words ""WOW and AWESOME!!!"" and I saw this 3 times but still interesting. This film tells the story of the future of a thousand years. There all awesome all though the end I think should have been a three way battle instead of Optimus killing them both in 3 seconds but still really good movie Megatron looked awesome. The should make a fourth one with Megatron coming back as Galvatron and Unicron should be in it. Morover,the special effects is where it was at. Big robots, big explosions, big buildings falling down. Those were the highest points.<br/><br/>The story of TF4 is similar to the 1st cartoon movie. Megatron is revived by Unicron and becomes Galvatron. Optimus is replaced by Rodomus Prime in the cartoon movie. I like that Transformers 3 is effective and very clear like in a reality life. Not Boring...I wanna to watch it every time.... I hope continue with next episode more adventures, also more tragic."
"ry-bier","7","8","10","10 March 2012"," Good for the series
","I liked this movie. After the first two I thought this one looked pretty good, better than the first two. It was. I was expecting a long final battle sequence. It took up almost half the movie, which was cool. The acting was pretty good, not to bad. The special effects were some of the best I had ever seen. The Oscar nominated special effects were very fluid. The explosions and fight scenes looked almost more than real. I liked the story, too. I liked the Sentinal Prime betrayal thing, but, the thing with the pillars was kinda strange. The things I didn't like about it was that it starts out slow and sort of dull. But after that it gets steadily better and better. So, for all that I give it an eight out of ten. I do recommend this movie for people who like great special effects and action."
"millers_09","8","8","10","4 February 2012"," Great but not perfect
","I loved a lot of the storyline. It gave some unexpected twists that even caught me by surprise. The voice acting was great once again. The soundtrack is pretty good. The CG animation is greatly improved from the last movies. I hope to see another one. The one thing I really hated about it (and ruins it a lot) for myself is that they gave Sam a new girlfriend and if that wasn't bad enough, they didn't even explain why. I'm not sure if the actor quit or what but they shouldn't of done it. I'm not sure how they'll follow up with the ending though. I think they should have presented a little bit more history on the pillars, Cybertron, and Sentinel Prime. It didn't make sense as to where the Brains robot came from, they should have explained a little bit more of what happened from the last movie to the current one."
"Terryfan","7","6","7","6 June 2015"," Mix feelings
","Well I knew I would have to review this movie sooner or later being this was the only film I saw in theaters in 2011 which I wish now I saw more but it is what it is.<br/><br/>I love Transformers and as you know from my reviews of Transformers Movies, Video Games and TV Shows I am a huge fan of the Transformers however I know not all Transformers can be perfect and this movie prove to be that.<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark Of The Moon prove what happens when you're not paying attention to anything. Everything about this film just feels disappointing.<br/><br/>The Autobots: Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen), Sentinel Prime (Voiced by Leonard Nimoy), Ironhide (Jess Harnell), Ratchet (Voiced by Robert Foxworth), Sideswipe (Voiced by James Remar), Mirage ""Dino"" (Franceso Quinn),Bumblebee, Wheeljack ""Que"" (Voiced by George Coe), Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny) Brains (Voiced by Reno Wilson) The Wreckers Roadbuster (Voiced by Ron Bottitta) and Leadfoot (Voiced by John Dimaggio)<br/><br/>The Decepticons: Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving), Starscream (Voiced by Charlie Adler), Soundwave,Barricade, Shockwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), Laserbeak (Voiced by Keith Szarabajka) and Greg Berg voices Igor.<br/><br/>The voice talent and their performances are what I like best about this movie and it was awesome to have Mr.Nimoy return to Transformers because anything he touches turns to gold. As I set in the theater listening to his voice work I can't help but think of Galvatron the role he first performance in Transformers. It's good to have Peter Cullen and Frank Welker in the film together since they are part of the Transformers for so long and you can't have one without the other.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was good enough as it did have a tense story line Action scenes in the film are the rewarding part as you are given tense and extreme battles. The music is also very well done Also the Special effects are just awesome that is enough to make you go wow<br/><br/>The disappointment I have with this film is that the comedy was really Bad comedy they try to push the comedy and I swear it just so bad that I wanted to cry. The human characters the new ones are pretty much awful and just really insulted my intelligence it just made you wish they added more transformers instead of more stupid human characters who are not even worth the screen time<br/><br/>This in my opinion is the weakest of the films yes I know ""Revenge Of The Fallen"" got a bad rap but this one deserves it more because it is like a wreck on a wreck while it does have some things to make it watchable.<br/><br/>What I like the best of the film is The voice performances of the cast, the music and the action scenes that are just what you hope for in Transformers. What I hated the most is the human cast who are just pretty much the worse punch line in the history of punch lines<br/><br/>But the plot, the action scenes and the voice performances are the redeeming features of this movie<br/><br/>I give Transformers: Dark Of The Moon an 7 out of 10"
"bh_tafe3","7","11","15","18 September 2012"," Back to something resembling form.
","The Transformers series recovers slightly after an horrendous second instalment with a decent final act, providing of course that it is the final act.<br/><br/>The story (yep, unlike No.2 this one has a story) is that the autobots sent a ship out into the galaxy nearing the end of the Cybertronian War which crash landed on the Earth's moon. The Yanks found out about this, which is why they were so eager to land there in the late sixties, their real mission being to investigate this alien vessel. Turns out have the dormant former autobot leader Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, the voice of Galvatron in the original animated film) on board, and he has a cargo that could hand the Decepticons final victory in the Cybertronian war and grant them dominion throughout the universe.<br/><br/>So the stakes are huge, so is the budget. So are the nods to older characters. Uber badass Shockwave finally makes an appearance, the autobots treating him with suitable fear and trembling. The rebel autobot Wreckers make an appearance, though as particularly vulgar characters. The autobots have the odds stacked against them, beaten and exiled, and yet triumph in the end after much sacrifice.<br/><br/>I won't say too much about the plot. Though there aren't many surprises, you're better off seeing them in the film than reading them in this review.<br/><br/>THis is easily the best characterisation of Optimus Prime, and also Megatron in the film series. Sentinel is an excellent addition, and I must admit to chuckling at the various Spock references throughout the film.<br/><br/>So with the human actors. LeBeouf, who I quite liked in the first and found tolerable in the second, is here just annoying. We swap the brunette Barbie Doll Megan Fox, for an actual Barbie Doll in Rosie Huntington Whitely. Though to compensate not being able to see Megan draped over a motor bike in short shorts, we are shown a close up from behind of Rosie walking up a flight of stairs in her underwear. As a matter of fact, that is her introductory scene which tells you all you need to know about her character. Frances McDormand and John Malkovich are both welcome additions and their characters both appear to have walked in off the same film John Turtorro's had in the first movie. Patrick Dempsey is perfect in his role as an oily business man conductor of mass enmity.<br/><br/>Spike's parents were so funny in the first film, and so vulgar in the second, hear they have improved to being merely banal.<br/><br/>Some of the set pieces are astonishing, the highlight being some humans trapped in a sky scraper leaning on another sky scraper, trying desperately to make their way across the fallen building into the still intact one as Shockwave tears the building apart, but the whole battle sequence in Chicago is breathtaking. The ending is suitably dramatic and feels final.<br/><br/>What can I say? Loved the transformer characterisations in this one. Had a couple of decent human characters added and actually had a story, even if it was pretty thin. Better than the second, not as good as the first. Loved it!"

","This film has no redeemable features what so ever, the few good scenes are overshadowed by the horror. Let me say I'm a Transformers fan & liked the first two movies & expected this to be similar to them, well it isn't.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has single handedly destroyed all credibility the Transformers had & that man should never be allowed to make another movie. I wasn't a Michael Bay critic before seeing this film but now hate the man for ruining something I love.<br/><br/>What's worse is this movie will be deemed a critical box office success based on all the poor people who pay to see it and go away feeling like I do.<br/><br/>If I had wanted to watch a humans vs aliens/robots insert generic bad guy here then I would have watched one of those movies. No I payed to watch Transformers instead I got about 30 minutes in total scenes of Transformers & two hours plus of Michael Bay making American soldiers look cool and badass.<br/><br/>Transformers have been fighting a war for centuries, they are supposed to be hardened veterans instead they are used for comic relief & to make humans look cool with the ways they can kill some huge massively armoured and armed robots.<br/><br/>The characters are all morons and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is the most annoying talentless person I have ever had to look at, just seeing her face on the screen in 3D no less made me angry and cringe at the same time. Also they shouldn't have called it Transformers it should have been called Optimus Prime because he's pretty much all you are going to see, the other Transformers are just thrown in as faceless, voiceless filler characters. The 3D is also terrible and pointless I have seen several movies in 3D recently and it was totally under used and wasn't even consistent not being used throughout the movie and the movie was about an hour to long, I prefer long movies but this one actually dragged along not going anywhere.<br/><br/>Sadly I could keep coming up with things I hated about this movie & very little I liked about it, this is the first time I have come away from a movie utterly disappointed & feeling ripped off. I went with my girlfriend & two friends, she liked the first two movies but wasn't a Transformers fan & she didn't like this movie, like me my two friends are life long fans & are utterly disgusted with the waste of space this film was. I am a very disgruntled fan who going into the movie ignored the negative comments and was very open about what I was going to see, what I saw was utter disappointment."
"jakimiku","7","31","51","13 July 2011"," Quite A Spectacle
","Well, lets get a quick look at the film. Explosions, CGI, 3D and after these comes everything else. These three things are the main reason why one should watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon. We all know who Mr. Bay is and what his movies are famous for: explosions, explosions, explosions and destruction, destruction, destruction. Plot has never been his strongest feature, but hey, and i am being totally honest here, it works well enough, at least for me. All i wanted to see was a typical Michael Bay movie, something like Armageddon or the first Transformers, and what i got was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>So, before watching the movie its probably not a sin to say that we were certain of one thing: it couldn't have been worse than Revenge of the Fallen, which, lets be honest, was pretty atrocious. This time we've got plot linked to Moon and Apollo 11, which was clever and worked well for the movie, decepticons taking over the world and turning Chicago into something we're used to see in The Terminator movies and autobots with their human allies resisting them. Oh, and what we don't have is Megan Fox. Thank God for that. The new female lead, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has one task: be pretty and well its safe to say that she succeeds at it, no one expects her to deliver an award-winning performance, but she did really good (it's her first film by the way) and she fits in the movie and with Sam very well. <br/><br/>Anyway, the film is much bigger and more serious than the previous ones. This time we've got emotion and character, which maybe has something to do with, again having Steve Jablonsky and Linkin Park for soundtrack. Iridescent which is played at some points creates an excellent aura. All this decepticon destruction and ""drawing the bigger picture"" motive provides us with more seriousness and depth.<br/><br/>So all in all, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was an awesome watch. It could be for anyone, if only one goes to watch it for the right reasons (needlessly to say explosions, CGI and 3D). We've got fast pace, a lot of visuals, romance, a lot of mayhem and well, a moral (presented heavily with clichés but, hey, no harm). All of which are vital components for a solid summer blockbuster and a clear head to define Transformers as something more than meets the eye. Just sit back and expect a fun and adventurous ride and you won't be disappointed."

It's preposterous. but it IS AWESOME. so, in fact, no, i don't want to be wasting my brain too much getting really 'in' to how deep and thoughtful the movie is. yawn-o-rama. <br/><br/>Having said that, a story is present here, and it works perfectly well for the source material. It tells of a device that has the power to re-shape the universe.<br/><br/>re-shape what i hear you cry? the universe? YES! THE UNIVERSE! that's epic man i don't care what you say. it plays out mostly like an epic fantasy, with it's own mythology and world relatable history. and man, what more do you want? <br/><br/>Michael Bay is the king of blowing stuff up. He's the man here who dreamt ""what would it be like it bunches of massive metallic transforming alien robots started having a war on our planet, smashing each other and everything around them to smithereens"" And I'm so glad he did dream that dream. because this movie perfectly portrays exactly what i'd imagine would happen if this was in fact the case.<br/><br/>We need this guy. Nobody creates this kind of spectacle like he does. it's so impressive. I can't even imagine beginning to conceive some of the sequences he pulls off in this movie. and he does it with such ease. It's so easy to hate michael bay, sure it is. he makes big dumb action movies, but we know this, and i really really enjoy a big dumb action movie once in a while. it's so much fun.<br/><br/>michael bay is the man. yes, THE MAN. he is your man for pure explosive spectacle. No one else would have done a better job of this movie. I genuinely believe that.<br/><br/>Beautifully mixing perfectly realised CG effects with epic locations. The camera always at some kind of ridiculous angle that makes everything look GINORMOUS. Huge towering sky scrapers, and vast landscapes setting the backdrop for the showdown. <br/><br/>It's a movie that knows exactly what it is, and who it's aimed at (that's right, horny teenage boys) and because of that, this movie DELIVERS. I'm now in my twenties, but when I was a young teenager, all i wanted to see was some awesome action, some crazy effects and some hot women. boom boom boom. this movie nails it.<br/><br/>Given most of the reviews from critics and again here on IMDb, people seem to have forgotten what fun it is to go and watch a real event movie. To see something that will blow you away. To have an experience. (3D came about for this reason) You want your ears bleeding, you want your eyeballs popping out, you wanna be guzzling your popcorn at all the visual thrills. <br/><br/>well i do at least. <br/><br/>i love movies. i love everything about movies. and i loved this movie. for all it's obvious flaws, it's not trying to be anything but what it is. and i love it for that. <br/><br/>sorry if i rambled on there. i know it's not the most eloquently written review. i think you get the idea of how i felt about this movie.<br/><br/>go see it with your brain tuned the right way and you'll have a blast."
"amaliafederer","8","12","17","8 December 2011"," Great Movie!
","I have always been a fan of the Transformers, the first film was amazing but The Revenge of the Fallen was a big disappointment so I was a little hesitant on watching Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I am so glad that I took the time to watch it since it was full of continuous action and destruction.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is about good vs. evil, and how good will always prevail at the end. The film revolves around the Decepticons trying to take over planet earth, and part of that plan means getting rid of all of the Autobots. It starts out with videos of the sixties Apollo landing mission and later the viewers learn that it was all a big cover up of an alien spaceship crash on the moon. The Decepticons are able to get started on their plan when they trick Optimus Prime to go to the moon and bring the missing puzzle pieces they needed back to earth. <br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is of course the main character and his new girl friend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is his side kick. I think the only down fall in the whole movie is Rosie and her character. She is clearly not meant to be an actress and I think that this film lacks a great female actress to match all the amazing male roles. I really don't see why a movie with such brilliant special effects would need ""eye candy"". The other male roles were played by Josh Duhamel as Lennox, John Turturro as Simmons, Tyrese Gibson as Epps, and Patrick Dempsey as Dylan just to name a few. <br/><br/>The Transformers in this movie are really amazing, their movement is so real and the angles they are shot from are visually spectacular. They did a great job shooting them from when they are cars to when they turn in to the transformers, and the angles make all the difference with such stunning sequences and the viewers are able to picture how huge these transformers are really meant to be. Bumblebee is my favorite transformer and he had a huge part in the first movie but I felt like he was missing a bit from this movie and it was disappointing not to see him as much. <br/><br/>When this movie first hit theaters in June of 2011 it did come in 3D. I was not able to watch it in 3D and I'm usually not a big fan of them either because films seem so dark once you put the glasses on. However, I felt this movie was very bright in lighting and because of that fact I think it would look great in 3D and hopefully I will have the chance to check it out sometime. <br/><br/>At the end all of the Autobots and humans have to work together to save the planet. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) puts a group together including Tyrese Gibson (Epps) to go to downtown Chicago and stop the Decepticons from succeeding. The final battle is a little drawn out and long but there isn't a dull moment in it, there are building falling over, glass shattering, explosions and all kinds of fun fire. Of course the Autobots win and Optimus finally kills Megatron.<br/><br/>In my opinion it is highly doubtful that this movie will be the last of Transformers and as long as they are able to put this much action into a movie they will continue to gain more new fans."
"loopmyworld","9","9","12","22 January 2012"," A good movie although it still remains dark in many ways !!!!
","After the success of revenge of the fallen in terms of money grossing over the globe, Michael bay n his team returns in Transformers 3 Dark of the moon. The movie is way much better from revenge in many ways. Been unlucky not to get the chance to watch it in 3d cause, the only 3d theatre projector got busted just before the release of the movie. Totally heartbroken as my other friends enjoyed the movie in 3d. well let first give you the overall negative & positive comments of the movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>Negative points <br/><br/>Where is Megan fox ? if I would have Michael bay, would have done anything to get her back in this third installment & made her role much better that European chick.<br/><br/>Was there a need of the Chinese guy in the movie director bay, I don't think so ! Megatron & Starscream were total waist in the movie, their role is not at not convincing as in previous installments.<br/><br/>Ratchet share the screen presence for not more than a minute in the entire movie.<br/><br/>The movie would have been better without Epps in my opinion. Bay just got him the movie to show the link between previous installments . Movie looses grip in the last 40 minutes due to excess of action & as their weren't much use of dialogues in the end.<br/><br/>What's the need of that European chick running around in the battle ? I could see the glimpse of war of the worlds & other alien invasion movies in this film.<br/><br/>I personally hate that scene so much the fight between Sam & Starscream, it does'nt make any sense & very unbelievable.<br/><br/>Positive points <br/><br/>The movie begins breathless, Autobots ark crashing on the moon & Apollo 11 sent to moon to investigate. Brilliant move Bay.<br/><br/>Good thing that Bay rid of Rc twins, which was pleasure to my eyes & ears .<br/><br/>Some new robots in Autobots, Que , Dino & Rackers. I became an instant fan of Dino, when he first transformers in the Middle East illegal nuclear site & his words. Way to go bay.<br/><br/>Bumble bee is been upgraded with its design & now he can even shoot without getting transformed. Way to go bay.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime as usual brilliant in the movie & carries the movie on his shoulders specially after getting betrayed by Sentinel Prime. He is being upgraded to with fly tech.<br/><br/>The introduction of new Decepticon Shockwavewooooooo my new fav in Decepticons & makes me his fan with its first arrival.<br/><br/>Laserbeak & Soundwave looks good on screen too.<br/><br/>Sentinel Primes looks perfect as a villain against Optimus prime & much more powerful too & has been given the perfect voice to his role.<br/><br/>Shia has improved with his acting skills in this movie, & proves that transformers is no where without him.<br/><br/>Agent Simmons at its best again in this movie, brings smile on my face with his introduction in this movie.<br/><br/>Mearing role is perfect for this movie, looks more powerful way strict. She share an important screen presence in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has got some of the best action sequences in the entire transformers series, my personal favourite, the highway battle my gosh what a chase I literally felt that I am actually inside the movie. 3 Decepticons chasing Sentinel & bumblebee, sideswipe & Dino in action. Ultimate action chase. Dino steals the show in this particular part. The best part of this chase is the background score, special thanks to my fav music composer Steve. The music touches my soul deeply every time I hear it & it suits the chase perfectly. I actually watch this particular everyday. The best action sequence in the entire transformers seriers. Masterpiece bay.<br/><br/>Ironhide the tuff autobots does it again in the Mexican stand off & so does the sideswipe.<br/><br/>Linkin park does it again giving another theme song for this movie, way soulful.<br/><br/>Steve as usual give the best background score once again.<br/><br/>This movie in my opinion could have been much better if bay & Ehren would have work more harder on the script cause I totally believe this movie could have been the best in the entire series but as usual its been ruined in many ways. If this movie would have been directed by Spielberg it could have been much better. If your planning to make a 4th one then bay please please take all your time work on the script & make a good transformers. No doubt about the effects in the movie but still you got to work on the script & screenplay. But still the movie is highly enjoyable in many ways & I loved it. As a huge transformers fan I rate it as 9 on the scale of 10 specially that highway chase which was breathless.The movie has got the best trailer ever i have ever seen. I am definitely going to buy the 3d bluray."
"EijnarAmadeus","4","166","318","30 June 2011"," It's Michael Bay: Explosions, CGI, sexy women, comic relief, explosions sunlight, romantic faith, explosions, CGI, explosions, CGI...
","Michael Bay's TRANSFORMERS franchise has become an enormous commercial success, and although the second installment received terrible reviews, it ain't gonna avoid people from rushing to see the third one. Now, it looks and feels exactly the other two films, in reality very little is changed upon so what we're given is a semi-mixed version of the first two, and that's sadly not a good thing. TRANSFORMERS 3 involves some spectacular CGI effects, and the more time director Bay shares with the robots not involved, the better the film is, which is kind of surprising given his experience. Megan Fox has been replaced by a high-heeled beauty which gives the teenage boys an alternate run for their money, and Shia LeBeouf in the leading part does a moderately good job, and as for the rest of the cast, it's not very much to say except that John Malkovich is funny in his scenes. The plot is as always very confusing and badly told, and the climax is long and noisy, which one can say is positive, though again - I felt tired at the end, being the film is very loud and way too long (a huge Michael Bay issue). It's way better than the second one, though not nearly as good as the first, so what we're stuck with is something in between."

","This movie is AWESOME. I actually don't know why so many people are criticizing the movie this bad, or why the movie is rated 6.5 only????? Every thing in the movie elements is fantastic (ie. Graphics, fights, story, acting and production)<br/><br/>In my opinion, the hero of this movie is ""Garrett Warren"" the fight choreographer (and if there are more). The fights are amazing and very very exciting. Those men have really shown their creativity in designing the fights' moves. especially for ""Bumble Bee"" and ""Optimus"" fights.<br/><br/>The Special Effects are very amazing and crazy. The graphic designs are perfect. The music of the movie is really great. <br/><br/>I still can't understand why people didn't like the movie !!!!!!!!"
"bmscubaguy133","8","16","24","12 July 2011"," The BEST MOVIE i've ever seen so far
","This movie is without a doubt the best transformers movie made for various reasons: one: the characters (humans and robots). two: the amazing storyline. three: the action sequences. The movie provides great character building. I started to know the characters and how they acted. Shia Labouf was awesome, but i also like how in this movie the autobots had a lot more character to them. When certain autobots die (I wont say whom) you are filled with emotion and you cared about that autobot.<br/><br/>Second: I liked the storyline in this, it was very solid. There are like one or two very tiny plot holes but who cares, it did not really effect the story.<br/><br/>Three: The action was the best i've ever seen in my life. That includes the best special effects ever made. The last hour you will be on the edge of your seat. You will walk out of the theater amazed and you just might be tempted to see it again. And for all those negative reviews, they are so wrong. This movie was awesome. To prove it: the first time I saw it, the audience cheered about 6 times! Yea go see this movie if you can."
"da_rc","10","16","24","30 June 2011"," Best blockbuster of the summer - best 3D effects ever
","Saw this movie yesterday and let's just start by saying that everything that Transformers 2 wasn't - Transformers 3 is. This movie is fast-paced and things happen constantly. This is what a summer blockbuster is all about - making the crowd entertained and at the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>The main improvement from the second movie though is the storyline. Not only is the main storyline very compelling but it is given plenty of time to get the viewer to understand the back story as well (in fact, the first 20-30 minutes are about the back story). The storyline is also very good as it keeps the viewer interested in the movie, unlike the second movie. Not only is this storyline very good and compelling but the one regarding Sam Witwicky is well done too. His character has a good story arc this time and it gives the movie another dimension other than ""robots fights robots in cool ways"". It should also be noted that the humor and comedic elements in this movie is very well done, opposed to the 2nd one. At one time, my friend told me that it was too much humor up till that point in the movie!<br/><br/>What also needs mentioning is the 3D. This is hands down the BEST 3D made in a movie - ever! I've seen every 3D movie that has been made and until now Avatar was in the lead, by a mile. But Michael Bay - with the help of James Cameron and Cameron's avatar team - has created a real 3D spectacle here! Gone are the problems with the dark glasses that make the picture darker - this time they've made the movie brighter from the start! There is a shot of the Hong Kong skyline in the night - and in 3D this looks absolutely gorgeous. You can literally see like 15 buildings all in front of one another. The one thing that's missing are objects that pop out from the screen.<br/><br/>Also, the cgi is extremely well done to accommodate the 3D. The cgi has always been great in the Transformers movie and now is no different. The transforming parts have been slowed down and one can actually see almost every single part that is transforming. Breathtaking in 3D sometimes.<br/><br/>It should also be said that the score is very good. EG, Linkin Park's Iridescent is used several times and one time in particular is really good (SPOILER ALERT: when you hear the singing and not just he music). <br/><br/>Finally, some of the scenes in this movie looks really awesome in 3D and is - even if u watch it in 2D - great. In particular there is a chase scene on a highway about halfway through the movie. This is the 2nd best chase scene I've scene, only upped by the one in Matrix 2. The reason is that the details can be clearly scene all the time and it never feels like you as the viewer is missing out on things thanks to the camera being too zoomed in. Bay has learned from the mistakes in the first movie and most of the fights are zoomed out so you can see everything!<br/><br/>There are a few gripes though: 1) There could have been a few more fight scenes in the movie. The ones we see could also have been a bit longer. For instance, the decepticon Skywave is made out to be a top top fighter for the Decepticons, yet he never fights by himself. A fight between him and Bumblebee would have been nice to see as the visuals would have been really good.<br/><br/>2) The main actress is as always in the Transformers movies criminally underused. I have seen people complaining about her acting skills. But come on - her main purpose in this movie is to look sexy and she does that easily. Would have been nice if she had a bigger role though.<br/><br/>3) Megatron was not used enough. In the first one he was a menace to be feared. In the second one he was suddenly not as good in fighting. In this one he is hardly seen.<br/><br/>All in all - go see this movie! It is a summer blockbuster and on that premise it delivers to 100%. It's by no means an Oscar winner (except for potentially special effects) but that's never what a summer blockbuster is - and should be - about. The movie's sole purpose is to entertain us and that is does flawlessly. Not only via the story lines but also via how well-shot it is and how great the 3D is"
"rohan-khanna058","8","21","33","29 June 2011"," awesome movie
","""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon"" is easily the best film in the series, and there's a solid hour-long action sequence in Chicago that uses everything Bay's ever done before, but all blended into one exhausting push to save one girl in the midst of a war involving two planets. It's the personal story on an apocalyptic scale that Bay loves to try to tell, and that other guys like Emmerich and Cameron and even Spielberg love to do. And this is the best version of it that Bay's made so far.<br/><br/>Let's start with this: for the first time since ""Avatar,"" I am going to recommend that you find the biggest and best 3D theater you can find and buy yourself a ticket, because ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon,"" especially seen in IMAX 3D, is an overwhelming sensory experience. The sound mix alone is more exciting than anything in the billion-dollar- bore of ""Pirates 4."" This is gigantic action we've never seen before, and Bay's reaction to shooting and cutting his film for 3D is to get better at what he does. It raised his game, and as a result, I feel like we just saw a dare thrown down by one of Hollywood's biggest action specialists: ""Top this."""
"phil_harrison","1","48","84","9 July 2011"," Worse than the holocaust
","Michael Bay should be tried along side Muammar Gaddafi for crimes against humanity, his latest film is a travesty of international proportions. Re-broadcasting of any of his films should be banned under the Geneva convention, in fact the only difference between a Michael Bay film and Hitler's reign is that Bay's films will have a more profoundly negative impact on society.<br/><br/>The film starts out just as any other Bay film with a pointless mix of thoughtless dialog and meaningless characters. Witwicky (LaBeouf) is out being the unimaginable world celebrity that he would be saving the world 2 times has no job and for some unbeknown reason is now in a relationship with a new love interest Carly (last name is not apparent anywhere in the film). The character of Megan Fox is completely dismissed from the entire film with a single sentence despite it being the supposed focal point of the entire storytelling behind the first 2 films. Her blatant departure from the franchise is not even attempted to be cleverly masked and immediately gives you a bad feeling of what's to come. The fact that Michael Bay is comfortable with creating deep plot holes, detached storytelling and single dimensional fill in characters over a petty feud with a mildly attractive wan-a-be actress speaks volumes about his creative and artistic merit, however than itself is not even close to the overwhelming tripe that is Transformers 3 in its own respect. <br/><br/>Soon it is revealed through a convoluted multi-generational web of increasingly ridiculous government cover-ups that there is an alien craft on the dark side of the moon. Somehow despite this craft being the single greatest discovery in human history it is revealed that single NASA accountant smudged cost figures to point where it was deemed ""infeasible"" to return to the lunar surface. Considering the potential benefits to the US government and much less the entire Human Race its unlikely that anyone; not even the accountants in charge of giving Michael Bay 300 million to make this film could have convinced the government to stay away for 50 plus years. <br/><br/>The next question of course is why. Why would an accountant want to keep humanity away from this extraterritorial discovery? Simple; and something Michael Bay is very well rehearsed in -- personal greed. Somehow or another the Decipticon's revealed themselves to this single person and convinced him that they would take over the entire world with or without his help this responsibility is then handed down to Dylan the son of the mystery architect of human destruction. <br/><br/>By this point the film's true plot is revealed and the fight is on yet again. The Decipticons and Optimus Prime's superior, sentinel prime have devised a plan to inhabit earth for themselves and use humans as slave to rebuilds their world. This seems somewhat pointless when they are the respective leaders of the two sides and a truce on their OWN planet would have made much more sense. However that doesn't even pale in contrast to the robot race and the absolutely comparatively pathetic strength of human engineering. This is akin to human's inhabiting an asteroid trillions of light years away over a war on earth and using ants as slaves to build their new homes.<br/><br/>After the Autobots fake their extradition to gain an element of surprise they waste in the first 20 seconds of their return a single five by point-five meter rod is controlling the transitioning of an entire alien solar system through an inter-dimensional gateway with absolutely no gravitational effects on earth. Its destruction is the sole focus of one and half hours of completely mind numbingly pointless action sequences and over the top special effects. <br/><br/>The film ends with the same sappy sequence of unity and love in the face of horrific mass destruction of an entire city as the last 2 films and is exceedingly uninviting due to the previous 2 hours being nothing more than creative excuses to waste hundreds of millions of dollars on seriously injuring lowly paid extras, poorly executing slow motion 3D hero sequences and lining Tyrese Gibson's pockets. <br/><br/>All in all Transformers 3 is the worst film in the Trilogy and possibly the worst film ever created in its budget bracket. Michael Bay has spent too long inside his 500 million dollar Gulfstream 6 private jet to properly flesh out a movie plot or characters and has instead opted to blow sh*t up for almost 3 hours. This is a movie that will appeal to the same part of your brain that is activated by car accidents and terrorist attacks, it will leave you shocked, appalled and your trust and faith in humanity will be at an all time low once the soul crushingly horrible and inappropriate end credit music start rolling."
"ceejay-cj","8","159","306","27 June 2011"," Third time's a charm for Bay and the Bots!
","There is a simple rule to knowing if its worth going to see this film..<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first film regardless of what you thought of the dubious second movie, then get your damn tickets! If you hated both movies then stay the hell away because there will be nothing new for you this time around.<br/><br/>Quite simply this is the most outstanding action flick you're likely to see this year let alone this summer and it's a successful return to what they managed to deliver with the first movie. Make no mistake about the toilet humour, sometimes screwball acting and silly jokes. That stuff is still very evident but unlike the second movie where it went spiralling out of control and dominated the picture, here it is kept firmly on a leach. In fact it is very much a film of two halves, the first half has an even mix of humour an action but it doesn't go too over the top to the point where we see robots doing embarrassing things like peeing or showing their balls etc, and there is a lot of human death unlike the other films. You see the innocent getting wiped out not just building collapsing and explosions. The second half is very much a tour de force of action scenes that are either nail biting or breath taking, not much letting up once it starts going and the finale is very satisfying! This is no movie with an agenda to deliver some life changing tale, it makes no attempt to equal the Bard with its narrative or plot. This is a movie based on popular toys for boys. Expect that much and you will be entertained because they actually set up this movie with a very clever conspiracy theory based on the NASA missions to the moon and weave that into the roots of the franchise. Shia Lebeouf is without his sidekick for the last two movies in Megan Fox but finds a more than worthy successor in supermodel Rosie Huntington Whiteley who plays a part that's very difficult to see Megan ever pulling off. Sure these girls are meant for mostly eye candy but where Megan's hot lipstick and deep pencilled eyebrowed, glam-pornstar look got more slutty with each picture, Rosie's supermodel grace and fine English accented charm brings more class than candy. Sorry Megan fans but no way would she pull of a semi-rich bitch who's been to finishing school and back! In fact her part is essential in the few well executed plot twists and deceptions this movie presents that were never as potent in its predecessors.<br/><br/>All this builds up to last hour of back to back action sequences of spectacle, stealth, barbaric violence and utter heroics that will please the masses and outrage the critics who can never assess these kind of movie based on what they aim to be rather than what they don't! Transformers Dark of the Moon delivers a picture worthy of ending any action series, this is what makes buying a movie box set on home video worth parting with the cash even when one of the films is totally duff. Bay's even managed to show the industry how to use 3D with easily the best 3D presentation since Avatar. Whoever takes over this franchise has a mighty jump to make because Michael Bay has placed the bar pretty damn high!"

","""Dark Of The Moon"" is the first Transformers movie that I actually liked a lot. The others are good fun and all, but they're never what ""they could have been"". And, to be honest, Michael Bay is a great visual director, but a TERRIBLE storyteller. It shows a lot in almost everything he touches (""Pearl Harbor"" being the best example of how the man, simply, can't tell a story).<br/><br/>Having said that, I feel that Bay directed this movie with the single intent to show us one of the greatest fire-work movies of all time. Screw the story, the characters and the substance and let's simply blow something up. The ""final fight"" last for about an hour and I just didn't want it to end. <br/><br/>Let's face it, nobody walks in a Transformers movie for the story, that's just stupid. If you want to see some of the greatest action scenes ever made, watch this film. If you're looking for a great story and a beautiful romance, go see Titanic or something else. This is a film for the eyes. And it delivers it in an amazing fashion."

","Dark of the moon is breathtaking. The Transformers look ultra impressive, and they sound mind blowing. The actors are on fire. Shai Labouf and the new Rosie Huntington-Whiteley go great together and their acting is infectious. To start remember to watch this on the biggest T.V. possible!<br/><br/>This is where the 3-part infection starts. On one hand Dark of the Moon is amazing. On the other it has serious flaws which is EXTREMELY SAD because this could have been the Star Wars of it's generation. What Star Wars had was flash + all the other great stuff. Dark of the Moon has flash, but it only has some of the other great stuff.<br/><br/>Infection I: Pretentious = why people dislike Michael Bay, you can really feel his arrogance in the movie. There are some unnecessarily stupid and glamouresk scenes that just seem fake.<br/><br/>Infection II: Confusing, but honestly it does a great job of not losing you. It's not as confusing as Pirates of The Caribbean 2 and 3.<br/><br/>Infection III: The Autobots and Megabots are indistinguishable. Not only do their personalities burn out, but there was one big scene that me and my wife couldn't tell who was good or bad because they all looked the same (colors). The only AutoBot (that's not a leader) that gets good development and some screen time is Bumble Bee, and I'm kinda sick of him.<br/><br/>Despite the flaws Dark of The Moon makes up for most of them (except the last one I mentioned) with some of the most amazing action scenes I've ever scene, also with a nice tune up of comedy throughout. I'll be watching this again, and on a bigger T.V."
"misel982001","10","119","227","11 June 2011"," Much Brighter than its title implies....
","In Transformers III, the battle of humans and Autobots vs the Decepticons moves into a new level; To begin with, visual effects are not just state of the art.They are innovative because they are really superbly designed and directed. There are hardly any faults and they look like real.Director Michael Bay helps us enter into the agony of the battlefield with his camera angles and movement. The film's atmosphere is now more dramatic. Many humorous elements of the 2 prequels are not anymore present. The dialogues are mostly desperate while the action is like a hurricane with a progressing climax that keeps the audience's interest and expectations on a constant knife edge. The battles can be described as epic. A minus (according to my opinion)is that the character of Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) is no longer in the script. Overall, a state of the art action film that will keep you in the seat from the first till the last minute."

","It is also the best job the series has done so far of turning the robots themselves into lead characters, something the first two films avoided for the most part. In the first film, Optimus Prime and Bumblebee had their moments, but they were still secondary to the human characters in every way, and the second film didn't really give anyone, human or animated, anything to play. This time out, I actually felt like the robots made a strong impression, and if there are more of these films after Bay leaves the series, then he's laid out a pretty strong template here for others to imitate moving forward. Finally, it feels like the war makes sense, and the stakes make sense, and it all matters. Sentinel Prime is a great addition to the series, and Nimoy plays him perfectly. It's a real performance, and as a result, it makes the rest of the Transformers feel more real. Cullen is very good in this one, and the rest of the robot cast manages to impress as well. Even the weird little robots, and there are two of them living with Sam (Shia LaBeouf) grew on me over the course of the film, especially when you see where they wind up. The Decepticons are way nastier in this one, and so when Optimus Prime and the Autobots unleash hell... AND THEY DO... it is so deserved and so worthy of one cheer after another that it almost becomes audience participation."

","In this epic conclusion to the Transformers trilogy, Earth's final stand against the Decepticons is about to begin. Starting off with a fast-paced war scene on Cybertron, then switching to the 1960's when man finally lands on the Moon, only to have a secret agenda of their own, hidden from the world; to investigate an alien ship that crash-landed. With mind-blowing CGI, good to descent acting, good story, and intense action sequences, Transformers: Dark of the Moon proves itself to be the best of the trilogy. The friendship with Sam and Bumblebee is really emotional as they are on the brink of destruction and even greater tensions arise as Sam is told by Mearing, the new head of the Autobots operation, he is no hero and will not be needed in their fight. Lennox and Epps return as Sam's friends and contacts in the military, only to become more distraught over the years as the fight between Decepticons and Autobots begins to take its toll on them. <br/><br/>Dark of the Moon really shows that after a disastrous sequel, a third installment can correct the mistakes that were made previously, except this did more than that; Dark of the Moon beats both of the first 2 movies put together, having the first film's in-depth story and characters, and the second film's incredibly intense action sequences. So, overall, Dark of the Moon deserves praise for its true effort to become something great.<br/><br/>9/10 Stars***"
"sotomichael84","9","25","41","29 June 2011"," A Great Summer Movie
","Here's my problem with the critic reviews, they expect too much. If you come to see the movie expecting to be completely moved by what you've seen, then you've got another thing coming. This is a great movie for what it is, a summer action thriller. The story was good not great, and obviously, the special effects were perfect. Compared to the second installment, this is a BIG improvement. The second was just trying to be too funny, and the action was great, but it was just chaotic. In Dark of the Moon, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg tuned down the comedy level and they put in a better structure for the action sequences. Now, there were still a lot of great laughs, and the special effects were at best they've ever been, if not better. my only problems were that I believe that the characters could have been better developed, but enough was done to get by, and the way it was put together was just a tad bit messy, but nothing too noticeable. DO NOT listen to what a bunch of hot-shot movie critics have to say, you really should never listen to these guys. Overall, this was an awesome, fun summer blockbuster. You will enjoy yourself, a lot."
"Dragonsouls","9","19","30","12 July 2011"," Believe it or not, this is an important film, and this is why
","(MINOR SPOILERS) I know I'm saying a lot by summarizing it this way, but I can't help but feel right in doing so. Before I review all aspects of the film, I'll talk about the story.<br/><br/>The story is being reviewed as convoluted, choppy and all over the place. And I can admit it can seem so for some audiences, but I think the film is directed for a target audience. I'd say Star Trek Trekkers! If you're a hard core Trekker, than this might be the best film ever created. It sounds bold, but I seriously feel that this is the case. I might sound corny for saying so, but I acknowledge that. And this is why I believe it is one of the most important films of all time.<br/><br/>In Transformers, and Transformers 2, we saw some simple good vs. evil battles, great action, and funny scenes. In Transformers 3 Dark of The Moon, we get a whole lot more. More in plot, and a much more subliminal tale that blends fiction with historical account. If you believe in The Secret Space Program, E.T. controlled governments, and UFO's, or plain and simple; aliens amongst us, than this film is the nutshell. I believe that Transformers 3 and it's plot is basically centered around conspiracy theories that have been running since the 50's. This is E.T. disclosure in fiction form, You will see simulated stock footage of John F. Kennedy discussing UFO's. Only to see real stock footage right after wards. You will see astronaut Neil Armstrong in a cameo appearance, only to see a scene of him taking an oath not to discuss his knowledge of aliens on the moon and on Earth. Why would Neil Armstrong agree to the role if he didn't agree with all of this?! It's absolutely perplexing to me.<br/><br/>The movie was darker than the previous 2. Less comedy, but thought Shia Lebouf was the best in this 3rd installment. He was very good, and as funny as ever. But yes, the movie lacks emotion as most critics say, but It doesn't matter, it's a plot driven film, not a character film. The CGI is the best I've ever seen, simple as that. It surpasses Avatar's CGI by far, I was absolutely mesmerized by the CGI in this film, and the previous 2 Transformers films do not compare to this one. Even the fight scenes were well choreographed, where as in the past 2 films, they seemed blurry and rushed.<br/><br/>This is Micheal Bay's best film. It's his masterpiece, without any doubt! I just wish the film was rated R, like I said in my review in the other Transformers film that you can find on here. I think a more serious tone would have made this less campy and just better.<br/><br/>In the end, there is an all to powerful message. All the evil in this world is due to a spiritually evil Extraterrestrial intelligence that intervened with our technological progression. And there is also a good kind of E.T.'s keeping us safe. Whether through their messengers, or not.<br/><br/>Star Trek fans, be advised, there are many homages here to Spock in this film, some of his most famous lines are used, and after all, he is voicing Sentinel Prime, so why not! 9/10 I'd give it a round 10 if it wasn't for the lack of emotion, and lack of care for the characters. But like I said, it's the plot that is good, not so much a character driven film."

","When I first watched this film I wasn't impressed with it, but after watching a few times more the film has really grown on me. Great action scenes as always and at least in this film you know what robots are who in the fight sequences.<br/><br/>Some of the battle scenes are mind blowing especially when viewed on blu ray. Much better story which makes this film stand along the first one very well.<br/><br/>Much better than the second film and improved with taking out the comedy aspect of which the second film had too much in. Give it a go, great popcorn movie."
"echodaxx12","8","10","14","10 October 2011"," Back to the Olden' Days, But Still Just Second Best
","Transformers Dark of the Moon gives you the same feel of awe that the first film did. The second film did not provide this because there was nothing really new compared to the first, except devastator. This film, however, has things that the first film did not include, specifically the public knowing of transformers, the driller, betrayal,optimus prime's trailer, and 3D effects, to name a few. However, this films plot, although a huge improvement from Revenge of the Fallen, is not quite as good as that from the original transformers. Also, the action, Which i loved, it was so exhilarating, might be to much for some viewers, like in Rotf.But, there's plenty of action to satisfy any transformers fan.<br/><br/>Many people hated the switch in Sam's girlfriend for ""some blonde"". First of all, the girl from the original transformers cartoon had a blonde who's name was Carly. And the change in girl has no effect on the feel of the film.<br/><br/>This is the second best transformers film, with even more exhilarating action, and more emotion(if you're a fan, you'll be upset when ironhide is killed by sentinel)than either film. don't watch this film if you don't like tons of robot action, a plot thats better than the second, not as good as the first, and tons of explosions."

","I was extremely lucky to go see an advance screening of the morning over in the USA last week. And after seeing the disaster of the second movie, i didn't really have high hopes for this movie. The trailer made the film look like it was going to be EXCELLENT!! And after spending nearly 2 and a half hours in the cinema viewing this movie, i came out thinking ""wow!!"" Michael bay promised he was going to improve on the second film and he did it sensationally. The 3D in this movie was incredible (up there with the 3D effects of avatar). The performances in this movie was incredible, the special effects were just out of this world, i don't know how Michael bay fits 20+ robots on the screen at the same time? it's just genius. I would recommend this movie to absolutely everyone, even if you're not fans of the series, this movie is still worth a watch. Amazing summer blockbuster. And Michael bay, thank you for giving the world such an amazing, and wonderful masterpiece of a film. 10000000/10"
"emo_boi1012","6","20","32","29 June 2011"," Clever script blended with spectacular special effects...
","I was highly disappointed with Revenge of The Fallen and I thought the script for Dark Of The Moon would be similar to the other films of the franchise. But surprisingly, it was fresh. Ehren Kruger cleverly used the Apollo 11 event to create a Decepticon world invasion storyline with few interesting twists...<br/><br/>Although I was amazed with the explosive action and brilliant special effects used in the film, the film itself lacks a lot of things...<br/><br/>It started very well with the whole history of THE ARK and it crashed throughout the second half of the film. The humour was still silly like Revenge Of The Fallen. For example, Ken Jeong was appalling and Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) tried to be funny and humorous but failed. Replacing Megan Fox with Rosie Huntington Whiteley wasn't much of a big difference. However, she was certainly better than Fox. There was pointless scenes around the last half of the film that made it a really long, boring film. Also, Michael Bay tried hard making the slow motion action scenes very 3D and realistic which was a bit irritating and ruins the film. The main antagonists haven't performed well enough to create an epic ending to the franchise In another point of view, however, this film was fairly enjoyable and the script was written very well. The soundtrack used was fresh and bends well with the film. There was some scenes that just blew me away and the CGI special effects definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. Shia Labeouf, John Turturro, John Malkovich and Alan Tudyk was enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, Michael Bay definitely improved this film compared to Revenge Of The Fallen by creating really amazing CGI effects and a really interesting script, but it wasn't enough to deliver a spectacular ending to the franchise..."
"jrwilson7","8","21","34","29 June 2011"," It could easily have been the first
","Transformers 3 will be the blockbuster of the season, like it was made to be. There is no denying the pull that battle-crazy robots trying to save earth has on the general populous. Both previous films have grossed an amazing amount of cash in ticket sales and merchandising, that the third outing is a sure-fire definite to make people hand over their hard-earned cash-especially now since the film is in glorious 3D!<br/><br/>It's no secret that summer blockbusters are the bread-and-butter of any production company. Most blockbusters are void of story lines and have plot holes you can drive a semi through. TF3 is no different, but there are times you are left wanting just a bit more; just a bit more development, a bit more sense and a bit more continuity.<br/><br/>Yet, again what the film lacks is a sense of substance, although I concede that it must be difficult to find ""substance"" in a story about children's toys that transform from robots to cars and trucks. The cartoon was simply a tool that Hasbro used to sell toys, specifically in Japan, yet the film version of that cartoon, released in 1986, did a really good job in finding substance in the mythos of Transformers. In that film, there were two human characters, a father and a son, which in its simplicity, was where the cartoons heart lay. They were a manifestation of Prime's heart of humanity, a thread that these films so desperately need and is so jarringly absent.<br/><br/>It's just not enough to save the world, we want to care about it.<br/><br/>TF3 is missing that substance. Where we want to see robots, the story focuses too much on Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebeouf) who is at the next crossroads of his life: getting a job. We had his teen ager angst in getting his first car, then the young adult angst of going to university, and now we have his adult angst of making his mark on the world, but, hasn't he already done that? He saved the world from near destruction, yet, he can't get a job?<br/><br/>The exposition which sets up the story rests on the shoulders of another government secret. Much to Primes dismay, there is a spacecraft just sitting there on the moon waiting for some transformer to find it. It seems that it is the Ark (a nice reference to the cartoon) which was sent at the height of the Cybertronian war with a device on board that would create a new Cybertron. How it works with the Cube, I'm not sure, but the ark crash landed on the moon which caused the space race of the 60's between Russia and the US. For any ""fan"" or movie buff, the enormous plot hole that exists here is not worthy of bothering about and many may simply gloss over it, but as a story, the three films don't fit together well, but when you think about it, very few series of films do. <br/><br/>But where this film lacks in story, it succeeds in attacking the audience with an astounding shock and awe campaign to numb your senses. As with the first two films, there are some insane action sequences that show off Bay's style, flair and ego. Gratefully, Bay has slowed down some of the action and sequences so that the audience gets to see more, however there are still times you really wish you could differentiate between the robots when they are clashing. Bay knows how to shoot war and fighting and cars – especially cars, and he pushed TF3 the the extreme. He really does lift the bar for action.<br/><br/>It is mind-boggling to see some of the scenes take place; especially in 3D. The scene of the skyscraper falling down in the trailer can only be seen on the big screen, it is simply that breathtaking and looks so good. The enormity of clashing robots and speeding cars that transform while driving to catch falling humans, simply leaves you aghast. There is even a freeway sequence that gives ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" a run for its money.<br/><br/>The robots look fantastic. If they could look more real than from what we have previously seen, this is the film that does it. They blend in with the earthly surrounds and interact with human characters in a far more believable way. <br/><br/>There are some darker moments too where the film takes on a ""Black Hawk Down"" feel and there is much more violence, which surprised me. Robots gush blood, have their spines ripped out and humans are vicerated by Decepticon weapons similar to that of the aliens from ""War of the Worlds"". There is much more robot time which will please the masses and you get the feeling that the film is trying really hard to cater to the fans this time although die hards will be very disappointed that certain Autobots don't have the names they are supposed to, but there is plenty to be happy about. The inclusion of Primes trailer is a welcome addition and when it transforms, OMG! Megatron is the real let down. Again, Bay and Kruger have no idea what to do with him nor do they understand is role in the Transformers world. This villain is underused which is disappointing. <br/><br/>The transfer to 3D is astounding; groundbreakingly so. 60% of the film was filmed in 3D and unlike films that have the transfer added for the sake of it, this movie is meant to be enjoyed as a 3D experience. It has raised the bar since Avatar. <br/><br/>There is a lot of potential left in the Tranformer world. It's doubtful this will be the end and it would not be surprising if the fans really get their own way and we see the introduction of the famed Unicron.<br/><br/>\"
"jonathan270","7","24","40","30 June 2011"," Cracking Action Sci Fi - Don't believe the hate!
","I'm a big fan of the original blah blah....... Make no mistake - as per the first two Bay-Em-ups, this is not G1 Cartoon - and why should it be? I loved the originals, the comics, the books, the toys – I'm 31 and lived through it all in the 80's. I don't consider myself a fan-boy, but I would have liked things to have been a little closer to the cartoon/toys. Michael Bay has access to cutting edge 3D and CGI tech, and all of the latest military hardware on tap to make this a massive summer blockbuster - and for me, it did not disappoint. Importantly the errors from the second film have been eradicated, Yes - a few clichés may be in there, and a couple of superfluous characters, and it may not be intellectually challenging (Just in case you were wondering – some reviewers have scored it on this basis) - but who cares? It's not an Intellectual subject matter...... Alien Robots have a war on earth....... enough said. Do I want to see Optimus with his trailer?......yes. Do I want to see massive robots smackdowns?...........yes. The fit new bird in tight her panties and tight fitting dresses?.....er - hell yes! Lots of awesome supercars?... of course, and what about a bunch of army dudes with flying squirrel suits being chased by a Decepticon and then smashing the sh@t out of it when the all crash land???......your damn right I do!! And that my friends, is exactly what this film delivered - lots of cool 'laugh out loud - it's that amazing, action stuff!' There is bit of light relief from silly (but still amusing) small robots and Sam's parents again, but nowhere near as much as previous - and thank god - no Jive Talking Autobots!. Turturro is funny as hell – and so are John Malkovich's teeth! I didn't want to see this film, as I was disappointed by the second film. But this is awesome!! Best of the three by a country mile! In fact, I honestly can't think of a better big budget sci-fi actioner. The 3D is amazing too! Seriously guys – Don't believe the negatives!"

The best movie you will see this year! no doubt about that. Oh, and watch in 3D. The 3D is amazing!<br/><br/>It had been a while since I watched a movie where everyone in the theater cheered and clapped after a scene.

Or if Laserbeak kills this man's from 1961 to our times why he don't help Megatron in 1 part or in 2 part? and there are few more questions but i think that this all can be explain.<br/><br/>100/100 Characters in this movie Are very very good.<br/><br/>This movie can be 100/100 but it have one doubt: Stupid scene With John Malkovich plays with Bumblebee my god Bay what was that?<br/><br/>Overall: 95/100 Great!"
"kdnor2011","8","11","16","5 September 2011"," It has flaws, but I still really liked it
","I don't know why the world seems to hate me. Before I saw this movie, I saw tons of reviews saying that this film was a fun, action packed movie, with great visuals, and a plot that actually wasn't that bad. I see the movie, actually really like it, then when I get home, I get on my computer, and all I can find are reviewers bashing the film. I mean seriously, spill.com gave this a low rental, two some ol' bulls**t, and a f**k you. Richard roper recently said it was the worst movie he had seen all year, despite the fact that he had given the film a D and given at least two other movies a D- and at least one film and F.<br/><br/>I won't say the film is perfect, even though I couldn't find any, I'm sure there were at least a few plot holes. Some of the humor didn't work, and it is at least 30 minutes too long.<br/><br/>I basically went into this movie expecting great action and effects, and I got that, but there actually were other things I liked in this movie. For example I did laugh quite a bit, some of the humor actually did work for me. And yes, I actually liked the characters. I can't say I really loved any of them, most of them are just forgettable, but Sam Witwicky I did find to be enjoyable. It's weird, I should hate him, but Shia LaBeaof takes a character I should hate and makes him likable, where were you on that one Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>And the plot actually isn't that bad, the last half of the movie is pretty much not stop action. And like I said, I didn't see any plot holes.<br/><br/>There are some people who absolutely hate this movie, and to me, they either focus on one negative aspect and exploit it, like Richard Roeper. Or they can't stop living in the 80s, like Spill.com or Brad Jones. I don't really care what Spoony says because I was never really a fan of his. If you do have a strong hatred for this movie, please explain why, what makes this really worse than Season of the Witch, or Battle: LA? Overall, it is a very stupid movie, but it's a fun, very stupid movie.<br/><br/>Whether you like them or not, I guess there are two things you can't deny about the the live action Transformers movies, one, they have incredible special effects, and two, they are very stupid."
"ninjiangstar","8","11","16","4 September 2011"," It has its problems...
","I think the dialogue was written really poorly, and bay spent too much time making things look realistic and too little time creating the film itself; as if the whole movie was shot in a week and the rest of the time was spent making special effects...<br/><br/>One thing I laugh at a bit is how physics don't apply in movies. The biggest and most noticeable problem is that gravity will pull the two planets together. The more mass, the more gravity, therefore two crazily large in mass items will obviously stick together rather than float alongside each other.<br/><br/>Also, bridges are not connected with the internet. You can't simply hack a bridge. That was one thing I had a major face palm in the theater.<br/><br/>Overall it was interesting to watch, if you ignore all of its problems."

"Sevenmercury7","8","31","54","29 June 2011"," The Thrill-Ride of Summer 2011
","*A review of the IMAX 3D version Say what you will about the ""soulless"" brand of movie mayhem served up by the likes of Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer and Roland Emmerich; roll your eyes at the crassness of it all; but have no doubt: audiences love this stuff. They're not being hoodwinked or manipulated into seeing anything they don't want to see. They, we, I know exactly what I'm paying my tenner for.<br/><br/>On the way out of a screening of Emmerich's 2012, someone described the experience as ""like an apocalyptic roller-coaster."" And that's a pretty fair summary, if you ask me. These are sensorial thrill-rides, state-of-the-art theme park attractions as much as they are movies. Audiences want to be blown out of their seats by the audiovisual experience. As long as the plot is coherent, the characters are likable enough for us to care whether they survive or not, there's an occasional laugh throw in to preserve that roller-coaster giddiness, well, there's your formula for this sort of thing. I can imagine select 3D scenes from this third Transformers film playing to sell-out crowds in any Universal Studios or techno theme park.<br/><br/>Dark of the Moon has stupendous scenes of destruction, perhaps even surpassing the aforementioned 2012. Director Bay's robot battles are epic. The hour-long showdown in a battered Chicago is worth the admission price alone. Vehicular carnage, military firepower, transformer face-offs galore--this sequence has it all, including skyscrapers being crushed and toppled by giant robot snakes. The 3D, too, is stunning, with a daredevil freefall by Josh Duhamel and his special ops rangers into a maelstrom of robo-carnage being the standout. It's eye-popping stuff, and just when you think Bay has peaked, he ups the ante tenfold until your brain can barely process what he and his filmmaking wizards have wrought with their limitless FX budget.<br/><br/>The series' throwaway humour is as hit-and-miss as ever, with John Turturro's oddball Agent Simmons and his even weirder German sidekick (Alan Tudyk) generating the most laughs. Ken Jeong is atrocious in his brief (but not brief enough) role as a paranoid office worker--probably the most grating comedy performance since Chris Tucker's screechy turn in The Fifth Element. Other series newcomers include John Malkovich and Frances McDormand; the former is given nothing to do, while the latter is good fun in her role as the brassy National Security Chief.<br/><br/>Duhamel and Tyrese are solid as ever in their stock gung-ho roles. Shia Laboeuf goes hysterical once too often but at least his character, Sam Witwicky, wants to join the action this time around. Brit model Rosie Huntington-Whitely is sweet as his new girlfriend, Carly, and makes a decent replacement for the Fox (whom I did miss, I have to say). In the transformers' cast, Leonard Nimoy makes a great voice contribution as the powerful and crucial Sentinel Prime.<br/><br/>I'm going to recommend Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3D to anyone who enjoyed the first movie, those who love action on a grand scale, or anyone who wants to see the potential of 3D technology. The SF prologue, including a nice alternate history reveal during the Apollo 11 EVA, showcases some breathtaking 3D framing and depth design. And the extended finale in Chicago is the must-see action event of the summer.<br/><br/>It's pretty much indefensible as anything but a thrill-ride, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one, as did the (astonishingly multi-cultural) audience at my IMAX 3D screening. It runs a bit long at two and a half hours, but once the Chicago sequence starts, you'll be gripped to the end."

"jim_pot_2000","9","38","68","28 June 2011"," Spoiler-ish review from a fanboy.
","I know that people most likely won't read this, but i want to get my thoughts down while still in my head. I just saw the 9:30 3-D showing of TF3, and here is my review. It is slightly spoiler-ish.<br/><br/>The Plot:<br/><br/>Most people despised the plot of ROTF. I sorta liked it, but I could tell why others hated it. I just sorta overlooked it. DOTM's plot is more thought out and contains many sub- plots. This makes the plot more like TF1 than the plot of ROTF. I loved the plot twists, even though one or two were predictable. The most shocking is Sentinel. Did NOT see that coming. I loved the explanations of how things worked and the character development. The plot gets an overall 9/10<br/><br/>Acting:<br/><br/>The acting overall was average for a TF movie. Rosie was surprisingly OK for a first-timer and a huge step up from Megan Fox's ""Meh."" acting. Shia was good as usual, Tyrese and Josh were OK. Dempsey wasn't as good as he usually is, but it was alright. The one amazing aspect of the movie was the voice acting. Cullen is superb as always. All the other robots were great, especially Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel prime. He nailed it. The voice sounded like an aging warrior. If they make a fourth, they should bring back Nimoy for a different character. Because of the voice acting, i give the acting overall a 7.5/10<br/><br/>The Comedy:<br/><br/>The parents are back and they actually earned a few roars of laughter from the crowd. So did Wheelie and his new sidekick brains. Sure, some of the one-liners fell flat on the floor, but Ya dunno if ya don't try. The movie was hilarious, but not always when it's supposed to, i give the comedy a 8/10.<br/><br/>The CGI.<br/><br/>I admit it. Even though I overlooked many ROTF flaws, the ONE THING i couldn't overlook was how many instances, the robots looked fake. Barely, and for short periods of time, but it did look fake. This problem is eliminated from this film. The robots looked real, just like the first movie. The 3-D just expanded the realisticness of the robots. Best Live action 3-D movie effect I've ever seen. The robots had perfect Human-like movement, and the lipsyncing was spot on. I give the animation a 10/10<br/><br/>Other Things<br/><br/>First of all, I like Shockwave. He is very intimidating. I sorta with he had more lines, even though his silence mad him more intimidating. I (being the nerd I am) noticed many Star Trek references. Most likely because of Leonard Nimoy participating in the film. First of all, Wheelie came into Sam's Apartment turning on Star Trek. He says ""I've seen this one, this is the one where Spock goes Crazy"" Also, Sentinel States Nimoy's Famous Spock quote ""The needs of the many oughtweigh the needs of the few."" (I geeked out at this moment) The action was amazing and Prime was at his most Bad A** in this film. The action scenes are epic and flow together amazingly. I also love Starscream banging his head on the ground to get something out. Overall, this other stuff gets a 9/10.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts<br/><br/>If you've read this far, I thank you for giving a crap about this review and appriciating the Hour I put into this Review. Dark of the moon is an action packed, thought out and visually stunning work of art. With average acting and AMAZING Voice acting, great CG, Amazing 3-D. If you haven't seen it, See it NOW. Overall, i give TF3 8.7 out of Five."

","All seeker does in this is start fires or spend the night not enjoying his plane ride over the ocean. But these are soothing activities. When starting a fire or cruising the sky, Seeker sometimes holds both his arms in the air (45 degree angle), closes his eye, and says: ""thanks for my body, this is beautifual, all my surroundings, everything that ive seen/experienced is what i always longed for."" Of course, seeker always says stuff like that, its like a habit or ritual."
"Screen_Blitz","6","3","3","18 June 2017"," Dark of The Moon sustains with overlong explosion-laden redundancy, but not without some improvement over its predecessor
","Behold the third entry of the Transformers saga. After the mediocre sequel that was 'Revenge of The Fallen' in 2009, Michael Bay has made his return to the director's wheel with a second sequel that manages to breath a just a little more life back in the franchise. It is loud and it is a very special effects heavy with lots of explosions, lots of destruction, lots of innuendo, and lots of screaming -- all of which is packed into a bloated 154-minute runtime. In addition, it slightly improves upon one major aspect that plagued the previous film, and that is boasting a more coherent plot with slightly more ambition. On the other hand, this does not eliminate the problems in Ehren Krueger's script which sporadically hinder the loud and overlong experience. Another change in this entry lies in the casting of Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who steps into the damsel-in- distress role, replacing Megan Fox was fired prior to production. This film tells the story of Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) who leads the Autobots in a race against the Decepticons lead by Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) to retrieve a mysterious Cybertronian artifact discovered by NASA back in the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf) has graduated college and has just landed his first white-collar job to support him and his new girlfriend Carly (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). When he and Carly are unexpectedly dragged into a heated war between autobots and the decepticons, they must enlist the help of the National Intelligence Agency, head by Mearing (played by Frances McDormand), to aid them in yet another battle on Earth. <br/><br/>Michael Bay normally falls short of ambition when it comes to storytelling. The premise, which unlike the previous two installments, boast a surprising amount of substance dealing with the Space Race during the JFK administration. The story to is able competently connect landmark political history with the Transformers universe. But when it comes to sustaining the plot, that is where things falter. In return, he tries to make up for this an enormous slew of eye-dazzling action sequences complete with extravagant special effects and enough explosions to put dozens of firework shows at once to shame. Then it comes to the big question: are these massive special effects do enough to distract from the thinly developed plot? For a while, they do, especially for those with longer attention spans to parades of visual effects than the narrative. Bay indulges in his signature blow-em-up style with countless shots of the giant metal monsters punching, shooting, and slashing each other to pieces, a gimmick that gets taken to a bulky advantage in the final act during the climatic battle in downtown Chicago. The destruction of the skyscrapers is spectacular and fun to sit through, but goes on for so long to the point where it gets a little numbing. On the surface side, the performances are about as good as actors can get in the franchise. Shia Labeouf is fine in the role, and working along his side is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the model-turned-actress who turns into a rather one-note performance. Her role is rendered to feel identical to the fashion in which Megan Fox's character is written in the previous films, and that is serving as a sex symbol for teen boy, especially as she is introduced in the first ten minutes in a shot showing her lingerie- clad bottom. Arguably the most surprising new face in the cast is Frances McDormand who, like the actress she is, turns in a competent performance. Needless to say, it is nothing that shouts for wide recognition as is the rest of cast here including Ken Jeong who has a minor (and gravely obnoxious) role during the first half.<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an overlong, but somewhat competent special-effects action thrill ride that is likely to please those hungry for some explosive visual heft signature to Michael Bay's trademark directorial style, but disappoint those seeking for something more ambition. As far as many of Bay's films go, this one sustains a level of entertainment that is not too low, but too high either. Don't go in expecting something ambitious."
"Rikki_Sixx","6","3","3","30 April 2017"," Entertaining at times but full of clichés
","Nowhere near as utterly garbage as the first films in this but whenever the military guys show up there's an overwhelming amount of terrible, forced jargon and clichés. Genuinely entertaining at times with all the visuals and slow-mo you'd expect from Michael Bay, but it is difficult to get past the terrible dialogue at times."
"clarkn-nc2","8","3","3","1 July 2014"," Honestly not as Bad as People Make it Out to be
","***ONE VERY MINOR SPOILER THAT DOESN'T GIVE AWAY ANY PLOT POINTS***<br/><br/>After seeing this when I was 11 or 12, I, as pretty much anyone of that age would be, was mesmerised by this film. Of course, that was simply because such a film is like a staple diet for kids that age. If that makes any sense at all.<br/><br/>Anyway, 4 years later, and I'm still loving this film. And it's not because it's feeding my inner 12-year-old (well, not completely)— it's because I genuinely think that this is a good film.<br/><br/>I understand where the hate is coming from: enraged viewers still haven't gotten over the somewhat shabby Revenge of the Fallen, and are continuing their hate over this sequel, too. People complain that it's too long, bloated, the acting is bad and the comedy is ridiculous. These complaints are what's ridiculous. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is exciting, the CGI is incredible, the acting isn't too bad, and the comedy is toned down, but very much needed. Let's elaborate...<br/><br/>The CGI. Pretty much the only aspect of this film (or, indeed, the entire franchise) that is not hated upon. It is simply incredible- you don't stop and think- ""was that real?"", or squint to see if there's some sort of not-so-real detail— pretty much nothing is flawed about it, except of course, the infamous scene where Sam is carrying an invisible robot in a brief shot.<br/><br/>The acting— not bad at all, I don't understand why people hate on it so much. People seem to hate Rosie Huntington-Whitely's acting, but it is not bad at all. Fair enough, it's not Anthony Hopkins, but at least it's not Alan Bagh (Birdemic). None of the other actors are bad at their job either: each one gives a very realistic performance. Yes, Shia screams a lot, but wouldn't you if you were flying through the air over a truck that just fell over while there are robots shooting at each other? <br/><br/>Now, the comedy, which made Revenge of the Fallen one of the most hated films ever. In DOTM, the comedy is toned down to Wheelie and his companion (who's name fails me at the moment). Their comic relief is much needed, as Dark of the Moon is as the title suggests- dark. There is a lot of killing, and some of it is graphic, but brief. The climactic threat is quite intense, and in the midst of it, these two provide a little relief. I will admit that there is a lot more humour in the first 3rd of the film, with the humans, but it does tone down once the action picks up.<br/><br/>And that's another thing that people are complaining about. ""Too much"" human involvement. Can I get one thing straight? Each of the Transformers movies are set on EARTH. Earth. That's where HUMANS live. How can you have a credible storyline if robots are fighting each other and there's no human involvement? And if there are humans, you have to develop them and make them interesting. The only reason why Carly (Huntington-Whitely)'s character was underdeveloped was because she was replacing Megan Fox who was abruptly fired. And she doesn't even need a back story- all we need to know is that she and Sam are together, and she's simply replaced Fox's Mikela (spelling?). And then you get all these other complainers saying there's too much action. Goodness me, it's a freakin' film about robots. No one complained about Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>Now, the storyline. There's only one major plot hole, which no one is going to care about unless they're a troll. Each of the scenes match up, there's no major clashes in the story, and it's actually pretty good. I'm sure there's some things people will nitpick at (yes, I have seen CinemaSins), but nothing too major. <br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I'll sum it up here. All in all, this is a great film, despite the unnecessary hatred for it. The CGI is incredible, the storyline is pretty much solid, the acting is believable, and there isn't the ridiculous comedy that was found in ROTF. A much darker, thrilling film that's based on a toy lineup. Doesn't require intricate thought, but is still very good, nonetheless.<br/><br/>On a final note, may I remind everyone that this film is intended for guys. GUYS. What does a guy film need? Explosions, action and hot female leads. This film has all that. This is a fun, dark action film that is definitely geared towards the male audience. Suck it up, quit hating and enjoy this epic masterpiece. Plus, it's doesn't feel 'cheap' like some action films (I'm looking at you, Die Hard 5...). It feels... Epic. Literally.<br/><br/>One final, final note to wrap this up— the score for this film is absolutely incredible. Very well done and really epic. Major, major props to Steve Jablonsky. He really captured the scale of this movie. (Yeah, scale. Giant robots, epic score— large runtime. It's about the scale).<br/><br/>That's about it. 8/10."

","So the final film in the Michael Bay Transformers trilogy now is up for review. In my opinion the first film set some solid ground work for what Michael Bay wanted to do. Sadly in the second movie it all fell apart. Some like to blame the writers strike that was going on during that time, I think that is a cop out, and a bad one at that. Thankfully Dark of the Moon brings the franchise back to the roots of the original film. Light humor, average acting, but fantastic action scenes. This is my review of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.<br/><br/>This is the third Transformers film directed by Michael Bay, and while I did trash his effort in part two of this series, I must admit they really rebounded amazingly. He took the heavy criticisms of the second film, mainly being that the humor was over the top and the film was light on action, and made this film better because of those criticisms. The action is heavy in this film, even more so than the first film. Sure there are slow spots here and there while they build up the story, but overall this is a nicely paced film. I love a great final battle scene, and while the summer blockbusters have been mainly stale in that area, Dark of the Moon fully delivers in that aspect as the final battle ranges from a good thirty to forty minutes I would say. That is very impressive.<br/><br/>Ehren Kruger returns from the ashes of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and is in fact the only writer who returned from that awful film. Also, Kruger is the only writer on this film. Much like the first film in the franchise, if you are expecting an Oscar winning script, you simply will not find it here. Kruger's script holds up nicely, and he really redeems himself after the mess of the prior film. The over the top humor is replaced with much more timely humor that works very well for the most part. The pacing of the action scenes are far better as well. With only a few slow downs in the story, Kruger is really able to hold our attention very nicely over the course of this two and a half hour film. While it is hard to say if this film was overall better written than the first film in this series, Kruger's effort is still top notch for this amazing summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Overall this film was a fantastic way to end the first trilogy for the Transformers series. Personally I must say this film is slightly above the first film, but even still, it is just barely. So fans of these Transformers live action films, this franchise as a whole is pretty good for what it has set out to be. Sure there are some like even myself who would want a Cybertron War movie, but in due time I suppose.<br/><br/>7.4/10 <br/><br/>While this is the end of the Sam Witwicky story, the Transformers will return in Transformers: Age of Extinction."
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","6","3","3","28 November 2013"," A bit of an improvement over ROTF, but not nearly as good as the first
","In order to coincide with a fourth Transformers coming out in the next few months, I'll be reviewing this third entry of the successful film series. I liked the first Transformers despite it's cheesy dialog in some parts and while there were some awkward moments and very bad dialog, I still liked Revenge of the Fallen. Then, when I saw the whole thing in theaters back at 2011, I thought, this wasn't so bad after all. It later turned out to be a good ride, but while I do think it's a bit of an improvement over the previous film, it's nowhere near as good as the first.<br/><br/>First, there are some good things that saved the film for me. The music score from Steve Jablonsky has improved and has an epic tone to it. The story is a lot more decent than the previous film with a much better second and third halves; the action sequences are solid especially the collapsing building scene which took my very breath away. The scenery is great and the special effects are as top-notch as ever. The acting is good, too. While John Turturo, Franches McDormand, and John Malkovich aren't given much to do, they did fine with the material. Patrick Dempsey did OK as the villain, but he's a bit underwhelming. Rosie Hunter Whiteley is a bit bland, but not exactly terrible as the new girlfriend for Sam Witwicky. While Shia LeBeouf isn't as charismatic as he was in the first film, he does have the same charm he brought to the film series so far. The Autobots and Decepticons are great to see again and the voice actors are solid especially Leonard Nimoy as Sentinal Prime, who is a very good villain for the movie much Megatron.<br/><br/>Then, there are the bad things that I would point out. First, the script. While the second and third halves are a lot better, the first half is pretty boring. It seems to be lacking in it's action and it wasn't exciting. Second, the ending is way too similar to the first Transformers (what? with the auto-bots and decepticons fight against each other while bringing destruction to the city and such?) The pacing is also very sluggish it would almost put you to sleep. Third and mostly the final problem is the dialog. There are some humorous bits that might get the audience a chuckle, but there are other parts that are just so inane it would give you a headache.<br/><br/>Overall, Transformers: DOTM isn't nearly as good as the first, but despite the flaws that I just stated, I think this is a great sequel in an overall solid franchise. I may not be a fan of Michael Bay and such, but while I do not like the Bad Boys films, Pearl Harbor, and others, I think that this and the other films are a lot better and it deserves a recommendation to those who haven't seen it."
"carlosdelbrey","8","19","31","28 June 2011"," Excellent Movie.. Simply Entertaining.
","I was on my toes the entire movie, It was very fast and stocked full of action. I did like the story to it.. Poor Ironhide, now he died in both series. Leonard Neomoy with the trademark Spock quote ""The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few"" Come on now.. ya gotta love it. Bay knows what the public likes, he can keep the attention span of new young followers and still keep it entertaining for older. Also this has to be watched in 3D. Avatar had the 3D label but honestly really didn't use it. To me just a camcorder block. Bay used 3D how it should be. <br/><br/>Now most critics who love ""The Pianist"" Will say something on the lines, ""This movie is without character, blah blah blah"" Bays premise, Entertain all. If you showed ""The Pianist"" or ""The Godfather"" to an 8 year old he would hate it. I love both movies by the way. You show transformers to the average to young and old we simply love it. The question at the end should be, ""Were you entertained"" I'm just waiting for all the trolls to take their opportunity the break this movie apart. It's the difference between a good Rock Song and Mozart. As much as I would like to kick back and play classical I love driving my car w/ some good Metallica and The Eagles.."
"stuyv29","9","20","33","29 June 2011"," Great, stop hating
","most people on here never had transformer toys as a kid, therefore they cannot understand how great it is to watch a cartoon come to life. 1. People need to stop hating on Michael Bay, what he doing is working , look at the ticket sales. 2. If after the first movie you still looking for character development, go else where. Go watch HP or LOTR, like they really had it anyway. 3. Transformers falls in a genre that is not for everyone, it is action, scifi and mecha, plus it was a CARTOON Finally, go watch it in IMAX 3D , the whole movie is 3D. If there was one problem i did not get enough of the transformers, which is what the movie is about, even though it had lots . next time do like 1hr 45 mins to include the TRANSFORMERS, and the remaining 45mins of humans All in all great movie"
"thedudeabides-2","7","5","6","31 July 2014"," More of the same from Micheal Bay
","The Transformers franchise has got to be one of the most infuriating in all of Hollywood. On the one hand, you have some of the most exciting and innovative action set pieces, not to mention some seriously impressive CGI which really sells the idea of robots disguised as various transport vehicles. On the other hand, you have some of the most excruciating dialogue this side of Twilight, corny humour which would make your dad cringe, and a guarantee of a bum numbing running time of at least 2 and a half hours.<br/><br/>And so it makes sense that Transformers: Dark Of The Moon follows the exact same template as the previous 2 movies. The action is fun, the CGI is the best it has ever been and the script is completely nonsensical. The story, for what it is, revolves around the 1969 moon landing. In Bay's universe, Neil Armstrong and Co. landed on the moon, but rather than being a simple exploration mission, they were actually researching a possible alien sighting. This of course turns out to be an old Transformer – one which the Decepticons (the bad guys) have been searching for and it's up to the Autobots (the good guys) to stop them. That's about it really, but Micheal Bay manages to pad out the story with a wholly unnecessary subplot involving Sam Witwicky and his low self esteem. It's as exciting as it sounds and only serves to distract from the admittedly impressive action.<br/><br/>This is the main problem with this, and the other Transformer movies; it's just too long. There are a number of misguided attempts at humour and Sam's love interest has all the charisma of a cardboard box. And yet, by the time the epic 45 minute finale kicks in, you will forget about all the wasted time and revel in the destruction that he so masterfully weaves as the Decepticons launch a full on invasion of Chicago. It's easily the best extended sequence of the entire franchise and would have benefited even more if we didn't have to wade trough so much unnecessary exposition.<br/><br/>A disappointing entry, in that Micheal Bay doesn't appear to have learnt from his previous mistakes. The good news is, he has also not lost his flair for explosive action and, in these moments, Transformers: Dark Of The Moon is every bit as entertaining as its prequels."

"martyshoemark","10","8","11","5 April 2012"," An improvement over the 1st and 2nd films, with dazzling special effects and emotional atmosphere
","Dark of the Moon began very strongly in rewriting history of the 1969 Apollo 11 spacecraft landing on the Moon and adding more to Cybertron's history. The special effects and soundtrack are very impressive. There were extremely amazing scenes including where Sam and Carly are falling down a building before the Driller attacks them. However, one weakness of the film is that, similar to Revenge of the Fallen, the Autobots do not have enough characterization. Dino, Ratchet, and the Wreckers were the least seen. Optimus actually was brutal and violent, he just killed off Megatron when he was offering a truce, didn't Optimus say in the 2007 movie, ""You left me no choice brother...""??, well he DID have a choice, a good one, and he said no! This film concentrated on getting the audience extremely angry at the villains except for Megatron and Starscream. That's a great way to develop a villain's presence in the movie, though not always the only way. Sentinel is hated very much for killing Ironhide, Dylan is more like a princess story villain rather than a science fiction villain as he kidnapped a girl wanting to marry her and the hero has to stop him. This has actually helped boost the characterization of humans in the film, as in Revenge of the Fallen the human cast was very uninteresting.<br/><br/>This film is seriously underrated and more people need to give this movie a chance. The script is not horrible at all, it was written in acceptable manner to be suitable with the special effects."

The last hour of the film is non-stop action of Optimus and his buddies kicking decepticon punk ass. The story is not as confusing as other reviewers say mainly because they are daft and can not watch films properly, this story is easy to understand the decepticons have hidden pillars around the earth and a decepticon army is buried on the moon awaiting the orders of Megatron or a certain traitor Sentinel Prime (He kills Ironhide you know).<br/><br/>Oh yes everyone, this film is pretty darn good and i recommend it to all fans of the first two films.

I just wish it would never end. I need more Transformers. <br/><br/>On the other side of thing though, I don't think this counts as a spoiler or anything but a few autobots weren't even in this movie, maybe they were killed between movies, I don't know. Mudflap and Skids were the comical ones and now R.C had to fill that roll. And Jolt is missing, the character that put the wings and guns on Optimus in Revenge of the Fallen. How could he not be in it? But new characters make up for it all. And don't think it's all action, there is a lot of important conversations and what not, not just robots running around."

Only a select few of the government and military knew of the extraordinary secrets the Apollo 11 astronauts brought back from the moon. The astronauts discovered the wreckage and remains of Sentinel Prime and shuttle him back to earth. That wasn't the only secret on the dark side of the moon.

","I know, I know, I am writing this to a lot of more male fans than female but, I had to express my opinion on Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I loved the movie. Lot's of action, emotions and humor. No one does a one liner like Sam (Shia LaBeouf)and Yes, I love Sam's parents. You never know what will come out of their mouths. That is what I have come to love about all the Transformers movies. Yes, I loved T2 and still don't get why fans disliked it. But, something was missing in Transformers: Dark of the Moon and that was Megan Fox as Mikaela. Now I'm am in no way saying Megan Fox is the greatest actress or anything. But, Mikaela As a character in the first 2 Transformers we knew her. We as fans got to know Mikaela and put time and heart into her as a main character. So we cared what happen to Mikaela. We knew Sam and Mikaela's feeling for each other. We cared about these characters. But whomever decided to ditch Megan Fox made a BIG mistake. We don't know this character Carly. The only thing we do know if you see the movie in 3D you will mostly only see her lips on the screen. But, Do we care if she is taken by the Decepticons? Me, No. I cared that Sam cared and that was that. You could tell that with 90% of Carly's lines someone just x'ed out the name Mikaela and put Carly in it's place. Come on Sam still had Mikaela's dog Bones and her Decepticon turn autobot buddy. Carly didn't even like the autobots, she was annoyed by them in the apartment. See, Mikaela will have never acted that way. I'm not trashing Rosie Huntington-Whiteley but she is no replacement for Megan Fox in the Transformers franchise. If this is truly the last of Michael Bays Transformers than I feel robbed, let down and any other word that comes to mind. We spent our money and our time getting to know and loving the relationship of Sam and Mikaela and someone in Hollywood, whether it was Bays, Fox and or Spielberg. They ruined the last movie for me. I am Lady, I like romance. I mean I loved the action and drama too but, I love/loved Sam and Mikaela and I want a T4 and I want the story fix for me."

","Well here we go again. Another Transformers movie and another round of critics bashing it harder than a decepticon hitting an autobot picnic.<br/><br/>First let me preface things by saying, when do all movies being made lately have to be compared to The Dark Knight or be reviewed as if its the next academy award winning film. Whatever happened to just simply going to the movies and enjoying yourself.<br/><br/>Transformers Dark of the Moon fits nicely into the ""go and enjoy yourself"" variety. ** Potential Spoilers ** I really enjoyed this installment of the Transformers franchise. The special effects are as always excellent. As opposed to Revenge of the Fallen there's actually a story to this movie. It appears that the space-race was inspired by a crashed Autobot shuttle that was fleeing Cybertron during the war. The US got to it first and learned what they could from it and salvaging some items that become integral to the story later on. Sam this time around is out of college and out of work. There's some mildly amusing and awkward interview moments (we've all been there) and he finally lands a job in a mail-room. This is when the story kicks in. It seems Megatron and the Decepticons have been working with humans behind the scenes for a while and now they are looking to terminate some of those relationships. Sam is confronted with the information about the crashed Autobot shuttle and NASA cover-up. And he goes to the dismissive head of national security. The Autobots hear of the news and hear to the moon to recover Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) and he tells why he was fleeing Cybetron. Then the action begins with some excellent chase scenes on the highway. Great battle sequences and an unexpected betrayal. Thus resulting in the invasion of the US and some mass destruction. Parents be warned the Decepticons actually vaporize innocent by-standers on screen and it may be a bit harsh for little ones. The new Autobots were enjoyable. Loved the Wreckers and they provided some great moments on screen. And the final fight between Megatron and Optimus was very satisfying. This was a great way to end the current story and leaves things open enough for future movies. It seems like most of the negative reviews have focused on the fact that A) They hate Michael Bay. B) Megan Fox isn't in it. and C) The story sucked. Well I for one thought the story was as good as the first movie. I like the action sequences Bay films and although I find Megan Fox pleasing to the eyes I really didn't miss her at all. I don't expect great acting from these types of movies. It's meant to be escapist fun. A chance to turn off the brain and be entertained for a few hours. This movie is pure fun and fit the bill nicely. Don't listen to the haters and bad reviews... Go see it.... and have fun"
"real_kurvos","9","14","22","15 December 2011"," Underrated movie... SO underrated
","People... you have seen video reviewers review this movie like snooty ones, haven't you? They tear the movie a new one, all of them. Why? Because it's a Michael Bay Transformers movie, and therefor must ultimately be bad.<br/><br/>If you are openminded, if you love action flicks, and if you love Transformers - you WILL love this movie. And I'm about to tell you guys exactly why. This movie surprised me on so many levels. It has amazing CGI like the two first movies, it has colorful cool bad**s unique Transformers like the 2 first movies - and it has so much more. It has a plot from the animated series appearantly, which most of the reviewers mention. And really - that helps. This movie had good humor I laughed my **s off to, it has characters we care for (even the new love interest of our main character doesn't fail to make us investegated), it has a interesting and pretty well written story with a ingenious set-up at the start of the movie, it has some bad**s villains, it has some of the best plot-twists I have seen in a long while (and that says something to me) - and it really satisfied me as the last part of a trilogy. I've seen it twice already - it's just awesome. Does it have it's problems? Of course it has. It has for instance the classical dumb cliché of the villain giving exposition to one of the main characters about how they will take over the world for no apparent reason. And like in the last movies, I am very afraid to say Sam Witwicky's mother STILL is a very annoying b**ch (although, she is a lot less in this movie than in the 2 first ones, which is a big plus). She has a scene where she wants to have a family meeting with Sam and tell him he ""should"" sacrifice everything for his girlfriend to make her stay; and she even shows a book she says is good with the title ""She Comes First"". And guess what's even worse? This is a real book - you can actually buy that piece of s**t. Classy mom he has - trying to force on things from the 19th century about how the man should sacrifice everything to please his woman... sex equality is overrated, huh?!<br/><br/>But you know what? Those are actually the only problems I had with this movie. I do not get what people complain about. They say it's annoying to see Sam scream in the entire movie. But each time he does, it's either hystericly funny or just authentic giving the situation he is in. People and reviewers say the last Harry Potter movie was fantastic, huh? Let me tell this right away - I thought Transformers: Dark of the Moon was AT LEAST 3 times better than Harry Potter: The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was... without overdoing it. People say Transformers 3 has plot holes? Yeah, maybe 1 or 2 - but the last Harry Potter movie literally got at least 10-15. Not to mention - everything felt rushed in the last Harry Potter movie. Nothing felt rushed in Transformers 3. NOTHING. Not to mention - the CGI is 4 times better in Transformers 3 than in Harry Potter 8. You think this is odd and/or dumb to compare? Oh, I think not. Everyone praises Harry Potter 8 as a masterpiece, while they bash Transformers 3 WAY too much. Heck - Michael Bay's Transformers-trilogy is a MUCH stronger franchise than the Harry Potter franchise is - they both got as long stories. Only differences are that Harry Potter pads it's story out way more, and is ironicly a lot more rushed when it's close to the end. And that really says something, people. And oh, guess what Transformers 3 had that Harry Potter did not have? A threatening conflict. Yes; I actually felt like the villains could more than well win in Transformers 3. The villain is a real threat - and it's established you just do not f**k with him, which also is easy for the audience to believe. In Harry Potter 8, we got Voldemort, failing as usual - and makes us laugh our a**es off each time he mugs the screen. Need I say more?<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon inspired me. I'm not joking - this is a very inspiring movie to me. It made my imagination go wild with how I could make my own stories. It really feels like a movie showing how close to an end Earth can get. They even play a dramatic choir in the background when the take-over takes place. Oh, and another reason why this movie is bad**s - Shockwave and his Driller Decepticon! I mean, man - that Driller destroys EVERYTHING in it's path! It's quite literally a gynormous killer robot-worm! And other nice touches can be seen, like one Einstein-Autobot - and one predator-decepticon. Pretty sweet, if you ask me. Oh, and Optimus has his trey for him as a truck now finally, like in the animated series. And guess what? They gave it a genuine reason. It has all of Optimus' weapons, and even a jetpack! Simply genius.<br/><br/>This is to me the best Transformers movie. The first one IS a close second - but this one just surprised me SO well. No bulls**t in it barely, no annoying plot holes, a skyhigh entertainment value, fantastic conflict, great music and a satisfying feeling after you've watched it. A very strong 9 out of 10. Don't miss this movie, people - and don't try too hard to hate it. It really doesn't deserve it."
"KhellendrosTheDragon","7","14","22","12 July 2011"," Decent, but nothing special
","If you liked the first two, you'll probably like this, it's not quite as awesome as the first one, but a bit better than the second, I think.<br/><br/>It was standard explosions and slow motion robots. There were a couple times I laughed so hard I cried a little, once at something John Malkovich did and another time at something rather absurd and ridiculous.<br/><br/>Acting wise it was alright, and there were a couple of minor twists I wasn't expecting, some scenes ran on a little long, but it was okay. I saw it in 3D and I'm glad I didn't pay for it because I don't feel that the 3D effects were that mind-blowing or wow-ing."
"alexray_67","10","14","22","5 July 2011"," Best of the three by far.
","Now just as a heads up, I attended the midnight launch for this movie in the best theater in the state and braced myself for the mind numbing awesomeness that awaited. Waiting in line for three hours, I could only stew in my own ultra hyped state of anticipation while the line behind me slowly grew and stretched out the front doors and down the side walk. At 11:45 pm we started our way into the theater room which quickly began to turn into one large testosterone heated locker room, filled with only 3 children under the age of 16, which I was extremely happy about. When the movie started, I quickly lost myself in the immersive 3D that made its transformers premier this year. All phones disappeared and all eyes glued to the 50ft ultra high definition projector screen. The Story in this movie was great, filled with reunions, betrayals, and retribution. It was easy to follow save the first little bit regarding Human-Decepticon cooperations, and did not feel to rushed due to the length of the movie(2:48). I felt like a kid again, oohing and awwing at the beautiful action sequences that dominated the last third of the movie, and likewise at the much needed character development and interaction added in this edition to the series as well. With returning stars such as Shia Lebouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and new stars like Patrick Dempsey, Alan Tudyk, and Ken Jeong, this movie had the best acting of the three by far. Jeong was hilarious as the uptight ex-NASA worker, and Tudyk was my favorite character, playing a crazy Dutch mercenary who wears outrageous suits and when pushed too far can find himself capable of killing everyone in a bar. Megan Fox's replacement Rosie Huntington-Whitely who plays Sam's new girlfriend Carly, is a much better actress than Fox. That does not mean she is great, but she is at least a large step up from Megan fox, who couldn't even act her way out of Sam's bimbo gal pal and into a more intelligent role. With cameos by Buzz Aldrid and Bill O'Reily and Insainly good voice acting performances from Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, and the great Leonard Nimoy, this movie truly has it all. It even came complete with a final epic battle in Chicago, The Decepticons attempting to form a space-bridge to teleport Cybertron to Earth and the Autobots fighting for the freedom of the human race. The tone of this movie near the end was sad and ominous and even included another Linkin Park song(Iridescent), and brought a real human aspect to the cold soulless body's of the Transformers. My friends and I all got choked up watching a desperate, sad faced, defenseless Bumbelbee with a gun to the back of his head, saying ""We gave it a hell of a run"". I also actually felt empathy for the first time when watching Iron Hide die, loosing a great character which felt like I just lost a dear friend. The 3D utilized in this movie was amazing. It was 100% completely throughout the movie, and really stood out in certain parts of the movie. As expected from any Michael Bay movie, the special effects were AMAZING. The final battle was the most epic part of any movie I have ever seen. Watching Sentinal Prime fight off four Autobots at once, and Shockwave riding his giant burrowing worm throughout the city were some of the highlights of this special effects bonanza. The Autobots nutted up and turned into completely badass fighting machines when they realized that the humans were truly lost without them, and Optimus said the one line that almost made me jump out of my seat with excitement.. ""We'll kill them all!"". He really brought the series full circle when he killed the ex-leader of the Autobots Sentinel Prime, saying ""No, you betrayed yourself.."" and De-Spined Megatron, destroying the chain of Decepticon command. The Movie ended leaving me completely fulfilled and happy with the trilogy..<br/><br/>Or is it the end?? Have we all forgotten about the planet sized Unicron, and him bring back Megatron as Galvetron??? A fan can dream can't he?"
"jvilla53","10","14","22","4 July 2011"," Yes, it's that great!
","I never thought I would find this one beautiful. I've never been a fan of the first and second one, but I like them nonetheless. When I found out my Mom was going to make me watch this, I had low expectations.<br/><br/>But after I watched the film, I realized I was wrong. The movie pulls it off. I never thought I would like this one but ended up LOVING it. This is a simple tale of freedom and the will to claim it against all odds. The acting was top-notch, and I have to give Rosie Huntington-Whiteley due credit for making a great performance which is not bad for a first-timer. Shia was as usual excellent and so were the other actors. Their performances complement the simplistic storyline to give it a kick it deserves.<br/><br/>And finally, there are the Autobots and Decepticons. They have been the CGI masterpieces that they are ever since the first one, and now it seems they've just secured their spot as the most charming CG robots on Earth and Cybertron. (Yes, I found even Megatron quite great.) In Dark of the Moon, they are not just rendered robots but somehow, the makers were able to breathe personality and even more life into all of them. Kudos to Michael Bay for directing this great third act to the Transformers franchise. I just wish there is no more 4th film as it might ruin the greatness in the series.<br/><br/>10/10"
"PwnPocalypse","10","14","22","29 June 2011"," A thoughtful review from a TF fan.
","OK, so where do I begin here? I just got back from a showing here in Seoul, South Korea in IMAX 3D. I'm simply stunned at what I saw.<br/><br/>I have been a Transformers fan since I was a kid. I used to watch the G1 cartoon with my Dad while holding my Optimus Prime action figure closely. I'm a true fan, I promise.<br/><br/>Now, onto the review! Remember, this is a spoiler heavy review so turn back if you don't want to have anything ruined for you. If you don't mind that sort of thing, then read on!<br/><br/>OK, so most everyone knows the plot of the film so I don't think I need to go into that so much. Was it anything special? No, not really. Did I care? No, not at all... The plot was simply there to move the movie along and it worked well. <br/><br/>The human characters this time around are also playing second fiddle to the Transformers, which was something many fans were concerned about with the other films. I'm happy to report that they get some great dialogue and the movie is mainly about THEM this time.<br/><br/>The dumb comedy is gone. I didn't roll my eyes once during the movie, and that's saying something! Also, the Twins are nowhere to be found and that was fine by me. Wheelie is back, and he brought along another small friend named Brains. They are actually GREAT this time and serve a purpose. Brains particularly is hilarious. I'm not even joking. He had some hilarious lines and was a welcome comic relief that actually didn't feel forced or dumb at all.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime (my personal favorite) and the rest of the Autobots have much more to do this time around. Dino and Q, two of the new bots, both have small parts in the film. You still feel a bit of emotion when Q is executed in front of Bumblebee. ""I'll miss you old friend"" you hear Bumblebee spurt out from his radio when it happens, adding more emotion to the whole scene.<br/><br/>Ironhide's death is pretty sad. It happens quickly, but it's hard to watch him waste away if you're a fan. He definitely kicks ass in the film and has his moments, but it's hard to say goodbye to him. The only problem I had with his death is that it's not mentioned again after he's killed. It's obvious it happens when Sentinel Prime is wasting everything in sight, so they really didn't have time to react to it, but I still wish they had shown some reactions to his death.<br/><br/>One small gripe I have, is that Megatron is underused a bit. He looks pretty awesome, and has some good lines with Starscream and Soundwave, but he really only plays second fiddle to Sentinel. He does have a definite ""Megatron moment"" at the end when he attacks Sentinel Prime at the end of the movie, as it was clearly only to secure him as the master of Earth. He's still Megs at heart here, and I think it was perfectly acceptable for Optimus to execute him.<br/><br/>The special effects were absolutely ASTONISHING! I saw the film in Imax 3D and I have to recommend that you ONLY see it in this fashion. I felt like I was on a roller-coaster in a chair that was bolted down to the floor. That's saying something! You really get a sense of depth and just how big everything is. It's definitely worth it to shell out the extra dollars to see it this way. Don't miss out!"
"dee.reid","10","15","24","18 November 2011"," ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon""
","I have to say that I actually really enjoyed 2011's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" much like I did its predecessors ""Transformers"" (2007) and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" (2009). Now I know I'll probably just catch hell for making that statement. But I don't care, it's my thoughts and that's all that matters to me.<br/><br/>Like most 20-somethings today, I grew up watching the original ""Transformers"" cartoons throughout my youth growing up in the early '90s. Those were really good times. I even collected a few of the Hasbro toys (which inspired the cartoon and big-budget live-action movies), but my admiration for ""Transformers"" never really peaked because the channel that I used to watch the original series on removed the show from its early-morning line-up during the mid-90s and it didn't return to TV until just recently - like within the last four years when the first live-action movie was released.<br/><br/>History lesson over...<br/><br/>Like its two predecessors, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is loud, obnoxious, high destructive good fun. The first film is obviously the best by any standard, I'm partial to liking the second film only slightly more than that one, and this third entry probably has the most ridiculously over-the-top city-wide siege battle I've ever seen. (The film's last 40 minutes are basically one long action sequence; 20 years ago something of this magnitude would have been impossible because of the sheer scale of everything but because of CGI and bigger budgets, lengthy action sequences of this type are now commonplace in the movies today.)<br/><br/>As you will recall (or in case you've been living under a rock and have no idea what a ""Transformer"" is), the whole ""Transformers"" mythology involves a centuries-old war between the heroic Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin who mistakenly bring their conflict from their home planet Cybertron to Earth where humans are soon brought into the fold along with them.<br/><br/>""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" begins in 1961, when an Autobot spaceship carrying a secret from Transformer home planet Cybertron crash-lands on the moon. A little bit of revisionist history thus takes place in which it is revealed that the whole Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union at that time was instigated to see who could reach the lunar crash site first and learn its secrets. (This is all set up in some pretty quick-step tempo that includes archival footage of President Richard Nixon and the 1969 moon landing integrated with scenes newly shot by over-indulgent, over-director Michael Bay.)<br/><br/>We learn that this secret could also save mankind, or wipe us out.<br/><br/>The Decepticons are back once again, led by their fearsome leader Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving), and they once again resume their war with the heroic Autobots who are led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, the only voice actor from the original ""Transformers"" TV series). Caught in the middle of it, are determined human players Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf, still continuing his likable Everyman thing), his new love interest Carly Spencer (newcomer and model Rosie Huntington-Whitely, now having thoroughly replaced Megan Fox), soldiers Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson), Agent Simmons (John Turturro) and his assistant Dutch (Alan Tudyk), and newcomers federal bureaucrat Agent Mearish (Frances McDormand) and Carly Spencer's hunky boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey).<br/><br/>Everything culminates in an epic, highly destructive Earth-bound siege in Chicago between the Autobots and their human allies, and the evil Decepticons.<br/><br/>I think Bay out-did himself on this picture with seeing how many things he can blow up and how many bullets can be fired. It's all utterly ridiculous, but the entire time I was more in awe of the amazing technical feats of it all. From the beginning of the ""Transformers"" series of films, I've always been impressed by the level of attention paid to the littlest details of every scene.<br/><br/>Every time a Transformer transforms, I've always been amazed by the sights and sounds of metal parts clanking, whirring, and reconfiguring into some robotic alien mass or robot disguised as heavy-duty machinery. I'm also awed by the amazing details of every explosion, every slain robot that gets torn apart limb from limb in battle, and just the overall attention to detail. It's a pure visual spectacle where you're just in awe of everything that's going on. If you hate Michael Bay, at least like his special effects.<br/><br/>Whatever your feelings regarding Bay are, don't miss out on this one; you'll only regret seeing one of the most finely detailed action epics of the year.<br/><br/>10/10"

I had gotten the privilege of seeing an early screening, and the effects and 3D were amazing as usual. But...<br/><br/>The Plot and the characters were amazing. The robots have deeper and more believable character development, surprisingly, which we never get in a bay movie.

They still have their original names."
"drakula2005","8","90","181","20 June 2011"," Michael Bay has somehow done it-what an improvement, what a Sci-Fi.Genre-defining!
","The Transformers series are a very strange and curious trilogy.The first was interesting, a little longer than the plot was capable of handling, but nonetheless enjoyable for what it is.<br/><br/>Then, the second one came around with initial reviews claiming it was a loud-explosion mess of a movie.Yes, i left the theatre deaf as a post, but i still accepted it for what it was-a brainless, one-liner, visual effects driven non-plot having extravaganza, that can take your ears to the grave.Yes, it was a little sub par on plot and substance, but i enjoyed it for what it is-a summer Michael Bay movie.<br/><br/>Now, with the third coming, i must say, that all of you, who were left unhappy, deaf and unsatisfied, you must forget it and see the third part as a reincarnation in a Sci-Fi classic, just like the likes of the nowadays Inception, or District 9 and so on, but with more effects, less inappropriate noise and featuring one of the most breathtaking scenery of giant robots fighting on 3-D.The technical part of the movie is done better than ever, on par up there with Avatar (yes, it's getting a cliché, but it's nevertheless true)and there is a believable plot, considering the flops they used to call stories in the first two movies (again, compared with this, of course).<br/><br/>The acting isn't great, but it's an improvement, considering the movie's improvement in any other department as well.Even Rosie looks a little better than Megan Fox.Shia LaBeouf is the running man again, and with some additions such as Patrick Dempsey, John Malkovich and even the twist in Turturro's character, Transformers 3 looks fresher than ever.<br/><br/>With good reviews coming from literary everywhere right now, i do hope people will believe, because this movie does not deserve to be in the box office shade of it's predecessors, because it is so much better.<br/><br/>So, i'll leave you with this-go see it not because you still have faith in the franchise, but see it because as it looks to you, the movie is really different from the other two (which Bay also claimed to be ""dark""), and last but not least, see it for the mind-blowing SFX's, which have not been seen since December 2009...<br/><br/>A great summer movie, a modern action, Sci-Fi movie, which will wind up in many movie collections over the years to come!<br/><br/>Ny note:10/10"

","Now this is how you make a summer blockbuster movie! The action is so epic and it never stops. The visuals are insane and breath-taking. It has those hilarious moments, and even Mr. Chow from The Hangover gives a great cameo. It's a much darker film and not entirely kid-friendly. I'm sure anyone that grew up with the cartoon in the 80's would love it. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a newcomer this time playing Carly, Sam's new love interest. If you don't dwell on it, you probably won't miss Megan Fox.<br/><br/>The Autobots have formed an alliance with the U.S. They soon find out why they originally sent Apollo 11 to the moon in 1969, to discover a Cybertronian ship piloted by Sentinel Prime carrying pillars called The Ark. Optimus revives Sentinel and is immediately betrayed by one of his own. Sentinel and Megatron team up and try to bring their planet; Cybertron to earth. It's up to Sam, Carly, Lennox, Epps and the Autobots to defeat the Decepticons once and for all. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON!!!"

","Transformers: Dark of the Moon was a really great film, and so far my favorite out of the three made so far. This is also the first film I watched in real D 3D and I was very impressed, there were some moments when the 3D became a headache because the scenes were so flashy and switched so fast my eyes/brain couldn't comprehend it, otherwise I believe the story line was outstanding, and they really do a good job of making the Transformers films seem like a true series line by mentioning events from the previous films. The humor was really great, I laughed a lot during this film, and I loved that I really felt in the action while watching this in 3D. This movie was like 3 hours but It is well worth watching. I would recommend this to anyone."
"edwbur","10","30","54","29 June 2011"," 3rd times the charm
","this is a big big improvement from revenge of the fallen. there is better acting, story, action, romance, everything. this time it is about how Neil Armstrong went to the moon and found sentinel prime. and auto bot who was the leader before optimus prime. that was in 1969. fast forward to 2011 and SAM witwicky (shia labeouf) has graduated college and is in search of a job. has a new girlfriend named Carly (Rosie Huntington- Whiteley) who did better and is a better fit for transformers than Megan fox was. she was better at acting and looked better for SAM in terms of relationship. anyway megatron and star scream went into hiding and is planning to once again take over the world. this time there killing humans or enslaving them to help them rebuild the decepticons planet. in fact they even got some humans working for them the decepticons. so they got a problem. and of course SAM Carly and Simmons (john turturro) find the solution along with the original army that has helped SAM the two other occasions and who work with the auto bots which means the returns of josh duhamel and tyrese Gibson. this film is made like the first one was made. they gave more room for the story, and development of different things, while still putting action sequences in it, but not all crammed into together. there is of course comedy and drama. more drama and shia labeouf really showed more acting skills than he has in the other two transformer movies. better chemistry also between shia labeouf and Rosie Huntington Whiteley. this movie will not be a let down and is diffidently worth the money. i recommend you see it."

It topped other movies like Harry Potter and also Iron Man off and was an awesome film about robots which i really enjoyed and i pretty much am now a Transformers fan.<br/><br/>The thing that i liked in this film is that Micheal Bay did a good job directing the film. If it was not for him, None of the Transformers would have been awesome such as this. But as a director i give him praise and also respect for being such a good director. So i have to admit he was even a lot better and also he directed such a great film.<br/><br/>The Decepticons want nothing more then the All-Spark cube for the destruction of our planet. Wanting nothing more then the cube itself. The Autobots join up to help the government with secret missions. But Sam Witwicky and his new girlfriend Carly Spencer are going nowhere when the Decepticons threaten to destroy the earth and with their new leader Sentinel Prime. It's up to Optimus Prime and his friends to save the world once again from a new threat if it's not stopped. Of course The Ark must be stopped because it's technology will destroy the world and ending all life on it if not stopped.<br/><br/>The special effects in this film like Buildings collapsing and of course the Autobots fighting with the Decepticons is intense. Almost all the scenes had some perspective to them and a lot of those scenes were amazing. I enjoyed seeing them as they looked so real. And almost CGI like.<br/><br/>Also Shia Lebouef is a great actor in this film. He expresses and acts so well that his performance is just unforgettable to watch. And his Talent amazing, He played recently as Mutt Williams in Indina Jones. And played as Sam Witwicky in Transformers. Though he does a good job playing in the Disney TV Show Even Stevens, And of course many more roles in the film Disturbia, And of course in The Battle of Shaker Heights. He was just excellent in this film all by himself.<br/><br/>Also Megan Fox is replaced by Victoria Secret's model and Jason Statham's girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whitely. Of course her role and her acting is awesome. But in some scenes she does not act normal like when she's only screaming. She looks great and she is an awesome actress. But Megan Fox was replaced as in the two other films were she was still with Sam but was eventually replaced which was nice too.<br/><br/>Although this film definitely has some great fight scenes and the soundtrack that is composed very well i should say is the best. Of course it's not that bad and it sounds a lot better because the music makes it suspenseful and yet violent. But still the fight scenes are really violent no matter what you think. This makes the movie a lot better then it already is.<br/><br/>Although the movie is a great film. I would have to say that this is an action packed film and it's a very good one. There are many great funny scenes in it like where Simmons knocks on the door and a Russian Doorman says that means goodbye. It surely makes me laugh every time i see it and the script is very well indeed told and read by the actors which is also nice. But the fact is that if you are a big Transformers fan then you have got to see this movie. It's all based on the toys and the TV Show and of course tops it off in my case. This is even better then Indiana Jones or Iron Man and also is something you have to see to believe. The story is incredible. The characters stay true and react perfectly in each situation. And the entire film and acting is something to be remembered. Everyone is going to love seeing this film like i did in the theater.<br/><br/>So if you are wanting to see a superhero flick then look no furthur then to Transformers Dark Of The Moon. It surely is an awesome film and is a great film. It will make you laugh and the director behind it which is Micheal Bay is surely amazing."

"historybuff94","Null","9","13","29 September 2011"," The best out of all three films (WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)
","I personally thought that Dark of the Moon was the best out of all three of the Transformers films. First, I know that it has the same plot as the first two films and I know this film isn't perfect.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about the bad. That would usually be the comic relief. Sam's parent's are as annoying as ever, but fortunately in this film,they give him advice to go after the girl. Second, Wheelie and Brains replace Skids and Mudflap in the most annoying transformers ever contest. Speaking of Skids and Mudflap, they're back in this film, but fortunately, they aren't given any lines. I personally thought the relationship between Mearing and Simmons was creepy. Add Simon's assistant Dutch to the comic relief characters. *SPOILER* Ironhide dies.<br/><br/>Now for the good. I personally like how Chow from The Hangover was used in this movie. The action scenes were bigger and better than ever before. *SPOILER* It's the first time we see Barricade since the first film. I also liked how everything is resolved here. Mr. Spock doing the voice of Sentinel Prime was just classic. Out of all the new characters in this film, my favorite would have to be Carly, Sam's new girlfriend. She literally sassed Megatron, voiced by Elrond. This probably because I'm 17 years old and I usually like looking for hot girls in these movies. I also like how they used historical references correctly this time, rather than how they did it at the beginning of Revenge of the Fallen. I still like the rivalry between Megatron and Optimus. Overall, I thought this movie was the best out of all three."
"im_cuter","10","19","32","27 July 2011"," great movie! great music! great effects! Mostly great Acting!
","I was never a huge transformers fan, but having just seen the first one and loving it and then watching the second and being utterly confused and unimpressed i was a bit skeptical about watching the last of the three. I went anyway and was utterly blown away. I have read some of the reviews on this website and find that this movie did not live up to the standard of those who are fans of the original transformer movies. I was never a huge fan so for me this movie was great. I would firstly like to point out the greatness of the soundtrack in this movie. Its mind blowing and makes the action and drama scenes much more intense. It fits in so perfectly as well. This is something that has not been touched upon by reviewers, and i personally think was missed by most people. ITS AMAZING. Secondly, visual effects, of course! thats an obvious one, but one that should be mentioned anyway for its greatness! Sure, we wont be talking about these visual effects in 20-30 years time, but right now, this is one of the best i have ever seen and i was truly amazed. Thirdly, Shia's acting, you may judge me on this, but i think it was his best from all three, and his comedy was spot on and hilarious! As for the whole story and plot, i think its based on opinion, i thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was carried out very nicely. Not the strongest part of the film of course, but not low enough for me to score a 1/10, definitely now. The only thing i would downgrade this movie for is the poor acting of rosie (Carly) but for me Patrick Dempsey, Shia LaBoeuf and Josh Duhamel all receive a 10/10. Im not sure if this review makes any sense because this is just me rambling after seeing so many negative reviews! Don't hate me, but i LOVED this movie! i would pay to watch it again! Best out of the three for me!"
"John-maynes-936-825264","10","25","44","28 June 2011"," Michael Bay's Amazing Redemption! Its Incredible!
","The greatest redemption in cinema history, you would think Michael Bay wouldn't give a crap about story or acting but he did.<br/><br/>I don't know what Michael Bay did but he finally did it, he actually did it, the whole movie was Incredible, i have never experienced such an experience.<br/><br/>This isn't a Spielberg experience or a Nolan experience this now official a Michael Bay Experience!<br/><br/>Do not let anyone spoil this for you, you will see what i mean after watching it.<br/><br/>And if i may also included Ehren Kruger was Born to write a Transformers movie.<br/><br/>You will not believe Michael Bay made this movie! I'm seeing this until it doesn't show anymore. <br/><br/>Michael Bay is finally in the spot in his Career!"
"prafulk","5","99","202","28 June 2011"," Eyegasmic ! But an Intellectual BORE !
","You go in this movie with fingers crossed tightly on both hands and wish only that Mr. Bay does not screw this up. In the end you come out of the theater still wishing you had more hands to break the jinx. <br/><br/>The first half is too comic and targets so to say a younger more adolescent audience. While the second half is a testosterone overdose pumping on adrenalin . Too much of action is stuffed in without any connections between the scenes. <br/><br/>There are too many crescendo moments and by the end you just grow old of it.<br/><br/>5 Stars for the amazing effects ! Hope it had a semblance of a story-line to keep the audience invested. :("
"madaras_adrian","10","23","40","28 June 2011"," See it, very nice movie
","Breath-taking, amazing, this movie has it all. S. Spielberg really did it this time. I just came from the movie. I live in Romania by the way, and seen it, today 28th of July, before the premiere ( some kind of early premiere, 1 day ahead of global release, that means 29th of June ). Shia is a great actor, and I say: 10 stars, good work people. A must see movie, probably movie of the year in my opinion. Many more baddies join the fight, especially Shockwave, a really nasty Decepticon + a few more Autobots + an intriguing story line that keeps you at the edge of your cinema seat. All in all, beautiful angles, impressive scenes, lots of destruction and mayhem. P.S. Don't forget your popcorn"
"TheLittleSongbird","4","84","170","14 July 2011"," I personally think this is the worst of the three
","I liked the first Transformers, and while it did have its problems the second was better than I expected. I came into the cinema not expecting much, but I left feeling very underwhelmed. Other than the amazing effects, authentic sound, quite excellent action and above average cinematography and editing, this Transformers entry was a waste of time in my opinion.<br/><br/>In my opinion Transformers:Dark of the Moon is the dullest and worst of the three. The first half is poorly paced and dull to the point of boredom, and while the second half fares much better due to the action it came too late and wasn't enough to stop the film from becoming a messy bore overall. The dialogue is stupid and formulaic, the film is much too long and the story is choppy and confused complete with a messy ending.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's direction is another low point, it is murky and unfocused throughout, while the characters are either underused(the robots) or annoying(John Tuturro's character). The acting is not great at all, the voice work is decent, however John Malkovich is wasted, Shia LaBoeuf's easy going charm doesn't disguise the fact his performance is uncharismatic and dull, Patrick Dempsey(performance and character) is useless, John Tuturro tries hard but ends up over-compensating and the less said about the lovely but bland replacement for Megan Fox Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the better.<br/><br/>All in all, a mess and the worst of the three. 3.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Gargoyle26","7","10","15","7 August 2011"," Could have been a better film and sorely missing Megan Fox.
","Instead of replacing the character played by Megan Fox we get new character which is stupid as it would have made more sense to keep the ""Mikaela Banes"" character and just substitute the actress as they did quite well on TV's ""Roseanne"" but no we get a new character airbrushed to the hilt with pumps which isn't the actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley fault as someone in the production obviously wanted to have that look. She did a good job in her role and would be much better if she was toned down to match the previous character as it was a distraction like the negative put downs of character throughout the film about ""Mikaela Banes"" which makes me wonder of Michael Bay's frame of mind by allowing that in his film. Anyway, Megan Fox as the love interest was sorely missed as she seemed more natural in the role and like the girl next door that had the ability to repair cars.<br/><br/>Sam throughout the film kept harping on his medal he was given and being a hero who saved the world, in reality the Autobots were the true heroes with Sam being an integral part. One would think that since he almost died in the last film that he'd be more mature, have a stronger character and not so whiny this time around.<br/><br/>I know it's all special effects but sometimes a building, helicopter etc. wouldn't look as real as the other scenes in the film and if you're spending a lot to make it realistic it better be. The scenes' where the characters' are hiding, creeping about not to be seen they do and stick out like Godzilla in the snow obviously the director and editor were asleep. There's a scene has someone telling another to shoot at an target which they hesitate and was out of character for being a member of NEST, the scene should have been deleted.<br/><br/>I liked the film though it could've been better if they hadn't rushed in it's making. It reminds me of Iron Man 2 which was disappointing as it too could've been so much better granted both films made big $$ but found that Battle: Los Angeles was a far better film though all three films had excellent special effects not counting the errors in this film. The rest of the returning cast and new additions were excellent."

","Third part in transformers trilogy what i have expected full of action and good camera work and heavy special effects once again Mr. Michael Bay proved it that he is the Master of Modern Epic Action Science Fiction Films.I am glad he used very heavy and high definition cameras. Transformers Trilogy is feast for my eyes and action pack trilogy very rare and unique script and direction and composer Steve jablonsky has done a great job.It shows that sometimes truth and humanity does not come easily we have to be active and full of action.I have seen all the films directed by Mr Michael Bay and he is my favorite director and it is the first film of Mr Micheal Bay to exceed 1 billion it is the most appreciated film according to fans all around the world."
"zuma777","7","11","17","15 October 2011"," Why do people hate this movie?!
","First of all, I'm 34 years old and as a kid I was a huge Transformers TV show fan. Back in 2007 when they said there will be a transformers film I was kind of excited, I loved the idea. When I went to see the movies I was very very very disappointed. The robots look nothing like the cartoon, the story was different, Megatron's voice was different, Shia LaBeouf was awful - It was a bad movie. <br/><br/>OK, sometimes things can get better, I went to see the second one. By all means those were 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Transformers 2 was a total disaster. No plot whatsoever, Megan Fox's body was being thrown on us for the film to succeed, about a million goofs and mistakes regarding ""the big war in Egypt"" - (Believe me, I know, I'm an Egyptian).<br/><br/>I thought of giving Mr.Bay a last chance. I went to the movie with very low expectations and then....WOW. By far the best movie of the trilogy. It had a nice story, some twists, AMAZING CGI - no more shaky cameras, you can now witness every fight in clear detail. The music was fantastic (although ripped off, a little mix between The Dark Knight and Inception). Shia LaBeouf surprisingly was actually good. The movie is a summer blockbuster, it's a two and a half hour thrilling action ride with a lot of scenes that will make you drop your jaw and bite your fingernails. Why do critics hate it? Have no Idea. Please people don't talk about plot holes and wrong scientific facts, this is a movie about talking robots that have feelings, so I think we're already past the scientific and logical point! I gave this an 8 because I had to drop 2 points for the movie's biggest fault - Miss ""lips"" Rosie - She can't act, I didn't give a damn about her and to be honest, she is NOT hot. Megan was totally HOT. <br/><br/>Don't wait to rent the DVD. You will not waste your money, if you like action, thrilling scenes, have an ear to music and most of all - like the Transformers, go see it."
"akashtaker001","10","11","17","9 October 2011"," Excellent, Mindless action movie
","I saw this movie in 3D despite negative comments by critics. I watched it because I really like last two movies of the franchise. And let me tell you that I didn't made a mistake. It was the most incredible movie I have seen so far. Its a brilliant treat for the eyes to see the mind blowing special effects, 3D is the icing on the cake. But bear in mind just keep your logical, critic mind at home. The plot is really thin and acting is average but this is not a Citizen Kane. The action is like never seen before. Also I am a big fan of Megan Fox therefore I was disappointed because of her absence. Also Rosie's acting is really robotic. But she fulfills her purpose in the movie for providing the much required eye-candy. On the whole if you are really a fan of action and special effects I bet you won't be disappointed."

","Best movie out of the three! I mean I thought the first one was good, this one is even better! Michael Bay did an outstanding job of creating a fun filled action movie!

All the Actors in it including Shia Labouf, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington Whitely and all the rest were fantastic!!! Congratulations Michael Bay for making the Best Action movie out there. Ignore all the haters and people who have no idea what good of a movie this is. Love you Michael Bay!!!!!

Long Live Transformers Dark of The Moon!!!<br/><br/>Please no hate comments."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","6","8","23 February 2012"," OK I admit, it's the best of the bunch, so far.
","It's sort of funny. Unlike most others, I don't mind big and overblown Michael Bay's movies at all. However his Transformers movies always have been ones that I could never really enjoy watching, while they are the biggest and most overblown Michael Bay movies out there.<br/><br/>Reason as to why I liked this movie far better than the previous two Transformers movies is because this time around I could actually understand what was going on, on screen and with its story. Not that it's well written or a terribly clever story but I at least could understand all that was going on. I don't even remember all that much about the first two Transformers movies, because they seemed terribly random with its story and got told very messily.<br/><br/>But really, this is not the only thing that this movies does better than any of its predecessors. Also for the first time ever I truly got a sense of it that the Autobots and Decepticons were at a full scale war with each other. And what a war it was! Visually and with its special effects, this movie is truly a great and spectacular one! The battles have never looked bigger or better and overall they also have a more type of special-effects vibe to it this time.<br/><br/>So both the Autobots and Decepticons work out better in the story, this time around but so do all of its human characters. Thing that really annoyed me about the first two movies was how it seemed to focus way too much on the human characters, while they didn't even seemed to fit into its story all that well. In this movie it all works out way better. The human plot lines are just as 'good' and 'interesting' as that of the Transformers and all of the story lines besides feel more connected to each other and less random. It definitely makes the movie more enjoyable to watch and it makes you forget that it's almost 3 hours long as well.<br/><br/>Of course there is still plenty to complain about. The action and interaction between the humans and Transformers still feels a bit awkward at times really and so does its comedy. It's shocking how lame and totally out of place its humor is at times. Another thing that started to annoy me after a while were its slow-motion moments. Really, what was up with that? Sometimes they would go on for ever and ever, without a real good reason for it and it became laughable, instead of awesome, like it was supposed to be. Also it was weird that you kept hearing all of the Transformers voices crisp and clear, no matter how much noise there was. Things like this bugged me, as did its simplistic story of course.<br/><br/>And does the presence of Frances McDormand or John Malkovich add a lot to the movie? Not really but they got obviously put in to give the movie a more serious status, as if this time things would be different and more focused on its story and acting, while this of course really wasn't the case at all.<br/><br/>But still, do all of these things really matter for a movie of this sort? This is simple entertainment and at entertaining this movie does not fail. Say what you will about Michael Bay but he is a guy that can make a $200,000,000 movie, of which you can see every cent back on the screen. The action is simply amazing and absolutely spectacular at times. They came up with some good set pieces, which also gives the movie a true sense of war and intensity. Really, this movie is already worth seeing for its action and special effects alone.<br/><br/>Simply enjoy it for what it is; a big dumb, overblown, action movie, that simply entertains and brings plenty of visually great excitement to the screen to enjoy.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"davydteather","10","21","37","13 July 2011"," Not as good as the first movie, but it is better than the second one.
","I just saw this movie tonight in the theatre with my father, and I enjoyed it a lot. Not as good as the first film but better than the second one. This film starts off in the 1960's and NASA plans a top secret mission to find out about the spaceship that crash landed on the moon. There is a lot of action and explosions in this film. It was directed by Michael Bay so of course there would be lots of explosions and CGI but I thought it worked perfectly well. Truth be told, I think Michael Bay is one of the most underrated and less respected filmmakers of all time. I think it is because he has lots of explosions in his films. But if you like films with lots of explosions and lots of action, this is the film for you. I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I was very sceptical going into the theatre, and I am glad I saw it. Kudos off to Michael Bay for a job well done. It is a must see for the people who love the original transformers action figures, cartoons and the first two transformers films. You will not be disappointed."
"LSWSjr","10","13","21","3 August 2011"," Third time's a charm for Bayformers
","Okay let me begin by saying that my score of 10 may not fit everyone's impression of the film, to be fair I was watching it with a like-minded friend and we went in looking to enjoy ourselves and the film... which we did.<br/><br/>If you don't find yourself in the same position or better, feel free to deduct 1 or 2 stars, furthermore I'm pre-emptively going to say for those that watch it on the 'small screen', that due to the epic scope of the action it may not stand up as well depending on how big a screen you can view it on, so deduct another 2 stars. Even if all that applies however you've still got a 6 out of 10 stars movie, which while not excellent is still pretty good.<br/><br/>So now that's out of the way I'll begin. This stands as probably the best installment in the series to date, which is mostly because they've worked through a lot of the faults with the previous films. The acting is tighter, the effects and sound have improved from the jump in technology again, and the plot is better than what was offered in the previous films (Love/Self Confidence can repair the Matrix uh?).<br/><br/>Most important of these is them finally dropping the 'for the kids' stuff, no destructively clumsy, urinating, leg humping, somewhat racist Transformers are to be found within. Granted, there are still some Transformers with accents and one that even looks and sounds a bit like Albert Einstein, but unlike the other films they're not played for laughs and aren't forced on us with lots of screen time like the 'twins' were (thankfully they don't return).<br/><br/>Even Wheelie, the pint sized annoyance from 'Revenge of the Fallen', has become bearable, having swapped Megan Fox's leg for an equally small and abusive robot, with the two of them going on to even play an active role in the proceedings rather than just being there for the kids to laugh at.<br/><br/>Another great thing is all the nods to the previous films and the original animated series. Optimus Prime, for example, now has a transforming trailer which shares its outside appearance with the animated original. Other mentionable references are the return of MIA Decepticon Barricade from the first film and Sam's replacement car, a Datsun with Bumblebee's paint job and his bee air freshener and disco ball from the first film.<br/><br/>A number of remaining Transformers have gone through changes, Soundwave returns (voiced again by animated series originator Frank Welker, using his Dr. Claw voice), with Lazorbeak (but not with Ravage), to fulfill a more important role than raping satellites and most surprisingly Megatron has taken on the appearance of a post-apocalyptic big game hunter, with a shotgun/blunderbuss, ragged cloak and spiked truck alt-mode to match.<br/><br/>Leonard Nimoy (who previously voiced Decepticon leader Galvatron in the 80's animated movie) gives an admirable performance as presumed dead Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, who helps to develop the lore behind the Bayformers universe, which is also assisted by a grander scale flashback of the war that destroyed Cybertron than we'd seen previously.<br/><br/>The tone of the film is definitely darker, to the point of Japanese tentacle horror at one point, with even better conspiracies and action for the human characters to actually get involved in for once, instead of just being the relatable set dressing for the all robot smashing and explosions that go on.<br/><br/>As for Mikaela's (Megan Fox's) departure, it's barely noticeable, her replacement Carly is honestly a similar if more useful character than Mikaela to the proceedings, swapping mechanical know how (which was never used in the films strangely), for a decent paying job and great social skills that don't just rely on her appearance. Sure its not a huge improvement, but she's clearly better for Sam in the long run and is more than just the hot girl who was with him for his cool car and then later for his cool robot car.<br/><br/>As for Sam, his portrayal is strong and jumps well between screaming in terror, suffering painfully in silence and eventually standing up to fight for what he believes in. Honestly the changes were fairly believable, due to the scope of what was happening, and in the end he still retains a certain 'common man-ness' about him.<br/><br/>John Malkovich, Ken Jeong and Alan Tudyk all give great comedic performances which play well into the action, while Patrick Dempsey and Frances McDormand both deliver slightly-antagonistic performances which sit well with the film.<br/><br/>As for the other main returning cast, namely Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, they all hold up well to how they were in the previous films and in the cases of Turturro, Dunn and White, their comedy moments are nice little highlights in the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is the film where all the pieces finally fit together nicely, with a lot of stuff for the fans of this film series and of the greater Transformers multi-verse; those who weren't impressed by the previous films won't be won over by this one, but it clearly stands out as a superior closing chapter for the series (for now)."

"mgodfatherml","1","14","23","17 July 2011"," Don't Bother
","Just as the title implies don't even bother with this film, the reason why its nothing we haven't seen before. Big robot fights in the desert and the city, annoying ethnic and racial insensitive robots, hot girls who can't act, bad jokes falling flat, and a plot that has more holes than swiss cheese. On top of that we have Shia Lebouf screaming every 5 minutes countless laws of physics and common sense being broken (and not in a god way) and is packed with characters that are unnecessarily over the top or just unneeded, like Ken Jeong and John Malcovich.<br/><br/>Overall it is a very slight improvement over the second film but still falls far short of one's expectations.<br/><br/>Overall will give this a 3 out of 10 for amazing special effects and relief that this will be Michael Bay's final defecation on the Transformers franchise."

Trust me, don't be biased about it, go see it, and you won't regret it! Unless your that cynical. (p.s the twists, character fates, and ending are breathtaking!)"
"optimusjamie","10","36","69","28 June 2011"," This movie isn't called MEGAN FOX: Dark of the Moon...It's called TRANSFORMERS: Dark of the moon and it's absolutely amazing!!!
","Firstly i'd like to say, to all the people who're like ""Megan fox should be in it for it to be good""....NO!!! Megan fox was a delight to be in the movies, but these movies aren't just about 'Megan fox'. Yeah she's stunning' and she had a good connection to Sam in the films, but come on people, the Transformers movie's aren't romance types of films, they're summer blockbusters, action, drama, maybe a little bit of romance in there. But all together, when people go to see these movies, they don't just look for 'Megan fox'...they come to see these movies to be entertained. And secondly i'd read some reviews from people, and they're taking a dislike to the new girl Rosie-Huntington Whiteley. Tbh from a girl who's never had any acting experience in her life, she did a darn good job as Carly. Maybe she didn't connect with Sam as much as what Megan fox. But the connection between the two was still there. I think she played the part very well, there was a couple of flaws that i picked up on within her performance, but overall i thought she did pretty well.<br/><br/>And now to talk about the film...I had concerns about this movie when Michael Bay first announced he was making the movie, because he didn't really deliver with the second film. But as the first plot lines came through over the web, i began to think ""maybe Michael could pull this off after all"" and then the teaser trailer came out and i thought ""hmmm...this could be a good summer movie"" and then when the theatrical trailer came out i was astonished and amazed and how well this movie looked. And so i went to see it at an advance screening in IMAX 3D at the odeon cinema in new york while i was out there. And after 2 and a half hours of sitting in the cinema watching this movie, i came out thinking ""WOW, Michael Bay deserves a round of applause, A REALLY BIG round of applause"" in fact i think this movie will be up there challenging for best action-invasion movie ever created! This movie was superb..i mean the action was top notch, went at a steady pace so everyone in the cinema could keep up. The drama in the film was intense and i think Michael Bay finished off the trilogy amazingly well. People who are fans of the movie's will really, really enjoy this movie. And for people who think this movie is garbage, then you must be very strict in what you want to see in a movie. 10/10 This summer isn't just about Harry Potter, Transformers dark of the moon will be up there with it. Well done Mr Bay."

"sensationalgirl-2011","Null","24","45","12 July 2011"," The product-placement is out of control
","The best thing about these movies is how they look, how well the transformers integrate into the real-life footage to make a compelling action sequence. Here it's cranked to eleven, and the CG is very impressive. On the larger shots, even tiny transformers far in the background look convincing.<br/><br/>There a several action set pieces (specifically towards the end) which are easily some of the best of the trilogy. The whole scene with the collapsing building and the tracking shot of Optimus slicing and smashing his way through a bunch of decepticons are colossal showstoppers.<br/><br/>This is also one of the best 3D movies to date. One major critique of 3D is that 3D glasses make the film darker, but here they do a very smart thing, the film itself is brighter than your average movie and this problem evens itself out. Another thing that worried me before I saw it is that if there was so much high-speed action maybe that and the combination of 3D would give me motion sickness, end of the movie: no problems.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>The villains suck. Megatron does absolutely nothing throughout the whole film until right at the end, and even that was a let down. Shockwave appears briefly at the start and vanishes for two hours, he himself doesn't actually do much, it's all down to this big nameless tentacle- clad decepticon he works with. Starscream does nothing, but then he never did anything anyway. I'm not even going to mention Patrick Dempsey. But the biggest let down is with the movies main villain ""Sentinel Prime"". Basically he is Optimus' predecessor but he changed sides to the decepticons and made a deal with Megatron to bring life back to their home planet Cybertron. This is the driving element of the movie, but there are many plot holes from this. Early in the film Optimus basically says he wants to make Sentinel Prime leader of the autobots again, and offers him the matrix (an item that brings dead transformers back to life) but Sentinel Prime declines. Then he changes sides. Why did he decline taking the matrix? it would in definitely be a help in his ploy. Sentinel Prime gets numerous chances to kill Optimus once and for all, but like all lousy villains he delays his hand and Optimus lives.<br/><br/>The product-placement is out of control. I am not joking when I say there is a scene where Shia LaBeouf stops the movie to recite a Mercerdes Commercial"

","Transformers 3: Dark Side of the Moon is a movie that I wish I could forget. They spent God knows how much money on this crap.<br/><br/>The plot was disjointed, not believable, and just plain horrible. The characters had no depth whatsoever, either. I was wowed at some of the special effects,though, but I laughed at others. I thought Michael Bay just had a bad day while filming Revenge of the Fallen, but I'm afraid he's just going downhill. Also what almost made me gouge my eyes out were the incredibly ridiculous, horrible and disjointed battle scenes. I literally thought of walking out of the theater. <br/><br/>Length was also a big issue. With a movie this bad, they should at least do us the courtesy of shortening it. With about 2 1/2 hours of this, I just got refills of my soda every so often. Yeah, it was that bad.<br/><br/>If I can say one good thing about this movie, it's that there are some funny one liners with lowbrow humor.

"Robert_duder","7","10","16","29 December 2011"," Desperately trying to capture the greatness of the original but falling short
","I'm not like other movie critics or movie watchers...I love a sequel...bad or good if I liked the original I will keep coming back to see the characters I love again and again but there is definitely a certain expectation that I have and the original Transformers film was so brilliant and unique and took live action translations to a new level. Yes Michael Bay blew things up in a huge way but will anyone (especially kids from the eighties) forget the first time we saw Optimus Prime in live action in that first film? The problem was trying to top that first film. Transformer 2 was so confusing and packed with more robots than seemingly possible. Transformers 3: Dark of The Moon tried to fix a lot of those mistakes and did well in some aspects. I think the issue with the third instalment wasn't even the robots but rather the people. The lead cast has just grown stale and Shia LaBeouf boyhood charm is now an overactive ego.<br/><br/>LaBeouf went from a talent to watch in Holes to having an enormous ego that shows on screen. I don't think his career will last much longer because people see that ego and are turned off by it. Many people complained about Meghan Fox and her acting ability but compared to the new underwear model they added to the cast, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Fox looks like Meryl Streep. Her ridiculous facial expressions (often mocked to great lengths on Youtube) and her simply awful acting ruins the story. John Turturro, who is a great actor, and is still good in this is also bordering on being annoying and overdone as well which is unfortunate. The only redeeming performances are the most underused by the military team consisting of Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel. Frances McDormand joins the cast as the Secretary of Defense but doesn't really up the ante any, Patrick Dempsey's role is mostly pointless and only helps at bringing out LaBeouf's star ego.<br/><br/>Transformers 3 is not a total loss because once again the special effects are outstanding, the battle scenes are breath taking and seeing the Transformers in action is just simply still cool. But you can see the series starting to lose its steam and that really is a shame but I'm sure a reboot is just around the corner and I say go for it!! But it might be time for Michael Bay to step back and let some fresh eyes took over the project. This is a must see for anyone who has already followed the series this far. Special effects, and battle scenes will keep you entertained but the human part of the film might leave a bitter taste in your mouth. 7/10"

Revenge of The Fallen wasn't as great as Traansformers but I still loved the film for the battle sequences and of course Megan Fox even though her performance wasn't that great. But Revenge of the Fallen was still a Technical and Box-Office. I only loved this film for the Battle sequences.

"shshnk","4","34","70","30 June 2011"," Michael Bay and company should be sued for this disaster
","If you are a Transformers fan and haven't seen this movie yet you can consider yourself lucky because the title of the movie is misleading. The movie is NOT ABOUT the transformers, it's about the stupid, useless human beings. Michael Bay has achieved the rare distinction of taking a high-potential franchisee about robots and successfully changing the main characters to humans throwing the Autobots and Decepticons somewhere in the background. I will list some of the disappointments I had: <br/><br/>1. The movie has no soul whatsoever. It's like Michael Bay taking revenge against every Transformers fan who criticized the 2nd part. <br/><br/>2. Only blowing up cars and lots of noise doesn't constitute a Transformers movie. There has to be a story. <br/><br/>3. Megan Fox should have been there. Because it was stupid without her. Rosie's role was written around Megan's but since they were two different people it didn't make sense. Also falling from buildings and escaping from bullets will leave at least a dust particle on her face wouldn't it? Why did it always look as if she had just taken a bath? <br/><br/>4. The stupid human characters are the main heroes and villains. John Turturro, Josh Duhamel and Alan Tudyk have been given undue importance. Shia had to prove he was a hero so the whole movie he keeps on fighting (and defeating) Decepticons who were strong enough to capture the Autobots. Even Rosie had to rise above the eye candy tag. So she was given the most important role in the end. Fox would be laughing. <br/><br/>5. Now for all these super humans we needed a human bad guy too right? So here comes in Patrick Dempsey. So unnecessary it's difficult to express in words. <br/><br/>6. Bay has made this movie like any other Hollywood Alien invasion film along with the 'American Spirit' part. This was supposed to be a Transformers movie. I can't figure out why they have done this. <br/><br/>7. The humour is juvenile. When will Hollywood let go of ' the two men coming out from the same toilet booth' scene? <br/><br/>On the positive side, technically the movie is sound. The 3D effects are amazing, although the slowed effects at times are kind of irritating. This movie was a disgrace to the Transformers franchisee. <br/><br/>I am utterly disappointed. All that hope of a movie as good as the first was in vain. Remove the visual effects – this movie doesn't deserve more than 3/10."
"stuffapproved","1","29","59","2 July 2011"," Simply Awful
","In short, this movie is just another example of how the more a production spends on special effects, the more the movie sucks. The humans in this movie are more prefabricated than the robots. This movie would seem good for two kinds of people, 12 year old boys, and people who were lobotomized.<br/><br/>This is just another example of how Hollywood is so out of touch with reality. This movie is just a corporate product that is simply designed to make money. There is no heart in this movie. It only demonstrates how a highly paid and competent team of professionals, from marketers to designers created a working product. I guess this is in line with the original concept of Transformers - a cartoon commercial created to sell toys."

"MrMario91","Null","29","60","8 July 2011"," An ugly, miserable experience.
","The third entry in the Transformers series is a cluttered, noisy, ugly mess that brings the series to its lowest point - a point thought impossible to achieve after the disaster that was its immediate predecessor. It proves to be an extremely miserable experience, being an hour too long with a plot too complicated for its own good and characters that, even for the type of movie it looks to be, are too thinly written.<br/><br/>The movie sees the return of its main character, Sam Whitwicky, portrayed at his whiniest by Shia Lebeouf, as he once again aids the Autobots in some sort of war against the Decepticons. Honestly, that's the most I'm able to describe the plot because I had no clue what was exactly going on for the film's entirety. Every major detail is presented in such an incoherent manner, with characters rambling endlessly at a pace so rapid that my head was left spinning after just a half-hour into the film. It also didn't help that the film would periodically stop for inane subplots such as Sam's mother - for some reason - trying to promote a self-help book to him.<br/><br/>That brings me to the film's next biggest problem. This is a two-and-a-half-hour-long film, but it really should have been anywhere between ninety to one-hundred minutes. For a simple summer blockbuster, everything should have been presented in much simpler terms and without unnecessary subplots. Why do we need to hear all this complicated backstory that's being thrown in our faces when all we really want to see is a simple story about two groups of robots in battle? If the simple route was taken, I could guarantee at least forty-five minutes or so would have been cut from the film. And for the better, I might add. I mean, how long could one possibly drag out the notion of a bunch of robots fighting each other?<br/><br/>Speaking of the fight scenes, the film even fails to make these appealing, and it's the action that's supposed to be the center-point of the film. Each action scene is presented as loud as it could possibly be, with non-stop explosions and screaming being the driving forces behind these sequences. The editing causes these scenes to jump all over the place, so there is never even really a clear focus as to where all the loud noises and screaming are distinctly coming from. This proves to be especially mind-numbing in the last act of the film, which is essentially all the previous action sequences in the film presented non-stop for forty-five minutes to an even greater degree. About five minutes into this point of the film, you're already begging for it to end.<br/><br/>The film also includes a huge supporting cast of actors who are clearly all too talented to be wasting their time with this sort of nonsense. However, I guess with the way the economy is going at this point, desperate times call for desperate measures, I suppose. The cast includes supporting roles or cameos from the likes of John Turturro, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, Alan Tudyk, and Patrick Dempsey. The majority of these roles are meant as comic relief, although they all fail miserably at providing one single laugh. Instead, they all play obnoxious versions of characters they have previously played, all desperately shouting out one ""comical"" line after another. For example, take John Malkovich's Osbourne Cox character from Burn After Reading. Now, take out all the profanity, make him shout even louder than he already did, and then just make sure every single word he says is not funny. And that's essentially the character Malkovich portrays in this disaster-piece. It shames me to see such talented actors go to waste, but like I said, there are just times when some people need a paycheck, I suppose.<br/><br/>Watching Transformers: Dark of the Moon proves to be one of the most miserable experiences I have ever had watching a movie. It does everything it could possibly do wrong to the greatest degree it could possibly do it. There was not one single bright spot I could think of as I look back on the film. And by that, I mean, there actually were about three or four moments where I remember briefly smiling, but there were so many explosions, screaming, and obnoxious performances that immediately followed that it caused me to forget what I was smiling about. It actually was so obnoxious that just thinking about it now gives me a headache, so I'm going to stop before I do any serious damage to my brain.<br/><br/>0.5/5"

","I think Transformers film changed the entire film world, it was just like a revolution. All the robot effects and all those animated stylize movements perfectly made everyone in nova days to use it,to have it similar and have all those actions. Just like helicopters design in the film ""AVATAR"", everyone is using that helicopter concept these days,and I'm sure is going to be soon a cliché. I definitely think that this film has the most dynamic effect feeling, and watching these in 3d glasses would make to get deeply into this film and feel it so bad. It is hard to watch this film and not feeling powerful. It just gives me that emotion that in life you really can do anything if you want to."
"RyanEberhart","10","5","7","20 September 2013"," Excellent!
","Of the three movies this one is by far my favorite. I like this one because it actually has more intrigue than the other two. I say that because in this one we find out that there have been many secrets kept both from the Autobots and by the Autobots. Of course there have always been secrets on the side of the Decepticons, but why wouldn't there be when they only exist to deceive.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like about this one was Megan Fox wasn't in it. However, Michael Bay made up for it by casting Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in a new role as Sam Witwicky's (Shia LeBeouf) girlfriend. So my disappointment is short lived, especially with the shot of Carly (Rosie) walking up the stairs wearing, what I believe to be, Sam's shirt over just her in her panties. After all Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was a model, and presumably still is, so this is something she has done in the past.<br/><br/>I don't want to give the ending away so I'll just describe the scenes I liked in Transformers: Dark of the Moon.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked was when the assassin robot named Laserbeak kills Jerry Wang (Ken Jeong). Laserbeak throws Jerry out of an office building window. As Jerry is falling he falls right by a window that Bruce Bezos (John Malkovich) is looking out of. Bruce immediately heads for Sam Witwicky and tells him that he won't mention anything that he may have seen in the men's room. (Don't ask, just watch.) Moments later Laserbeak, who had transformed into a photocopier, transforms and starts attacking humans. Laserbeak is specifically looking to either kill or capture Sam. But Sam escapes.<br/><br/>The next scene I liked was when Sam attempts to save Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) from being captured by the Decepticons. Unfortunately, it is not known by NEST, Sam or Optimus Prime, that Sentinel Prime had joined the Decepticons. The line he uses is ""You simply fail to understand, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" I couldn't figure out where I had heard that line before, then I thought of who said it. Leonard Nimoy said that exact line, well not the ""You Simply fail to understand,"" part, but the rest, in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Don't you love when they recycle lines like that, especially making the actor who said it nearly 30 year before say it again?<br/><br/>The rest of my favorites are when Sam, Lennox (Josh Duhamel), Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and several others infiltrate Chicago. They are trying to stop Sentinel from bringing Cybertron to Earth, basically turning Earth into their new Cybertron. There is a scene where Sam, Epps and several others are in a sky-scrapper that has been partially knocked over, that is a pretty cool scene.<br/><br/>All I have to say about all three of these movies, and the new set of movies Michael Bay is putting together with a different main cast, is if you can't find something about these movies to like, then you might not be the Science Fiction, Action or Transformers fan you think you are. Not saying you to be any or all three to like these movies, but it helps. Hell you could be a fan of CGI and get something out of this movie you like.<br/><br/>I give this 10 out of 10."
"brando647","7","5","7","27 March 2012"," A Major Improvement Over FALLEN
","REVENGE OF THE FALLEN was an abomination. Seriously, it was crap. I was a fan of the first TRANFORMERS movie, but the second was almost enough for me to write off the series completely. Now, I understood that there was a lot of behind-the-scenes trouble during the second movie's development/production, so when the time came that the third movie, DARK OF THE MOON, was to be released I could barely muster any interest. I almost passed on it, but I enjoyed the first movie enough and the reviews coming out claiming that the third film was actually decent blockbuster fodder convinced me to give it a shot. I did, and I'm happy to say that it was a lot better than I expected. Not good enough to rank as one of the best movies of 2011, but fun enough that I haven't totally given up hope on the franchise (because let's be honest, this series isn't done yetnot while it keeps making bank at the box office). In this movie, it's explained that America's sudden eagerness to reach the moon during the 60's space race was the result of a mysterious craft's crash landing. The first men to walk on the moon discovered a Cybertronian secret that would remain buried for decades. In present day, Optimus Prime and the Autobots are angered to discover that the humans have been keeping this secret from them and demand access to the craft and it's contents. We discover that the craft is the Ark, a ship sent from Cybertron during the war containing a secret to ensure the continuing survival of the Cybertronian race.<br/><br/>For starters, I should mention that the story in this movie is actually coherent. It's amazing how much better things turn out when your writers aren't on strike. The plot is pretty slim (though I love the premise: integrating man's first landing on the moon with the Transformers canon), but that's to be expected in a movie where the big interest is the visuals. If there's one thing that can be counted on in a Transformers movie, it's that the CG will be spectacular. They've had three movies to perfect these effects, so yeah, they're pretty awesome. Quick complaint about the CG: the computer-generated JFK. It sucked and stuck out horribly. The Transformers themselves look great and the action is seamless and intense. The battles in this movie are done a lot better than in the previous movie because you can actually see what is going on. With that said, I've got to saythe fights in this movie are pretty brutal. I was surprised. I mean, the whole series is based on a collection of children's toys and a cartoon. When the Transformers fight in this movie, robots are being dismembered. ""Blood"" is spurting. Death gurgles. Heads ripped off and even a ""spine"" being ripped out. Seriously, you replace the robots with humans in this movie and you've got a hard-R rated action film. I'm not complaining, I'm justwow. A bit out of place but pretty cool nonetheless.<br/><br/>There's a lot of action in this movie. The last 45 minutes in the movie is a non-stop action sequence as Sam and the Autobots infiltrate a Decepticon-devastated Chicago. But, unlike the overlong action ending in REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, this one entertains. The majority of the regular cast returns here: Shia LeBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, etc. Even Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) get some screen time, though mercifully less than in the second movie. The only one missing is Megan Fox. Oh well. Her character was nothing more than eye candy in both of the first movies so, plot-wise, she won't be missed. Nope, director Michael Bay merely replaced her with a different piece of eye candy, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. A Victoria's Secret model, Rosie's acting history is limited. But that's OK, because the only thing this character needs to do in Michael Bay's Transformer movies is look good in slow motion and show off the goods when necessary. And that's all she does. Mission accomplished? Speaking of Michael Bay, I guess he's had a good run with the Transformers series but, in my opinion, it's time for him to let go. Let another director have a chance to bring these larger-than-life robots to the big screen. He's done well (ok, except for FALLEN) but his shtick is getting stale. His obsession with the military is becoming overbearing in these movies. I get it, he likes the armed forces and has some friends inside that let him use the cool stuff. But I didn't come to this movie to see Bay's military toys, I came to watch giant robots kick each other's butts. Enough, man. I also think the character of Sam Witwicky has run his course. Let him remain as a supporting character in future films, but pass the torch to a new leading man. New director, new characters, more robots. Time for an overhaul. Well, time will tell where this series will go in the future (and there's already a release date scheduled for a fourth film). On the bright side, DARK OF THE MOON was fun enough that I'm willing to see another in theaters. If you were a fan of the first movie, then DARK OF THE MOON probably won't disappoint you."

","It's similar to the other Transformers film in scope and quality, with everything we've come to expect from a Michael Bay film. Explosion should get credit in the cast section, as it probably gets more screen time and audio than anything else in this film. Where to even begin? To be fair, the 3d is very good, and some of the action scenes look very good. It doesn't save the film.<br/><br/>1) Continuiwhatty?: The premise of the film basically ignores the previous plot involving the All Spark. I mean, the really real reason we have Megatron going to Earth is to get the Autobot super weapon to enslave mankind, not the Allspark? Why? In a side by side MacGuffin comparison, the Allspark is so much more important than the Columns to restoring Cybertron, it's barely a comparison. Yet somehow, we are supposed to believe he was really coming to Earth to meet up with Nimoy-bot to enslave mankind. I believe, originally, they had no idea humans were even here.<br/><br/>2)Nonsense Plot: Maybe the new movie will manage to create something deeper with it's plot by ignoring the other films?<br/><br/>*Spoiler Time* So, basic premise- we started the space race and went to the moon to get a UFO. Already, this makes no sense. Why didn't the scientific community, who does a lot more stargazing than the government, detect the quite obvious comet and blip on the moon at some point after the mission was announced? Why didn't we go back to get it once discovered? While there were only supposedly 35 people who knew of this plot, it's just about impossible to believe when you consider all the other scientific organizations around the world who must stay silent and ignorant for such a thing to stay secret. In detail, they used radar dishes from an organization that wasn't created until after the space race to detect the UFO. This puts things on a weak foot to start with.<br/><br/>3) Focus on one dimensional Human characters: Sam has problems. Harped on by his parents for not finding a job three months after graduation from an Ivy league school, while he lives with his super model from Britain. Oh the shame! For some reason, despite being Ivy league, having a presidential medal, etc., he's a bumbling fool in his interviews, and in general. How did he make it through school being this inadequate at basic human functions? Later, he seem to use his Ivy League parkour to dodge and run like a freak through more 3d mayhem! While a great deal of time is spent establishing how much he loves his new model in this movie, I don't really buy it- not because of acting, just because it all feels rushed.<br/><br/>Really, to just skip play by play, there is, once again, excessive focus on people. To be honest, I have to give Michael Bay props on his creativity, because he finds lots of places to avoid having robot on robot conflict. Autobots get captured by Decepticons off screen so we can watch more army guys fighting robots. Long scenes of this, in fact. I think Michael Bay realizes he'll never get this kind of budget again and tried to stick every crazy paramilitary stunt he could into this thing just so he got a chance to do it. Some of it is very pretty though- unfortunately feel very out of place in this movie.<br/><br/>Then there's the stupidity of mankind working with the Decepticons- apparently, smart enough to make energon detectors to warn of decepticon attack, not smart enough to realize the evil robots that have attempted to wipe us out TWICE are just going to do it again. The Autobots then leave us to our doom for a full day, letting the Decepticons murder thousands to show that the Decepticons could not be trusted and so they could get them.<br/><br/>4) We Get It: The Autobots fight terrorists while waiting for Decepticons. The Decepticons double cross humanity when they 'negotiate'. Optimus Prime says freedom enough in this movie so many times I swore he was being secretly piloted by George Bush. Terrorists bad! No negotiate! USA! USA! Agenda pushed. Honestly, the original Decepticons were evil royalty, militaristic vehicles, despots with purple color scheme, versus the working man Autobots, with the red color scheme and all the social service civilian vehicles like firetrucks and such. Corrupt Royalty/Military vs. The Working Man. It wasn't terrorists versus USA. That was GI Joe.<br/><br/>All in All: All flash. It's not a good plot, sub par dialog, and the robot action is set aside to see explosions and people. Coming to the end of the film, I felt so little investment the 'mind blowing' action fell flat- people were in danger but their situation, it's context, how little I felt for them, I simply felt as if I were just being forced to wait through the action to get back to something that almost mattered. Right to the end, I just couldn't care. I am sad I funded future films from this director by seeing it."
"zabullock","2","27","56","12 July 2011"," Why did I fall into this trap... again!
","When I saw a preview for the first Transformers I rolled my eyes and could believe someone would be stupid enough to make a movie about that cartoon, but after huge praise and endless hype i had to go see it. And when i did, i was blown away. It is still today one of my favorite movies. Then they came out with the second one and I tried my hardest not to go see it, but one of my friends made me go and it is one of my least favorite movies. So when they made a third one I really didn't want to see it, but people said it was a ""crowd pleaser"" and it was a more ""dark"" movie and I mistakenly went to see it. The movie had no plot, mellow dramatic action, annoying characters, failed attempts at comedy, and bad acting to top it all off. Nothing in this movie made sense and that school girl excitement you got when the Autobots got ready to fight in the first one turns to ""when am i still watching this movie. at points I stopped watching the movie and admiring the wallpaper. This movie sucked and was total let down, thank you Michael Bay for wasting my time yet again."

I absolutely loved the beginning! the whole moon story was actually brilliant.<br/><br/>So I am baffled as to why this never got at least a 7 average rating but hey such is life and people are weird but please trust me you WILL enjoy this movie and if you don't then there is something wrong with you!"
"sephev","4","8","13","27 July 2012"," What's all the fuss about?
","You know what? I get this film. I get what Michael Bay aims for these films. He doesn't make emotional or deep movies. He makes action-packed blockbusters. This is what, I think, people have forgotten about the director. This film, unfortunately, doesn't try anything fresh for the franchise - it is still the same ""end of the world"" plot with a couple of plot twists here and there. The characters don't really develop at all - Sam is still looking for something he hasn't figured out yet (in this case, a job); Megan Fox, now out of the picture, has been replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, who is still there to stare at when the plot gets dull, although does well in her first big film; Sam's mother and father are irritating as ever; Optimus is dramatic and always arrives at exactly the right moment. This doesn't make Dark of the Moon a bad film, it just doesn't take the franchise in any great leap whatsoever. It provides a fairly fast paced, action packed movie with awesome special effects and incredible set pieces - probably better to wait until it drops in price and pick it up then."

If you want more logic in the plot, more realism, see something that has more of those things. But don't waste your time reading others' criticisms of this or any other movie.

"liluh-237-727727","7","6","9","14 March 2012"," Not as good as 1 part, but better but the 2nd
","There has been a lot of discussions about this movie so I will try to keep it short.<br/><br/>I will first describe what I didn't like in the movie, and then move on to the good parts and things I liked.<br/><br/>First of all - lovely Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. She is gorgeous, but she can't play. At least she didn't in this movie. I bet she tried, but what we have is just horrible, and there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Shia Lebeouf's to the point I couldn't actually believe that Witwicky digs her character. It really bothered me throughout the movie. I mean, we have Turturro who overdoes his part but for one I'm fond of him, and two - he does that deliberately and winks to the audience while doing it. I understand that, it's just an action-figure movie. Yet what Rosie delivers is dramatic, and would be in anything more than, let's say, a Brazilian TV soap opera.<br/><br/>Sigh. Alright, let's move forward. I'll just point out that the story, while making more sense than in the previous part, is still rather so - so. While everything is fine with the dark side of the moon and the general core of the plot, there are little inconsequences and simply daft scenario cuts that make it, at times, just disturbing to watch (whole issue of government handling the situation, Malkovic and Jeong characters). Not to mention we are lead by the hand throughout whole movie so while there are some major twists - you just can't be surprised when they finally happen.<br/><br/>So what's good? As always - humor and visuals. I mean the battle at second part of the movie is truly epic. The mega-mecha-worm cutting through buildings, the air scenes with skydivers, dang, those are some really creative effects that were never tried before in any other action movie, and they are top quality too.<br/><br/>So why rate it so high? 7/10.<br/><br/>C'mon, it's a movie about giant robots! Let's not expect too much from it."
"kcboo","8","6","9","21 February 2012"," I actually enjoyed it!
","This movie (Compared to the other Transformers films) Is quite enjoyable. The story line is a lot more interesting and fun to watch, the acting is quite fair, yet to be honest, they really should have this rated a little higher then PG-13. This movie takes a large turn from a movie that kids can enjoy and a movie that Adults can enjoy as well, sense this change is so evident, the acting is quite a lot better from the previous films. And if you wonder what i mean by the movies ""Adult Turn"" For instance, the amount of times people say ""Shit"" in this movie is quite high, honestly i could care less on what they say but still. There is also a scene where John Malkovich blatantly says ""Fucking Awesome"" I know these moments sometimes add a sense of humor to a dull moment but still, you have anywhere for 6-13 year old's in the audience. As for my review. Animation, 8/10, it was quite well done, some scenes look kinda odd but i can easily look around that when robots start ripping each others heads out. For Acting, 8/10, the acting from shia is still pretty good, and in this movie he's a little more free to actually act unlike in the other films, overall the acting of this movie was good. For Story line, 9/10, When you have Giant robots beating the hell out of each other and blowing stuff up, you don't really need a story line, it just has to be entertaining, yet Transformers Dark of the Moon manages to be entertaining in fights scenes while still holding a solid story line. My over all review of the movie is a 8/10, while it is entertaining, there are times where i find a scene dragging on a bit long, besides that this film is Highly watchable and i WILL be watching it again soon."
"hannah-wildbanana","7","6","9","12 February 2012"," Its pretty good, but a bit flat
","I was a bit skeptical of this movie because of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley being the lead female role, but I was surprised that she actually did a good job! I thought it was good, the plot was a bit flat at times but I liked the characters and character development throughout the movie. I liked the visual effects but that wasn't the whole movie as some reviewers said, there is good dialog and it shows humans for about the same amount of time as transformers. I thought that plot wise, the second movie is better but the visual effects on this one took the cake. I think they should end the transformers series here, if they make another one they are going to drag it out, this movie was stretching it a bit much. Its going to turn redundant soon."
"jjf662001","Null","7","11","18 July 2011"," Transformers : Dark side of the Moon
","So who is with me and giving up on listing to some of these so called critics who bash our comic book movies? I say if you're a fan of the transformers show or any other comic book film franchise stand up for it and let your voice be heard. This sci –fi adventure transformers : dark side of the moon stars Shia Labeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington –Whiteley, and PatrickDempsey.It's directed by Michael Bay and runs 157 minutes.<br/><br/>Going into this film i was hoping it would better then revenge of the fallen and it went way beyond that this film was a home run. The Transformers : Dark side of the Moon centers around the autobots learning about a cybertronian spaceship that crashed landed on the moon during the war on cybetron between the Autobots and Decepticons, this space ship holds a secret that could have help the Autobots defeat the decepticons.The secret is held inside an accent autobot leader Sentinel prime who crashed on the moon and prompted the space race of 1969 between the USA and Russia.Sam's life picks up after transformers 2 living in Washington DC trying to find a job after graduating from college living with his new girlfriend Carly(Rosie Huntington –whitely).Megan fox and victories' secrets model Sam is one luck guy.<br/><br/>This secret brings SAM (ladies man 261) witwicky back into the fold of the war among the auto bots and decepticons. While working at new job he meets a co worker jerry Wang (ken jeong) who has inside info to the spaceship that crashed on the moon and knew Sam had connections to the auto bots. He gives this information to Sam in an awkward but funny bathroom scene wrestling around in a bathroom stall. When on the way to give this info the CIA, which is headed up by Charlotte mearing (Frances Mcdormand) Sam is attacked by the decepticons at every turn.Sam realizes after some digging what the plan actually is and all hell breaks loose. It's all starts with his girlfriend Carly being kidnapped by her slimy boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who happens to be an allies of the decepticons and helping them get the secret from the crashed spaceship on the moon.<br/><br/>You know regardless of what people think of all the special effects being used nowadays this is one film where it is necessary to explaining the story and bring the characters to life. Michael bay did an outstanding job of bringing this final chapter to life from the battles between the auto bots vs.decepticons to the attack on the CIA facility, and the attack on Chicago and everything in between.<br/><br/>If you're expecting any Oscar worthy performances here you went to the film and wasted your money. This is a typical sci- fi action adventure lot of explosions gun fire, buildings collapsing, and aliens. He did a good job adding some new faces to the franchise; it didn't interfere with telling the story at all. Ken Jeong (the hangover) John Malkovich (red) added just the right amount of humor as Sam's co worker, and lunatic boss.Frances Mcdormand felt like she was there all along from the beginning and what can you say about Rosie Huntington –whiteley she made me forget about Megan what's here name.<br/><br/>If this indeed is the final chapter in this wildly successful franchise you can say it really went out with bang. It didn't disappoint one bit from beginning to end. I give Transformers: Dark side of the Moon 7out of 10 stars for putting a great product on the big screen."
"mr_shya","1","21","43","5 July 2011"," I thought, Michael Bay apologized for part 2...
","I don't always review films, but when I do, it's either because the movie is great, or it really sucks! Which one do you think it is?<br/><br/>I thought Michael Bay apologized for the second movie, but still he didn't seem to have learned anything. The annoying parents were still there (although I have to give him credit for keeping their screen-time to a minimum) And although he put some well-achieved actors in this movie (John Voigt saved Transformers 1, in my opinion), both John Malcovich and Frances McDormand are both redundant for the plot (if there was anything like a plot) and also had pretty ridiculous roles.<br/><br/>And yeah, you have to give the movie some credit for the special effects, but now really think about it!<br/><br/>...Were there any amazing scenes apart from those in the trailer? I don't think so. Optimus slashing some Decepticons, Building falling down with protagonists in it, City of Chicago under a large-scale attack of spaceships... all in the trailer...<br/><br/>And now some more points that make the movie the terrible piece of cinematic pulp it is:<br/><br/>-product placement (yeah, all computers are lenovo, I get it)<br/><br/>-soundtrack (some nice pieces from the first one but anything new? anyway,what has become of linkin park?)<br/><br/>-non-existing jokes (at some points you feel you were supposed to laugh, but couldn't really find anything funny... just weird)<br/><br/>-what the fudge did the Chinese guy from hangover do there?"

The whole purpose of that animated slide show is to feed up your senses with a surrealistic flood of non-stop stimulations for your eyes and ears and to paralyze your brain with a nonsense story so that you can sit out this war against niveau.<br/><br/>Honestly, where would Michael Bay be without a decent CGI department with a decent budget? Could you imagine the same movie with the same plot and actors would have been made with low-grade FX: winner of the razzie award in all categories! Same with all Bay-movies for sure!<br/><br/>I guess sooner or later, the audience will get Bay-fatigue. And a good script will always work without 3D glasses and THX-Sound.

"Min111","Null","2","2","7 February 2020"," A very good third movie
","This was a very good movie - a very enjoyable one. Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the third entrant of the Transformers series, and was a successful one. The battle still continues between the Autobots and Decepticons in this third movie. My favourite member each are Optimus Prime and Megatron - both being leaders of their respective groups/factions. I also like Starscream, and I always think he would make a good replacement for Megatron as leader. This movie was most certainly better than the last one (Revenge of the Fallen), and the most interesting thing about Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the story itself. I really liked the start of the movie particularly - it looked good and serious. The music was wonderful right the way throughout. It was still good to see Shia LaBeouf playing Sam Witwicky in this movie, and that was important because he was in the previous movies. This movie makes up what is known as a trilogy despite more movies which followed afterwards, and a good trilogy Transformers rightfully is. There was so much action to be found in this movie, and the action starts fairly soon. Though the action was good, it would've been better had it started later because the story for this movie was interesting to listen to. Overdoing the action is a bad thing, and this is what this movie has done even though it's a Transformers movie."
"darrobaldacchino-03922","10","2","2","5 February 2020"," My favourite Transformers film and one of my alltime favourite films! A MUST WATCH!!
","Now ... to start off this review, I know millions of people give these movies a bunch of crap, which is undeserved in my opinion, but I personally love them for many reasons which are:<br/><br/>1.) The Action.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things that this franchise and this film specifically has to offer is the fact that they are all action-packed rides! Not only is the action insanely entertaining, but it is also very well-made with outstanding special effects. With that being said let's move on to the next reason.<br/><br/>2.) The CGI.<br/><br/>Although these movies get a lot of hate, no one can deny the fact that they have outstanding CGI, making the movie even better than it already is.<br/><br/>3.) The plot.<br/><br/>Now ... one of the supposedly main issues of these movies is the plot. I can admit that they are not phenominal stories but they are surely funa as hell. Basically the story is that the Decepticons (the bad guys) come to earth to enslave the humans in order to rebuild Cybertron (ther Transformer's planet). WHAT IS NOT TO ENJOY ABOUT THAT! Personally I love it. And also, with the movie's runtime being of 2 hours and 34 minutes, the story gets to flow perfectly as it has time to breathe thanks to the runtime.<br/><br/>4.) The score.<br/><br/>Personally, my favourite aspect of this movie is the music, and I have to say, I have to hand it to Steve Jablonsky. He has created some of the best music in a film known to man making the emotion in this movie even more believable. Beautifully perfected music!!<br/><br/>5.) The emotion.<br/><br/>Finally what make this movie so much more amazing and satisfactory is the level of emotion crafted in the scenes. **SPOILERS**. There is a scene where the Autobots (the good guys) are held hostage and are about to be killed by the Decepticons, the first victim being Que/Wheeljack. The next victim was going to be the one and only, my favourite transformer, Bumblebee, until he is saved by a sabotaged spacecraft. In this scene I was about to cry when I saw Bumblebee make eye contact with Sam Witwicky whispering to him ""We gave him a hell of a run..."" before almost being killed ... almost.<br/><br/>Conclusively all I have to say about this masterpiece is that it is an amazingly well-crafted movie with great special effects and story. People reading this review, ignore the haters and give this movie a chance. I'm sure you'll enjoy it!<br/><br/>Thank you and have a great day!"

As a sequel to Revenge of the Fallen, this is a massive jump forward, but not a classic by any means. This is entertaining and has some fun introducing the space race.

Too much time is wasted on Sam trying to get a job. There's no place for crap like that in a movie of this stature. This, together with the silliness, added to the unnecessary long running time and ruined the excitement during the first hour.<br/><br/>Once the film reached the hour-mark, it literally is a non-stop full throttle fast-packed action-paced thrill ride. The visuals and effects are out of this world! It just proves again how well the film industry evolved. I know its all CGI but it looks incredible on film! Blending CGI with real life actors is still a challenge, but Michael Bay seems to have perfected that with his Transformer series. He has such a vast imagination!<br/><br/>John Malkovich is a brilliant actor but he honestly was dispensable in this film and there really wasn't room for his wittiness and cocky attitude. The visuals certainly steals the show. I will remember this film for the toppling building scene. Wow, that was awesome!!

"Floated2","6","2","2","22 May 2018"," An Improvement over Revenge of the Fallen
","Having not watched this film at the time of its release, and watching the fourth and fifth installment starring Mark Wahlberg before Dark of the Moon, one can see as to why the entire franchise has changed. Dark of the Moon is relatively decent with some entertainment and in comparison to the films with Wahlberg, this one is better. Shia LeBeouf portrays his character better in these films than what we have seen from Mark Wahlberg, as his character and the storylines seem to make more sense.<br/><br/>As a film, this does start off decent but becomes tiresome at some points and drags on heavy as these films tend to do. The visuals are there but overall, the film film is still quite messy and the plot becomes distant to its special effects.<br/><br/>Megan Fox's replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is decent as her role doesn't require much but is quite odd how the film doesn't mention how her and Shia's character came about. Though, it is what is expected. Dark of the Moon even with its flaws is easily better than Revenge of the Fallen as that was far more messy, too much overload of action with a lesser plot. <br/><br/>In this film it settles down somewhat as there is more drama, more heart and at least concise.

","I'm not the sort of person who enjoys mindless action, for example I wasn't a fan of the 4th movie, but I sure can appreciate a good action movie when I see one.<br/><br/>This movie was fantastic, great acting from certain actors, fantastic soundtrack, absolutely world class cgi and a notable storyline. Sometimes you get those movies that make you feel something and I can tell you that when the movie ended after Optimus Prime's monologue and the music kicked in, I was just sitting there with a huge dumb smile on my face. <br/><br/>However as a review, I will have to give some negative feedback as all movies do have their weak points.<br/><br/>Rosie Huntington Whitley's role should have gone to someone with more acting experience as, for example, some of her acting killed the tension of certain moments.<br/><br/>They belittled some Transformers by killing them off in ways which made my inner nerd angry, e.g. Starscream, Shockwave, Soundwave and Wheeljack. <br/><br/>Wheeljack really was shown incorrectly in the movie, more as a bumbling scientist who begged for his life than a badass. <br/><br/>Shockwave should have really had more of a prominent role, or they should have held off using such a big character until maybe another movie e.g. Bumblebee's reported spin off movie.<br/><br/>The plot line after really thinking about it is quite bad - the transformers wanted to teleport their home planet to earth so that humans can rebuild it? Was a bit weak. <br/><br/>Regardless, don't let these criticisms blind you from the truth - TF3 was the best TF out of all 4 that have come out as of time of writing (hopefully ""The last knight (2017) will prove me wrong). It really is a fantastic movie. 8.8/10"

","A decent movie from the Transformers franchise.<br/><br/>Dark of the Moon has a fairly dark plot, involving the seeming total invasion and enslavement of Earth, and the apparent exile of the Autobots. There is also an 'ememy from within' subplot that's delivered well.<br/><br/>What I dislike about these Transformer movies is that they take themselves too seriously. The transformers are portrayed as serious defenders of humanity. The fact that they are cars that turn into robots makes this seem a bit absurd. I do also find the transformers hard to engage with as characters.<br/><br/>They'd be better off embracing the absurdity and making the movies much more flashy, joyous and funny."

That is question we have when we go to see Transformers 3. Answer, bad. really bad. Really, mind-numbingly horrid. So bad you think, does Micheal Bay hate us? Yes. Yes he does. And now he has our money. Damn it. <br/><br/>He makes Optimus into a jerk. He has no understanding of basic plot or character development. He likes to spend time filming girl's butts hoping it will distract the teenage boys from understanding anything else in the movie. The editor should have been shot after the first screening. And where the hell did all those Decepticons come from on the moon? It was an Autobot ship! The Decepticons shot it down! And then they tell you that everyone on the ship was allied with the Decepticons. Then why the hell did they shoot it down! And again, where the hell did the Decepticons come from!

With a little work on the script and animation, it would have had much broader appeal, but the result is a movie aimed only at teen-aged boys, which is actually offensive to other demographics. The jokes were stupid and crass, and the themes too childish for someone of LeBeouf's age and maturity. Presumably the inclusion of good-quality actors was to make it seem they would present good characters, but I suspect that after they saw the script, it was only good pay that kept them at work on the production.

The newcomer in Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is an abysmal performance and can't really see her hitting Hollywood movies, she should stick to the modelling.<br/><br/>As for the 3D aspect, I only saw in 2D so don't know how impressive that is but a couple of action scenes are visually stunning but thats it's only positive.<br/><br/>So I'd give the film probably a 1 out of 10, couple of good action scenes, hardly any story to it and terrible acting Performances. Another shocker from Michael Bay."
"IllusionOfLife","8","19","39","29 June 2011"," Exceeded My Expectations
","To say my expectations going into Transformers: Dark of the Moon were low would be a tremendous understatement. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was so embarrassingly bad I could hardly fathom it; but I ended up going to the new movie against my better judgement, primarily because I wanted to see the trailer for Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol up on the big screen (which did not disappoint by the way, Brad Bird's live action debut looks amazing). To my surprise, though, Dark of the Moon was not terrible, and all things considered was actually pretty good. <br/><br/>So when it comes to critiquing a Michael Bay film, you can't really treat it like anything else. There's a certain level of expectation that comes with one of his movies, and that involves a lot of explosions, and not a lot of plot. And when it comes to explosions, giant robots, and epic action sequences, this movie does not disappoint, however, for a Michael Bay film, Dark of the Moon is surprisingly talky and I'm still not sure whether or not that's a good thing. The first two acts of the film contain relatively few big action set pieces, and mostly attempts to set the stage for everything that happens in the film's final act. On one hand I appreciate that this film actually attempts to tell a story rather than Revenge of the Fallen's method of ""look, here's robots fighting in China for no reason! Ooh, and now they're fighting in Egypt for no reason!"" but on the other hand the film kind of drags at times in the first two acts because none of the characters are particularly compelling. Normally I would not criticize a film for spending more time on story and characters than on eye candy, and I do commend the filmmakers for telling a coherent story this time around, but they could have easily trimmed some time from the first two acts and focused more on the battle for Earth between the Autobots and Decepticons. <br/><br/>When we finally do get to the good stuff in the final act, the action and the scale is certainly epic, but parts of it feel hollow. What we're seeing is cool, but none of it carries any weight; what should be a rousing finale to a series rings a bit flat because there was not a proper build up to it. Yes, this movie spent a long time setting up the finale, and they did it as well as they could, but for the kind of impact they were clearly going for the series needs to build up to it from the get go. This is my biggest problem with the film, it's not the shallow characters, the massive plot holes, or the annoying comic relief characters; those are all par for the course with a movie like this. My biggest complaint is that Transformers did not have the ambition or the foresight to build any sort of arc into the trilogy. Almost nothing from the first two films has any impact on the events of this film (the second film is particularly overlooked). This does not feel like Transformers 3, it feels like Transformers: Yeah, We Did Another One. When you make a trilogy like this, it's essential to have a narrative that ties them together. The reason Return of the King is so powerful as a conclusion because the rest of The Lord of the Rings builds up to it, the same goes for the Star Wars trilogy, even the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy creates an arc for its story and its characters so that the ending feels like the culmination of everything, not just another ending of another movie. In my opinion, that is the biggest area where Transformers: Dark of the Moon fails, that it does not build on any established narrative, but instead goes in an entirely new direction and therefore feels less satisfying than it could have. Again, though, this is Michael Bay's Transformers, so to expect that kind of foresight to go into it is a bit silly. So let's shift gears and focus on some things I did like. <br/><br/>This movie, has far less embarrassingly juvenile humor than either of the previous films (THANK GOD!). Oh, there's still some in there, but we don't have anything as facepalm worthy as masturbation jokes, Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro, Mudflap and Skids, or ""I'm underneath the enemy's...scrotum."" Outside of the juvenile humor though, there are some things are actually legitimately funny John Malkovich has a fun, albeit brief, role in the film, and Shia LeBeouf has some great interaction with a character played by Patrick Dempsey. I was also impressed that there were one or two plot twists in this film that actually managed to surprise me. It was nothing super heady, but the script was at least intelligent enough to keep you on your toes, even if just a little bit. And of course the visual effects work by ILM was amazing, and is a shoe-in for the VFX Oscar this year.<br/><br/>So all in all Transformers: Dark of the Moon was an enjoyable film. It vastly exceeded my expectations based on what we got with the last film, and while not as satisfying as it could have been still had plenty of cool action sequences and fun moments. If you liked the first Transformers at all I would recommend it, if not, than this isn't going to change your opinion on the series at all. <br/><br/>B-"

It takes almost an hour to get into the film as the first hour is filled is nonsense action scenes and petty jokes out in for cheap laughs. One the action kicks in the pace of film is halted by more explosions and more slow-mo action shots of an attractive model ( i stress the word model as she is not actress, she can barely deliver a line sincerely). The predictability of the film was also a horror as every time something that might happen which will make the film interesting gets put into slow motion and is cut off by a loud bang of a friendly conveniently there to save them.

","First I would like to say; the CG in this movie are top-notch! I visited the IMAX 3D version today and the visuals were absolutely stunning. For anyone who is enthusiastic about graphics, this is a must see.<br/><br/>At least, for the first 30 or 60 minutes. I did not see this movie expecting any depth in the story or brilliant acting - but Transformers 3 seems to be a compilation of every bad cliché to attempt getting the viewer to connect to the characters. The reason this fails, at least for me, is that you will see everything coming from miles away. The movie will not skip a chance to throw a US flag in your face.<br/><br/>This movie will work fine for you if you're into hot chicks, hot cars, explosive action, American heroism and not very attentive of details. As soon as you start trying to ""read"" the scenery, the sequence of action and especially the plausibility of everything that happens, you will find that the suspension of disbelief is broken every two minutes.<br/><br/>I'm rating it a 4 because although I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics, everything else in this movie made me want to get up and leave halfway. I sat through it to the end and realised: ""I would have enjoyed this much more if it didn't intend to be a story."""
"MastaKat74","1","12","23","4 July 2011"," I can no longer defend Michael Bay
","If you follow Michael Bay's career you can see an obveious bell curve. Every movie he's made since Pearl Harbor he's has less and less fan's and more and more haters. I used to defend him saying people just don't get his style. At the time I thought that his only crap movie was ""The Island"" (Pearl Harbor was the writers fault, not his.......that's what I said then).<br/><br/>So now there's the Transformers Trilogy (which was packaged and wrapped to go so fast that I don't even think their was a script for parts 2 and 3).<br/><br/>Transformers (B-) Not a bad film considering he had to make a storyline based on toys that are cars and trucks that turn into robots. There were PROS and CONS, but in the end I give him the nod for making a solid flick. Now you would think MB would take the PROS and cut the CONS for his sequel........you would think.<br/><br/>Trandformers ROTF: (F) WTF, I don't even think there was a script for this movie. MB just walked around filming things and making it up as he went along. Why was there a terminator in a transformers movie? etc, PURE GARBAGE. So you would think after this monstrosity of a filmmaking abortion that MB would humble himself and really put effort into making the 3rd film the best.......again you would think Transformers DOTM: (D+) I wanted to leave before the movie was an hour into it. The flick had NO direction. It was all over the place quickly introducing characters and then taking them away never giving any explanation to what was really going on. The plot was like a super ball bouncing all over the walls. We're here, now we're there, this guy, then that girl blah blah blah. The movie couldn't decide if it was serious or a comedy. Why did MB make Megatron such a punk in parts 2 and 3? Why does Shiah LuBuff kill Starscream with a knife (or whatever)? This movie makes NO SENSE. Who are all these random Decpticons that get introduced then killed 5 minutes later. Christ, the CARTOON gave more background into the characters then this movie did. How did Bumblebee get captured at the end? Literally how? One second he saves Sam and is in car form. Then 2 minutes later, and with no explanation, he's in robot form as a prisoner of the Decepticons. WTF. Michael Bay has NO respect for an intelligent audience. So unless you are a 12 year old boy then you KNOW this movie sucks.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that this movie will make a zillion dollars. Michael Bay will never understand that this happened only because Transformers has a BUILT IN AUDIENCE. I could have directed this movie and put up those numbers financially. So the problem will not be corrected, Michael Bay will say ""Well it make a zillion dollars, I must be doing good!"" And studio producers will think the same thing.<br/><br/>The Dark Knight, Iron Man, Terminator 2, District 9. All movies that have a far fetched premise, but they were done in a grounded/realistic way that makes them KICKA$$.<br/><br/>Does anybody know where Michael Bay lives?

"hell81007","3","21","45","1 July 2011"," Do electric sheep dream of Michael Bay?
","Watching a Michael Bay movie is like sleeping with a prostitute. There's that rush of adrenaline, the heart beats become faster, the pulse quickens and all your thoughts converge into making the most out of what lies in front of you, be it a naked body or bare knuckle metal. And while the act in itself, however long it may last, may very well be an apotheosis of pleasure, it will definitely be one of those acts which, once it's over, you'd desperately want to sweep under the rug or stash it away in a closet hoping that its skeletons don't tumble out years later the way Bill Clinton's did. And soon after finishing the act, you realize that you have a wife, seven months pregnant with your 2nd child, and a 5-year old kid to whom you are the Batman, Superman, Ironman and all other imaginary super heroes out there rolled into one. The screws of guilt start turning and tightening, leaving you conscience – stricken about the dastardly act that you just committed. That is exactly how you feel when the closing credits starting rolling after completion of a Michael Bay movie. All the excitement, the adrenaline, the eagerness that was there before the movie started snowballs into one gigantic sphere of guilt as the end nears, leaving you flummoxed as to why you went to see the movie in the first place.<br/><br/>It has been four years now that Michael Bay has been running a prostitution racket in all its metal glory. We know that racket as Transformers. And just like failure to contain one's carnal desires has led to flourishing of prostitution, Bay's metallic monstrosities, bereft of any emotion or storyline, have drawn audiences from all over the world if only to find out whether a robot's testicles are square or round. Almost every Bay movie has raked in substantial amount of moolah at the Box Office, resulting in rapid proliferation his racket and fueling his desire to find innovative ways to assault people's senses with every imaginable metal monstrosity. As if it wasn't enough, this time he has gone a step further and added an extra dimension thus launching the attack from all the three dimensions leaving us feel like a mosquito that has been squashed over and over again with a sledge hammer. Bay's movies are destined for two things 1) being lambasted by critics 2) striking gold at box office. Dark of the Moon will be no different. <br/><br/>I don't know for sure whether androids dream of electric sheep or not. But that Michael Bay is wet dream of every metal part that moves is unadulterated four-dimensional truth. The tagline of Bay's latest instalment is 'Earth's last stand'. How long an ordeal do the earth's population of 6 billion+ will have to undergo before they get the see the tagline 'Bay's last movie'??"

","Let me get something straight, I like movies which contain a good storyline, unpredictable plot twists, memorable dialogues and well executed direction and acting. And to be frank this movie had none of those. It was just a showcase of high- tech, expensive but pointlessly executed special effects filled with extremely boring clichés, petty thrills and cheap attempts to draw big crowds. Movies like this might be considered by some people as 'entertaining' but where is the class in it?<br/><br/>The acting is just awful, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was used as an eye candy but nothing else. Shia Lebeouf did what he did in the first two movies , bored us to death. His character is flat as usual and the acting was disappointing to say the least.<br/><br/>Now, coming to the context of the plot , there are no twists, no adrenaline-rushing action scenes, no depth in the storyline. The only thing that might be considered even remotely close to ""good"" in this huge mess is the work done by the special effects team. They managed to make some of the scenes pretty believable and realistic. And finally, how on earth did the writers manage to create plot holes in this rather simple plot? I mean how can machines survive for years in a metal corrosive surface like that of the moon? There were also other plot holes which I spotted but I'd have to spoil the story to point them out. Anyway, with due respect to Michael Bay and all who were involved in the making of this film, I'd like to request them to change their extremely commercial approach to filmmaking and create movies by thinking out of the box like Quentin Tarantino and especially Christopher Nolan."

","I'm fine with brainless action movies, as long as they entertain in some way, like with a fun romp or a tense chase. But this movie fails to entertain, it has no drive, no story, and no spark. Even the effects scenes, while technically well done, somehow don't add much. They rarely amaze, and there's little sense of grandeur, its all too busy, too much smoke and flying bits, and too tedious.<br/><br/>The characters are lifeless, we don't know anything about them, and they have no motivations. They hit their marks but nothing more, like set dressing, just enough presence to allow positioning the effects around them. And star actors are sprinkled throughout, but their characters are not at all essential to the minimal story. They seem to have been added at the last moment, maybe for some needed interest, but its little help.<br/><br/>The story is a pieced together mess, with numerous nonsensical leaps, and characters that suddenly appear when needed, though never seen before. Too much time is spent on story lines that have no relevance, like the job hunting, or all the bickering. Characters are sometimes bizarre in ways that are slapstick, and this stands out as interesting, though with no connection to anything.<br/><br/>This movie is listed as Sci-Fi, ideally an exploration of ideas, of what could be. But no ideas are evident here, and nothing is explored. In the first Transformers movie we got to see some of that, but not in this one. Instead we have goofy little sidekick robots, and giant evil robots that apparently have limitless amounts of power and energy at their disposal, enough to physically destroy cities or move their home planet to earth, though for some reason they need us earthlings to act as slave labor.<br/><br/>There were a few fun parts in the whole thing, like the historical revisionism, or when people are in a building that's being toppled over, or a few oddball laughs here and there. And the 3D was better than in many recent movies.<br/><br/>It might help if this movie were half as long, literally, to chop out all the empty filler, though it wouldn't help much. But at least there wouldn't be that painful ""I love you"" scene near the end. Heck, just edit out the girlfriend all together. Like the movie, she's pretty, but pretty much useless."

In it, Megatron marches to the Lincoln Memorial and blasts Abe to pieces. He sits on his new throne while two smaller robots gnaw away at Lincoln's severed head. This image serves as a haunting symbol of the fact that the entire human race will soon be enslaved, their freedom and dignity taken away from them. God, this movie sucked. <br/><br/>I could stand Megan Fox, John Turturro in a thong, and the takeover of the Smithsonian Air Museum with a couple of tasers. As bad as ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is, I can stand it. Even enjoy it. It's a decent popcorn flick. That being said, I found it easier to eat popcorn during Precious than this cinematic train wreck.<br/><br/>The third installment in Paramount's billion-dollar franchise finds Sam Witwicky in search of a job. He's saved the world twice, been given a medal by the president, graduated from an Ivy League school, and dated really hot girls. Regardless, he still can't get a job outside of the mail room. In the midst of this, he discovers that the malevolent Decepticons are out to take over the world again. The logistics and intricate details of their plan aren't important. Just know that the plan involves an exhaustive barrage of slow motion, explosions, running, and screaming. <br/><br/>Michael Bay's never really been known for his storytelling, but he can make movies flow at an even enough pace. This movie jumps around faster than a bunny rabbit on crack, explains nothing at all and assumes we care about characters who are about as interesting as bird droppings on a telephone pole. Appearances by the likes of Ken Jeong, Stephen Merchant, John Malkovich and Frances McDormand aren't as much welcomed as they are unnecessary. The humor present in previous installments, which at times was cringe-inducing, has all been vanished, replaced instead by an extremely morbid, depressing tone. It's not even exciting. <br/><br/>To be fair, the movie is a technological wonderland. The CGI is effectively placed in the film, the sound design is excellent, and the 3D is actually worth the price. Shia LaBeouf is always fun to watch, and I was actually able to stand new girlfriend Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley. <br/><br/>Despite its achievements on the technological front, the movie is still a mess. The final, incredibly long battle to save the human race will leave you more exhausted than exhilarated. Oh, and the movie's about 157 minutes too long."

Unfortunately, Michael Bay has made a film about on par with his last trainwreck Transformers movie, and this, like this last movie is a thoroughly dumb and unenjoyable sensory overload full of poorly thought out plot points, dumb dialogue in this sort of surreal fantasy world where everyone is as goofy as can be.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is living in a nice apartment with his new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and needs some action in his life. He gets a new job, and is almost killed, and meanwhile Optimus Prime makes a trip to the moon to gain pillars and to bring back his old friend Sentinel Prime. Meanwhile again, Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) is Carly's boss, and Sam is jealous. And then Megatron and the Decepticons take over Chicago. And then there's action. And then it ends (thank God).<br/><br/>Transformers 2 must have been too serious for people, because Michael Bay just had the actors go all out slapstick performances. It was like an unfunny reproduction of the Three Stooges or something. Comedic scenes are comedic only because of these cartoon like performances where everyone is a comedian, and nobody seems to care about impending danger, but instead just want to lighten the mood with their nightclub routines. The first hour of the movie is so silly and lightweight, it literally serves no purpose whatsoever. <br/><br/>No scenes had any effect on the next scenes. Shia Labeouf is almost killed, and this scene is followed by a 5 minute speech about love with his parents. Chicago is destroyed by Decepticons, and immediately following we see people casually walking through destroyed Chicago like they're going for a stroll before work or something. An entire sub-plot about Sam getting a job is completely dropped, and serves no point in the movie except to introduce these bizarrely eccentric characters and give the audience some very dumb yuk- yuks. A bizarre scene has Russians pulling guns on Sam and John Turturro, and it literally is just there for laughs. It's so over the top, and cloying for cheap laughs, it's almost pathetic, and again, has no impact on anything. In fact, this entire movie could have been scrapped, and the big battle at the end could have basically been the film, because really that's all that mattered in the ""plot"".<br/><br/>Character motivations are way off too. Patrick Dempsey wants the Decepticons to win, because he was promised he will be saved, and not killed by them. He knows that their plot is to enslave humans, and he also admits a dislike for Megatron. When the Autobots come, Dempsey goes and tattles to the Decepticons. So...does he want to be a slave? Not tattling would have had no repercussion on him, and actually could cause him not to be a slave. Also making no sense is Patrick Dempsey's henchmen and workers who stay loyal to him in the face of total annihilation. As the robots destroy Chicago and kill people, they stay guarding Carly like this job is of some importance. Humans are being enslaved and they are taking some meaningless job when they should be running for their dear life. Again, it's like no characters think through anything that happens. <br/><br/>The Transformers are hard to watch. They walk around with English, New York, Italian and other accents and why? Are they from these places or just made to be exactly like Earth people? Megatron's henchmen robots are like Igor from Frankenstein, and one of them even has this giant rag on their head to make them seem like a lowly servant, but why? Why would a robot wear this? Did they see people doing this in clichéd sci fi movies? And to top that off, the robots know all the cool Earth slang and speak in it, and the little robots seem to have high libidos. The only purpose for them being so anthropomorphic is to get the audience to laugh at their lame one-liners, and they come off as horrible clichés. <br/><br/>This is a movie that is pandering to it's audience through bottom of the barrel dumb comedy, big loud action scenes and a nonexistent plot. But it's terribleness goes beyond that. It's a movie where even the most idiotic of individuals in the audience has more brains in their head than any of the characters, and nobody thinks through any situation, and no decisions make any sort of logical sense. It's a series of unnecessary events that leads to an overlong finale that is more headache inducing than fun. This might be a tiny bit better than Transformers 2, but the two movies are close to being on par. If you just think about any aspect of the film, you will realize nothing makes any sense. This was just awful!<br/><br/>My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 153 mins. PG-13 for violence and language."

","Picking up where the previous one left of this one starts with several transformers living on earth, more or less at peace with human civilisation. This all changes when an old government secret is uncovered. From there on things start to get nasty and the world once again needs to be saved by the Megatron and his metallic friends.<br/><br/>After seeing the second one I wasn't expecting too much of this one. Where the first one had a story and a decent amount of CGI the second one had no story and nothing but CGI. For some reason I was thinking this one couldn't be worse than that second one. But alas, it is.<br/><br/>On the one side it offers what is to be expected - explosions and fire, and lots and lots of action sequences. On the other side it offers the return of some of the older characters - and a shipload of new ones. Now that wouldn't be too bad - if only they would fit in the story and would do what they were supposed to do. What I found more than mildly irritating for instance was the fact that the Sam Witwicky character had to start all over when it comes to trust from the government agencies.<br/><br/>Add to that that at least one character was hopelessly miscast - Patrick Dempsey does not belong in this film, at least not in the role he plays, it doesn't suit him at all and it shows in the way it comes to the screen.<br/><br/>Then it seems they tried to save the film by applying the old trick of opening a can of known actors/actresses in the hopes they can turn lead into gold. The trick never worked and it doesn't work in this one. What's Frances McDormand doing in this film? She can do a lot better. The same for John Malkovich. John Turturro is about the only big name that I can like in this film - but that's because he has a long history of odd little roles and the one he has in this film suits.<br/><br/>Last but surely not least, the 3D. This can be described by asking one question: What 3D? There's next to none and where it is visible it doesn't add anything.<br/><br/>So, all in all, an utter waste of celluloid.<br/><br/>2 out of 10 robots no longer disguised"

","After watching the 2nd Transformers i expected it to be somewhat boring. Well I was wrong, this movie was beyond boring! Let's start with the worst part of the movie, Rosie whatever-her-name is. She makes Megan Fox seem like a great actress. I actually missed her! All Rosie does throughout the whole movie is prance around in tight little white dresses wearing no undergarments with the camera zooming in on her butt, breast and lips. Her face always looks the same, with her heavily botoxed lips always open and ready to give someone some mouth action...Perhaps that's how she got this acting gig! PLEASE DO NOT GET ANOTHER ACTING ROLE AGAIN! <br/><br/>The action was drawn out boooring! It was as fun as watching ants come out of an anthill. If you are into this kind of stuff then you will certainly find this movie amusing.<br/><br/>It was not very realistic. Not that these kinds of movies have to be but come on! They rolled down a skyscraper with shattered glass falling behind them and they didn't even break a bone or have a cut for that matter. And lets not forget that Rosie's clothes are intact and her makeup is picture ready throughout the whole battle. She was even wearing stilettos the whole time.<br/><br/>Before I finish let me say this, You will have to tie me up to the theater chair at gunpoint if you want me to watch another Transformers movie again!"
"aaronjbong","8","11","22","29 June 2011"," ""Dark of the Moon"" is the Real ""Transformers"" Film!
","The first ""Transformers"" was an enjoyable experience back in 2007. Even though it wasn't great, it was still a great experience watching the film. But the second one back in 2009 had a considerable drop in terms of quality from the first film. Even Michael Bay accepted the fact that ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was a sequel with a precipitous drop in terms of quality from the first film. Then ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was announced with Bay promising that it would be a good film. And yet, it is. ""Dark of the Moon"" is a significant improvement from ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and is absolutely the best installment of the franchise.<br/><br/>As its predecessors, ""Dark of the Moon"" has a mediocre plot. As mediocre it is, this is how it goes. Back when Apollo 11 landed, Neil Armstrong and crew were given a top secret mission to investigate a Cybertronian spacecraft that had crash landed on the Moon years ago. They discover several robots and kept the operation secret for a long time. Later, the Autobots and Decepticons learn of its existence and race to get it which can lead into two results; if the Autobots get it, the world is saved, if the Decepticons obtain it, humans will be enslaved and Earth will be used as the base to rebuilding Cybertron which would result in the destruction of most of Earth.<br/><br/>""Dark of the Moon"" will take us deeper into the origins of Cybertron. This third installment will include much more robots, and most of them are much cooler than what's already in the previous two films. One takes the form of a Ferrari, one's some sort of professor, one's a gigantic snake-like form driller that's around ten times the size of Optimus Prime, one's super ancient, and there's much more. These robots take the action to new levels and will get our hearts racing so fast like never before. <br/><br/>The acting, however was normal. Shia LaBeouf was great in portraying the role of Sam Witwicky. The others were also okay. But newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley seems to have a lack of experience in acting. But anyways, the result here is what you get for casting a new actress who's new to the world of acting, and for one who's new to acting, it's not that bad. <br/><br/>The script was kind of awkward though. There were some scenes that were confusing and made me lose track of where the film is heading. Sometimes, these convoluted scenes force the characters to say strange things and I found it really annoying. <br/><br/>""Dark of the Moon"" loses points in the shifting of scenes. Sometimes, they make the film look awkward and not really enjoyable as it could be. Here's an example (no spoilers): Optimus Prime talks about something very serious that relates to the fate of the whole world INTO Sam finding a job with humor. Definitely ironic. <br/><br/>But besides all those, ""Dark of the Moon"" is definitely a fun ride to experience. The climax of the film takes up almost an hour and is definitely satisfying. The huge and dangerous robots compliment to the thrill levels of the fight scenes. The fight scenes are super awesome!<br/><br/>The 3D in this film was acceptable, although it wasn't exceptional. Depth was sometimes conspicuous, though. But at other times, the robots and the explosions were out of the screen. But definitely, the scene which had the most amazing 3D effects were when the title showed up during the beginning of the film. That was amazing! <br/><br/>The special effects in one word: amazing! There's no need to complain about that. The robots, the explosions, the fires, were simply amazing. But what was shocking, and funny, was how they used CGI to create the face of John F. Kennedy during one short scene. The face was clearly different from the others' faces. But good try though. <br/><br/>Through halfway of the film, expect some reminders of disaster films such as ""2012"" as well as ""Terminator Salvation"". But what amuses me in these scenes are: where are all the people. I mean, it was only a few minutes after the destruction of the world began, and the terrified people only started running away. But then, minutes later, millions of people started to vanish and barely any person was there. <br/><br/>But anyways, that doesn't matter. ""Dark of the Moon"" is satisfying. <br/><br/>To wrap things up, ""Dark of the Moon"" is simply a great film and definitely worth watching. I know ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was a bummer but ""Dark of the Moon"" will replace that horror. 3D is not a bad choice to watch this film. I truly recommend watching this film. But remember, don't get the expectations too high. If you do so, you'll be really disappointed with this film. <br/><br/>Michael Bay's promise is fulfilled. ""Dark of the Moon"" delivers. It is absolutely the real ""Transformers"" film we've been waiting since 2007. <br/><br/>Prince AJB's Rating: 8/10 (Great)<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review on ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". I do hope that this review is useful for you to read."
"ivo_shandor","1","5","8","2 June 2013"," Toss it into the dark side of the moon...
","This movie isn't very good either. The opening is just hilarious because NASA automatically thinks that the ship crashing is a UFO? How do they know that? What if it's a meteor? Did you read the script ahead of time? Shia is also one of the most annoying actors working today. He's a stuttering annoying teenager in every movie. That's not acting...He has the worst scene in the movie, when his car is smashed, he starts screaming at the top of his lungs. It's the single most annoying moment I've ever seen in a movie. Another scene is when John Turturro and his assistant are in the Russian bar and then they have a Mexican standoff for no reason, only because Michael Bay uses it in all his films. Turturro then speaks the worst fake accent I've ever heard in a movie. It's just embarrassing on the astounding level of filmmaking of Michael Bay, pre-school humor and explosions.<br/><br/>The level of stupidity in this movie astounds me. First off, how did the Russians get ahold of Transformer technology? They never got to the moon. Did the Americans just give it to them? This was the Cold War, that would never happen.<br/><br/>We were tricked with this movie as well...We were told the main villain would be Shockwave. Lie...Megatron is the semi-villain while Sentinel Prime is the villain. That's another false advertisement for the movie. Shockwave only has one line in the movie...one line...and he's defeated by a parachute...a 10-foot tall robot is defeated by a sheet...embarrassing.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime in the end, throws an axe into Megatron's face and then kills him. Prime would never do that, it destroys his character as a moral leader, never killing his main enemy. And he does it for no apparent reason, only Bay killing the franchise.<br/><br/>There is only one good scene in the movie, when the building collapses. Bay's sense of humor is just dirt level, unintelligent and he just shoves as much stuff on screen as possible."

","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third installment in the highly-lucrative franchise. Regarding whether this film is any good or not, my title for this post says it all. This movie is very similar to the first two films except the visuals and effects are even more over-the-top which I didn't know they could do. I happened to like this film because this is my kind of movie. I enjoyed the two and a half hours of explosions and more battles between the Autobots and Decepticons.<br/><br/>In this film, Sam Witwicky returns as the hero who saved the world except he can't find a job. He has a girlfriend that is not Megan Fox. He gets caught up in these robot fights again when the Autobots are betrayed by one of their own and the Decepticons are intent on destroying Earth by moving Cybertron, their home world to Earth.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good with one exception. Shia LaBeouf is pretty good because you know what to expect out of him. John Turturro is solid and as usual, brings more comedy to the film. I liked the additions of Frances McDormand and John Malkovich's charm because they are two wonderful actors. I didn't like the new chick because she just seemed phony and pathetic. I wish they brought back Megan Fox because she can act a little bit.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film with impressive visual effects even thought it sort of lacks a plot. I didn't mind that because I wanted to see cool fights and extreme visuals. That is exactly what I got. I love these kind of movies because they are perfect examples of summer popcorn films. I don't know how they did the visual effects for the last hour of the film, but they were impressive. I rate this film 8/10."

","The best so far, action all the way and a CGI eye candy. I especially liked the first minutes of Dark Of The Moon because they used real footage from the moon landing and the who and why suddenly Russians and Americans wanted to go to the moon, because there was something on the other side, the dark side of the moon.<br/><br/>I was happy that the stupid humor from Revenge Of The Fallen (2009) was left out of this flick. And the voices of the robots that annoyed me in Revenge didn't annoy me here somehow.<br/><br/>Also have a look how Megan Fox was finished in this flick due a few sentences and if you listen closely yo can spot that Michael Bay finished her off. Out Megan Fox and out was her career. The new comer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly the new love of Sam (Shia LaBeouf). Shia performed excellent again, Rosie was just in it for her body and legs. Alos on board was John Malkovich (Bruce), always nice to see him but his new teeth made me watch that in stead of the flick itself. I would also like to mention John Turturro as Simmons, he's so funny.<br/><br/>The effects are again extremely well done. The start of this flick and Buzz Aldrin being involved made it all more believable. <br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5"

It had 2 things going for it.<br/><br/>1) the 3D was great because it wasn't all about things popping out of the screen. It created good depth and was always present but not in a bothersome way.<br/><br/>2) some good special effects - the snakey bot was cool, and the long fight at the end was good, but ....<br/><br/>by then I was so bored by the bad dialog and plot that I didn't care. The supermodel chose unemployed Sam over rich, famous, good looking CEO. Right. The entire sub plot involving John Malkovich didn't need to be in the movie.

Sentinel Prime, voiced by Leonard Nimoy did get to repeat some lines from Mr. Spock. That was a cool homage.<br/><br/>3rd good thing - Sam's parents.

"3xHCCH","4","14","30","3 July 2011"," An Overlong Metallic Mess of a Movie
","I did not exactly enjoy this movie. I went in with no big expectations, simply more of the same as the first two films. I could not really believe how much more of a mess this was, compared to the previous two. <br/><br/>The story was actually very simple. A senior Autobot named Sentinel Prime resorts to traitorous means in order to achieve his dream of reviving their dead planet Cybertron. Can the Autobots here on Earth avert the mayhem which result from Sentinel's evil scheme? I'm pretty sure you know the answer to that question.<br/><br/>I call this movie a mess because it really looks and sounds very messy. Like before, you can barely identify which transformer is which, be it Autobot or Decepticon because of extremely close and fast action shots. Everything looks like a noisy blur of metal across the screen. I'm thankful I did not watch it in 3D or it would have just tripled the eyesore. The ONLY character (robot or otherwise) who meant anything above all this mess is Optimus Prime. He breathes life to this movie every time he is on screen. <br/><br/>The human characters are really not needed in this story at all. I do not know why people feel it is cool to act this annoyingly over the top and loudmouthed. Everyone resorts to this acting style - from Shia LeBeouf to John Turturro to Frances McDormand to Patrick Dempsey. Megan Fox's replacement, the beautiful Ms. Rosie Huntington- Whiteley was an oasis amidst the chaos but that is it. The funny lines uttered by Sam's mother remain to be my favorite lines in the whole film.<br/><br/>I felt there were simply a lot of useless and indulgent scenes. This caused the film to bloat up to a tedious two and half hour running time. While the Apollo 11 moon scenes were an interesting beginning, the rest of the movie simply collapses after the title card."
"Cupidvogel","3","24","57","28 June 2011"," Transformers: Dark side of human intellect
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon does put me in some dilemma. To call it a movie would be gross injustice, for it is anything but, it is a sad, raucous, empty 150 minute flick that tricks you into yawning insufferably. To call it a bad movie would be no less an injustice, as it would give the bad movies a bad name. So if we agree to call it Thing, I should say that it is one terrible Thing.It is easily the worst Thing of the decade, and keeping in mind that this very decade has seen movies like its prequel, Pirates of the Caribbean IV, Twilight saga, this is saying something. There is no story, none at all. It is a pathetic excuse for a movie. The last hour is peppered with loud cacophonous dumb action, where, for all it matters, every robot is hitting every robot, and it becomes tiresome to figure which ones are the good ones, and frankly speaking, you would hardly care. The acting is pedestrian, a fine actor like John Malkovich is reduced to an absolute mockery, Shia LaBeouf, who was moderately tolerable in the first two installments, spends the first half screaming like hell, and the second half deciding whether to scream or not, and his parents, as usual, are poor comical add-ons and make you cringe. Every alternate minute, people turn up sporting a national top-secret, making you wonder since when has the US Govt started dishing out state secrets to common people. John Turturro appears out of nowhere, and bosses his way in and out of CIA, NASA, whenever he pleases, wherever he wishes, and he seems to have an awful number of people at his command, even though he is supposed to sit home sipping lemonade, as he was stripped of his power in part II. <br/><br/>Surprises abound, still. As if the entire US army has gone to Tahiti for snorkeling, only a dozen of people are left in Chicago to defend the city, as the future of the world lies in balance. Thousands and thousands of spaceships materialize from thin air, and instead of attacking the rest of the world, which would have been much easier, given they don't have Autobots to protect them, attack poor old Chicago, and keeps on attacking it only. Actors find time to exchange romantic truisms in the midst of the war, even when a missile is cruising towards them. A clichéd word of wisdom is enough to turn one Decepticon against another, that too when the latter is about to kill an Autobot.<br/><br/>The dialogs are so inane and trite, that one might strongly suspect whether there was any script at all. The action is stale and raucous, an unending pain-in-the-ass litany of gunshots and missile blasts, a motley influence of too many Fast and the Furious movies, and it's time that directors understand that having the latest CGI graphics and special effects at their disposal and cramming them in any possible combination does NOT a good action film make. Perhaps they will never understand. Perhaps that is why the Spielbergs and Camerons will always belong to an elusive class.<br/><br/>And of course a review of the Thing would be incomplete without a mention of its lead ""actress"" Rosie Huntington Whiteley. Yes, you heard it right, she does make Megan Fox's acting look like Ingrid Bergman's! She happens to be the latest addition to a slew of models who have made a foray into acting, trying to parlay their success as a model into celluloid. She looks reasonably tolerable when she keeps mum, and indeed looks hot in progressively lesser and lesser amount of attire, but the moment she opens her mouth the entire effect is ruined, and an already poor scene is made even worse. Not only does she sound dumb, her trying to buy off the audience with daredevil clothes, as if her 'hotness' can buy her a purchase on acting skills, cannot but appear condescending, and after some time, quite tiring. It's high time that directors (and most importantly the models themselves) understand that acting and modelling are mutually exclusive sets, and excelling in the former doesn't necessarily make her good (or even tolerable) in the latter, so that we, the audience, are spared some horribly wooden acting. Amen."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","3","4","30 December 2012"," A little better than 2009's sequel
","So many changes, so little progress. As the conclusion to the Transformers trilogy, this second sequel was better than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but not everything was tweaked as tight as it should have been. There were changes and there weren't. As stated before in my last two reviews of this franchise, there are three components that have stayed the same for these three films. These three components are the music, action and special effects.<br/><br/>The music, still composed by Steve Jablonsky; good work. The action; still big, loud and bold. The special effects; still cool to watch robots transform and fight. Not much to be said because that kind of stuff has been standardized now. The autobots and decepticons are still voiced by their respective voice-actors. One decepticon I found really cool was Shockwave. A real robot I don't think anyone would want to mess with. Here are the changes and for the most part they are positive things. <br/><br/>First, Megan Fox has been replaced with Victoria's Secret model, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who plays Sam Witwicky's new main squeeze, Carly. It's not that I find her bad at acting but she doesn't cut out being a tomboy like character as Megan Fox made out in the first two. Plus, Carly's clothing ceases to get dirty throughout the whole running time of the film. Oh and let's not forget that she runs around in high-heels.<br/><br/>The next piece to change was the tone of this sequel. For once, the film crew heard what fans and audiences wanted and they followed up on it. Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) actually has less of a comedic feel. People will actually be killed on screen. It won't be blood and guts but the audience will actually see them die. Also the two loud- mouthed autobots were removed from the story as well. Thank you for listening Ehren Kruger.<br/><br/>However, I am still frustrated over the fact that Kruger did give Simmons (John Turturro) a larger than needed role and still gave Shia LaBeouf's role the lines, ""You scream here, here, here and..."". I'm done with the runaround. I don't know how others who tolerate it can sit through it and say that's good acting. It's noise. The explosions are more fun to listen to than that.<br/><br/>The second transformers sequel has some improvements over its previous follow up but it still lacks the greatness of the first."

I have seen this film with two other people and we three have taken naps along the never-ending story of 154 minutes running time. <br/><br/>The awful story is ridiculous and the characters are imbecile and inconsistent. The hero Shia LaBeouf has the face of an idiot, is a simple filing clerk in an office and out of the blue, he is the savior of mankind in a total absurd. His girlfriend with Botox in the lips is a decorative character and may be a great model, but her acting is limited to make faces and mouths and nothing else.<br/><br/>The excessive use of stereotypes and exacerbated patriotism is also irritating. A film can not be limited to special effects only; otherwise it is unbearable to be watched. My vote is two.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Transformers: O Lado Oculto da Lua"" (""Transformers: The Dark Side of the Moon"")"
"the_way_maker","6","13","28","30 June 2011"," You tried Mr Bay, and you failed.
","I am, without question, a huge transformers fan since childhood. The home i share with my wife is filled with original die-cast metal transformers toys made in the 80's which i display proudly in my home. I have spent large sums of money to get the items i want and countless hours learning about each transformers character and history. <br/><br/>In short, i am a transformers purist. This means i want any movie that depicts my childhood heroes to be true to their original characters and soul. This is a bias i must point out so that you the reader understand where i come from in writing this. <br/><br/>Michael Bay has come under sharp criticism for how he directed the first two films. It was widely accepted before the third was released, that the original was far superior than the second. Now it is time to explore what Michael Bay did well and not so well in the third. <br/><br/>WHAT IT DOES WELL. The films action sequences are superb. One of these scenes in particular is worth the price of admission alone where a number of autobots seek to protect another while driving at high speed on a freeway. More specifically, it is bumblebee's attempt to do battle with passengers on board that is an absolutely magnificent sequence that gave me similar thrills to those i experienced when i saw the car chase sequence in the second Matrix film. To give you an idea, I consider that scene in the Matrix to be one of the best car chase action sequences ever. If you enjoy action films then this movie is a must. <br/><br/>Michael Bay does his best to bring some maturity to the plot .There are twists that genuinely add to the drama and draw real surprise and anger (towards the characters) from the viewer - these moments alone allow the film to stand head and shoulders above the second transformers film. The brutality of battle is not censored and the very real sight of human casualties is a welcome realism that was missing in the last two films. <br/><br/>The film definitely has its comedic moments. John Malkovich has a welcome and underused role and the banter between Bumblebee and Witwicky is not heard often enough. There was a clear decision to give a less prominent role to Sam Witwicky's parents and i actually believe this was a mistake. Going against the grain i actually found his mother's role and edgy insanity to be funny in the first two films. Regardless, the film managed to have the audience laughing at times more so than the last 2 films. <br/><br/>WHERE IT FALLS DOWN The acting is cringeworthy. As i exited the theatre i overheard one woman say to her friend ""would you like some cheese with that?"" and her cynical question nailed it on the head. The film utilises a cliché'd romance between its main star and his sweetheart to motivate many of his actions and it does not work. Their scripted lines are stale and lack any type of edge. More importantly, the Transformers themselves always had enough on their own to sustain a plot. These are machines with souls and the original characters had failings just like humans - these imperfections made them interesting. We do not see it in these Transformers films and the insertion of a romance plus its lack of credible dialogue means we miss out on a big part of the folklore that makes this franchise great. <br/><br/>The film does not make a genuine effort to be true to the original transformers. To name but a few let me provide examples: <br/><br/><ul><li>Megatron as a vehicle. To any transformers fan, this is almost unthinkable. Even more maddening is that his being a vehicle is not important to the films plot. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Perhaps the most iconic Transformers voice (after Optimus Prime) of Soundwave is not only unlike the original voice, it does not stand out from the other Decepticon voices.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This is a criticism of all the films, but do we really believe an advanced Robot race would come to planet earth and have accents as well as metallic beards as they get older? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The killing off, so quickly, of some of the very original and most important Transformer characters. We saw it in the first film with Jazz and we see it again in this film. </li></ul><br/><br/>OVERALL Transformers 3 is an action extravaganza worth seeing for the wonderful sequence of battles and use of CGI. The acting, as with the first two is average-to-poor but this film is a genuine improvement on the second and is on-par with the first. For those with little concern for the Transformers history and mythology this is likely to satisfy but one thing is for sure, Michael Bay has failed to satisfy the hardcore fans in his attempt to bring the Transformers to modern day cinema."

"KnightsofNi11","2","19","45","29 June 2011"," Crap piled on crap, piled on crap, piled on crap
","Somebody please institutionalize Michael Bay. The first Transformers was a weak action film with some redeeming qualities. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was a ridiculous and over the top mess and now we've arrived at Transformers: Dark of the Moon which at this point is just sad. This is a pathetic excuse for an action blockbuster that makes a mockery of everything action films stand for. In the latest bulbous growth to the series follows the Autobots when they find a Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon. The Autobots must save the world again as they keep the Decepticons from utilizing the spacecraft for a worldwide takeover.<br/><br/>There isn't really much more to say about the plot because it might as well be nonexistent. In its place we find the most convoluted action scenes full of a painful and redundant amount of explosions and robots throwing crap at each other. There is a scene here and there that I might be able to stomach calling a little cool or kinda neat, but this film mainly succeeds in convincing me that giant fighting robots can actually be really boring. I never thought I could muster up so much hate for so much action. But there is a certain point when all cinematic skill and finesse goes out the window and it is nothing more than an attempt to see how many explosions can be allowed in one two and a half hour film. There is no aesthetic quality to the action. It is as far from stylish or sophisticated as it can possibly be and is nothing more than an idiotic mess. I don't remember the last time I wanted a film to end as badly as I did during the last 45 minutes of endless stupidity that was the final battle of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.<br/><br/>This film basically breaks down as follows. 60 percent action. 30 percent stupid jokes that do so incredibly little for the plot and aren't all that funny. 5 percent childish romance between the two obnoxious leads. And finally, 5 percent story. After Michael Bay snorts twelve lines of coke and crams his idiotic mess of a film full of as many explosions possible he says to himself, ""Oh right! I have to put a story in here somewhere! Well I can't have it take up too much time so I'll have to just have the characters explain things as blatantly and flatly as possible so that I have more time to thrown in explosions and stupid jokes that don't really belong here, but who cares! I'm Michael Bay I can do whatever the hell I want! And that includes making my movie two and a half hours long!"" And what a painful two and a half hours it was. If only Bay's heart had stopped after that whole spiel and I would be in a better place right now.<br/><br/>This film reminds me why the art of filmmaking is so under-appreciated. It is because some ""filmmakers"" manage to produce steaming piles of crap like this movie. Every moment of this film is a mess. I chuckled maybe once and never did I feel I was witnessing something intense, awesome, or even fun. I wanted this movie to end and when the credits finally began to role a huge wave of relief came over me. This film is exactly how not to make a film. It is boring, stupid, paced horribly, and just put together so horribly and so crudely. In all its glamour and grandiose special effects you would think the film would be more polished than this turd is, but it is just such a piece of garbage that feels like it was thrown together by someone who has never made a film in their life. It is dreadful on a whole new level. However, there is one thing going for this film. I'm going to go see a lot more films this year as we're only half way through. A lot of them will surely be crap but now, when I see a bad film I can at least find some optimism by telling myself, ""At least it wasn't as bad as Transformers: Dark of the Moon."""
"Chalice_Of_Evil","6","12","26","30 June 2011"," One word away from being a Pink Floyd album...
","You know how you see a movie and enjoy it, then they go and make needless sequels to it? That's how the Transformers franchise has been. The original was surprisingly good. It had a nice balance of comedy, action and actual *story*. The sequel - like with most sequels - was just a bigger (but not better) version of the original. It was over-long and ultimately rather pointless...but at least I somewhat enjoyed that one. As not-great as the last film was, it's still better than this new one. Why? Well, for starters, Dark of the Moon is just more of the same. If you've seen the first two films (or even just the first film), then you'll have basically seen it all. There's nothing new to be found here. There's a whole lot of CGI robots fighting and explosions...and a whole lot of nothing else. The few actual good aspects that the last film had going for it aren't to be found anywhere here.<br/><br/>The cast is more or less a waste. Shia LaBeouf, who I'd previously found likable as Sam Witwicky, is rather annoying this time around. He's his usual fast-talking self, but it appears that he's of the mind ""When it doubt...yell a lot and it'll be REALLY FUNNY!""...except it's not. Lots of the attempts at 'humour' in this film fall well and truly flat, which is a shame given that the first movie had an actual good dose of humour to it. Those who aren't fans of Megan Fox may well come to appreciate her presence in the previous two films, as this time she's been replaced by Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. If you thought Fox was bad, Huntington-Whiteley makes her look Oscar-worthy in comparison. We only get two throw-away lines about Fox's character Mikaela from the previous films, but at least we learn she dumped Sam (which makes sense) and not the other way around. This new Carly person that Sam is with does nothing but stand there with her distracting lips and show off her legs. Seriously, her legs deserve more credit than the rest of her, as they are showcased at every chance. Our introduction to her character? The requisite bum shot, of course. Say what you will about Megan Fox, but I always thought she and Shia LaBeouf at least made a good team. I couldn't care less about Carly and the fact that Dylan (Patrick Dempsey - who's gone from McDreamy in Grey's Anatomy to McSleazy in this) attempts to steal her away from Sam. As the human villain of the piece, Dempsey is pretty average. We didn't even get the satisfaction of a clear demise for his character in the end.<br/><br/>Josh Duhamel as Lennox and John Turturro as Simmons both return but don't really have a lot to do. Having even less of a point are new characters such as John Malkovich's weirdo boss at the new place Sam works, and Frances McDormand as Mearing - filling Turturro's role from the first film as someone for Sam to spar with. These two new people really don't add a whole lot and appear to be made 'quirky' just for the sake of it. And if you thought Sam's parents were annoying, wait until you meet Jerry Wang (Ken Jeong) - who I didn't understand the point of nor what he was on about half the time. About the only new character I did think was half decent was Dutch, played by Firefly's Alan Tudyk. He's quite memorable.<br/><br/>As to the 'stars' of the film - the Autobots and Decepticons...well, what can really be said? They transform and kick each other's butts a lot. Sadly, we lose Ironhide partway through and yet no one seems to really care/acknowledge it, which sucks (as he, Optimus and Bumblebee were the only Transformers we ever really got a chance to know). Though the Decepticons don't fare any better. Megatron, Starscream and everybody else apparently meet their makers (which is better than them getting away yet again, I guess). New good-bot-turned-bad, Sentinel Prime, is rather average despite Leonard Nimoy voicing him. Still, he's better than the extremely irritating Autobots called Wheelie and (ironically) Brains.<br/><br/>After endless fights and explosions, there's still the 'end' to have to sit through, which seems to go on FOREVER. Just when you think it's over, it keeps going. And it's not even that memorable. At least the last film had Devastator. What's this one have? Some big giant robotic worm thing that wraps itself around buildings crushing them, apparently. Though some humans do get zapped to bits, so there's that. And at least Sam doesn't go to Transformer Heaven in this one. However, you're left pondering ""How can robots have hair??"". One thing I *did* like was near the end, when Megatron is trying to weasel his way out of having Optimus kick his arse but Optimus is having none of it and proceeds to get Megatron back for what he did to him in the last film.<br/><br/>You know it's not good when you're waiting for a film to end and it just doesn't want to. When the credits finally do come up, it's a massive relief. In the end, this film - like a lot of sequels - is pretty pointless. Michael Bay does what he does best - directs mindless chaotic action, and if you like that sort of thing then you'll probably enjoy this. But if you're expecting something great, or even really good...then prepare to be disappointed. It's like when you see a really good film, then see a lacklustre first sequel to it and think ""The next one can't possibly be worse...right?"", but then it *is*. I'm just glad I didn't see this thing in 3D, as it would have caused twice the headache and eye pain as the regular 2D version that I saw did."
"brettrnz","10","10","21","28 June 2011"," Best movie ever made
","Just seen the premiere in IMAX 3D and Michael Bay has nailed it. After two fairly good transformers movies he has delivered the crème de la crème. This masterpiece had all you could want and more. A sensational plot (not gonna spoil it for the rest of you) bringing together more of the side characters, countless action, many emotional moments and times of laughter, and the 3D made James Cameron's Avatar look like something made by a 6th grader. Also The much criticized Rosie Huntington-Whitely greatly surpassed expectations and left me thinking Megan who?. This film is amazing and must be seen even if you are not the biggest Transformers fan. 10/10. Heres fingers tightly crossed that Michael changes his mind and comes back for a few more. Would love to see what he could do with the Unicron story and Megatron's reincarnation Galvatron."

","First of all, I'm not a big fan of Transformers. I loved the toys when I was a kid, rarely watched the cartoon show, thought the first movie by michael bay was okay, but the second was completely stupid.<br/><br/>With that in mind I went to the cinema expecting to see another childish wanna be cool action film like the second one (Why the f**k does a transformer need genitals???) But I have to say with all honesty the third on was pretty cool. The effects were great (as always) the last hour is just ONE BIG WAR (I don't count that as a spoiler since i wont tell you who's winning, but take a guess ;) ) the camera shots were pretty good and actually for me thats all that counts for a good transformers movie.<br/><br/>Of course the story is stupid and the characters are completely forgettable, but come on who walks into transformers expecting a high class script? I went to the movie to see explosions, cool fights between robots and maybe a nice (pretty hot) new Megan Fox, and thats exactly what I got.<br/><br/>So for all those who can ignore a story full of plot holes and forgettable characters (eventhough I like ShiaLaBeouf) and just want to see some nice heavy action robot fights you sure won't be disappointed"

"RichardSRussell-1","3","13","30","28 June 2011"," Not As Egregiously Awful As #2, Merely Bad
","Transformers [3]: Dark of the Moon (2:34, PG-13, 3-D) — SF, biggie, sequel<br/><br/>I have the same attitude toward Autobots vs. Decepticons that I do toward vampires vs. werewolves, rats vs. cockroaches, and Baathists vs. Al-Qaeda, namely I hope you all die! Kill each other off, but please do it quickly, quietly, and far far away from here. Unfortunately, in Transformers 3 they take forever (over 2.5 hours), it's noisy, it's in a theater near you, and there are still some left standing when it's all over.<br/><br/>The original Transformers wasn't all bad; I gave it a 5 (average). The sequel was aggressively, unrelentingly obnoxious and loud loud loud loud; it got a 2 (awful). This one edges up a notch to 3 (bad). Why is that? Because the 1st 9 minutes recreated the greatest moment in human history, when we took only a decade from decision to footfall on a trip to the Moon. There's original footage from the 1960s plus a modern-day cameo appearance by Buzz Aldrin.<br/><br/>But why did we go to the Moon? The movie starts off with an intriguing premise: that we were aware that an alien spacecraft had crashed in the Sea of Tranquility, and we wanted to go up and get a good look at it. Aldrin and Neil Armstrong (who were never on the far side of the Moon, regardless of the title or what screenwriter Ehren Krueger has his characters claim) supposedly discovered a huge alien robot there. This turns out to be Sentinel Prime, master strategist of the Autobots, voiced by Leonard Nimoy. Severely damaged, he had fled the Transformer homeworld of Cybertron after his last-ditch effort to win the final robot war ended in defeat. But he's inert in 1969, and it isn't until the present day that the Earthly Autobots head back to reactivate him, bringing along their own version of the Energizer Bunny.<br/><br/>That's the high point of the movie. After that, it's all downhill, as director Michael Bay and the various special-effects teams take over. As before, there's lots of whirling hardware, dust, spurting oil, blazing guns, and explosions. Once again it's impossible to keep track of who's who, even if you had a clue in the 1st place, which the movie never bothers to provide. Dweebish protagonist Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) tries to pretend that human beings in general and he in particular have a role to play in the intra-robot conflict, but it's abundantly clear that they're mainly cannon fodder. He's accompanied thru much of the carnage by eye- candy girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), whose job is to dress in saran wrap and adopt whatever emotional attitude the screenplay requires at any given moment.<br/><br/>The tone of the human interactions is saucy and insincere, played broadly and cartoonishly. Oddly, the actual cartoon characters, the robots, are the ones with the serious dialog and motivations. This is at least consistent with the movie's general attitude that they're the only ones worth caring about.<br/><br/>Other actors who collected a paycheck for walking thru this junkyard-in-progress include Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, Alan Tudyk, and John Malkovich. Their talents range from decent to excellent, but in all cases are superfluous here.<br/><br/>The Decepticons convincingly devastate an odd version of Chicago that includes the Milwaukee Art Museum. The survival of our heroes against all odds is not even remotely plausible.<br/><br/>I saw the flick in a packed 1st showing, and I was the only one who laffed out loud when Nimoy's character said ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" This tells me that (a) nobody else in the theater was over 35 and (b) efforts to insert even a little bit of ingenuity into the plot were wasted. OTOH, one of the comic-relief minibots elicited a hearty chuckle with the clipped-off expression ""clusterf"", which tells us once again how effectively the MPAA is protecting the tender sensibilities of the too-young-for-R kiddies.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that this movie will find its audience. I am not among them. I'd advise you not to be, either."
"scarletaka","8","9","19","4 July 2011"," Spoilers Dark Side of the Moon Transformers
","I would have given this 10 out of 10 for the sheer visual effects, Shia playing Sam is always fun, John T. as Simmons and Sam's parent's all good fun. What I disliked was the replacement of Megan Fox with this Rose Huntington Whitley as I feared she was their replacement for Fox with someone hot but her acting stunk to high heaven. Megan Fox is no Oscar caliber actress but she and Shia were perfect as Sam & Mackala(sorry about the spelling). After two movies and her profound love for Sam to have it simply be that she dumped him was a pitiful joke. The actors from previous Transformers were good, Optimus and his gang were excellent and I felt sadness for them. This movie was good because of the special effects what they can do with the auto bots and decepticons is truly amazing. Sam was still a little goofy his parents hilarious. Patrick Dempsey and Rose Huntington Whitley's characters were too close for comfort I was with Sam on that one. Photos of them together looked like a couple not employee and employer. Carly played by RHW was just not likable at all pure eye candy for the guys. I know many will hate me for saying this but Shia & Megan had much better chemistry, the natural humor and seriousness of the situations it was missing here because RHW just stunk.<br/><br/>The powers that be made a major mistake by not getting Megan back she'd been with Shia through the beginning and understood the gravity of the situation. RHW just kind of screamed and pouted.<br/><br/>I will see the movie again simply for Sam, his parents, the nest team, Simmons and the auto bots but they could cut out all the RHW scenes and the film would be perfectly fine nothing missing at all.<br/><br/>All I can hope for is that if there is a sequel and after this one I think that is a huge if not a definite probably not. If they do they need to get on their hands and knees and beg Megan Fox back like I said she is not a Queen bee actress but the role was hers and it worked. As they say if it ain't broke don't fix it."
"marcus-mosesson","1","10","22","3 August 2011"," And I who thought that it couldn't get worse...
","Okay, this is the deal: I really like the first Transformers movie, because of its charm, action and interesting story. I was VERY excited when the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, was released; but that was one of the biggest disappointments of my life: bad jokes, horrible story, cheesy/corny/childish manuscript (seriously, Optimus saying ""Let's roll!""?!) and other horrible stuff. After that movie, I stopped being a fan of the whole concept.<br/><br/>And then, when a third movie's coming, reviewers are positive. I give it a little chance, and pray to God that it's at least less bad than Revenge of the Fallen. But it was the opposite: it was even worse.<br/><br/>I can't believe how it's possible to fit so many bad (a.k.a. ""funny"") jokes into a single movie, that's not intended to be a comedy. I hoped that at least the jokes would be better, but they weren't at all: the only thing I really laughed to was when they showed a picture of Sam (Shia) shaking hand with Barack Obama. But that was it.<br/><br/>The story and dialogue was horrible, and I can't believe how ANYONE mature can have the balls to actually write this piece of crap (excuse my French, as we say in Sweden). I thought the story was bad in the second movie, but this was just... A piece of junk. Bad ending too.<br/><br/>The acting was okay, but I didn't really care. The voices for the robots were so bombastic that I was almost laughing. It felt like a cartoon for kids!<br/><br/>Besides that, the special effects were awesome (as always), though in fact, I actually got tired watching robots killing each other and helicopters exploding; how many times haven't you seen that before??!!<br/><br/>For the patriotic part, I don't find anything explicit with that. WHY NOT fight and proclaim for freedom? Communists and anti-Americans might get angry, but I don't see any big deal with that. But anyway, let's not influence too much politics in this.<br/><br/>Overall, this is just rubbish. If you aren't tired of watching giant robots shooting at and fighting each other, and don't care the slightest about any story depth at all, then go for it! My friend who was with me when we saw it actually said: ""This movie doesn't have any story at all, and that's why it's so freaking good!"" Maybe that's the way to see it. But for me, I say no."
"nicoleahern","2","10","22","7 July 2011"," Frustrating and shallow beauty
","Watching the first 5 minutes of this film I simply disregarded the previous two Transformer films and knew that it was going to be nothing like them. <br/><br/>The film just became frustrating at so many times; like when Dempsey started working for the Decepticons he did it because he wanted to live. OK, I'll give him that. But if he didn't try to re-ignite the Pillar then there would be no way that the Decpticons would win, so he wouldn't need to be enslave and would be free of working for them. Dylan didn't have a clue what he was doing, and it seemed no one in production of Transformers: Dark Of The Moon did either. <br/><br/>And ahhh...you can NOT place a new character in, provide no background of their relationship and expect the audience to empathise with her or relate to her emotions, it just ends up with you hating her and her scary lips that just look swollen (it may look good in photos, but not on film). So you just don't care about Carly, and you don't want Sam to save her because you don't know her. And I know Megan Fox quit/got fired, but there was NOTHING about her, except when he argued with his parents and said something like 'she dumped me, I found someone else'..what? WHAT?! You saved the world TWICE together, vowed your love..WHY did she dump him?! There was no story supporting any of it. <br/><br/>Oh and how did Carly manage to survive all those crashing buildings, sliding on the floor, running through explosions and being thrown around by robots in heels and not have a SINGLE mark on her, with her white clothes looking impeccable, when Sam's were torn, his face dirty and bleeding? <br/><br/>Turturro was OK in this, not as compelling as in the other films, but he wasn't in it as much. It was just at the end of the film when the Autobots were 'leaving' which was almost sad with Bumblebee's departure, ruined by Simmons in his chair with his lame leg and un-humorous comic appearance. <br/><br/>The plot was weak and there was no depth. There was nothing connecting the previous films, they just defeated Decepticons back, finding new ways to destroy the planet: first they wanted to destroy it, then blow up the sun, now rebuild their planet. There was no humour, and the mum wasn't on form with her one awkward sex comment. <br/><br/>And the typical annoyance of the bad guy telling the good guy the bad guy's plot shone brightly. I would have thought Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg could come up with something better than that, it offends me that they don't seem to care, and care only about making money by putting in the MILLION product placement ads.. jeesh it gave me a headache: the Mercedes ad, the Nike trainers, the posters, the drinks it's just too much!. I don't know what LaBeouf was thinking when he said this was the best of the three films. <br/><br/>And if they wanted to enslave the human race to rebuild their planet WHY DID THEY KEEP KILLING THEM!?? How are humans meant to survive on their planet without food or oxygen? And the idea of Cybertron coming to Earth.. has Michael Bay not heard of gravity? It's quite important really, it would mean Cybertron and Earth would collide and both planets would be destroyed. So therefore the whole film is pointless, unrealistic and a shambles. <br/><br/>The robots were weird: the old robot and the small one (that looked like Frankenstein's Igor) with the strange? I didn't understand why they bled? Obviously trying to humanise them for the audience to relate with them, it made no sense, because they are metal. <br/><br/>So much was unrealistic: when you are thrown through the air, free falling at about the rate of 80mph and caught by a METAL robot, ITS GOING TO HURT!!! Then you have the stupid 'ray guns'? I guess that's what they were - when the Decepticons killed the humans-_- why did the clothes survive and not the body? <br/><br/>And I was overly disappointed with Optimus. He was barely in it for two hours, and when he arrived it was so unspectacular and casual it's like it never even happened. <br/><br/>I wanted this film to be good, like the first film was, and even the second I guess, but they just focused so much on the CGI (which were amazing-except for when Starscream was tossing virtual-Sam around which reminded me of early Harry Potter films when Harry played Quidditch), sex appeal and money that they lost their values and the point of the film. I wished they would have connected the three films more, interlinked the plots more so that you could understand previous plots or develop future plots, but they seemed to forget all the other films, just like an episode of South Park: Kenny dead, Kenny alive. <br/><br/>But I applaud the CGI, and the amazing visuals and beautiful landscapes, making it epic to the eye, but to the mind it bored and frustrated you to no end. This was a rant filled review, but to say I didn't enjoy it AT ALL would be a lie. I just wanted so much more from it and it just didn't provide what it needed to. You could consider it as art: beautiful but mind-bogglingly confusing. <br/><br/>The people who clapped at the end of this film purely clapped not because it was a good film, but because they enjoy Transformers and WANTED it to be a good film. And you shouldn't clap anyway; Michael Bay can't hear you and the Odeon workers don't care if you enjoyed it or not, they just want you to leave so they can find your forgotten bags and go home."
"kingwreck","3","10","22","7 July 2011"," generic film for a generic audience
","Micheal Bay is the king of typical bad structured film making and yet he delivers from a visual aspect. Where the movie failed is how boring it is and the constant rehashing from bad pun to another. The movie had no part in trying to recreate history thats what worked for The Watchmen, really a pointless first half and why couldn't this be the first movie?<br/><br/>The biggest surprise came from Malkovich and Tudyk the both came off very naturally and I'll admit that alone was worth the admission other than that Shia's character has always been the weakest for comedy relief. He will always be typecast. Its like a bad sitcom and the canned laughter is there. He constantly yelling and come off as contrite,whiny,malcontent douche bag. In a million years what guy gets a bombshell of a girlfriend without a job; that was the biggest slap in the face towards the audience right there.<br/><br/>The movie was predictable and went on way too long during the second half,there was too much unnecessary action like Optimus gets caught in a crane but they show Shia's character fighting for a good 30 minutes until Bay shows Optimus again. Oh Btw Why did Optimus not get his trailer back he said he needed it?<br/><br/>There's too much flaws and if you like a movie same as the last yet less annoying. I say watch it. However if your a movie fan you'll find it boring, same generic speech Optimus always seems to give,same bad toilet humour other than Tudyk and Malkovich and if your was in high school I would enjoy this. Its a shut your brain off movie simply that.<br/><br/>Bay should do the movie world a favour and retire, I always liked transformers as kid and all three of these movies he did ruined my childhood. A great director like a Nolan or Matthew Vaughn is needed for character development."
"Dee800","5","10","22","6 July 2011"," Another swing and a miss (minor spoilers)
","We've come full circle and Michael Bay never realized that if he didn't sell out to market toys, sell drinks, and make a buck at every corner, he could have still made a load of cash and turned out a great product as well. The scene where the bird-like Decepticon murdered the family shows the kind of horror and menace that he could have built into each film and each Decepticon to make them true villains. Megatron could have become a menace in the same class as other historic on screen villains....instead, he was a mostly absent figure throughout 3 films that said some mean things, yet was completely incapable of ever appearing as more than a stumbling fool that was only a danger to anyone because he was so large. I doubt that anyone looked at the duel at the end of the film with any emotion that they were trying to destroy a truly evil villain......just some big Decepticon that made random appearances and couldn't really be taken seriously as a threat. Vader was a serious threat in Star Wars because he kicked the rebellion's rear in Empire.....the Decepticons never came close to an Empire moment.<br/><br/>The opening 5 minutes of the first film, and scarce moments of the 3rd film were the only fulfilling scenes of the entire trilogy when it was obvious that if each of the films followed that tone, that we could have had some special storytelling of good and evil on our hands....instead, we were bombarded with teenybopper scenes to get laughs, and ghetto speech to get the people that are going to make Idiocracy come to pass do their best LOL.<br/><br/>This movie drug along for a good while with nothing but the weak human characters trying to carry a flimsy mystery tale. Every time you'd think you were about to settle in to a serious film with terrifying consequences, Turturro's character (the most annoying character in film since Jar Jar Binks)was in the way again of any kind of plot development...it just drove home the point that Bay wanted to make so many factions happy that he completely lost his way and produced a lot of drivel dressed up with cool special effects and visuals. You will only enjoy this if you don't like thinking and you can tolerate heavy doses of stupid jokes and idiot humor.<br/><br/>This movie had promise, but missed, as did the entire series...sadly some potentially awesome villains were reduced to tools that couldn't take over a city, much less the planet. How is it the Decepticons whipped the Autobots right off of their own planet, but when they had them incredibly outnumbered in 2 of 3 films they never stood a chance at defeating them? How is it that their armor is basically like soda can aluminum when fired at by human machine guns in some scenes? Human soldiers taking down multi-ton killing machines with parachutes is a threat to humanity? Hopefully someone in touch with the darker potential of the series can reboot it and give us what it might have been."
"moviexclusive","9","10","22","28 June 2011"," Hands-down the most visually awesome action spectacle you'll see this summer- this third entry is easily the best 'Transformers' movie to date
","We are happy to announce that ""Dark of the Moon"" is our vote for the best film in the trilogy. It isn't just the bombast that puts it ahead of its predecessors; rather, this third movie boasts a stronger plot and well-developed characters- human and machine alike. <br/><br/>Like this summer's ""X Men: First Class"", writer Ehren Kruger legitimises the sci-fi premise in a real-world context by taking a revisionist view to past events. Through the extended prologue, we learn that the space race of the 1960s was really a cover-up to investigate the remains of an alien spaceship crash on the far side of the moon. Bay injects this alternate history with gravitas by using both archival footage of JFK and Richard Nixon and re-enactments of what went on inside NASA as well as the White House, and this terrific opening portends a darker film than what we have previously seen in the past two movies.<br/><br/>Bay and Kruger makes good on this tantalising promise with the new human and machine character additions. Chief among these is Sentinel Prime, once the leader of the Autobots during their war with the Decepticons on their home planet Cybertron and a father figure to Optimus Prime. Sentinel's allegiance and subsequent actions blur the line between good and evil amongst the Autobots and the Decepticons, and for lack of a better description, make the machines more human and also more interesting. <br/><br/>On the side of the humans, it is Patrick Dempsey's Dylan, boss of leading man Sam Witwicky's new and equally Megan Fox-hot girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who turns out to be unexpectedly intriguing. At first no more than a romantic rival to the recently graduated Sam still struggling to find a job, Dylan turns out to be- pardon the pun- more than meets the eye once the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons unfolds proper on our planet. <br/><br/>While there is significantly more depth to some of the characters and the story compared to the earlier films, Bay still resorts to the kind of easy humour characteristic in the first two 'Transformers' movies. Yes, despite his promise to tone down the goofy humour, there's still plenty of it on display whenever Sam appears on screen without some sort of battle raging around him.<br/><br/>It's a pity too that Bay also uses acting veterans John Malkovich and Frances McDormand only for cheap laughs- Malkovich as Sam's tyrannical boss; and McDormand in an essentially one-note character as the no- nonsense national intelligence director Charlotte Mearing. Also unfortunate is Bay's frenetic handling of even these made-for-laughs scenes, which would have worked better with a lot more subtlety and finesse.<br/><br/>But of course, the above two qualities are not what Bay is known for- despite the benefits a more varied change in rhythm could have done for the film- and sure enough, it is this brazen attitude that serves him well in the plentiful action bombast that follows in the last hour. Bay begins his non-stop trail of destruction from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., but he reserves the bulk of his firepower for Chicago.<br/><br/>By the time Bay is done, little of Chicago's skyline is left- none of the iconic buildings whether Hotel 71, the Tribune Tower, Marina City or even the Trump Tower manage to escape unscathed. But this Bay-hem is also utterly, absolutely thrilling, and features quite possibly some of the most intense action sequences you'll see on the big screen this year. Indeed, Bay has learnt from the criticism of ""Revenge of the Fallen"" to hold his shots for longer so that his audience can get a sense of the awesome scale of the unfolding action, and my goodness does it totally rock!<br/><br/>The highlight of this colossal climactic sequence takes place inside a toppling skyscraper as Sam, Carly and returning face Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are hunted by a serpentine Decepticon known as Shockwave and forced to slide down the glass exterior of the toppling building. Other breathtakingly exciting extended setpieces include one where Sam and series regular Lennox (Josh Duhamel) are dangling off a metal rod whose sharp end is lodged inside a Decepticon, and another where Optimus Prime faces off against a group of Decepticons led by wounded leader Megatron who makes a return from the previous film. These are especially awe- inspiring when viewed in 3D, and Bay, who was convinced of the format by James Cameron, grasps the additional dimension to amazing effect.<br/><br/>Never mind that only 60 percent of the film was in fact shot in 3D (with the rest, especially the closeups, shot in anamorphic and then post- converted), this is probably one of the few films since ""Avatar"" to thoroughly make use of the format. Nowhere is this more evident than in an aerial sequence where a group of paratroopers led by Lennox infiltrate the Decepticon-infested Chicago city, all the while pursued by flying enemy robots. Shot composition by d.p. Amir Mokri is excellent, and there is excellent use of foreground and background to create depth in every scene. The added dimension also helps illuminate the other technical achievements of the film- the mix of physical staging, live-action stunt work, location shooting, and visual effects just seamless and simply remarkable.<br/><br/>On pure visual spectacle alone, ""Dark of the Moon"" beats both of the earlier 'Transformers' movie and in fact probably anything you'll see this summer- so kudos to Michael Bay, who has clearly outdone himself by creating his most exhilarating work to date. Yet this third film in the franchise also emerges its strongest entry not just by visuals, but also by a well-grounded plot and rich character additions. Sure it's pure summer popcorn entertainment, but on that level alone, it succeeds immeasurably and on sheer entertainment value, this is the must-see blockbuster of the season.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"
"kevinorrell99","Null","11","25","12 July 2011"," I am now dumber for seeing this movie :(
","I felt the first transformers movie was excellent. It was new, original, and simple in what it tried to accomplish. The same can not be said for Dark of the Moon. What made this movie terrible was Bay's attempt to appeal to a mass audience. He tried to make an action, horror, comedy, romance movie and unfortunately the end product was extremely cheesy. Also, the movie had poor physics. How many times can a human being jump through panes of glass and not receive any cuts? I freely admit that I half expected this to be a bad movie and what I was looking forward to was the 3D animation. However, even that lacked originality to it as it was simply debris flying everywhere as the 3D showcase. The one saving grace of this movie was LaBeouf's performance, who carried this movie on his back by creating a believable world of metal robots and bad actors and actresses. I will not be watching another Bay movie in my lifetime."

","Someone made a mess of the plot . With a wafer thin storyline and the action blinded by stupidity for eg. in one scene 'humans' creep along the street undetected under the 'watchful' eyes (come one - how can aliens be this stupid ?) this is way up there with disappointing sequels. Everywhere there is a sense of deja vu with the 'luuuuuv' thrown in. Action scenes are few and far between - if you expecting 3D to dial up the moves - don't. Worst ever movie i have seen in recent times . Not to be rude or offensive but in close up shots,Rosie Huntington-Whiteley appears to be less feminine and looks like a bloke with thick lips (??). of course she can't deliver her lines - she is not an actor. She is a body with a few lines to speak. No chemistry seen with Shia. to conclude - no amount of action or hi tech wizardry topped with 3D can be a substitute for the age old the story has to be reasonably good. Period."

","Absolutely abysmal. Made it 1h 30m through somehow. My head is spinning. It felt more like an anxiety attack than a movie. Sort of like ""The Other Guys"". Just bizarre moment after bizarre moment. Felt more like 6 or 7 hours of dialogue crammed into a very dizzying, very uncomfortable experience. Where do I start? The comedy failed. The action was pointless. The girl? Who cares. All I remember was something crashing on the moon and there being a government cover-up. Can't put into words how stupefied I was after viewing this crap. I watched the first Transformers and, I didn't have enough great things to say about it. It was amazing! The only vibe I got while watching Dark Of The Moon was that the directors must have been ingesting large amounts of amphetamine while directing this. I felt like it was one big RUSH to squeeze so much dialogue into 2h 20m of run-time. But for what!? 80% of the script was pointless! Maybe cut out all the completely useless scenes and you wouldn't have this horrendously distracting pacing issue. I spent so much time being dizzy and confused, I didn't really even get a chance to digest what was going on. I literally had to leave, and go to the bathroom and splash water on my face and calm down because the movie had overstimulated me to the point of having an anxiety attack.. Not a figurative anxiety attack, a literal anxiety attack. I spent the rest of the evening vomiting. No wonder it disappeared from the theater and landed on DVD and Blu-ray so fast!"
"juanpa01","1","8","17","11 July 2011"," The franchise is over
","I am a big fan of the franchise, and it is really sad to see what it has become. This movie is a joke, but not a good one. Makes Optimus look like an idiot hanging on ropes while the Decepticons wreck Chicago. It seemed as if a guy with Alzheimer filmed the whole thing, too loud, too many explosions everywhere, the action scenes are too fast paced to enjoy. So Michael Bay might be thinking OK I have almost U$200 million to spend, have 100 to spare, so let's hire some high profile actors for the comic relief (which is not comic at all). The fight scenes are so long, but it takes one second for Optimus to kill Megatron. The guy from Grey's Anatomy is like Hugh Jackman halfway a gender change treatment, the girl talks to Megatron changing the course of events when she should be making a sandwich and looking pretty. Nice touch having Leonard Nemoy voicing Sentinel Prime. Also, what's up with the overweight autobot and the Einstein look alike? And Sam's penis size? When you have to make a character wear silly clothes it means you don't truly believe that the character itself will be funny. Way too long, 90 min. would have done the trick. A lot of potential wasted, the Nixon and Kennedy scenes seemed as if at the point of shooting them there was no budget left, the Dutch character could have been developed some more...<br/><br/>In conclusion a great disappointment, even the toys look cheap. 1 Star is too generous. You've been warned."
"craigsomerville","Null","9","20","25 July 2011"," Utter utter p**h....
","Well I have to say this has to have been one of the most enduring and annoying cinematic experiences I have ever had the mis-pleasure of sitting through. Where to start...<br/><br/>Well the film seems to have been written by some teenager who appears to have been continuously turned on by the posters of glamour models and US Military equipment on his bedroom wall as he wrote. Dialogue is terrible, story doesn't have any coherence or even make any kind of sense when comparing it to the mythology to the two previous movies.<br/><br/>Acting, well appalling, the 'new' Megan Fox is horrendous, and can't act for toffee. Shia is a decent actor but his character Sam has now become extremely annoying by this stage in the franchise. All the other parts are simply either, cardboard cutout's and have very little screen time to develop in anyway, or are just beyond stupid and pointless.<br/><br/>Direction is the same old Michael Bay lets blow everything up in the sunshine with slow motion. Its been done to death Michael, lets try and evolve as a film-maker and focus more on pacing, character and story development. 60 minute final battle scene? Eh? No one except 7 year old kids want to watch that. Far too long, and once you've seen one battle between two gigantic robots you've seen them all.<br/><br/>So many WTF moments. Too many to go through. I can't remember the amount of times I just wanted to put my head on my hands in despair.<br/><br/>I don't get this movie, a lot of people say 'What do you expect form a movie about robots that was based on a kids toy line.' True but M Bay didn't make this for kids or he would have had much more subtlety with the amount of sexual connotations instead of ramming it down our throats. There also seems to be an air of Rasicm, Jingoism, and sexual discrimination similarly to the previous efforts and those underlying themes shouldn't be involved in a kids movie.<br/><br/>An extremely poor effort of film-making, excluding the visual and special effects. Unfortunately 2.5hrs of visual effects doesn't constitute a movie to me. Michael Bay seems to be a sheltered and overly patriotic teenager who has just discovered the excitement of sexual arousal trapped in a mans body. This can only explain his style, content and the view on the world he wants to project in his movies. Someone needs to grow up fast and open his eyes a little wider before making another movie IMO. <br/><br/>1/10 Awful in every way."
"emmithepaladin","2","9","20","5 July 2011"," Terrible Movie
","I saw this movie a couple of days ago, and I think it's fair to say that there are two parts to this movie -- the humans and the robots. The Robots don't matter. One look at the casting list in IMDb shows you that. A movie that is supposed to be about the robots doesn't even list the characters on the first page here. They are after-thoughts in a thoroughly forgettable film.<br/><br/>The voice acting for the Autobots and Decepticons is absolutely superb, and the only reason this movie is getting a 2/10 from me. Peter Cullen's iconic voice acting is better than ever, and Hugo Weaving and Leonard Nimoy are amazing as well, in their very very limited screen time.<br/><br/>I'm a long-time Transformers fan, and with all of the reports about how good the script was supposed to be, had the expectation that this movie would be better than the second. It wasn't.<br/><br/>The plot holes were numerous or unexplained. The large numbers of Decepticons on the moon isn't explained, nor is why they had to be transported to Earth instead of simply flying there, and the amazing ""rewind"" function of only the second pillar disruption was just stupid.<br/><br/>As for why Sentinel Prime gave Optimus the Matrix (All Spark) back isn't made clear in any of the movies, and my guess that the Matrix would sense his betrayal and destroy him, or simply outright reject him which could lead to suspicion, is simply that -- a guess. Not that I think Michael Bay is clever enough to mean to do something like that.<br/><br/>The script writing is terrible, and the human actors need to go to acting school. Sam reaches new levels of annoying in this movie, and the dialogue is contrived and insulting; this is highlighted by the obvious and contrived ""homage"" lines throughout the movie -- Sentinel saying ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.."" and Bumble Bee saying to Sam, ""I am and always will be your friend."" before they blast off to ""leave"" the planet.<br/><br/>I'm all for mindless action movies, but this one just blatantly insulted the audience. I'd also like to suggest that Transformers is no place for toilet humor, and I feel the writer(s) and director really did the franchise a disservice with this movie (and the second one) by including it.<br/><br/>Transformers never ""talked down"" to its audience, which is one of the things I think that made it so successful and worth watching, and I feel the last two movies did just that.<br/><br/>Another positive is the CGI, it was very very good. But that isn't a good reason to see this movie. It never is. Looks cannot hide this movie's lack of substance, and I am insulted yet again by the assertion that bigger and better CGI is what I want. It's not. It's a tool in a story-telling toolbox, and since there was no story, the audience is simply and continuously hit over the head with a giant CGI hammer. Safe yourself the headache, and skip this movie.<br/><br/>If you pay more than $1.00 to see this movie, you'll be wasting your money.<br/><br/>2/10 stars"
"moviewizguy","3","9","20","2 July 2011"," Transformers 3 with the Extra ""D""!
","To explain the plot of TF3 is like trying to explain rocket science to a child. You just can't. It has something to do with some Spock-voiced robot crash landing on the moon in the 60s and some teleportation pillars having to do with the end of the world or something, but I digress. It's already giving me a headache. TF3 can be basically seen as an apology from Michael Bay after making the hated TF2. He said it would be 100% better. He lied. Sure, TF3 has a hint of a story this time around, and the film tries really hard to show us this, but it fails miserably. At least TF2 didn't try to have a plot (which is probably due to the fact that the script wasn't even finished when they began shooting the film), and at least it was entertaining.<br/><br/>Even removing the two annoying racist twin robots from TF2, TF3 is still worse. Why? Because it's a dull film. It turns out that watching the same thing thrice isn't as interesting as watching it the first two times. It tries to be different, but when you get down to it, it's more of the same, but with one huge difference: Bay decides to save all the action in the last 45 minutes of the film. And seeing how people watch these films for the action, we have to wait about 100 whole minutes to see it. Now this shouldn't be a problem had the film had an interesting story and characters to invest in. Well, it didn't. It's a LOOOONG 100 minutes of unfunny jokes and non-existent, incoherent storytelling. Seriously, Bay could have easily cut 30 minutes off the film, but you know how he is. His films just have to be over two hours, don't they?<br/><br/>But anyway, once we finally get to see the action, it's actually quite impressive. With the addition of 3D, it's pretty damn amazing. And because of the Chicago sequence alone, TF3 isn't a total lost cause. We eventually do get what we came for. As for the 3D, I liked the use of it. It was shot in 3D instead of converted into 3D during postproduction, so you really get to see the depth and stuff popping out during the entire film, especially during the Chicago sequence where you see the depth of the city and people flying around (among many other things).<br/><br/>The actors in here are efficient. It's not like they actually have to act. They just run and yell. Newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Megan Fox's replacement, is pretty decent too, although it's easy to imagine that Fox could have done the same. Veteran actors John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and Leonard Nimoy give a response of pity rather than a warm welcome as we much prefer them not have their resumes tainted by this film. But anyway, they are in the film for good, and there's not much we can do about it. Ken Jeong is pretty annoying but (thankfully) does not appear in the film any more than 5 minutes. Alan Tudyk--why? Why are you in this? You're better than this!<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll get off my soap box now. Of the 157 minutes(!!) TF3 has, about 45 minutes are actually fun to watch. The other minutes....aren't. I mean, it's a Transformers movie. It's the third one in the series. You know what to expect. By this time, you already know if this is for you or not. If it is, watch it in 3D. Or maybe don't, just so they don't make a fourth film. I'd imagine people will get tired of Transformers soon enough (like me) as the case of sequelitis becomes increasingly apparent."

Indeed, Rosie Huntington Whiteley's acting debut was particularly interesting; never have I seen an actress perform so breasts.<br/><br/>The action scenes were a treat to behold - each explosion looked radically different from the last and really provided the film with an emotional edge. You really start to sympathise with all those poor buildings being shattered to pieces.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the best films I've seen in years. A true landmark in cinematic history.

","The beginning of this movie offers a little hope that there may be a great story line, but low and behold, in cometh the M.Bay wrecking ball. The plot is decent as an overall view but fails when it comes to each individual 'bot. Megatron acting like a deranged fat drunk that wanders the back allies is not the most picturesque picture of a leader. He looks to have added 40 tonnes to his build. Aside from that, he is a groveling coward that lets Sentinel Prime take over leadership without a fight. Shockwave has been portrayed to be the main villain in every promo but appears throughout the entire 2.5 hour film for a maximum of 5 minutes. The Decepticon character Igor (really x_x) serves absolutely no purpose at all. You only see the 'cons kill one Autobot in the entire film. Please inform me as to how an entire army of 'cons could not dispatch more than one enemy through the entire battle? 'Cons were also supposed to have won the war on Cybertron. I don't think they could have done that by not killing anyone. Cliché as is the fact that every villain (Decepticon) cannot kill ANYONE. Autobots have been portrayed as ultimate Godmoders that could kill the flies off a rhino's butt on the other side of the planet while the 'cons must have bullets made of marshmallows. The only villain that is top stuff is an Autobot turned bad. EVERY 'con has a pitiful death that is un-climatic and extremely quick. This is true aside for Starscream's long death which was made for laughs.<br/><br/>The only good side of this movie was the visuals. The special effects are top notch.<br/><br/>Overall the rating is: A for special effects C- for the plot D-/F for character development/deaths<br/><br/>Its a good movie to see if you like sexual imagery and explosions but nothing more."
"baumer","9","9","20","29 June 2011"," Strap in, hold on and get ready to be blown away!
","Transformers 3 is a miracle. It has everything you could hope for in a summer film. There were times when I wanted to stand up and cheer (I did sit and cheer or clap twice in the film) and there were times when my voice box wouldn't work so my shocked and awe functions were relegated to my eyes bulging like I was on Ecstasy and my mouth was agape like I was lining up to have someone throw an M&M in my mouth. There were times when I laughed when no one else did (Sam's interview with Malkovich and when just a few notes of Sweet Emotion played, just like it did in Armageddon). There were times that I laughed when everyone else did (the two New York mini robots doing pretty much anything got me and the audience all giddy). And then there were times when I just sat back, glasses on, blinding light from the screen, crisp and precise sound emanating from the 100 or so speakers, and just took it all in, and thought to myself, ""this is why I love movies"". This is why I go to the theater. My favourite films take me to another world. A world of infinite possibilities.<br/><br/>When I watched Terminator 2, I believed that liquid metal was real. I was convinced that it could take the shape of a Vasquez from Aliens and stab a man while he was drinking a carton of milk.<br/><br/>In Jurassic Park, I was in that park with the kids and with Malcolm and with the lawyer and the director of Ghandi. Tyrannosaurus Rex was real and so were the raptors before they started playing basketball in Toronto.<br/><br/>In Armageddon, I knew that Bay really went to a giant asteroid and shot on location. He really did take Bruce and Ben and William with him. It had to be real because the worlds that they inhabit felt real.<br/><br/>And that's not even mentioning some of the big guys like Star Wars and LOTR and Matrix and many others. The worlds that can be created take you places. They remind you that with a little imagination, a lot of hard work and a letting a little bit of the kid in you come out, you can creates anything. <br/><br/>Bay's Transformers 3 is a brilliant and worthy addition to these worlds. There isn't one frame of this film that feels fake. There's not one shot that wasn't laboriously coddled over. It's truly a remarkable film and even though I'm not a huge proponent of 3D, here it absolutely works. The base jumping scene will go down, imo, as one of the all time most amazing scenes ever filmed. It's just remarkable that Bay could do what he did.<br/><br/>The film has a very fresh story which is also a bit surprising as it kind of rehashes the story from part two. But when you can get Kennedy, the moon landing, Cheronobyl, the destruction of downtown Chicago, the middle east problems and a plethora of other issues all rolled into one film, it just feels fresh.<br/><br/>My favourite part of Transformers, even more the mind blowing spectacle of watching them transform, is Sam Witwicky. His character is essential to the film and he is the glue that holds it all together. The first 15 minutes or so is all exposition. They go to the moon and discover the crashed Transformer there and it is a very well done beginning. But when Sam finally gets on screen you feel a sense of relief. His mannerisms, his idiosyncratic ways and his entire ethos is what makes the Transformer films so much fun from the human side. Here, he has grown up. He is disgruntled as he feels he should have some cushy, well paying government job seeing as he saved the world twice. But he is unemployed and looking for work. His new girlfriend is hot, obviously, but she is a nice addition to the film. Her story arc could not have been done with Mykala as his girlfriend, so it was written well. Cameos by John Malkovich and Ken Jeong are played strictly for laughs and they do it well, especially Jeong who's a short and sneaky man working in Malkovich's company. He had some of the best early laughs.<br/><br/>Adding to the mix is newcomer Frances McDormand. She plays a caricature of a bitchy CIA agent who is way too full of herself but really hasn't a clue what she is doing. This part is not played for laughs as she insults Sam and Optimus at every chance she gets. It's also nice to see that Coen's alumni McDormand, Malkovich and John Turturro are all in this film. They even share some screen time together (not all three together).<br/><br/>Without getting into the story, to avoid spoilers, just suffice to say that everything you want and expect from a Transformers film is here and many of the things people complained about in the second one are not. Gone are the Transformer balls, leg humping and the supposed racial stereotypes of the twins. Replacing that is more subdued and well placed humour. Even the sheer emotion is magnified in the film as the last 30-45 minutes will leave you breathless and exhausted. And the only spoiler I will mention is my favourite line of the film is when Rosie tells Megatron that he will be used like he is the Sentinel's bitch.<br/><br/>Transformers 3 is a like a ride at the amusement park. It can leave you breathless, queasy and exhausted. But you know that once you get off you just feel like going back on again.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This movie was better than the second sequel. Still, the director of this movie is very poor. He lacks in every department of a good director. I do not understand how he can get away with his B movies. In 1999, 2002, 2010 he won decisively Razzie Award. I mean doesn't this by itself tell you a kind of movie you can expect from him? Hard core Transformer fans will like it more than the 2nd disaster. However, I am missing Megan Fox, in this type of movie a hot chick is a necessity. Rosie is miles away and definitely not even comparable to Megan in a ""beauty"" department. All that this movie possesses are visual effects and better action in comparison to the 2nd movie. Even the sequel name is lame ""Dark of the moon"" trying to imitate the sequel ""Dark Knight"". In conclusion, better sequel than the 2nd one, but still not up to expectations."

","As preposterous, unfunny, immature and horrifyingly bad, believe it or not, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the best of the three movies. But, that's like saying it's better to be deaf than blind.<br/><br/>Aside from the blatant swearing, this movie should've come with the warning: Not for those over three years of age. I mean, the cuss words were so obviously put in to give this juvenile film ""an edge"" as was Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's flaunting of her body for the young teen boys.<br/><br/>I'm no prude – in reference to the profanity, but just to add it to make the laughable cardboard characters ""tough"" is just plain stupid. And weak.<br/><br/>I'm aware this is a part III of an already established dumbed-down action/Sci-Fi series based on toys, but there's a point of leaving your brain-at-the-door that goes too far. The point for me, aside from the ridiculous mismatching of this ""story"" and stock footage of President Kennedy, was about 20 minutes (of 157) when idiot Shia, er, I mean, Sam played with his obnoxious little Transformer pets.<br/><br/>The positives for this feature was the fact they toned down the lengthy and complex story finally and made it a lot easier to tell which robot was which – they added color to the Autobots. Neither of these attributes elevated this above 1 star out of 5. It was just a speck of a gift for all we had to endure to get to the end of the film.<br/><br/>Quick story brief: previously outed-alien metal race Autobots is helping humans thinking the bad aliens, the Decepticons, are out of commission. Well, obviously, they're not and both parties are trying to regain planet-destroying materials from their defunct planet. Oh, and Decepticons want to use humans as slaves, à la Borg/Matrix.<br/><br/>Really, the point of the movie is for us to sit through painful dialogue, pitiful acting, awful jokes and minimal action sequences to get to the inevitable crushing of Chicago in the last 40 or so minutes. Matrix Revolutions, anyone? In both Matrix 3 and Transformers 3's over-long final battle scenes, I was literally left bored despite all the efforts they put in for ""heart"" and special effects. Numerous times, I just looked away from my screen and played a game on my phone.<br/><br/>Even when Leonard Nimoy (""Sentinel Prime"") barked his signature Spock line, I had already checked out and could care less when he said it. I seriously can't recommend this to anyone. Again, I would for the under three crowd of toddlers if not for all the deliberate vulgarity.<br/><br/>I guess I could end on a positive note. I did laugh hard a couple of times. Both scenes involved Sam being thrown in the air sloooo-mo while his yellow friend Bee went to catch him. That was (unintentionally) hilarious!"
"akik1259","3","4","7","9 June 2013"," The silver medal of the trilogy
","First off, I LOVED the first movie, it was fun and fun to look at. Then the second movie came and I HATED it. It took everything great about the first one and flipped it on its shiny metal ass. I gotta say that this movie is marginally better than 2, but still nowhere near 1.<br/><br/>You don't need to know the plot here because it barely exists anyway.There are a lot of annoying characters, both human and robot, that deliver bad performances and really bad jokes. In fact the first hour is full of these bad jokes. The first action scene is really boring and forgettable. How could they screw up Optimus fighting a giant driller worm? The first hour is boring and almost a completely different movie with hardly any robots or action. Instead, we get Shia LaBeouf trying to find a job and please his new impossibly hot girlfriend in a painfully long and unnecessary sequence. You can almost skip that entire part.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the move gets much better in the second half, where a HUGE battle takes place in Chicago. The effects and the set pieces look amazing here. This is where you gotta give credit to Michael Bay. The robot fights are also filmed better here than in the other two movies. Two scenes get special mention: the highway chase involving Decepticons and the skyscraper. Those scenes are really intense and fun to watch. Like I said the entire second half is pretty much one big prolonged battle scene. It has some great moments, but some are filmed poorly or just plain long. Also the movie ends very abruptly, with about 30 seconds of aftermath.<br/><br/>Put simply, the movie is pretty bad overall. Most characters are annoying, the writing is bad and the jokes are horrible. The robots and other CGI look great, but they cannot cover up the flaws. Only the second half is worth watching."
"Richardball160","1","7","15","28 January 2012"," How can this movie score 6.4
","Perhaps, if this movie had cost less than $195 million dollars say a mere $100 million and had some other atributes, plot characterisation or a point to its existence I might have scored it higher but this is just another example of Hollywood and in particular Michael Bays view that if you have a project and if you throw vast sums of cash at it, an overblown cgi budget and pounding score, you get an instant mega bucks hit. These kind of movies are killing the movie business, I am certain that there must be a hundred lower budget projects that never get green lighted, because such lumbering primitive monstrosities like the Transformers movies get made. I have no problem with high budget movies per se, Avatar, Pirates of the Caribbean ,Marvel,Star Trek, Batman franchises all cost lots of money, and make lots of money, but they have at their core, intelligence vision and integrity and are far more entertaining than most of Mr. Beys work. Give Mitchael Bey $50million and he might just manage a 10 minute short. In short Transformers DSM while occasionally spectacular lacks pretty much anything else that would make me want to watch it ever again."

","Revenge of the Fallen was a terrible movie. Michael Bay himself stated this and he even went as far as saying this would be a lot beter. I am trying hard to think of anything positive in this movie.<br/><br/>For some reason the bay formula has always been about action explosions, car chases and American flags draped over everything and people walking cool ( with a flag , guns down etc...) at the end of every movie. Pan downs.<br/><br/>The latest installment continues this trend itsobvious that michael bay has absolutely no clue about what story means in a movie. A movie should make the audience root for someone bad or good. Right now we are stuck with wondering who most these robots are. coming from a transformers background for me it was horrible to see the bay interpertations of devastator but i was more shocked when I saw the new and improved soundwave.<br/><br/>All of these transformers are shells of nothing I do not like optimus neither do I like Megatron who was called a bitch by someone before he decides to finally do something in the movie and then getting his head pulled off his total action time was 3 minutes! . He served NO purpose in this movie other then being a miserable robot being.<br/><br/>The animations while great again add nothing to the movie except for trying to hide the most glaring flaws this movie has. THe lack of a story obvious copying of a few old transformers episodes but ultimately it falls short on its face.<br/><br/>Bay has since Pearl harbour only made graphically impressive movies but his story and his ideas of a good movie are completely wrong. I think Bay has a lot more potential then this when there is someone who keeps im under control. Right now I see TF3 as a showbook case on what you can achieve with technology but it does not leave a single brand or shred story wise. I hope they find a director who understand what made transformers special."

","Instead of writing a large review pointing out all the horrible aspects of this film...I will just say that I encourage people to go see this movie for themselves. Yes you read right, go see this horrible film for yourself so that you can witness CG and cheesy scenes blended at it's worst and to witness one of the worst movies of all times, as this film definitely made my top 10 list of worst films ever (Transformers 2 is also in that list and I have yet to see the first film, which may also be included in that list).<br/><br/>This film is absolutely horrible and do what you can to see this film for free, because it's not even worth a buck.<br/><br/>As horrible as this film is, these are the reasons I gave this flick 2 stars: <br/><br/>-By default, all movies on this site receive a minimum of 1 star.<br/><br/>-The visual effects were good, even though at some point (especially in the last hour of the movie) the visual effects are all over the place giving you an unnecessary overdose of CG (thank goodness I did not watch this film in 3D, my eyes would have hurt a lot!). At that point in the film, you just can't wait for the credits to roll and leave the cinema. Kinda think of it, since the film is full of CG, they should have just made it into a computer animated movie, like that it wouldn't have needed all those horrible actors. Hmm, now that I think about it again, even the visual effects don't deserve to give this film an additional star.<br/><br/>-I will give it another star for somehow being able to generate millions in revenue and being able to please a certain audience.<br/><br/>Total: 2/10. I would have given it a 1/10 but I'm in a pretty good mood as I write this review, so I want to be a bit generous.<br/><br/>As a final note, I just want to point out that I am very worried about nowadays' film audience which enjoy this type of film. Then again, I am more worried about large movie company executives and producers who allow for horrible movies such as Transformers 3 of even being filmed.<br/><br/>So go see this film for yourself and be ready to worry about the mental health of individuals who thought that this film was even somewhat good."

","Perhaps it was JFK's grotesquely computer animated face, or the stupid trying-to-be-cool rip off title, or maybe it was the Buzz Aldrin and Bill O'Reilly cameos that did it for this reviewer. Whatever it was, the third installment of the Transformers series is obnoxious, bloated, and appallingly bad.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf returns as the main character, this time shacking up with Rosie Huntington, who does nothing but stand in for Megan Fox. LaBeouf spends almost all of the first 30 minutes complaining about not being able to help save the world with the Autobots. Boo-hoo. Meanwhile, John Turturro plays Seymour Simmons, the other guy that was in the other two movies. Are we supposed to care about these people? In a film about giant robots? Regardless, director Michael Bay spends nearly an hour with the contrived plot and useless, unlikable characters. John Malcovich and Patrick Dempsey both have supporting roles in this film. Neither of them matter, yet Dempsey alone gets 10 minutes of screen time. The only logical explanation for this is that Michael Bay must have nothing but contempt for his audience.<br/><br/>Rather than a movie, Transformers plays out like something used on Guantanamo Bay inmates when water-boarding doesn't work. The acting is bad, the story is incomprehensible, the robots are ugly, and the movie is 2 ½ hours long. Even the action scenes are impossible to figure out; Optimus Prime is literally left hanging for ten minutes, and the film cuts away when anything remotely important happens. Shia LaBeouf & co. are dangling from a falling building facing certain doom, when the film cuts to Optimus and Megatron fighting, but whenever someone looks like they might be the one who wins, the film cuts away—and with so many side plots, they don't return for what seems like ages. It's nearly impossible to tell the Autobots and Decepticons apart. They all have the same color schemes and cheesy one liners. ""Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican standoff here"". Give me a break.<br/><br/>Michael Bay directs with the attention span of a hyperactive middle schooler. For the first hour the only thing he seems remotely interested in is Rosie Huntington's body; which is fine—for a while. And when the action finally starts, Bay can't make up his mind on where to be. Every cut seems like some main character is left facing impending doom. Not that Bay has made any effort for the audience to give a crap.<br/><br/>The script lacks any forward thinking, trudging along at a gruelingly slow pace. Filled with stupid jokes, an insufferable romantic subplot, and jive talking robots, this screenplay is—dare I say it?—worse than the last one. The plot at points is ridiculously mundane. If this is a movie about giant alien robots, then why in God's name must there be a 5 minute montage of Shia Labeouf being interviewed for freaking jobs?!?<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this abomination is Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime. He has a few good lines, but—just as in the other Transformers movies—he's not in it nearly enough. As a result, nothing works; the script doesn't work, the action doesn't work, Patrick Dempsey's pathetic attempts at acting assuredly don't work. Michael Bay throws every explosion he can at this movie, going so far as to completely destroy Chicago. His obnoxious direction consumes the movie, and the result is what happens when soulless Hollywood rears its ugly head.<br/><br/>www.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
"julian-mumford","3","7","15","9 July 2011"," A ""Marmite movie"", either you love it or hate it
","The first Transformers movie was fun, silly but highly enjoyable. The second film was successful but critically panned as it turned the volume up to 11 and made no sense.<br/><br/>Pre-release, director Michael Bay confirmed he had learned his lesson from episode 2. This third film was filmed from the ground up in 3D, we were told we would enjoy a decent story and a more mature structured film. All of the above, whilst retaining all the fun, explosions, soft and car porn a fourteen year old boy could want or at least wish to handle.<br/><br/>Has he succeeded? The movie from a technical point of view is a tour de force. The 3D effects are fantastic, the set pieces colossal, see the previous 11 and raise you double. The CGI and animation on display is perhaps the finest and seamless we have ever seen at the cinema.<br/><br/>How can it be then, that I would describe this as perhaps one of the worst films ever? The story begins with the Apollo moon landings, where it transpires the moonshot was about more than just going to the moon, the US needed to photograph and investigate a crashed Cybertronian ship. The remainder of the film revolves around huge fight scenes between the Decepticons (bad) and Autobots (good) led by Optimus Prime striving to prevent Cybertron being called to earth - very bad.<br/><br/>This an interesting premise and the first twenty minutes hold together reasonably well following a lingering first shot which sets out the non-feminist agenda of the film. Sam (LeBeouf) is now with Carly (Victoria Secret underwear model - Huntington-Whiteley). Megan Fox leaving the series after she compared Michael Bay to Hitler, which will always dampen your career aspirations somewhat. Carly is gorgeous to look at and a large proportion of the film traces her sun kissed body and ogles her curves, at every and any opportunity.<br/><br/>Can she act, no. However, for many this may be a moot point. LaBeouf also does nothing to dispel the illusion that he has yet to be involved in any movie where decent acting is actually required.<br/><br/>The story then vaguely unfolds into, well it is difficult to tell, because from a thematic and structural point of view the film is a complete and utter mess. Each scene merely a very brief interlude or bridge to the next orgy of CGI created Robot on Robot fight scenes. Perhaps 80% of the films running time is used in this way, even reverting to a FPS (First Person Shooter) view at one point, confirming beyond all doubt, the continuing convergence between action movies and computer gaming.<br/><br/>Interestingly the fighting is more brutal than ever, execution style sequences, ripping of robot body parts and spines, in slow motion with what appears to be blood on occasion. Quite why this would be the case is not explained.<br/><br/>This is a short list of the talent on display, all of which without exception are wasted and on reflection may well be ashamed to have been part of the film. Stand up, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, John Turro, Patrick Dempsey and most sadly of all Buzz Aldrin, the only genuine character briefly on display.<br/><br/>Ken Yeong of ""Hangover"" ""fame"" also appears in a bizarre sequence and yet again manages to confound as to why he is popular with audiences. The scene when ex-agent Simmons is reintroduced to the film appears to come from a different movie and jars to such an extreme, it is difficult to believe it was not intentional.<br/><br/>Leonard Nimoy does a decent job of voicing the new character ""Sentinel"" but there really is no film of any substance to comment upon, just a string of CGI show reels, some appalling dialogue and misjudgements in taste. Quite how a shot reminiscent of the Challenger explosion was considered suitable is difficult to understand and a later tattered US flag waving moment, that even the staunchest of American redneck would blanch at.<br/><br/>On this and recent evidence, Bay has to be one of the most technically savvy but shallow and incoherent directors working in modern cinema today. When compared with intelligent yet blockbusting cinema from Christopher Nolan, there is no comparison.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Technically and visually arresting but otherwise an appalling film, lacking any humanity, story or structure.

","Optimus Prime: You may lose faith in us, but never in yourselves.<br/><br/>First off, I must say that this movie was not as good or better than the first (4.5/5) was far superior to the notoriously bad sequel (and Worst Picture winner) known to many as ""Revenge of the Fallen"", or ""TF2"" (2/5).<br/><br/>Now, lets decrypt this film so that we may know the good and the bad;<br/><br/>BAD The script by Ehren Kruger was poor. The dialogue and cheesy and unnecessary one-liners (Optimus while flying: I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU! from 1000 meters away) are abundant here, but this is a ""Transformers"" film, but it still seemed to have slight resemblances to RotF, which it was said it would try to stay away from. Its not bad, but it sort of degrades the quality a tad bit, preventing it from being on-par with the first. Rosie Huntington-Whitley's acting in the film was poor as well, but that was expected, especially since she was probably just picked straight out of a Victoria's Secret magazine, especially since she models for them and was chosen just to look pretty and just have a big sign on her forehead saying, ""HEY GUYS, I'M REPLACING MEGAN FOX!"". She was the only really ""bad"" actor I witnessed throughout the film. Comment if you wish to try to educate me about everything else (I do agree that Wheelie and his buddy, while helpful in the movie, are still obnoxious, but less obnoxious than the dreaded Twins).<br/><br/>GOOD Well, the humor of the first is back (no fart/ball/weed/kid jokes, mainly the type of humor from the first), and it was actually enjoyable instead of stupid like the second (and Sam's parents are slightly restrained also, participating only in the first half). The score is excellent, reminding me a little of the ""Inception"" score a bit, and Michael Bay did an awesome job directing the action sequences (my favorite part was when the paratroopers jumped out of the planes and flew through the city to find Decepticons to fight), but not very well with the plot scenes (although it was slightly more coherent than TF2).<br/><br/>Also, the last hour of the movie, which starts with the climax of the brutal destruction of Chicago and DC (Megatron destroys the Lincoln Memorial and sits upon his throne, which I found somewhat ironic), and ends when the long battle is over, especially in 3D, makes up for the gaping flaws.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT Compared the the first, its only average, but compared to the second, its like the first. It was a bit cliché at the beginning and the end, but the last hour makes up for some of it. I would give it a 3/5 (a B-), but I'll amp it up to a 3.5 just because it met my expectations.<br/><br/>It was some good fun, and the 3D is quite good. See it while the gas prices are down.<br/><br/>GRADE: B (3 and a half stars out of 5)"

It almost made me puke. As in they actually waited an entire 2hrs to kiss (like that was the most important scene in the movie). To say the truth, if I wasn't so hungry at the beginning of the movie, I wished I was elsewhere. And that bit where Starscream blew up that spaceshit (read it exactly as its written), talk about the most predictable part of the entire movie, it was so obvious that they'd find a way back before the ship even got out of the earth's atmosphere.<br/><br/>Back to the Robots; OK is it me or are these the flimsiest robots you have ever seen. I mean Ironhide melted after being shot once, Sam (a mere human, not even military trained nor muscular) was able to pop off Laserbeak's head? I mean I could try to rip apart this computer I'm using with my bare hands but I would be screaming and bleeding like a mofo by the time I'm done and this guy got off without even a scratch; Not even Hamisi is that able, and mind you he has the roughest hands in this side of the office as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Action; the only worthwhile action that was worth talking about was Optimus Prime fighting off the other big robots, and he got tangled in some wires, for like 20mins he was still in those wires; and here I thought he had some big guns, a flaming sword and a huge axe to say the least.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, there is also the issue of there being only ONE just ONE hot chic in this movie. JUST ONE!!! If I'm going to sit for two hours watch a truck load of nonsense there had better be more reason than there being a bunch of flimsy robots getting their asses handed to them for 40mins or more.<br/><br/>Most of all I will NEVER EVER EVER! forgive Michael Bay for messing with the holiest of Holies in the world of Sci-Fi Movie. ""The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few""; He selected Spock's dying words in one of Star Trek's best ever movies (The Wrath of Khan) and put them in one of the CRAPPIEST MOVIES ever made. Why oh why did Leonard Nimoy ever agree to being part of this horrific mess<br/><br/>Well on a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 3. I'd have given it 1 but I still love huge robots fighting."

Questions such as: 1)Who was it who ever sat down and said ""you know what, I think Michael Bay would be great to direct a Transformers trilogy!""? 2)Who exactly green lighted this 'script' (and believe me I use the term VERY loosely)? 3)What sort of barnyard animal is in charge that would ever, EVER consider that this movie was 'ok' to release to the public? 4)Who was the cretin that went to the studio bosses and told them ""we need a star for the new Transformers trilogy! Get me the kid from Even Stevens!""? 5)In what universe is Rose-Huntington whatever considered hot? These are but a few enigmas that plagued me throughout this...thing.<br/><br/>I'll refrain from beating around the bush. The acting is horrifying. The story is non-existent, and whomever thought it would pass as being acceptable needs to be horsewhipped. The dialogue is atrocious. In all, one word can sum up this movie-laughable. This wasn't a movie, it was a nearly 3 hour joke that tried to be serious. I am embarrassed for anyone who worked on this project.

Then why is the movie 30% about robots and 70% about humans beings who a)I don't have any emotional connection to b)I couldn't care less about because they're preventing me from viewing the robots I paid to see and c)I honestly wished would die in every scene they appeared? <br/><br/>Fast moving camera shots and large explosions tend to hinder people in their efforts to view what's going on in a movie. Especially during the fight scenes.<br/><br/>In said fight scenes, its also hard to know who's who when the heroes and villains look almost exactly the same. That's kinda why you make people and things look different, so, you know, we can identify them...<br/><br/>The title. ""In the Dark of the Moon"" makes sense. ""Lunar Shadow"" makes sense.

"ali-bianchi","1","8","18","29 June 2011"," A film only matched in it's epic failure by it's epic bad taste
","Once in a while,a film comes along that is something quite special. Setting the standard higher than any that has gone before. Such a film has the ability to unite people in a common purpose, no matter what walk of life they come from, enabling young and old, rich and poor, to put aside personal differences and agree together on one a common opinion...disgust! It's not that Transformers 3:Dark of the Moon is just bad - that, this trilogy will be long remembered for. Instead, Micheal Bay has upped the ante once more and has created a ""film"" that not only succeeds in being vapid, obnoxious and offensive, but downright boring. The plot that exists is a hotch-potch of half-ideas, beginning in the 1960s with the suggestion that the American space programme and moon landings (via some shocking inter cutting of real footage) were an effort to reach a crashed Autobot vessel (they are the good robots - you can tell because they don't have evil red eyes). This ship carries 'pillars' which have the ability to open portals which allow teleportation. Cue the Decepticon's (red eyes) fiendish plan to bring their home planet of Cybertron to Earth, enslaving mankind in the process.<br/><br/>TF3 is a game of two halves.<br/><br/>For the first hour exactly nothing happens. Not only does nothing happen, but when it does happen, it is garbled and confusing, with big jumps in continuity and logic. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf - the human hero of the previous two outings) finds himself searching for work while also struggling to come to terms with the fact the Autobots no longer need him. Fortunately for Sam, he has a new girlfriend, possibly the least developed and most insincere relationship ever committed to celluloid, played by super-model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in inimitable Bay style, with minimal charisma and minimal clothing. In Bay's world men are either soldiers or gay, women are either supermodels or Mrs Trunchbull tyrants (with insinuations of lesbianism), and ethnicities serve only to be stereotyped (only black people say ""wak""). All familiar territory for the Transformers world, but Bay truly outdoes himself with some horrendously thoughtless references to 9/11 and Chernobyl. Classy.<br/><br/>(NB. This is a 12A rating but due to sexual content, innuendo and swearing - not to mention the regular Hostel-style disembowelling of robots - it should be avoided for younger audiences. .) Played largely, and largely unsuccessfully, for goofy laughs, the first hour feels like a holding pen until the director can unleash his trademark Bayhem in the second half. Surely this will redeem the film, especially in the glory of 3D?! Well, no actually.<br/><br/>Devoted to one long fight scene, this should be visceral, mind-blowing, red-hot action. Granted, the CG is effective, robots really do look like they are hitting each other, and a free fall set-piece is very well done. However, despite so much going on (explosions, mecha-crunching fist-fights, lots of running and shouting) there seems to be very little happening. Sure, there is lots of noise and stuff, but it's all so overblown that it's difficult to get a handle on anything, making what should be exciting, well, boring.<br/><br/>It appears that Bay does not have an original idea in his head. Decepticon spaceships and technological hardware are a 'who's who' of other alien incarnations. Humans are dispensed of in War of the Worlds dust-clouds, the mother ships are Skyline carbon-copies, and the snake-like droids have been seen ad nauseum attacking The Matrix's Zion. (There is also a horrendous amount of copy-and-paste dialogue. Guess the films: ""I'll never let you go"", ""There can only be one"", ""With great power..."" yadda yadda yadda...). The random splicing of half-finished scenes, breathtakingly poor soundtrack choices, and rapid cuts is entirely disorientating, causing the viewer to slip into a kind of action-induced coma.<br/><br/>Having spent so much on CG effects, Bay clearly had no money left for insignificant details like script, story or acting direction. Forget the Blockbuster cliché ""it's just a bit of fun"" - it isn't. It is boring and senseless, leaves a bitter after-taste, and gives the best reason yet to close down Hollywood forever."
"Aqua_Fresca","3","8","18","28 June 2011"," Transformers 3...worse than I expected.
","When going into a film, it's only right that you go in knowing what the film wants to deliver. In the case of Transformers 3, the package has always been non-stop robo-action, and humoured digressions. That's what I kept telling myself going into this film: ""it's just a popcorn movie, so enjoy it for what it is."" Well, I went in, and for part of the movie I was kind of enjoying myself, but as soon as the final hour began, whatever enjoyment I felt disappeared and boredom set in.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with the humour of the franchise then you're probably expecting more of the same, and that's what you get: more colourful comic relief, more banter between characters, more awkward moments for Sam Witwicky. Your enjoyment of this is likely dependent on how you enjoyed the previous instalments's humour: if you enjoyed it you'll like this, if you didn't then you probably won't. Personally, I thought this film was funnier than the others, but I still thought it was hit or miss.<br/><br/>The actual plot itself has a lot going on, but it's largely there to connect the dots and present opportunities for large scale action. Even the moments of humour, which appear to at least attempt to advance the film's plot in some way, come across more as digressions from the plot as certain characters are given license to chew the scenery. But really, does anyone come to Transformers expecting to be engaged in the plot? Most people come to this movie to see robots fight each other, and that's just what they will get. And yet...I found myself wanting more.<br/><br/>I thought I had gotten myself ready prior to my viewing, to enjoy the film as best as I could on its terms, and for a moment I believed I was heading in that direction, but I soon became bored in the final sequence & though I have a few reasons for feeling so, the one that sticks out in my head the most is the fact that not only was I not engaged, but I wasn't even feeling the slightest sense of drama.<br/><br/>Out of all 3 Transformers films, Dark of the Moon easily has the most at stake, and there are moments of characters in distress, but it all comes across as superficial. Michael Bay fails to go deeper into the characters and throughout the climax I kept asking myself ""why should I care that 'this' is happening?"", and if I don't care about anything that's happening then why am I watching all these special effects other than to just, well, watch the nice looking effects? To a lot of people out there they are able to view only the eye candy and get enjoyment out of that, but to me, without any real feeling behind anything that's happening, the climax became meaningless.<br/><br/>Dark of the Moon is indeed a popcorn film, and if you go in looking for a lot of action and humour then you may come out pleased, but for me the lack of any real drama hindered the conflict a great deal and left me feeling cold and bored."
"TomL123","3","8","18","28 June 2011"," had the potential...
","First of all let me say that there may/may not be spoilers in what i am about to write. As a person who works in the film and television industry i can say that this movie had A lot of potential. but didn't deliver. <br/><br/>OK first things first. The whole moving a planet thing? why bother? why not just take over earth?. Maybe I missed something but that was a major script flaw for me. The CGI and cinematography was so so close to being perfect. if it wasn't for a few shots in the entire film that really destroyed it. no the thing that really put me off this film was the few times that Micheal bay referenced 9/11.<br/><br/>Especially in a scene towards the back end of the film where the guys jump out of the aircraft and are falling. one shot shows them directly in front of a building that resembles the twin towers. ( a reference to the jumpers I think). another scene where they are in a falling building and the guy around saying ""all the stairwells are blocked"". Could I think also be a very subtle reference to 9/11. There were also a ton of other movie references. some which worked. others which didn't.<br/><br/>overall i think what really destroyed this movie's potential to be the best transformers movie was the over-referencing. those few bad shots with some bad CGI. and the script seemed out there...even for a transformers movie. overall i give a 3/10 which i think is being slightly generous."

Twenty minutes of drawn out slow motion giant robots fighting in mid air could still be pretty cool. Over an hour of it? Not cool.

","Okay so i liked the first one it was fun! The second was a bit of a mess but still had a bit of charm. This is just a mess. Yes the special effects are impressive, but with 170 mil spent on it so it should be. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this deserves a slap. the timing of certain lines made me laugh, when they were supposed to make me think! seriously the dialogue in this movie is so bad its laugh out loud. There are scenes that look like they have been written by the us government. anyone outside of the us will see it as drivel. The action scenes are decent but the rest f the film is so badly done it doesn't even matter. For the love of the loaf Michael Bay stop butchering this franchise and do something like captain America 2 where your rubbish script would suit instead of inflicting this rubbish on the rest of the world. i don't usually check my watch at the cinema, but 5 times i checked just to make sure i hadn't slipped into a time-warp. i went in not expecting much, and left expecting to be treated as if i was smarter than a five year old on heroin.<br/><br/>3/10 but only for the effects."
"DarthVoorhees","3","10","24","29 June 2011"," As good as it could be
","I don't know what there is to say about this film. It's headache inducing, has nothing even remotely resembling plot or character, and it runs nearly three hours. So in all normal circles of film criticism it tanked. Oddly enough though this thing might be Michael Bay's masterpiece. I don't like Bay's film making because it is all style with nothing close to substance. 'Dark of the Moon' is no exception but where I give Bay credit is that he has trademarked his own brand of filmmaking. You can look at a movie he's made and see the same trademarks and this deserves some respect. Some directors never find their niche and Bay has clearly found his and so all the power to him. I don't like Bay's style and so I don't like 'Dark of the Moon' Have you seen a Bay film before? About everyone has. 'Dark of the Moon' is a Bay film on steroids. All the clichés and loud action scenes are multiplied ten fold here. So as a word of warning your ear drums will bleed and the sap from his all American action montages will probably put you in a diabetic coma. The question becomes do I credit Bay for this or criticize him for it? Obviously this film is very expensive and he's really used that budget to stretch out the confines of what a Michael Bay film can be. In doing this however Bay showcases his weaknesses as a filmmaker and general storyteller. With all his 'Bay'ness brought out to it's utmost limit his shortcomings become all the more relevant because we miss them more. Bay essentially throws a lot of stuff at the wall and admittedly some stuff sticks and is impressive to look at. Bay throughly destroys Chicago in an epic action packed battle and it's action packed to the point where I just don't care. Why? Why is this war so damned important? Why am I supposed to care about Optimus Prime? There's no characters and no story and so I just feel as if everything in this movie is just filler to wrap around action sequences.<br/><br/>The problem I see with the film is that I don't care about the Transformers. None of these robots are characters at all. I maybe know Bumblebee and Optimus Prime and that's it. The rest of the Autobots and Decepticons are mere props. There isn't a villain or real conflict here. Oddly enough there is more setup than in previous films but so what? I don't care about Optimus Prime's mentor becoming a backstabbing traitor because I don't care about Optimus Prime. I mean what is he? He looks shiny and cool and that's about it. You see Sam our lead character break in tears when his car Bumblebee is about to be executed and I couldn't help laughing because no emotion is invested by the audience. Give me a reason to care about these toys even if it means giving us a break from the action.<br/><br/>I see the credit for Hasbro at the end and it is so utterly appropriate. This film is nothing more than a giant toy commercial. With Bay serving as the kid playing with his toys making things go boom ka-pew. I don't care for it but obviously people do. I won't begrudge his fans of any respect of their intelligence because I can see why he's popular. He has a style and he made it his and so good for him. To people who like Bay's films I say you will have a blast because it is the best one. That's all there is here a Michael Bay film with all of his strengths and all of his weaknesses shown front and center."
"Hellmant","8","5","10","4 July 2011"," The film is once again (like all of Bay's films) loud, obnoxious and relentlessly in your face. It's also a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing!
","'TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The third chapter in director Michael Bay's immensely popular super robot franchise, based on the popular 80's cartoon show and Hasbro toy series. Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and most of the rest of the cast are back. With one obvious exception of course; Megan Fox. Due to conflict with the film's producers (Bay and Steven Spielberg) Fox was fired from the project. She's been replaced by popular Victoria's Secret's model Rosie Huntington Whiteley (who has worked with Bay before on a 2009 Victoria's Secret commercial). Also new to this film are John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, Ken Jeong and others. Ehren Kruger (who co-wrote the last installment) returns as the sole scriptwriter this time around. The film is once again (like all of Bay's films) loud, obnoxious and relentlessly in your face. It's also a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing.<br/><br/>This adventure begins in 1961 while the Autobot's and Deceptions still wage war on their home planet of Cybertron. An aging Autobot known as Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, who also voiced the character Galvatron in 'THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE' 1986 animated film) escapes the planet with special teleportation technology called Pillars that could end the war for good. He crash lands on the moon and has been wrecked there ever since. When Optimus Prime (once again voiced by the legendary voice actor Peter Cullen) learns that the U.S. government has known about Sentinel's whereabouts and the Pillars for some time he becomes extremely angry and makes it his mission to bring Sentinel home to Earth. The Decepticons meanwhile lay in wait, waiting for the appropriate time to strike and seize control of the Pillars. Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf reprising his most famous role) at the same time is struggling with unemployment (even though he helped save the world twice and earned a medal from President Obama) and feelings of inadequacy while trying to impress his new super hot girlfriend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley).<br/><br/>The story is once again pretty simple but things still seem to get very convoluted and hard to follow (in classic Michael Bay fashion). The film always moves at breakneck speeds regardless of what's going on (whether it's a simple dialogue scene or an elaborate action spectacle). It jumps from slapstick comedy to emotional drama to explosive action, without a moment's pause, and back again (constantly). The whole thing becomes very exhausting (like all of Bay's films) and you really need some strong caffeine or some kind of drug (whatever LaBeouf is on) to keep up with it. This kind of material can definitely leave the viewer with a severe headache if they're not in the right mindset. With that said the movie is still a heck of a lot of fun and you get far more than your money's worth (there's so much going on). The scam is that it takes you three or four times of seeing the film just to process it all. The action scenes are breathtaking, the 3D visuals are arguably the best since 'AVATAR' and the comedy for the most part is very funny. The script is a complete mess but that's not really important with this type of film. LaBeouf's shtick is getting a little old but for me it still works. The guy has so much energy and is still hilarious in the right role (and Witwicky is the perfect showcase for LaBeouf's comedic and improvisational talents). Some people hate the parent characters but in my opinion Kevin Dunn and Julie White are always scene stealers in these films. Huntington-Whitely does a good job of looking extremely glamorous and beautiful (and that's all she really has to do) but I still prefer Megan Fox (or anyone more real). Bay's directing is once again Bay's directing; you either love it or hate it. I personally love it. Seeing one of his films is a very unique experience and it is almost like being on drugs in a way. It's mind-blowing! I love creative independent films made for next to nothing but I also love big visually exploitative films (made on budgets of 2 to 300 million dollars). I think there's room for both types of film-making in the marketplace and one style doesn't hurt the other. They can co-exist! If you enjoy these types of films you'll definitely enjoy this one too.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeZHJaLfc8"

If you really want to regrettably lose two hours of your life, then go ahead and watch this film.<br/><br/>The story is woeful even on Transformer's standards. There is no explanation as to what happened to Megan Fox. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is thrust upon us with her big fake lips and without a gram of acting ability. Sam Witwicky is a massive tool as always, his parents were really annoying just as they were in the other two, and I cannot begin to describe how awful Frances McDormand was. Frances McDormand is about the only person in this film with any serious credibility and I would think more highly of her if she had gone out with Lindsay Lohan on a drug induced night of mayhem than appear in this.<br/><br/>Tyrese Gibson was about the only person enjoyable to watch, and if it wasn't for his charm then I really would have hung myself during this monstrosity of ""story"".<br/><br/>I'm so disappointed in Leonard Nimoy."
"tyronor","1","6","13","17 August 2011"," This is how Transformers DOTM could have been if more improved.
","This has some spoilers of my own making. This is not from real film.<br/><br/>Intro is fantastic and it fits. In Russia, after NEST finds a strange device, Optimus Prime battles Shockwave and the Driller; Shcockwave almost kills Optimus and flees. Sam and Carly have a more balanced relationship and they are accompanied by Brains and Wheelie more (both are not too dumb and annoying at all). Sam gets his job and the office segment of the film is not crappy like it is in real film. Sam meets Dylan and Carly like in real film. Optimus and Ratchet find Sentinel and Optimus later resurrects him with Matrix of Leadership. Megatron comes in with no stupid green small character and he informs his followers to get rid of their human comrades. Megatron still has his hatch-lings, who soon grow and become enhanced by Shockwave during Chicago fortification. <br/><br/>There are not stupid moments, stereotypes, and random comedy bits in this version except the President Obama part. Sam is more improved including the whole cast. Ken Jeong is brutally killed by Laserbeak including the family in the real film in a bloody mess. No stupid scene with Sam's car caught by guards and Sam acting like a dimwit. Bumblebee talks normally this time with no radio-voice (ENOUGH with the radio voice).<br/><br/>After Russian club meeting with Simmons and Dutch involved, the chase scene has the Driller and Dread robots going after Sentinel; Driller faces Mirage while Ironhide and Sideswipe have a long and better battle with last two Dreads (other Dread is killed by Mirage). Simmons and Dutch are injured badly and they are saved by NEST. Sentinel, who is inside the secret base for the heroes betrays his comrades and gets his pillars; Driller and Shockwave help stop Autobots/NEST soldiers from going after him before leaving. Later, Sam and parents meet and have a discussion about love; Megatron allows Starscream to prevent Optimus from stopping Sentinel from bringing a large army of Decepticons to Earth; Sentinel halts Optimus while Autobots go out and battle the large army of Decepticons. Afterward, Optimus and Autobots retreat from the big battle including the NEST soldiers, who were losing. <br/><br/>Sam confronts a traitorous Dylan like in real movie and Carly gets kidnapped by Laserbeak and Soundwave (Dylan's partners). Dylan does the same thing to Sam like in real movie and wants him to ask Optimus Prime about a plan to take down Sentinel and his alliance. Soon, the government woman, who is more improved and not annoying, takes Sam to see Epps and the Wreckers at the rocket area. Soon, after Dylan allowed Starscream to destroy the rocket with exiling Autobots inside, he allows Shockwave, Megatron, and many Decepticons to fortify Chicago like in real movie.<br/><br/>Soon, during the huge battle in Chicago, robots have more involvement and they help NEST take on Dylan's tough human group and the Decepticons. The whole conflict is overnight and the main characters try to survive. Megatron, who easily injures Optimus while up high, wants to be the one in charge; however, Sentinel, who plotted to trick Megatron, allows Starscream to knock him off of the building they are on with pillars; Shockwave and Starscream are given control over Decepticons by Sentinel Prime as a humiliated and hurt Megatron flees from his own group who now reject him.<br/><br/>Later, instead of transporting Cybertron (which was a dumb idea), a new and gigantic device with small remaining Allspark energy gets transported by the pillars so it can combine with the master pillar to turn Earth into a new Cybertron. During the end of the big fight, NEST (with the wingmen), Silverbolt (who was in disguise as a Decepticon), and the Autobots take down their enemies (Dylan's human large human force and Decepticons alike) and later allow Optimus to fight Sentinel. <br/><br/>This time, Carly saves Sam from Dylan and kills him with one of Q's weapons. Bumblebee battles Soundwave long while nearby Dylan and Sam. Wreckers are the ones to do a lot more damage while following Optimus to destroy many Decepticons on the street (better than that single destructive assault of Optimus in real movie).<br/><br/>The heroes and a changed Megatron (who has been supported by Sam and Carly) prevent the larger machine from entering Earth and disable the master pillar. Shockwave, who loses his Driller to Bumblebee and Optimus, activates a secret device to control the remaining Decepticons against the heroes; Shockwave kills a damaged Sentinel (who gets beaten by Megatron) in front of his enemies; he fights Optimus, who teams up with Megatron to give him a chance to free the remaining Decepticons from Shockwave's control.<br/><br/>Shockwave gets his face slashed, but remains strong with the help of radar sensors he built for himself. The blinded Shockwave overpowers Optimus and destroys his other arm (his right arm is detached like in real film) with his gun. Megatron saves Optimus again and allows him to stomp Shockwave's head.<br/><br/>After the huge battle, Megatron and his forces leave their path of violence and move to Cybertron with Optimus' help. All of the heroes rejoice and separate. Frenzy, who somehow has been revived, parties at Dylan's penthouse. The End.<br/><br/>Major Casualties: Dylan (killed by Carly with one of Q's tools which blows him up); Starscream (damaged by Wreckers and NEST soldiers before one bomb weapon Sam placed in one of his eyes blows him up); Laserbeak, same way like in regular film; Ironhide, same way but inside NEST base; Shockwave (real main villain) (gets his head stomped); Sentinel Prime (killed by Shockwave after Megatron ripped him apart); Major Lennox (Shockwave's cannon form destroys him); Silverbolt (Driller eats him); Q, same way; Driller, killed by Bumblebee and Optimus after Megatron damages it with right cannon arm; Jerry Wang, slashed and blasted to death by Laserbeak, Wheelie and Brains (same way), and Soundwave (blasted and killed differently by Bumblebee)."

If the humans portion was cut out of the movie entirely it would be an even better movie to watch.<br/><br/>It is a million times better than the abominable ROTF.<br/><br/>John Malkovich in his short role is quite funny, as is John Turturro, even if he is still OTT in his diminished and toned down role.<br/><br/>The transformers, both good and bad, are quite excellent. Sad to say but they're better actors than the humans.<br/><br/>The slightly sub par: The new girl: I have to admit that she wasn't as bad as I thought she would be acting wise but she was still nothing special. In fact her role was completely pointless and there was a point where she's interacting with the transformers as she's been in the previous 2 movies and took herself way too seriously at times. Even a muppet on a stick could have done the same job, for less money, and with the same result. But she is still a lot better than Megan Fox...<br/><br/>The negatives: The lack of consistent humour, which was quite funny and welcome in the first movie. Instead there are some sexual gags and jokes which are quite lame.<br/><br/>The slow motion of the new girl's body: I like it when a camera focuses on a hot girl but the way Bay did it made me feel sleazy and cheap. It was there in the first movie but done quickly and more tastefully. Here, it's so blatant that it's annoying, as if it had to be part of the script or else the movie would fail.<br/><br/>The plot: there is none, or more to the sense there is nothing original to the plot of the movie. It follows the basic principle of just about every trilogy ender: have a giant war/battle that lasts more than an hour. It seems that the plot was written after the action scenes were mapped out because it's a jumbled mess with a lot of stop and go.<br/><br/>The cheesy ending: a typical Michael Bay ender. NO spoilers required. Who said this guy could direct movies? Too many human actors: just about everyone from the first two movies are in it and there are new people added. There's no time to draw out anyone's back story and you just don't care for Sam and the rest of the humans this time round.<br/><br/>Not enough time spent on the robots: This movie, as well as the others, starts of as Transformers, not Humans. There are new transformers but they are either not identified or done too quickly for us to register before the start of a action sequence so it becomes confusing whether they are autobots or decepticons.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a teenager's action movie wetdream and they'll love it. But for the cynical it's a wasted effort on ending the transformers saga on a high note in terms of a good story. If there is another movie in the works I really hope that Michael Bay is not there to ruin it. George Lucas destroyed the first three Star Wars movies with his ""vision."" Let's hope that Michael Bay is not round to repeat the same mistake..."
"malbanese","4","8","19","29 June 2011"," You better not have hoped for much!
","First let me start by saying that I knew when I went to see Transformers 3, that i was going to be in for a big budget blockbuster, so I wasn't hoping for too much in the way of depth or volume or character development. But hell, a little wouldn't have been too much to ask. I know I know, it's Michael Bay at his ocular raping best, but something is missing here. Something big. <br/><br/>I think Sucker Punch proved, you can't just through a tonne of money and special effects at a turd and hope it will polish itself. And this is no exception. Don't get me wrong, it's a major improvement on Revenge of the Fallen, but not quite up to the standard of the first. What has happened here (in MY opinion folks. Don't get upset. You're all entitled to one, and have one (opinions, not assholes)) is, we seem to have lost the need or want to tell a story. <br/><br/>The special effects here have spared no expense. The 3D is OK only surpassed by Avatar or Jackass 3D (no, seriously, if you'd seen Jackass 3D, you would know what I'm talking about). I guess you have to tune right out and not try to think about the film so much to rate it 10 out of 10, but when I'm paying hard earned dollars to see something special, I expect something special. This is not special. To be honest, my favorite thing about the whole film was the Green Lantern 3D trailer at the beginning. I guess I had hyped this film up for myself too much and it failed to live up to my own expectations (also my friends who sat next to me complaining about the stupidity of the weak ass story). But I imagine I'm not alone. I think a lot of people have high expectations of big budget blockbusters and want to see something mind numbingly great. But this just didn't do it for me. Why? Because it was just plain stupid. The story had holes you could drive Optimus Prime through (at one point he does). And come on, since when do Robots have free-kin HAIR???? Robots with lips is one thing, but hair? I draw the line people.<br/><br/>So see it (at your peril). But please don't expect to be blown away. Maybe expectations of an epileptic seizure (there is a lot going on at one time, flashing lights, explosions, space shuttle disasters and robots with hair) are more appropriate.<br/><br/>I can only hope Green Lantern lives up to the trailers expectations."

","I was lucky to have missed Transformers 3 in theaters- you'll want a fast-forward button for this movie.<br/><br/>After watching one-and-a-half Transformers movies, I had hoped that Michael Bay would break away from his tradition of terrible plots, cheesy dialogue, boring action saturated with explosions and cliché characters, thereby making something that resembled an enjoyable movie. To the contrary, DOTM had everything listed above in even greater frequency. Bay even takes his time with it, drawing out the nonsense for three (3) hours! If anything, that's a feat in itself.<br/><br/>""But wait,"" you say. ""Maybe I want to turn my brain off and just watch mindless action for a while."" That's fine, I can respect that because aside from the pretentious I-only-watch-Oscar-worthy-movies film buffs, that's a guilty pleasure we all get from time to time. The problem with this film is that you feel like you're watching the same thing over and over again. If I'm going into a movie expecting nothing intellectual, at the very least I want the action sequences to be interesting/stylish, I want the dialogue to be funny, and I want the music to be captivating/cool. Movies in this category are seldom ever considered ""good"" by critics but have spawned memes like ""this is sparta!"" and ""release the cracken!"" and fulfill some of those things mentioned above.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for all the money spent on the film's admittedly impressive visuals, the ""action"" in Transformers 3 expects audiences to be captivated by flying debris and destruction which makes up 2/3's of the film. It stops being impressive after watching it for an hour straight (an iPhone in the blender can simulate this pretty well). The musical score is equally uninspired, and the dialogue sounds like it was scripted by a 3rd-grader. I spend the time writing this review in hopes that I can save the time of others. Even for the action lover, there are much better movies to waste 3 hours with."

Also they shouldn't have called it Transformers it should have been called Optimus Prime because he's pretty much all you are going to see, the other Transformers are just thrown in as faceless, voiceless filler characters.

"themissingpatient","7","7","16","4 July 2011"," I was insulted by the first two films...
","Transformers was a horrible script with bad direction and annoyingly terrible performances. Transformers 2 only made things worse. Jokes and humour only funny to children with language and sexual references aimed at a much older audience, it was a mess.<br/><br/>Now you could say; 'Why then, if you hated the first two films, would you go to the theatre to see the third?' I have a six year old brother who is obsessed with Tranformers. He is going to see the movie either way. So I thought it best if he was going to a 3 hour long abortion by Micheal Bay in the theatre, I might as well be there to support him.<br/><br/>It begins like just another sequel and goes on for about an hour with only a few hints of action yet both the presences and performances of Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk and a much less goofy, John Turturro, take the film to a new respectable level. I know, I still can't believe it either.<br/><br/>Somewhere within the 2nd hour, a complete shift happens. A series of plot twists with characters and Shia LaBeouf, who I have never been a fan of, for the first-time in the series, we actually relate with! The film then continues to surprise as it gets bigger and darker with excellent effects and stunts with human characters we care for. It's not shot over-the-top Micheal Bay style either, which is a surprise within the film itself. The film looses the over-use of shaky cams and lens flares, instead focuses in on what is going on, so we can get in on the action instead of getting frustrated trying to figure out what is going on.<br/><br/>It's almost as if Micheal Bay studied Zack Snyder's direction of The Watchmen, stopped smoking crack and later, watching J.J. Abrams films, said, ""That's what I've been doing wrong!"""
"sammieyayho","4","7","16","1 July 2011"," Had it's moments, but overall disappointing
","What to say about it, exactly? I love the first two films, and I was pretty excited to see this. I was already annoyed/bummed that they had replaced Megan Fox, but I was hoping it wouldn't be too big of a deal. Because I had fairly high expectations, I ended up being disappointed by the entire first half of the movie. It had a very strange, unpleasant feeling to it. The humor was very forced and didn't fit well with the wittiness from the other movies. There were several new side characters, few of whom were at all funny. John Malkovich's part was unnecessary, Frances McDormand fell flat. Ken Jeong was a nightmare who brought The Hangover to Transformers. Alan Tudyk at least provided some good laughs, but his character was also an unnecessary addition to a bloated cast. Even the established characters didn't have that old spark. Sam was reduced to ranting and whining by turn, without the right kind of sarcasm. His parents became caricatures dressed in matching green track suits, who irritated rather than endeared. Even some of the new Autobots were ridiculous, especially in appearance. Only Optimus and Bumblebee felt true to character.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there's the new girl. Carly, a.k.a. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. With regard to any actual acting, she did alright. Nothing impressive or all that expressive, actually, but she was okay. The thing that I'm most bothered about is the blatant and over-the-top over-sexing of her character. You can so obviously see why Megan Fox declined to return to the role under what I'm sure is the absolutely objectifying and misogynistic direction of Michael Bay. Of course he had to resort to casting a lingerie model! And his unprofessional-ism showed itself in the dialog as well, dismissing the character of Mikaela as 'selfish' and praising the new Carly as someone who 'loves Sam for who he is.' It read way too much like Bay getting a final few jabs in at Megan Fox through the script of his new film.<br/><br/>But there were some redeeming factors that deserve to be mentioned. First of all, the 3D in this movie was admittedly spectacular. Normally I hate 3D with a passion because the darkness added by the glasses and the inevitable headache that ensues, but I had no such problems in this film. And the action scenes were as fantastic as ever, perhaps even better than in the previous films. I must admit that the second half pulled me in and had me on the edge of my seat. There was a wonderfully epic feel to the entire Chicago storyline, which almost made up for the rest of the movie's shortcomings."
"the_rattlesnake25","4","7","16","1 July 2011"," Marginally better than the second film, but it still contains many flaws...
","Collectively the two previous live-action 'Transformers' instalments have grossed over $1.5 billion dollars worldwide between themselves in a little more than two years, so it was always inevitable that Bay and Paramount would re-team for a third film to round out the robotic trilogy. However, just like its previous cinematic instalment, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a poorly crafted, overlong, robot-infested-mess which is populated continuously with cheaply written dialogue and over-the-top acting.<br/><br/>In 1961, John F Kennedy tells the American public that they will endeavour to put a man on the moon before the end of the century, but what the American public isn't told is that the space-race has been commissioned to reach a Cybertronian craft that has become stranded on the dark side of the moon. However, nothing is never simple as it seems, as Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is once again drawn away from his post-graduate job-hunting and attractive British girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and is placed slap-bang in the middle of the reoccurring war between the Autobot protagonists, commanded by Optimus Prime, who must once again stop the villainous Megatron and his Decepticon partners from destroying planet Earth.<br/><br/>At two-and-a-half hours in length, 'Dark of the Moon' is just a long, tedious film to watch, which is primarily down to the films incredibly disjointed plot. For the first two acts of the film, Bay continuously jumps between the romantic-comedy and action-adventure sub-genres, before deciding to simply settle on an all-out extended action sequence, which then culminates in a third act which contains nothing more than exploding robots and extended scenic destruction. In between the constant on-screen destruction important plot-points are information is seemingly thrown at the audience hoping to create anything that can be seemingly considered a workable and engaging plot. Despite having a potentially workable premise in using the moon landing of 1969 to establish a link between the extra-terrestrial robots and humanity, it is instead reworked into a complex plot involving years of conspiracies that are never fully explored nor investigated.<br/><br/>Alongside the disorganized plot, Bay once again attempts to place considerable emphasis upon the actions and choices of humanity, rather than the Transformers themselves. For example, in during the beginning of the final climatic fight sequence, Sam is about to save his girlfriend himself from a dangerous, metal-laden fortress, however as Epps (Tyrese Gibson) is unable to follow due to the impending doom that lies ahead he instead offers the pesky young adult a hand-gun, just in-case he encounters any large and sophisticated robotic killing machines. This is the conclusion of a sequence which shows all the former soldiers coming together out of retirement to help Sam and the human race, before they decide that the situation is ultimately too dangerous for them. All the while the Autobots are eventually introduced back into the situation with yet another preposterous explanation that just further cements films lack of structure. This focus upon humanity isn't helped either by the stale acting and cheesy script which despite newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley attempting to work beyond stereotype she is unable to do, as the script clearly has her labelled as nothing more than 'Sam's attractive love-interest'.<br/><br/>Once again Michael Bay has attempted to circumvent the simple rules of filmmaking by filling his third Transformers film up to the brim with energetic action-sequences and detailed computer generated imagery hoping to cover the fact that it contains a convoluted and difficult plot, sub-par acting and terrible dialogue. 'Dark of the Moon' would work perfectly if the final climatic fight sequence was released as a stand-alone short film examining the effects of modern-day technology on film-making, but as a two-and-a-half-hour feature film, the third film in the Transformers franchise misses the boat (once again) completely."
"PWNYCNY","8","7","16","30 June 2011"," In this case, the format works.
","Amazingly, this is a good, robust movie. Despite the heavy reliance on special effects, the movie actually has a coherent story in which human characters figure prominently. Some of the dialog is snappy and the movie keeps the audience engaged. The principle characters are interesting and are not lost in all the noise and mayhem caused by the robots. The robots, both good and bad, are actually interesting, with humanoid features that make their behavior more plausible. One can almost feel sorry or elated when a robot is destroyed. John Malkovich and John Tuturro are especially excellent and the rest of cast give energetic performances. One is almost rooting for the good guys to win. Heroism abounds as the robots and humans join together to fight for the survival of the planet. They form a united front which transcends the obvious chasm that separates human from machine. Leonard Nimoy's voice-over work is excellent. This movie is one of the better examples of the sci-fi, action, fantasy genre. In this case, the format works."
"med77_99","3","7","16","29 June 2011"," A Hollywood joke !
","So i read an article a couple of months ago about how Micheal Bay and Spielberg worked on improving this new movie over the atrocious film that was Revenge of the fallen. And while i have noticed some improvements over the sequel, this one still fell short from becoming a good movie in my eyes.<br/><br/>So many wrong things about this movie that i don't know where to start, probably, the most thing that annoyed me, was the silly and lame humor. very silly and unrealistic characters that don't seem to take the events surrounding them seriously, especially Turturro's and Malkovic's characters, such jokes !! i don't get why someone like Malkovic agrees to do a character like that ?! And what about the embarrassing Ken Jeong ?! involved in a disaster scene that was meant to be funny !!!<br/><br/>Then comes the typical cliché characters in the American military, all pumped up and Rambo like macho men with big huge guns and gear running around and kicking A** !! lame !!<br/><br/>the Robots themselves are ridiculous with their multi English accents, some speak American accents while other speak Irish and British ! what is up with that ?<br/><br/>So here, Sam has left his old connections with the Autobots and is starting a new life looking for a job, yet he still has two robot pets, that i have no idea why they are there with him ? and as expected they are clumsy and always goofing around him for no clear reason ?!<br/><br/>No more Megan Fox, but now she is replaced with another hot model like actress, who's character is still annoying, was just casted here to be constantly saved by our hero. there was supposed to be a passionate drama like relationship between her and Sam, which was totally unrealistic and lacked in depth. She was hot undeniably, but why ? do we have to ingrain this hot image in our growing generations ? that this is what every guy should have and that this is what every girl should look like ?!?! another cheap Hollywood image that i wished they would have avoided in this film. sad !!<br/><br/>Too long, too much unnecessary scenes that could have been easily cut out, the whole Sam struggling with his family issues have been done before and grown old.<br/><br/>the Visuals and sound effects, however, were stunning, i really can't deny that, and i only saw this in 2D, people seem to like the 3D and highly praise it. definitely, very enjoyable visuals, and some of the action scenes were very brilliantly executed, but even the action lacked in certain areas and did seem unrealistic.<br/><br/>Spoiler >> so when Sam is hanging by one arm to one of the Decepticans, there was so much big and violent movements and he was dragged around like a feather, yet his arm did not get broken or his shoulder dislocated, seriously ?!<br/><br/>So to summarize, this was another Hollywood joke, lots of emphasis on visuals, which were brilliant, but no depth and no heart to it. but I'm pretty sure, a lot of people will be taken by the visuals and will think that this was the best movie ever made, the younger audience "" including my 7 years old son who actually liked this "", and it will make big bucks, but with no heart."
"VeneVidiVici","3","7","16","29 June 2011"," Do you like mindless action? Go see this ASAP.
","But for those of us who focus more on the story and characters then, you won't find too much of it here.<br/><br/>The flaws from the God-awful transformers 2 has sort-of been fixed (probably because Bay didn't write any of the script this time). But the main issues are still very visible. One of the largest problems with this movie are the human characters, you can't relate to them and we don't really get to know them at all, as such we don't really care what happens to them, which makes a lot of the scenes where people get hurt or gets close to death rather bad.<br/><br/>The awful and very miss-placed comedy is still here, while it is far from as present as it was in the second movie... It's still here. This is a really major issue since there isn't a consistent theme in the movie. For example, a lot of times when suspension is built up in the movie, it's destroyed by miss-placed toilethumour slapstick jokes which immediately breaks the tension. This was a MAJOR issue in the second one but thankfully it's not AS present in this one. Also, most of the human characters are in the movie only to serve as comedy-relief, which usually is fine but there are WAY too many comedy-relief characters in the movie which just gets annoying and breaks the tension. <br/><br/>The story is also quite bad and there are a lot of plot holes in the movie, however what annoyed me the most were the same things as in the second movie.<br/><br/>A, Unnecessary scenes) Again, there are so many scenes that contribute nothing to the story or the development of the characters, since I can't spoil anything I can't give any good examples of this, but again it's much less than the second movie (which is pretty much just a clusterf**k of unnecessary scenes) but is still very prominent.<br/><br/>B, Historical things...) This is something that I personally dislike a lot, while a lot of people probably don't care at all. The movie both ""explains"" what ""really"" happened at two major of events, one of which was a huge disaster most people probably heard of, namely the Chernobly disaster. This almost felt insulting, not only do they want us to accept such a implausible explanation, they expect us not to react on it... I mean, people died in that disaster show some respect for Christ sake. It also references other disasters via imagery.<br/><br/>C, The transformers)<br/><br/>This is supposed to be a movie about the transformers, and I still don't understand why our main characters are humans and not autobots. The transformers themselves are never really presented in a good way which means you probably won't know who's who. The only characters I could notice were Optimus Prime and Bumble Bee, luckily the autobots are easier to differentiate from the decipticons this time around. As for the decipticons, I really did not have a clue as to who's who.<br/><br/>D, The length) This movie is way... WAY too long. The ending part of the movie is almost 50 minutes long and it's just constant action which I found rather boring. I think if they cut around 35% of the movie I might consider giving it a 5.5-6 in score, but at this length it got to the point where I was looking at my watch every 5 minutes to see if it was about to end soon.<br/><br/>Conclusion)<br/><br/>If you want to see a solid action movie, then this will probably serve you rather well, however do not expect anything from the story and be prepared for poorly placed toilethumour jokes. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a ""good"" movie, then you'll have better luck elsewhere, the movie fails to deliver at everything aside from the action.<br/><br/>Final score, 3,5."

","I watched this with my sister and as much as we love and connected with the 1st film, this one is just... BLANK. It was all CGI which we've already seen before. Story was a disappointment. Rosie should just stick to modeling with her injected lips. As expected she wasn't able to capture and leave a mark with the viewers like Megan Fox did with the first two films. It was a major mistake Michael Bay let Megan Fox go.<br/><br/>As you guys may have noticed Megan Fox's name is continuously brought up when Transformers is being featured on shows like E. Usually you don't bring up an actress who has been FIRED already. Now, why is that? I guess they're hoping bringing up Megan Fox's name will help with the box office numbers.<br/><br/>Also I've noticed that Bay often compare Transformers 3 with Avatar. PLEASE! Does Michael Bay really think he can beat Avatar with this? If you're a teenage boy with passion for robots and doesn't care about the story or soul of the movie, you MIGHT enjoy this. But if you're someone HOPING THIS WOULD BE A BETTER MOVIE THAN THE 2ND ONE, forget it. It's as bad as people have feared.<br/><br/>I am impressed with how much advertising they've spent. I'm telling you Transformers 3 is ALL HYPE. Don't be swayed by the movie being featured daily on TV shows. It's all marketing. They make it seem like this one is going to be sooooo epic but it's not. Especially with the absence of Megan Fox. To think I'm even a girl! One of the reasons the 2nd movie is bearable is because of the presence of Megan Fox and now that she's gone, this 3rd installment is just UNBEARABLE replaced with a girl with injected lips.<br/><br/>Transformers 3 DID NOT DELIVER.

","The first two Transformers films, while by no means exceptional, were vaguely entertaining and I expected the third to follow in the same vein; you would not think such moderate expectations could be disappointed, but Dark of the Moon managed it. Not since Mickey Blue Eyes have I so genuinely wanted to demand my money back from the cinema.<br/><br/>This film continues for about two hours after you've completely stopped caring what happens, and every time you think it must be nearly over there's another painfully predictable ""twist"" and an excuse for another twenty minute CGI fight scene indistinguishable from all the others. The storyline is virtually nonexistent - it could have been compressed into about ten minutes. I am not normally a film-geek or bothered by goofs, but the continuity in this one was poor enough to become confusing; Optimus seemed to vary in height between ten feet and skyscraper-tall, and Huntingdon-Whitely's character is apparently able to change her clothes several times in the course of running through war-zones. The funniest aspect of the entire film was the many ways they try - and fail - to disguise how much taller Huntingdon-Whitely is than Labeouf.<br/><br/>Every character in this film is a 2D cliché, from the sleazy traitorous boss to the hard-ass intelligence director who learns to bend the rules. What John Malkovich was thinking when he agreed to go near this, I have no idea. Honestly, honestly - save your money. It's beyond terrible, and I genuinely feel like I've just been robbed. I actually resent the fact that someone has taken money off me in exchange for this absolute, utter, mind-numbing and insulting crap."

","I enjoyed Transformers. In fact, I didn't even notice the movie was bad until later. I was so excited watching Optimus and Ironhide that I didn't mind when Prime said he found Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) through eBay. I forgot most of Revenge of the Fallen; barely remember a Decepticon climbing the great pyramid which was just awful. At least had Megan Fox.<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon is very different. Is not a movie, I can say. Is a carnival, a celebration of stupidity and incoherence. A blatant mockery on the moviegoers. Sincerely, the most exasperating 150 minutes, didn't make it to the last scenes. But I guess Buzz Aldrin did not know.<br/><br/>Just like I didn't know either if there was an actual plot in the film. Apparently Michael Bay and Ehren Kruger had an idea involving Apollo 11, Chernobyl and the Trump International Hotel and Tower. They got $195 millions dollars and went through with it. I'm sure they didn't even ask an astrophysics before thinking of teleporting a planet into our exosphere. Absolute madness, some sort of vulgar comedy mixed up with a hottie (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), a lot of special effects and useless characters without persona, that is what this movie is made of.<br/><br/>A little bit of light came from Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich), Sam's boss who was genuinely funny. Sad his appearance was kind of short. John Turturro was also entertaining during some point but took big part into the senseless madness as well.<br/><br/>Definitely, we've seen the darker side of transformers, not the moon's. These people only cared about their $43,225,329 and this is the film they understood they had to make to achieve them. Congratulations!<br/><br/>I know you may think I did not speak about the movie, but trust me is not necessary. If you want to go watch it, go. I did. I just don't think your reaction will be any different than mine if your passionate about movies.<br/><br/>Always remember, you can actually loose your faith in Michael Bay."

I will give you what I thought was the good and the bad.<br/><br/>The good. 1.The action scenes in this movie are incredible intense and plain awesome. 2.I thought Sentinel was a good villain in the movie and I liked the fact that Optimus had to go up against his mentor it just added a bit more heart to the movie. 3.The script (While still not amazing) was good and I never saw Sentinels betrayal coming 4. The movie had a good amount of heart to it.<br/><br/>Now for the bad.<br/><br/>The Bad. 1.Even though the script was good for this movie it does a poor job of connecting the other two movies to this one and it just leaves a million plot holes. 2.Megatron goes from being so cool in the first movie to being such a wimp in this one its almost painful to watch. 3.Even thought I liked Sentinel he had 4 thousand chances to kill Prime an he didn't take them I mean do you want him dead or not? 4.The acting in this movie is pretty horrible. 5.The movie raps up so fast that I literally thought at the end #Wow 13 seconds ago I was watching a battle now I am watching end credits guess that's how this movie ends.#<br/><br/>Conclusion. You will like the movie if you take it for what it is. If you go any deeper then that you will tare this movie apart."

Also, the plot is really bad, and the coincidences that had to happen to make said plot anywhere near plausible are so implausible that it's nowhere near plausible. I just gave myself a headache.

","Transformers 3-D Review<br/><br/>Here's a fun little fact, the day I saw ""Transformers 3-D"" I was also working my first day in construction. The guys pulled off a carpet, had me get down on my knees, and scrape all the green glue beads off. THE ENTIRE 1ST FLOOR. As my dad put it, ""Its hard, you're gonna be tired, and you're gonna sweat like hell."" Comforting. Although I think watching this movie was the more exhausting experience.<br/><br/>Transformers 3-D (or ""Transformers 3: The Dark of the Moon"" if you want to use it's full obnoxious title) is a special effects reel. There is a plot, a plot that started with promise, the space race of the 70's was to investigate an alien spacecraft? Sure. It could be a pretty good time. But, what lead me to believe that I was in for a movie with an intriguing plot, I do not know. It is an excuse for us to see robots beat the crap out of other robots.<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time figuring a standard to hold this to. Is it a sci-fi? A war movie? Or just an eye melting sequence of special effects? I don't know because the tone waves around so much it's hard to tell. The movie has dramatic elements too. Moments where sad music plays, and people look sad, mainly Shia Labdwqiufcgydil, who looks like he's trying to have a good time while acting in this heap, and the audience is supposed to feel sad, but in reality, I just felt awkward.<br/><br/>Megan fox is gone, because... I couldn't even tell you why. Some people say she quit because Shia Labouiyfouysdfgbliu claims he ""shagged"" her. Some say she got fired because she made some statement about Hitler (?????????????) But I think her terrible acting is enough to justify it. She has been replaced with a Victoria's Secret model who's never acted before. Because that is so much better. But to be fair, she was far better than Megan. But the new girl added nothing to the movie except something pretty to look at. <br/><br/>The effects are nice. But the main problem is the length. This is a 160 minute movie. 2 HOURS AND 40 MINUTES LONG. That is quite absurd for a movie about giant robots beating the crap out of each other. The first half was kind of cool, but self indulgent, and you could cut most of it out. I could understand 2 hours. Maybe 2 hours and 10 minutes. But stretching it out for this long in such a show-offish, over-the-top manner is too unnecessary. <br/><br/>The final act of the movie would be great if they had given me a little time to breathe between action scenes and catch up with the characters, similar to the way Die Hard let me breath between explosions. Die hard worked because it was suspenseful. Because you cared about John Mclain, and wanted to see him succeed. I don't care about any of the nameless autobots, or whether they succeed (although comparing Transformers 3 to die hard isn't fair, I'll admit that) . The physics are off too. If you crash through 10 sheets of glass, you die. At the very least, you get cut a lot. And if an explosion is detonated 5 feet away from you, you die. You don't just stand there like it didn't happen. In the words of Will Ferrel: ""How do you walk away from an explosion without flinching like that? There's no way! The movie system is completely irresponsible for the way they portray explosions!"" <br/><br/>The humor is better here. It doesn't make me ROFLMFAO (I hate it when people use that expression), but I confess I chucked a few times. When it comes to comedy, Michael Bay is no Ivan Reitman, he is more Tyler Perry. The racial stereotypes are downplayed, but still there. There is more emphasis based on comedic dialogue, which he also doesn't know how to write. The worst part was the mom giving her son a self help book about woman and like, breaks the flow. I was supposed to laugh, but I was saying to myself: NOT THE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The story has tremendous holes in it's plot. THE DECEPTICONS ARE JETS! WHY DO THEY NEED A STARGATE TO TRANSPORT THEMSELVES TO EARTH! JUST FLY THERE! And why did the Autobots lead the Decepticons to Chicago to fight them? And why did the U.S. wait so long to tell the Autobots about the ship on the moon? Why not just tell them immediately? And the Decepticons' war is with the Autobots, why are they attacking humans?(this hole was brought up, but not answered.) And the guy in sector seven new about this. I think this ship on the moon would have trumped the whole ""probe on mars"" story. But I don't know if they even gave answers to this stuff because the plot was so uninteresting it lost me a lot.<br/><br/>Complaining about plot holes in transformers is pointless. This is about effects. Not more. The problem is, I grew out of effects. The first time I saw transformers when I was like 9, I could look over the story and characters because of how great and unique the effects were, but I see this kind of thing every summer. There is nothing unique, special, or memorable about this. I just felt like it wasted my time, like I payed $11 to stare at a wall. What I would like to see, is that battle of Cybertron that we hear about in every opening monologue, make that into a movie. But as for now, this is just another routine, boring popcorn movie. This is one of the hardest movies I have had to sit through, and that is that."

","Bay cannot pace a film. Bay cannot develop characters. Bay has no respect for source material. (twins,minibots,jetfire,wheeljack etc) he needs to decide if he is making a kids film or an adult blockbuster. Style is confused. Bay has some OK ideas for action sequences but the editing fails them. Bay has the most retarded sense of humour. The fans of TF could rip these movies/re-edit-revoice in some parts and maybe salvage two movies. Bay needs to stop directing with his penis. Bay needs to hire decent writers if they make a fourth and be more rigid in his design of the cgi characters. Less gimmicky more connected to each other in style shape and form.

","I knew it. This movie was a huge disappointment, I shouldn't get too excited to see movies, I've been disappointed so many times, fortunately, I won't do the same mistake again.<br/><br/>OK here we go. The main villain Shockwave appears only for some minutes on the screen and the whole movie is about 2h 30min, he's supposed to be the main villain and he doesn't appear only in the beginning and the end fight, what a huge disappointment, also, how easily he's killed, thats a let down also. In the end, it wasn't so hard to know how the movie ended. two dumb robots sabotages a Decepticon spaceship and that's the start of their downfall. Megatron is reduced to a nobody in this movie just like in the 2nd movie, that sucked so bad. When I saw the trailer,I thought that the Driller (Shockwaves pet) is hard to kill, but Optimus kills him with a single blow which cuts off his ""head"", although he has many parts which can be considered as ""heads"". This film was too obvious, you could feel how it would end. Some bad jokes like ""Megatron, lets dance tango"" said by Agent Simmons. Sigh. I hoped that some of the leader Autobots would die in this movie. Sentinel was about to kill Optimus but then, for a stupid reason, Megatron intervenes and wounds Sentinel so Optimus gains the upper hand, before killing Sentinel, Optimus kills Megatron who's easily killed, what a joke!! then he kills Sentinel. <br/><br/>Im very disappointed, thats why im only gonna give 5 stars."

"FairlyAnonymous","7","6","14","29 June 2011"," Argurably better than the first one, and just about anything is better than the second
","Well after the last transformers movie (revenge of the fallen) a lot of people lost hope in the transformers series. Actually some people lost hope after the first movie, but I personally liked it.<br/><br/>Dark of the moon takes place some time after Revenge of the Fallen, and thank goodness Sam has a new girlfriend. Honestly Megan Fox wasn't really attractive in the last movies and just kind of looked like a... ummm... not going to say slut... but you get the drift. Either way this new girl who is played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who honestly know how to act for not being in any movies before this. I found this surprising that she actually did have some acting talent, and seemed like a better match for Sam's character than Megan... but honestly who really cares about the female role. I WATCH TRANSFORMERS FOR VIOLENCE! Shockingly Dark of the Moon has a plot of sorts (I know this may sound like a stretch for Michael Bay) but it does. The plot isn't real deep or extremely engaging, but it still has one that deals with conspiracies and it actually makes sense. The visuals are over the top in this movie, and honestly the visuals are so good you don't really question if this is real life or not (scary, I know). This movie is much darker compared to the others and there are much less juvenile jokes. That was the biggest problem with the last two movies is that the autobots would do something juvenile like fart, pee on someone, or talk trash. There is a little bit of that in this movie, but much less compared to the others. The most annoying characters from the last movie are gone. Sentinel Prime is voice by Leonard Nimoy which I discovered when watching the movie and I literally turned to the guy next to me ""THAT'S LEONARD NIMOY!"".<br/><br/>This movie is really good at being what it is: A very violent robot action movie, with human characters that are there for plot reasons. The human scenes are sometimes funny (a particular bathroom scene) but sometimes they are unrealistic. Like where someone gets shoved out of a window, only to fall to their death. Everyone in the building practically laughs at the guys death, and take pictures. One guy says ""Look there is a dead guy out there, he is literally everywhere, so go clean him up."" at this scene bothered me because it is trying to be funny, but it is so dark that it doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>I'm slowly getting to this, but the action in this movie is top notch, along with the 3-D. If you are going to see this movie, see it in 3-D. The action is very detailed, has graphic robot violence, and is very epic. All of the battles are very cool and fun to watch. Seeing humans work together to take down a giant robot is also cool, though sometimes it seems like the humans weapons are overpowered. Like when the humans are using machine guns, you will see chunks of robot fall off. Another impressive battle was a road action sequence which you could compare to the road action sequence in the first movie. The only difference is that this one is bigger, and a lot cooler. The decepticons are in large numbers in this movie, but they seem to be a bit weaker, and Optimus Prime now has a crazy amount of weapons and seems like a total bad-a** when he is mowing down tons of decepticons.<br/><br/>The movie has some slight pacing issues, like the ending seems a bit too abrupt, especially if this truly is the last movie then I think there should've been a deeper ending. There are a couple moments in the movie where a whole bunch happens in about 30-seconds. Like the entire decepticon attack was viewed in a montage... slightly disappointing we didn't get to see the whole attack instead of only a couple seconds of it.<br/><br/>If you want to see a great action movie, with a fairly good plot then Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the movie for you. If you didn't like the first movie than you might not like this one... you notice I didn't even mention the second movie there? Either way see this movie in 3D and you will definitely enjoy it. Did I mention the ending action sequence is over an hour long?"
"gregeichelberger","6","6","14","29 June 2011"," Franchise rises above part two's sub-standard effort
","After a fine first effort in the action/adventure department with the first ""Transformers,"" the series ran into major writer's block (as well as a writer's strike) with the horrid second installment. And while still not up to the inaugural's standard, the newest release, ""Transformers: Dark Of the Moon,"" is a decent addition and captures - somewhat - that movie's intense action scenes, as well as much of the humor. <br/><br/>It actually could have been even better if not for the female lead (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - I never thought I would miss the acting talents of Megan Fox), who is nothing but eye candy in high heels.<br/><br/>After the confusion of the end of part two, with no one knowing what was going on and which robot was fighting which, this edition begins with the defeated Deceptacons in exile while the Autobots are involved in an uneasy co-operation with their human hosts. Acting as international peacekeepers, they are soon called upon to answer a decades-old rumor about beings on the Moon, as well as other alien conspiracies.<br/><br/>When Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) travels to the lunar surface to bring back his former leader, Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), with several ""space bridge"" pillars, a plan is fomented that may bring the robots back to the brink of war again - with the measly humans once again caught in the middle. Meanwhile, Sam (Shia LeBeouf) is trying to secure a low-level entry position in a company run by the wacky John Malkovich (this despite dating an international supermodel).<br/><br/>At this firm, he runs into the spaced-out Jerry Wang (Ken Jeong, ""The Hangover 2"") and learns of the goings-on over at the dark side of the Moon. Also in place is former Cia agent Seymour Simmons (John Turturro, ""Cars 2""), and current Central Intelligence deputy director, Mearing (Francis McDormand). When the Primes begin to fight amongst themselves, exiled Megatron (Hugo Weaving) makes its long awaited appearance.<br/><br/>Battle sequences are appropriately loud and violent, while the addition of blood pouring from the gaping wounds of the machines will be a welcome sight for most 14-year-old boys in the audience. The decibels are still there from part two, but the distractions have been kept to a minimum. <br/><br/>Director Michael Bay, who learned the art of subtly and nuance on the set of ""Pearl Harbor,"" also wisely puts back much of the comedic touch that made the original so successful. Sure, Sam's dopey parents are still here (thankfully, for just a few scenes), but there are some real laughs in this version. Makovich, Joeng, Turturro and Alan Tudyk (""3:10 To Yuma,"" Steve the Pirate in ""Dodgeball"") are the one's responsible for most of the giggles.<br/><br/>As far as the CGI work, it's something we have come to expect from this franchise, but the work is seamless in this film, as well; and with apocalyptic conflicts going on, with half of the city of Chicago destroyed, the graphics department acquitted themselves nicely. Overall, ""Transformers: Dark Of the Moon"" does what it sets out to do, entertain the masses and rake in millions at the box office.<br/><br/>It's not Shakespeare, but I did not expect it to be. It's a two-plus hour ride that will leave one mentally unstimulated but a bit physically exhausted, and during the long hot days of summer, that's not an entirely bad thing."

","Sometimes you simply get proved wrong. I was wrong and I admit it.<br/><br/>When I saw the first Transformers movie, I thought I was seeing something that advanced the cinematic vocabulary. The movie was still otherwise worthless, and the advance was in the service of crass goals. But an effective evolution in how we see things is a big deal. What I saw was expert editing that in the action scenes gave us just a bit less information than we needed to understand what was going on. These edits had compositional energy so that in general we got caught in the swirl of the battle, experiencing the fog of war.<br/><br/>This, I thought was a big deal, because there is only so much you can do visually. You are delivering an entire world and interacting within that world at the same time. It should be impossible. I qualified my comment at the time by remarking that this also saves money; since you never have time to fully comprehend a special effect, they can be designed or rendered with less fidelity.<br/><br/>The second film continued the tradition, with less freshness. This one abandons it altogether and presents itself no differently than your average Marvel bravado. It has a different editor, so that makes sense. But for the first time, the franchise has decided to enter the premium ticket market with three D and IMAX. Ticketbuyers who pay the extra moola want clear confirmation that the extra detail is worth it. So the whole enterprise has had its one redeeming value ripped out. The world we glimpsed was coming has had its transport beams destroyed.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

Do your part and earn citizenship. Oh wait, we're not there...just yet.<br/><br/>I fault the viewers who buy a ticket to this. That includes yours truly. Because as long as these things double or triple their budgets, it's still gonna get made. Number 4 is in the making and it's our fault.<br/><br/>An awful film that deserves an awful review: 1 out of 10."
"GeneralC22","8","5","11","29 June 2011"," Everything i could have hoped for in the final Transformers
","(May contain minor spoilers)<br/><br/>This is the sequel i've been waiting for since the first Transformers film. Not an overly loud, sex joke ridden mess, but an action packed, well acted, a**-kicking action flick. Do i think this is going to win any awards? Not by a long shot. I do, however, think that this may be the best of the trilogy, and is without a doubt the perfect summer blockbuster. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that i went into this film with low expectations, but high hopes. And boy, did Bay deliver. While some of the more immature humor is still there, its not nearly as awkward or misplaced as Revenge of the Fallen. And the action? Never been better. This is the kind of movie that gets the audience so hyped up that people holler and cheer when the heroes get the upper hand in a fight.<br/><br/>Now on to the acting. With Megan Fox gone, and Sam's parents left with little screen time, i can safely say that this movie had the best acting of the trilogy. Shia is, as always, outstanding, and Patrick Dempsey delivers a very good performance considering his short time on screen compared to other major characters. The surprise here is the newcomer, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who, for a first timer, delivers a solid performance.<br/><br/>Am i going to suggest that you see this movie based solely on what i think? Absolutely not. But i will say that, as a fan of Transformers from a young age and a big fan of the Bay films, i loved this movie"
"DonFishies","7","5","11","28 June 2011"," This epic conclusion will make a Transformers fan out of everyone
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Michael Bay's finest achievement. It is not his best film (that honour will always reside with The Rock), but it is his most mature film to date. After disappointing everyone including himself with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Bay went back to the drawing board with the final film in his robotic orgy of mayhem and destruction, and rehauled just about everything. While the results are not perfect, it shows that he may not be quite the hack we always thought he was. And that he knows exactly how to end things with a bang.<br/><br/>Picking up a few years after the travesty involving the Fallen, Dark of the Moon revolves around secret government coverups, the US/Russian space race of the 1960s, high-level assassinations, secret counter- terrorism ops involving the Autobots, and Sam Witwicky's (Shia LaBeouf) search to find his place in the world. <br/><br/>It may sound just as busy as the previous two films, but Dark of the Moon manages to let the story flow organically through the first two acts. It feels significantly more grounded immediately after it starts, and all the threads manage to lead somewhere. And rather surprisingly, there are very little action scenes splitting up the story beats. It stalls in some places due to a serious lack of editing, but I am willing to give more than enough credit to Bay and writer Ehren Kruger for composing something that actually held my interest and did not lose me twenty minutes in. The government intrigue and the blending of the Apollo 11 mission and infamous space race into the story was so incredibly well done that you almost forget you are watching a film about robots that can turn into cars. <br/><br/>But what is really impressive about the film is how grown up it feels. When I watched Transformers and Revenge of the Fallen, I knew I was watching slickly produced movies primarily sold to teenagers and young males. While watching Dark of the Moon, it felt like it was catering to a more adult audience. The dark nature of the film is simply astounding, and becomes downright brutal in some areas. I was really surprised by Bay's go-for-broke style, but it works for the tone the film strives for. There are more than a few shocking moments sprinkled throughout that really push the PG-13 rating of the film. I predict that some parents may take immediate issue with how violent the film becomes.<br/><br/>While the dark nature of the film flows throughout its excessive running time, the story comes to a screeching halt when it hits the third act and the massive battle scene begins. You may have read that it lasts almost an hour, and it comes pretty close. It is an absolutely insane, balls-to-the-wall action piece that simply needs to be seen to be believed. The blend of special effects, practical effects and 3D effects is simply outstanding. The addition of the real 3D effects helps make the battle, and the robot antagonists, feel more real than ever. Bay has staged some awesome fights in the previous two films, but this ridiculous heart-stopping battle is simply incredible and outdoes every single one. It is worth the price of admission alone, Transformers fan or not.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a Transformers film, so it is not without its fault. The 3D may be the best since Avatar, but it never really comes alive until the final act of the film. Leading up to that, it is just as underwhelming as every other 3D film you have seen recently. And as you likely have guessed, the film is far too long for its own good. Some scenes drag themselves out unnecessarily, and others are cut up way too quick. <br/><br/>But what really drags it out is the obscene level of comedy taking place before the epic battle starts. I mentioned how adult the film is, but it still attempts to bring in the child audience with goofy jokes and ridiculously zany performances from John Malkovich, John Turturro, Alan Tudyk and especially Ken Jeong. The previous two films seemed like they had a few too many jokes, but here they just feel forced and overdone. It makes the film feel desperate in some scenes to evoke the dark tone it is aiming for, and in other scenes feels like a complete betrayal. <br/><br/>Acting wise, there are not a lot of standouts. LaBeouf does his usual scared hero routine, and both Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do their usual ass kicking routine. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is absolutely stunning eye-candy as Sam's new squeeze Carly, and she wisely does not even attempt to act. Frances McDormand does well in a thankless turn as a CIA honcho, but Patrick Dempsey is likely the only human character who gets to chew scenery and not overact while doing it. I have yet to be impressed with him as a film actor, but he gives a great performance here easily outshining everyone not playing a robot. Voicewise, Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving are excellent as always, as is the absolutely impeccable Leonard Nimoy playing Sentinel Prime.<br/><br/>I wanted to love Transformers: Dark of the Moon for everything that is done right and all the mistakes it makes up for. But it still has its share of problems that seem to be characteristic of the franchise more than anything else. Yet, do not let these issues hold you back from experiencing the sheer absurdity of Bay's robot opera. It is a wild event, and one of the few true worthwhile blockbusters we have seen this summer. After being disappointed by the previous two films, I can say without fault that I was made a fan by this film. I just wish I did not have to wait for three movies to make it happen.<br/><br/>7/10.<br/><br/>(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"paul_haakonsen","6","2","3","31 December 2015"," Visually impressive...
","I grew up with the 80's cartoon and love it, but the movie adaptations just never really cut it for me. It just didn't have that same appeal and just never felt like it was properly being ""Transformers"".<br/><br/>And I guess that having Shia LaBeuof in the lead was the deal breaker for me. That actor just doesn't bring anything good with him and he is annoying in his acting, just to be blunt. So he wasn't helping sell the movie adaptations to me. However, the amazing voice cast for the Autobots and Decepticons, now that was impressive. And especially since many voices from the 1980's series are back, that was just downright awesome.<br/><br/>As with all Michael Bay movies, this was a continuous explosion. If you enjoy lots of action and explosions, then you will be more than happy with this 2011 movie.<br/><br/>Story-wise, well, the movie was good enough for what it was, and it was entertaining enough for what it was. Just don't expect a Shakespearian experience.<br/><br/>This is solely a special effects movie. And I will say that the special effects and CGI team did an amazing job with ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon""."

Action and stunts are great and will not disappoint for hardcore action lovers.

"t-46717","6","1","1","1 March 2019"," Rosie impressed me most
","What impressed me most in Transformers: Dark of the Moon was Ky's advertisement and Rosie. The advertisements were inevitable, which I was used to it and did not affect my watching. Rosie impressed me most deeply that her contradiction existed between action and high heels. So in the process of hijacking, escaping and fighting, although she had no time to wash her face, she changed several pairs of shoes."
"zwu-64457","6","1","1","9 January 2019"," A good story, but too much advertisements
","The plot of Transformers 3 is still simple, but it is the most complex of the three. There are conspiracy, deception, strategy and turning point. The music matches very well with some very sad place, the music surpasses the first two parts and the rendering is very good. I feel that the Bumblebee was not very cute this time. Maybe it's because there are too many advertisements. I hope the advertisers pay attention to propriety, so that I can watch the plot well."
"aarongooderham","7","1","1","22 June 2014"," It is not that bad
","So I am a big transformers fan. I have seen this film a couple of times but I don't believe it deserves all the hate it has been getting. Sure it is filled with loads of clichés like the main characters always survive big explosions and stuff. But there is so many things to love about this film such as the special effects. I am not going to start ranting about the reasons that it was probably the worst entry in the franchise so far but one of the things that annoyed me was actually in the plot were SPOILER ALERT Megatron has just taken down Sentinel and him and Optimus have there final battle in which one of them will die I was really annoyed with the way Megatron went down with such a little fight I mean Optimus had 1 arm and Megatron was very weak so I was expecting a real great final fight to the death. but within 10-15 seconds Megatron was dead. This really ruined the film for me. Overall though this film was everything it was meant to be with the same black magic that Michael Bay always whips up so generally this film was great for fans of the series. I do recommend you watch the first 2 entries into the series as you will be a bit muddled with the plot. This is a great way for some Transformers fans to kill 2 hours of there life."
"user-543-975655","7","1","1","12 June 2014"," Excellent
","Since Transformers: Age of Extinction is coming out in two weeks, I decided to re-watch all of the old Transformers movies. After watching the first movie and reviewing it, I decided to review all of the movies. I really liked this movie, which was surprising because I didn't remember liking it this much. I really enjoyed the 2 1/2 hour movie. It was very long, but I still enjoyed it. Just like the second movie, I felt like some of the scenes were dragged out way too much, which is why I gave it a 7 instead of an 8 or a 9. Just like the second movie, I was happy with the absence of a shaky camera. It made the battles much more enjoyable, and made the movie way better. Even though I gave this movie the same rating as Revenge of the Fallen, I think Revenge of the Fallen was a tiny bit better. It was more pleasant. This movie was so dark that I had a hard time believing that it was a Transformers movie. Don't get me wrong, it was still really good, but it was also very dark. The acting in this movie was once again outstanding, and Shia Labeouf did a great job adapting to his new character. He was still Sam, but his attitude completely changed, and he did a wonderful job. Rosie Huntington-Whitely did a good job filling in for Megan Fox. I thought the movie would've been a little better if Fox was still Sam's girlfriend. Whitely still did a wonderful job, though. Every single person did another wonderful job in this movie with acting. The Transformers really is a good series for acting. The series is also amazing for special effects. Everything looks so great that the battles and the robots and everything else that isn't real looks real. Transformers 1,2,3 and probably 4 are one of the best displays of visual effects I have ever seen. I like how there is always so much detail in all of the Autobots and Decepticons. Their emotions are so easily displayed that you are sympathetic for them when one of them dies (the Autobots, mainly), which really makes them more human, and all of their moving parts go together without a problem, and their transformations are once again awesome. That is another thing I like about this movie. They aren't just regular, stereotypical robots. They are original, and are very realistic. As with the second movie, the setting changed. Well, the final battle of the first film was in New York, and the final battle in Dark of the Moon was in Chicago, which are different cities, but still cities. But the scale of the battle increased at least 20 times. Maybe even more. This made the battles more grandiose, and way more fun to watch. Also, the story thankfully changed again. The introduction of so many new Decepticons was awesome. I was looking for a lot of new Transformers. Ehren Kruger and Michael Bay did such a good job creating some new Transformers that it was almost as if this was a different series. The dialogue was another great thing in this movie. The actors said their lines perfectly, and displayed their emotions perfectly once again. Steve Jablonsky (composer) did a great job once more with this installment of the series, and used Arrival to Earth again as a main theme, which is good. That's all I have to say about Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Thanks for reading. See ya."
"prameen_2007","10","7","18","28 June 2011"," Transformers: Dark of the Moon the best of the series
","The best of the series from the hats of Michael Bay, Special hats off to him and Steven Spielberg for the amazing special visual effect. Inclusion of the human struggle for freedom against the new treat is an added stroy line tat supports the play. Sound effects awesome. 3D effects spellbound.And a special thanks to the writer Ehren Kruger for overcoming Revenge of the fallen with a superb script. The chase of the autobots from Earth to the moon for the Cybertronian spacecraft sets the plot with couple of twist (three in fact).Rosie Huntington-Whiteley she is damn nice compared to Mikaela who ditched our dear old ""Messenger"" or ""Alien Badnews Magnet"" boy Sam. Inclusion of Sams parents was quite unnecessary while concentrating on human-decepticon killing agent could was a new kind of plot missing in the previous flicks. And as always one person to stand in the way of Sam :Frances McDormand(Mearing) was good. John Malkovich's small cameo was interesting especially the embrassing part of Sam. The new ally of Sam is also does his part well (John Turturro) Former agent Simmons. Overall for those crazy action flick geeks and for first timers its a really a good movie to watch."
"Coydawg5204","1","6","15","5 July 2011"," Schlock
","So,... how many successive action beats does it take for a movie to degenerate into a chaotic mess? Well, it took me about an hour into this turkey to realize I had wasted my money. So let me break this down...<br/><br/>First off effects are a tool for telling stories, when the effects become the story then we have no story. This movie is nearly three hours of very nice explosions and dynamic fight scenes. If these are the reasons that you go to the movies then this will be perfect for you. My nine year old nephew loved it. I like a coherent plot and character development, neither of which occurred here.<br/><br/>Also, I think the filmmakers did a grave diservice to the new female lead in the franchise. The first time you see her on screen all you get to see is her ass. She delivers her first dialog while the camera is zoomed in tight on her posterior. It was very clear why she was put in the movie and quite frankly it was gratuitous, tasteless, and disrespectful to her.<br/><br/>So my recommendation is gonna have to be to skip this overblown, overlong schlock fest and rent the 1985 Transformers animated movie instead, a far superior story..."
"judywalker2","3","6","15","29 June 2011"," Pitiful excuse to show off an ugly blonde
","I knew Transformers 3 would be bad as no one had reviewed it in advance. That's always a bad sign. Also all the talk about Megan Fox not being in the movie and Shia shooting his mouth off also was tip off. This movie seems to be an excuse to show off an ugly blonde woman who seems not to know that there is any other color clothing but white and wears inappropriate attire to work. Every time I say Rosie Huntington- Whiteley on the screen all I could think of was Edna Mose and her summation of super models ""stupid little stick figures with poofy lips"". Not only is she ugly but she's the worst actress I have ever seen. She and Shia have absolutely no chemistry but Michael Bay must have been in love with her as he shot so many scenes of just her and her body that it started becoming ridiculous.<br/><br/>Let me just say from a females perspective, Megan Fox might not have been great but her character was at least well written and we women appreciated the fact that she could get herself out of trouble without Sam. She didn't slow him down and she sure as hell would never have tried to stop him from saving his best and most trusted friend-Bumble Bee. Just for that he should have kicked Carly to the curb.<br/><br/>As far as the plot, well we all know there wasn't one. Just one robot battle scene after another. As far as the humor and annoying characters were concerned, it wasn't as bad as Transformers 2. And these characters weren't half as annoying as the supermodel girlfriend. John Malkovich was wasted. Turturro was his usual. Tudyk and Jeong were funny. I really was disappointed that they used Leonard Nimoy the way they did. Some of the special effects were nice.<br/><br/>The whole movie just makes you have to ask yourself what was Steven Spielberg thinking when he saw the finished product, hard to believe that he's sunk this far with his craft.3/10"

Then, less than half way through the movie I was wondering why I was still sitting in my seat. Being as I was with 2 other people I respected their wishes to stay & tried to get comfy enough to sleep off the rest of the film.<br/><br/>You would think after the last 2 movies they would have a budget big enough to have a better story line & less Team America!<br/><br/>To be honest I'd rather just forget I was ever there."
"DICK STEEL","5","8","22","30 June 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Transformers: Dark of the Moon
","Some things never change in a Michael Bay film, and one enters his world knowing fully well what to expect, no matter what he's directing. Granted the army is back in full force once again, as are various quasi-government agencies, but toned down are the tremendous recruitment ra-ra moments that defined Revenge of the Fallen, although you can't help but to chuckle at how Bay is determined to show us the perfect US-led world with the Autobots now being at the beck and call of the American military to take out rogue nations and groups that pursue unsanctioned nuclear ambition. Well if you can't do it in real life, do it in film in time for a 4th of July salute, can't you?<br/><br/>Then there's the token female characters, one babe in Rose Huntington-Whiteley's Brit bombshell Carly taking over the fired Megan Fox whose character in the previous two movies got written off through no less than two mentions that she had dumped Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky with many characters exalting Carly's ""great"" qualities, and the other the brainier Mearing of NSA played by Frances McDormand looking really frumpy. In Bay's universe, hot babes get to drive sleek sports cars and pout incessantly, and in what would be a laughable moment, have enough charms to casually chat with one of the main villains in the show reminding him that he should be vicious, when the villain should have just swatted her away like an insect.<br/><br/>But there are some plus points to amuse a Transformers fan. For instance, the much loved Laserbeak gets featured here in its nasty glory, being one heck of a powerful opponent with espionage its main weapon in orchestrating much of the Decepticon web of deceit, though its combination with Soundwave was one scene too little. Then there's Shockwave looking too up to date save for his cyclops eye and owning a gigantic pet worm that you see in the trailer, and Optimus Prime finally having his trailer put to good use in more than one battle sequence. Yes, it is up to these little things that keeps things interesting for fans and the casual viewer, but that's about it, as the big bang finale treaded on familiar ground covered in recent science fiction films such as Battle: Los Angeles - this one becoming Battle: Chicago - and Skyline with its alien invasion theme with alien planes peppering the sky, and aliens flexing their superior firepower with reducing masses of humans into ash.<br/><br/>Effort has been put into resisting the temptation to have too many robots show up on screen pulverizing each other in close combat, and having Bay's slow motion to show off some cool stunts involving humans and robots (Bumblebee seems to be the favourite to have to slow down), but for all the loud, mind numbing and eardrum busting action going all around during the action sequences, there's this distinct lack of villainy in the movie, with action sequences being overly long and losing their impact and focus.We get tons of faceless and nameless Decepticons yet again, with plenty of action in the huge finale focused on the humans and the soldiers/mercenaries, but little on the robots. I mean, if Optimus Prime can be temporarily forgotten since he's stuck in a bunch of wires dangling upside down from some broken building, something is wrong.<br/><br/>There are also supporting characters galore, some returning from the previous film such as John Turturro's Simmons, now a multi-millionaire thanks to his best selling book, and the likes of military men Lennox (Josh Duhamel) now made Colonel, and Tyrese Gibson's Epps, and new ones with John Malkovich and Ken Jeong in minor roles, with Patrick Dempsey's Dylan being written in to be in stark contrast to Sam Witwicky as humans who share similar robot-related ancestry, but it doesn't matter since no acting chops are required to star in this film, only the willingness to spout incredibly bad lines, and look cool/nerdy. What Buzz Aldrin (the real Buzz Aldrin) is doing in this film, is something of a mystery in itself too, other than to lend some gravitas to the created back story on the space race.<br/><br/>The IMAX 3D presentation wasn't all that impressive given the trumpeting of using technology that gave rise to Avatar, and felt for the most parts a 2D film instead, since most of the action sequences were converted to 3D in post. So you just might want to save money on this and go for a digital presentation which will suffice. Will this be the final Transformers film? I suppose the millions in revenue will make it hard for the studio to say no, but whether Bay will be back for another round, well it's anyone's guess. At least this installment was more entertaining than the previous one, but it still doesn't offer much and is at risk of running stale. There's only so much that the robots can do on Earth that we haven't already seen before in 3 movies."

"chaz-28","2","5","12","9 August 2011"," Just because it is a third installment doesn't mean it must be a farce
","The third (and hopefully final) installment in the Transformers franchise is just as weak as its immediate predecessor and far weaker than the opening salvo in the trilogy. The scenario setup had promise though. The Apollo program and the space race were an elaborate front to get to the moon and check out a UFO which crash landed there. This crashed ship turns out to be a casualty from Cybertron and naturally holds some cargo which both the Autobots and Decepticons desire. These events are combined with more historical fiction including Chernobyl and with quality writing could really have taken off somewhere intriguing. Unfortunately, Michael Bay chose to focus on an extremely uncharismatic Shia LeBeouf and his insecurities of unemployment, jealousy concerning his girlfriend, and wishing he had more recognition from his previous attempts to save humanity. To extend an even bigger weakness, John Turturro is also back again and now seems like even more of a Daffy Duck sidekick instead of an actual human being. <br/><br/>Michael Bay tries harder this time to make the hand-to-hand combat amongst machines work but anyone sitting in the audience will continue to find it quite challenging to tell the difference between Autobot and Decepticon until they somehow untangle themselves. Also, the humans scurrying around beneath their robotic feet while dodging falling bits of building somehow never get accidentally squished which should really give a lot of credit to the machines situational awareness.<br/><br/>The Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, reprised his ministerial role and speaks only in philosophical platitudes which contribute nothing to anyone and is most likely why he receives far less screen time to perch on his soap box and spout them at whoever is unlucky enough to be in the room when he begins a sermon. His speeches resemble a page-a-day motivational calendar. <br/><br/>The female lead this time, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is not Megan Fox but is interchangeable enough that it does not matter. Casting also added ensured the new accent brought a British accent with her to make her even sexier to the American male audience. The first hour of the film has her getting in and out of quite a few low-riding vehicles in extremely short dresses which have most of the audience straining to catch a glimpse. I wonder if Megan Fox left this series before or after she read this script; she dodged a bullet here. <br/><br/>The new additions of Patrick Dempsey, Francis McDormand, and John Malkovich hold their own with limiting material but Ken Jeong's character is just flat out ridiculous. John Turturro is already in the film to provide the lame comic relief; adding Jeong helped make the first hour even worse than it was already shaping up to be."

","I didn't actually see the other two Transformers, so that may have been a hindering factor. But when I saw this, it put me off the other two. I saw this in 2D about two weeks after it came out. I thought it was going to be awesome. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The action sequences were loud and fun just like they should be, but the rest was actually so bad it was funny. Every line of the dialog was incredibly cheesy. Another hindering factor is it's length. Clocking in at just over two and a half hours, all the other crap can get you bored quickly. About two days before I saw Harry Potter, which is two hours ten but it felt a lot shorter. Transformers, however, actually felt like the two and a half hours it is. As most of the action didn't come in until about forty five minutes in I quickly got bored.<br/><br/>So overall, this is probably the worst film I've seen this year. I give it 3 out of 10."

","Dark of the Moon definitely redeemed itself from part two but it still was somewhat of a disappointment. There was no need to cast the girl in this movie. She contributed absolutely nothing to this film and I thought it was a low blow to insult Megan Fox during the film. It was so obvious that there was no chemistry between Shia and Rosie and her acting was terrible. (not that Megan Fox's was any better). The only thing I enjoyed was Optimus Prime kicking major butt. The two little robots was pointless as well. Thankfully I purchased my tickets through Groupon for $2 because I would've been heated spending $10 on this. Definitely could've waited for On Demand."

","I remember when I saw the first Transformers. I was blown away by the special effects. Robots, intent on destroying the world. Pretty trippy stuff. The second one was, in my opinion, just like the first, but still such an amazing concept with even better special effects that I couldn't help but like it. Now that the third movie is out, it's really lost all of the original quality. The acting is simply awful and it isn't helped by the ridiculously poor dialogue.

","Michael Bay and Transformers 3 Writers: Take Notes.<br/><br/>Story: Apollo 11 really went up to investigate an Autobot ship that crashed into the moon. The whole thing was covered up, happy day. OK, here begins my first beef with the film. Just how many things 'happen' to crash on/near Earth? A giant cube, OK. Ancient transformers planting a device to harvest energy from the sun...stretching it. Now a huge bloody ship crashing into the moon carrying the means to teleport a whole planet...no. <br/><br/>Moving on...Shia LaBeouf...you were a perfectly reasonable relatable tie to humanity in a otherwise machine-dominated movie, but Michael you must understand: your movie is called Transformers. This is what viewers like myself are paying to see...and you have no business naming it as such if your focal point...and the only point you seemed to care about in this film, is how much Sam Witwicky needs a job. And while we're on the subject of old Sam, Mike. Why, oh why if you had such a hard-on not to have Megan Fox in this film, did you replace her with the stale, botox injected, simply god-awful piece of wanna-be-eye-candy that appeals to 40 year-old virgins still clinging to a hope of getting with Cameron Diaz, that is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley? Thankfully, you had the good sense to only refer to the plausible reason Megan Fox was not in the movie with only a millisecond of dialogue, but it was a millisecond of BS. I mean, come on. They discovered an alien race together, helped save humanity not once but twice. I think a marriage would at least be in order here. OK, I'm done ranting on why Megan should have REALLY been in this movie. Other characters featured included Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson as the awesome NEST team commanders, the latter retired. Regardless, they are still bad ass in this film, and I was greatly pleased to see them returned. However with the parents...I had issues with their inclusion. It felt...the best word would be off. It's as though, Mike, you 'forced' them into the movie, whereas in the other two movies it seemed plausible and natural. Now on the Transformers side of the equation I was giddy...yes I said giddy...that you at least included Shockwave in the film. This was a good call in the writing department. And Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime, he's been doing voices for years since the days of Spock so it fit very well. <br/><br/>Now for the REAL thorns in my side. I feel betrayed. No, let me rephrase that, I believe this film has betrayed three characters. Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Sam Witwicky. First with the least important (sorry, die hards): Sam. At one point in the film, Sam is 'forced' under threat of girlfriend death (oh what a tragic loss that would be) to gather intelligence on Optimus' plans after Sentinel goes ass-kickery on the NEST team. Now in the first two movies, you have essentially created Sam as a morally 'good' archetype, ethically doing the right thing even under the threat of losing his own life. I mean, he risked life and limb (including his girlfriend-at-the time, played by Megan) to save Optimus Prime, so why, oh why, idiot writers did you suddenly decide that Sam should be morally ambiguous and put him in a situation where he ACTUALLY complies with the demands and betrays Optimus? Next Megatron. At one point in the film Rosie actually has the gall to stride right up to Megatron (taking a chill pill in an alley with all hell breaking loose all-around, might I add) and convinces him that Sentinel is going to betray him. OK, #1- What is Megatron doing lazing about in an alley? #2- Why is he listening to a 'pitiful human insect' and #3- Let's say Megatron believes her, why would he let said insect live afterwards? And 4, finally oh #4- Megatron ACTUALLY swoops in to save Optimus Prime, his sworn enemy and Nemesis, from the maniacal Sentinel Prime...like a misunderstood bad guy. Face it kids, if you knew anything about Transformers lore past and present, you know Megatron is NOT misunderstood. He is as good an archetype of evil and badness if there ever was one. So him coming in to save Optimus is a betrayal of the character. Now finally, Optimus, poor Optimus, you were forced to make many errors for the sake of terrible writing. #1- You LIED. You LIED to your friend Sam. You let him believe, and even ordered Bumblebee to let him believe you were going to leave humanity to its fate. You are the symbol of all that is good and just. A soldier, at heart, but still a decent being of...metal. You...do...NOT...LIE. #2- At the end, Megatron saves your life by defeating Sentinel and leaving him prostrate and crippled before you. How do you return the act of good Megatron for some weird reason conveyed? You kill him, and then you kill a Sentinel Prime that is begging for mercy before you. You have turned Optimus...you have turned to the dark side.<br/><br/>Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your viewpoint, the series has been stopped dead and I would seriously be mortified if they tried to force a number four out of the franchise, with all of the big character deaths and horrid story changes, this series may have to slumber for 20-30 years before resurrection. Peter Cullen, I know you'll be 90 to 100 by that point, but I do sincerely hope you may be able to help us out once more when we're in need of Transformers awesomeness and the overpaid writers in Hollywood are sent into exile over what they've done here..."
"adam-scrivner","2","5","12","11 July 2011"," Possibly the worst film I have ever seen
","****May contain spoilers for this awful movie**** <br/><br/>Concise review: Rubbish, even worse than Avatar. Spend your money on something else.<br/><br/>Extended review: Despite having heard nothing good about this film, I was quite excited about going to see it. Transformers was pretty good, Transformers 2 was pretty bad, but I hoped that Michael Bay would at least make something approaching an effort with the third instalment of this money-spinning franchise.<br/><br/>Right...here goes...<br/><br/>Plot: there actually is one, and if you pay attention during the first soul-destroying hour then you can try to follow it, although by the end of the film you will realise that such plot as there is completely fails to make any logical sense. In a nutshell, Sentinel Prime (an Autobot) was escaping from Cybertron with some new technology, but the Decepticons shot up his ship and he drifted through space until he crashed into the moon. Later it transpires that Sentinel had made a pact with Megatron to work together, so why then was his ship being attacked at all?? Some nonsense about the space programme is chucked in to confuse and add idiocy.<br/><br/>Characters: Sam Witwitless returns as the slightly unconvincing wet who has amazingly attracted a model as his new ho. He continues to be annoying at every turn. His wench (I cannot even remember her name) is paper thin with no personality. The CGI characters are, as one would expect, almost completely lacking depth, aside from the fact that I went to see this film in 3d. Sam's parents return briefly for no obvious reason to reprise their roles and earn a few quid. There are some other characters but nobody who stands out in any way. Towards the end it is very difficult to distinguish between individual transformers as they start to all look the same.<br/><br/>Acting: Shia Lebeef manages to struggle unconvincingly throughout the film, although excels himself when being ""terrified"". Rosie Huntingdon-Poshbird doesn't act at all, simply because she clearly cannot. The long, lingering shots of her bum and legs at the beginning of the film clearly indicate why she was chosen - in fairness, she is quite tasty for a skinny bird, although after the first 30 minutes of the film her permanent pouty-lipped look makes you want to put a paper bag over her face, or at least a photo of Megan Fox. Mr Spok (Leonard Nimoy) is an interesting choice for the voice of Sentinel Prime. Overall the standard of acting is somewhat low, as one would expect.<br/><br/>Effects: There are lots of amazing CGI effects and stuff but personally I would have preferred 50% of the CGI budget to have been spent on the screenplay.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: Lots of overly cheesy music utterly spoils what atmosphere was present. Way too loud, too.<br/><br/>Length: At 2.5 hours long, this film is a killer. The first hour contained nothing of note and could have been put in the bin. At 90 minutes the film could have been slightly watchable.<br/><br/>One last thing: I would really like my money back. This film is on a par with National Lampoon's Men In White."
"PartialMovieViewer","1","5","12","9 July 2011"," Trashformers; Garbage on the Screen
","Rating this movie was tough since there were no NEGATIVE numbers. Pure vomit on the screen. I cannot believe I was so stupid to pay HARD earned money for this dribble. I hear Hollywood elitists bash greedy big business, fat-cats all the time. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! OK - OK - let me chill a little. I will start by saying I saw the first movie in this series and it was funny and entertaining. Additionally it had a solid plot and some pretty good acting. This movie had none of the above. Well - not really. The beginning sequence was very well done, and it did grab my attention. From this point the movie took a nose dive into the abyss known as the cavern of crappy flicks - what was I thinking. I should have seen the writing on the wall and left. I do not know how many words equate to celluloid dung – whatever they are – this movie earns all of them. The story depended 100 percent on special effects and those things called script and talented performers - well that concept was quickly tossed in the can and flushed. I saw the name, 'Spielberg' - which used to really mean something. When Mr. Speiilberg put his name to something, it was going to be quality. Jaws - ET - Schindler's List - the resume is huge and so impressive. Alas he is now nothing more than another greedy Hollywood fat-cat. Maybe I am too harsh on Mr. Spielberg, but this guy - Michael Bay. I will remember this person's name. I will ensure to see NOTHING he puts out in the future. The only movies he has done that were worth seeing (in my book at least) were Armageddon and the first Transformers. Until the name recognition kicked in, we were thinking about seeing. 'I am Number 4', now that I know he did it, I won't waste a number 2 on it. Trashformers III obviously appeals to some...and that is great. I am just not part of that demographic and will pay attention more to who produces and who directs in the future."

","Quite simply one of the worst movies ever made. I love crappy summer block buster movies. I love huge CGI over the top nonsense.

There is a very short list though, of movies I loathe, detest, despise. Eyes Wide Shut. 300. Pan's Labrynth. And now I must add Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Both Peter Travers and Roger Ebert describe the movie perfectly, and give the appropriate zero stars; so a review here is unnecessary. This is for anyone thinking they might go see this horrible waste of film- donate the money to charity. Starving children in Africa deserve your money more than Michael Bay. <br/><br/>Horrid."
"shtk1979","4","5","12","6 July 2011"," Big and shiny, but not much substance...
","Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon is one of those quintessential action-fantasy-flicks that unfortunately lacks any semblance of a decent script. Now, before I get pelted with tomatoes for having the audacity to criticize what is basically the biggest blockbuster this summer, let me share some of my woes. Case and point: the resounding screech of metal against metal and the peppered pops of semi-automatic weapons are still ringing in my ears, but I cannot remember a single freaking' thing that ANY of the characters, flesh-born or computerized, said during entire three-hour long feature. Not a single one-liner. Nary a pithy comment about how we as a human race have to survive to fight one more day. Come on, man! No inspirational speech on the eve of apocalyptic genocide? Have writers learned nothing from the success of 'Independence Day,' 'Terminator,' or '300'? The premise is simple: before the destruction of the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron, a single ship containing a contingency survival plan for the inhabitants of the planet managed to escape and marooned itself on the Earth's moon. The space race of the mid-sixties was supposedly an attempt to retrieve classified intelligence on the nature of the crash material, and in the pursuit of this knowledge it is discovered that Decepticons and humans have been plotting this entire time to keep an important secret, cloaked by the dark of the moon, from falling into the hands of the Autobots and their allies.<br/><br/>I am not a hater, people. I grew up teething on the plastic wing-dings of Optimus Prime and Starscream myself, and if there was anyone out there rooting for this flick, it was me. But...it was a hot mess, baby. Not in terms of action -- it's categorically impossible for a Michael Bay movie to lack in visual stimuli -- but it just reeked from the lack of character development when it came to the story line and the acting. When did Sam Witwicky become such an angry little fellow anyway? He's almost shrill, and he needs to take anger-management courses. Shia LeBeouf is becoming one of those Joe Pesci types of actors that always end up yelling and pacing and angrily hitting things on-screen just to make a point. And Ken Jeong was the scariest caricature of an Asian corporate douche if I saw one. He needs to take a Xanax and call Paramount in the morning. The whole schizo-multiple personalities thing is so done. What I wouldn't give to see Ken Jeong being funny, instead of desperate.<br/><br/>Oh, and the model was ridiculous. This is a point that bears repeating: on behalf of bewildered women everywhere, the presence of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam's devoted girlfriend was just plain RIDICULOUS. A walking, talking Pantene commercial in the middle of Cybertronic war? What were you thinking, Michael Bay? Yes, she was freakishly long-legged and gorgeous -- but dude, there is a time and place for that type of vapid sultriness, and the eve of destruction is not it! If I were angry little Sam, I would have instantly hooked up with Frances MacDonald's powerful CIA operative character, because at least she's tough and wears sneakers and I wanna LIVE, dammit, and she has the greatest likelihood of making it out alive. Heck, even Megan Fox seemed like she could take a punch if necessary. This new Barbie-doll looked like her shin was gonna snap in half if a shard of glass fell on it (which incidentally she somehow managed to avoid, despite falling out of a damn skyscraper).<br/><br/>In summary, the film's three hours of non-narrative battle footage in which machines are burned, wrecked, and incinerated was just a bit too much for me to handle without the occasional glimpse into the depths of humanity. The few scenes of comrades sacrificing their lives for one another and of the military forces tirelessly re-engaging the enemy despite certain defeat just didn't have the same gravitas, due to sensation overload. Wanna know the reason news channels don't just film actual war zones for hours and replay them without editing or injecting some sort of human interest story? It desensitizes us, folks. Deadens our brains. We begin to feel ambivalent about the outcome. I stopped caring what would happen to Sam Witwicky and his ridiculously attired model-cum-political attaché girlfriend (four-inch platforms while running for your life down Wacker Drive? Really?) less than an hour and a half into the film, and the yawns punctuating the theater during the last battle scene clued me into the fact that I wasn't the only one shifting restlessly in my seat from boredom.<br/><br/>The scenes that really took my breath away actually had nothing to do with the Autobots or Decepticons. The audience got to see some truly awesome scenes of men (not machines) deploying from carrier planes and sailing between the skyscrapers like flying squirrels in the rain-forest. The film tempts you with the trailer of a swiftly tilting skyscraper and people scrabbling like gerbils to keep their footing... maybe it was the green-screen affecting the acting chops, but it should have engendered more feelings of tension and suspense in the audience. The chemistry was off somehow -- what should have been a nail-biter was mostly just exhausting to watch.<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you have a few hours to burn, but don't feel like being bogged down by a creative storyline. Just focus on the incessant clanging and gnashing of metal belonging to Autobots and Decepticons alike as they transform like they're on steroids -- a buddy of mine mentioned why they kept transforming so much, since the beloved toys of youth consisted of one, two, three, maybe four twists before yielding Optimus or Bumblebee. It was the original beauty of an Autobot -- the balance of form and function. Take that, Michael Bay."

"nmiodrag","3","5","12","3 July 2011"," Unoriginal, special effects orgy, farewell to logic
","Most of this film feels like a re-hash of the previous installment, only with better graphics and a bigger quantity of everything – except for logic. Bigger quantity of action and special effects does not necessarily make for a better movie. At some point it becomes tedious and you just want it to end but it drags on, and on, and on. The attempts at comedy were annoying and so were the two leads. I honestly expected something from Shia LaBeouf after the first movie, but the sequels left me sadly disappointed. The two saving graces for me in this film were John Turturro and Frances McDormand. Back to the issue of logic: *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** Problem #1: Sentinel repetitively states that they were gods on Cybertron – however if the entire planet is inhabited by autobots, who were they gods to? The entire idea of autobots is ridiculous to begin with, for such creations have no purpose except to make interesting toys. Problem #2: as demonstrated by the scene of decepticons invading from the Moon – the pillars create a portal – one that is entered on one end (Moon) and exited on the other (Earth). When they want to teleport Cybertron to Earth, they surround Earth with pillars, but the Cybertron appears OUTSIDE of the pillars, and there is obviously no entrance portal because Cybertron is abandoned. Problem #3: when the teleportation is interrupted a black-hole like funnel sucks Cybertron in – it is the size of the Earth and very close, but nothing happens to earth's atmosphere?"
"Jinn","2","5","12","1 July 2011"," Rolling out for the last time. HAD it with Brainless Bay.
","After the last two, I wasn't holding my breath for Dark of the Moon and just as well. Yet *again* Michael Bay falls short of what Transformers should be. It was never about the humans, it was the story of the Transformers. In Bay's movies the Transformers take a back seat. There's little or no character development and he still hasn't worked out what Transformers look or sound like. And Bay can't even get the characters right. No way is that sorry bucket of bolts Megatron and if Megatron was that decrepit, Starscream would have taken full advantage, blasted him and taken over. In the original G1, the Decepticons were not such ugly, chunky and messy robots and since when do Transformers slobber? Gross. In the original movie when Starscream died I bawled my eyes out and was upset for years. When Screamer bought it this time round I couldn't give a high flying frenzy. Bay is a greedy money making bozo who could not give a stuff about the fans or the characters we know and love. Where was Optimus Prime's compassion for all living things? Loved Megatron's 'Lawrence of Arabia look' Gods he was having a bad hair day. Where were the female Transformers who got an almost non existent cameo in Revenge of the Fallen? Carly spent most of her time being duped, running scared or running to her man. Very sexist. She had a few good lines with Megatron though. The only other woman with a big role was Mearing, a snotty, stuffed-shirt, full of herself bitch. The antics at Sam's workplace were beyond ridiculous. Only Bay with his brains in his nethers could have come up with such tripe. Simmons, a little better in this one is still a dweeb and the last line of the last Transformers movie is him?! What an insult!<br/><br/>It had an interesting premise, but as with the other two, fell short character wise. Bay's movies are bereft of the magic that Transformers once had. Gone is all the original charm. Well at least they called the girl Carly. But what I loved about Carly in the original series (despite not being in many episodes) was that she was not a supermodel and slightly dumpy, which made her real for me as I hardly looked like a supermodel either. In the original show she was also American (not that I have anything against the Brits - I'm half pom myself) but they should stick to the original, but then seeing how Bay's f---ed everything about Transformers that was special, I wasn't surprised. Bay's movies were noting but a huge let down and mega disappointment. In 2007 and 2009 I bought heaps of Transformer toys and merchandise, which I wish I hadn't. I was trying to re-live those childhood years where it brought me so much happiness and joy. That joy no longer exists with these new movies and it's very sad. This time around I only spent $15 on some TF office stationery and a box of TF chocolates and that was it. No point in lining Bay's already overloaded pockets. I certainly hope what goes around comes around for him for what he's done to Transformers. Sadly the younger generation do not know the original and therefore do not have a reference point to see how badly Bay has messed up Transformers. I really feel for them and for what Transformers has become thanks to Bay. And Spielberg should be ashamed of himself. Won't say that a-hole ruined my childhood (like I'll give that pathetic Earth Germ that much credit) I cherish my G1 moments. What I don't get is why Transformers movies couldn't be made this time round with the characters looking and sounding right, with good character development, heart and soul of the original and enough CG action to make it uber-exciting and an unforgettable Oscar winning epic like Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>On a lighter and happier note, I hear Bay's been ousted by Hasbro and good f**ing riddance. Sad that Hasbro even hired that dorkus molorkus in the first place. Hopefully in the near future we will have a team of intelligent directors and writers that will write that epic that the Transformers and their loyal fans deserve.<br/><br/>Actually, over 10 years before Bay got his grubby, greedy, dirty little hands on Transformers, I had an idea for a live-action Transformers movie, but sadly didn't have the money, connections to contacts like he did :( Goes to show those who deserve to have money and power in this world, sad that many of us don't. Very sad. My story stayed true to the G1 characters, with much character development, an interesting story with many twists, turns, heart-stopping effects and action, (and a real looking Carly) coupled with much heart and soul which Bay lacks period. Sad as it would have shat all over that carbon based microbe's deploringly abysmal so called 'blockbusters.'<br/><br/>Sadly, Transformers, like Megatron in this flick have definitely seen better days.<br/><br/>Rolling out now.<br/><br/>The Transformers have left the building."
"lotrfreak_1987","10","5","12","29 June 2011"," The Best Transformers with Better Plot, Human Aspect, and the most Extravagant 3D Experience to Boot
","I saw this movie last night after waiting in a line that I haven't seen that big in a long time. I saw this at my local IMAX 3D theater. And let me tell you, that if you're looking for a movie that defines Summer Blockbuster and 3D that redefines the 3D experience the way it should be, than TF3: Dark of the Moon is film you're looking for.<br/><br/>The story was intriguing, it got me into the plot right away and I was interested from the get-go. I thought it was cool how they tied the 60s space race as a cover-up for something bigger, and combined it with historical footage mixed with colored reenactments of those footages. I liked the pacing of the story at the first hour 1/2 of the movie combined with covert missions and fine action sequences that are woven into the story's progression. This movie is definitely darker than the previous two. The characters are more believable this time and not over the top as they were in the 2nd movie. Yes, there are some quirky jokes, but I found them to lighten up the mood, and it has been toned down, nothing to dwell upon, criticize, and base the entire movie for that fact though.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, when the real action begins and the onslaught that eschews upon Chicago, you feel the dark tone Michael Bay has taken this time round. Human corpses and vaporized casualties make you cringe and leave you on your feet for the fight to survive against the merciless Decepticons. What I liked best was that there was the human element, which the last two films lacked, that was prevalent in humanity's struggle to survive in the face of a few against many. You actually see characters attempt to take down the advanced weapon loaded robots and believe that it's actually possible to persevere when times are impossibly ill. It has the 300 and Blackhawk Down feeling. Shia Labouf gives his best performance in the franchise, Rosie's character plays a part rather than being pointless, John Malkovich and Ken Jeong's were great additions to the cast. The action sequences and special effects are just sheer spectacular in all sense of word epic and artistry. The sound editing was amazing. And last but not least, this is the 3D experience everyone should see. This movie can actually revive and legitimize 3D again after the horrid mess of Clash, Pirates, any 3D comedies, etc. It's on par with Avatar if not even better because their is the surreal aspect in Transformers that Avatar does not have, which is the Earthly setting and ground zero location that is Chicago.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the story, characters, SFX are much improved in DOTM and is the best installment of the three. Dark of the Moon should be viewed and experienced in IMAX 3D. That's where the real roller coaster that leaves you breathless at the end begins. I'd given it a 9, but it is the best of the 3 so 10/10.<br/><br/>Overall"

","OK I wish someone would please after this is all over, please let some other director reboot this franchise. I mean Bay was just looking to make a buck with some explosions and humor. If you can get the right director who knows how to story tell, the transformers can be epic.<br/><br/>I mean look at the disaster of the other 2. The focus was to much on well I am not sure but nothing of the decepticons or Autobots. What happen to the history between megatron and prime? How can some robots be frozen or killed so easily? Where is the bad vibe with megatron and starscream which was not done well? Why is it that the autobots have no clue what the decepticons are doing? Please do not get me started on this trash of the 3rd one nothing is new. This movie needs a reboot from a better director."
"Goodfellasz","2","4","9","1 February 2014"," This gives a new definition to the word brainless
","I am a huge fan of Michael Bay movies and I must admit the first two Transformer movies were actually quite good and entertaining. The First Transformers was a action-packed, funny and good written movie. The Second installment was somewhat a put down, but nevertheless watchable.<br/><br/>But what has happened to this third installment. The acting is horrifying, the writing is crap and the special effects may be the only good thing in this movie.<br/><br/>Where the humor in the first two movies was well placed and actually a contribution to the movies, the humor in this part is just bad.<br/><br/>As for the story, it must be said there is just no story. People keep complaining how Man of Steel is just a brainless action movie with no story, but it must be said, transformers dark of the moon has even less story in it.<br/><br/>Like I said the only good thing in the movie may be the special effects and CGI, however watching this movie one gets the feeling that he is in a computer game and not even a good one. More than half of the movie is just pure computer added effects, making you wonder if Bay should even have taking the effort to film any actual scenes.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of brainless action and just want to sit down in your seat after a hard day of work, watching the Apocalypse with some weird humor than you should really go and watch this movie. If you are not looking for this then I would suggest to just skip this movie and go watch another Michael Bay movie."
"terriblemrt","1","4","9","24 August 2013"," Too dumb, even for a dumb action movie.
","Its a badly written, badly acted, awful incoherent mess, which jarringly shifts tone every 5 minutes - the ""funny"" moments are childish, yet the language is too rough for children, its as if it was written by a 12 year old who thought adding swear words would make it more grown up. <br/><br/>It also heavily panders to an American audience with clumsy over the top patriotism. It felt like a parody of Team America with Autobots acting as a hit squad for the United States, sorting out those pesky people in the middle east. Never mind the way they crowbar in Buzz Aldrin and the Apollo 11 mission.<br/><br/>Lastly there is the portrayal of women in the movie - they are treated either as a sex object (with lecherous camera work ensuring a good view of tits and ass), or as an overbearing/nagging annoyance. <br/><br/>I went into this just wanting to watch a dumb action movie, the trouble is that this is dumb to such a spectacular degree you probably wont be able to enjoy the action sequences - a bit like trying to enjoy an ice-cream after eating a bag of moldy onions."
"StevePulaski","2","4","9","14 October 2011"," Load, aim, shoot, crash, boom, explosion, repeat
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is loud, lucrative, cloying, and an ongoing headache of a film. Its structure consists of mindless action scenes with hundreds of explosions, stiff characters, and a neverending amount of screaming. It's easily one of the worst action films to come out of Hollywood in recent memory, and the worst Michael Bay film to come out in about a year.<br/><br/>The story is convoluted and just a mess. In simple terms - the Autobots and the Decepticons are at war again, and for some reason, they decide to fight on Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive in Chicago.<br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf is back playing Sam, who is still as idiotic and as loud as ever. Only this time, he has a new accomplice named Carly (Whiteley) who takes Megan Fox's place in the film. Together her and Sam face numerous explosions and somehow survive everyone of them. Because, you know, every girl sticks by some charming nerd who has a relationship with giant metal monstrosities. Not to mention remaining optimistic while they watch in awe as the robots turn Chicago into what appears to be the depths of hell.<br/><br/>When people say they love the Transformers films I can't help but laugh, then correct them. They don't love the film. They love the explosions, the special effects, and the constant, mind-numbing action on screen. If these action sequences were cut up and put on the internet in little spurts and dubbed something totally different it would be the web series every twelve year old would be talking about. So, before you say you love Transformers: Dark of the Moon, stop and think - do you like the film or the special effects within the film? I bring this up because while Transformers: Dark of the Moon lacks a lot of hefty material that is required to make a good film, it completely shows the carelessness and idiocy of making a modern day action piece. Look at any good action film - Death Race 2000, Dirty Harry, Easy Rider, The Rookie, Speed, etc. What makes them all good besides their iconic leads? Character development, dialog, and worthy special effects that make up well crafted action scenes. Transformers, and I'm saying this to represent the entire franchise, lacks all but one of the categories.<br/><br/>No matter how great the pyrotechnics, the explosions, or some of the scenes are, it gets incredibly aggravating to see pretty much the same thing for the course of two and a half hours. Not only is this just an incoherent mess, it's a mess that occupies so much more time than it needs to. It would be different if there was some narrative consistency rather than just explosion after explosion with a pounding, pretentious score playing at all times. If it followed a simple story, and worked from the ground up rather than settling for such a lazy style of film-making, the series might actually be more than just ""dumb fun."" One thing I could never wrap my brain around were the physics. I understand the whole genre is based off of someone's creative idea. In a cartoon, the idea of cars turning into a full-blown mechanical robot destroying everything in their paths is not only unique, but perfectly acceptable. For a cartoon of course. In a live action film, the idea is simply way too plausible to be accepted. The fun thing about cartoons is you know they could never happen. Having a live-action film made about the franchise, let alone three, just flat out ruins the point of Transformers overall - it could simply never happen.<br/><br/>Certain scenes baffle me. For one - how can a robot jump, climb, wrestle, destroy, and blow up the same building and not having it collapse? How can another robot run on the side of a building without going straight through it or making it tilt? Also - how can Sam attach a grappling hook to a robot's eye while proceeding to be flung around like a piece of meat, crashing into concrete garages and buildings? With one hand only. Questions like these don't really get any other answer aside from ""just because."" Director Michael Bay has spent most of his directing years to making and producing horrible remarks and lackluster franchise re-imaginings. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the poster child for why he shouldn't be in film, and why action films are quickly spiraling down to an all time low. The problem with Bay is he isn't creative or willing to pursue his own personal idea. The problem with this is the fact it suffers from no straight forward narrative, and relies on drawn out, cliché action scenes that, while well-crafted, go on for way too long of a time span.<br/><br/>The final battle in Chicago, literally, is over an hour long. And it ends in the same cliché one would expect. If the battle was an hour long, and we were provided with a twist or something new I could see the reason for making it a certain length. But when you make us walk a long road to get somewhere and we get something we've seen before it just makes the whole trip useless and contrived.<br/><br/>The moral of the story with Transformers: Dark of the Moon can be summed up, unlike the film itself, simply and effectively; quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Starring: Shia LeBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Patrick Dempsey, and John Malkovich. Directed by: Michael Bay."

Rose also seemed out of place in this film...maybe she should stick to modeling since acting really doesn't seem to be in her at all. <br/><br/>Also, I think the only thing that could really be considered an upside to this film, is all the action, it was fast paced, filmed fairly well and in pretty god detail, editing seemed fairly poor though. Definitely not as good as most of Mr Spielberg's films but still fairly well done and Mr. Bay should have stopped after the first Transformers movie. <br/><br/>After seeing it, I had to ask myself, can the money really be worth putting this dribble out? Evidently so... <br/><br/>All-in-all I give it a rating of 2, right behind the first Hulk & all three Spider-man movies."
"merpenguin","3","4","9","26 July 2011"," A Poor Movie
","I'd just like to open this review by stating that this film appeared to replicate every negative stereotype about Hollywood directing at once. Sure, it had great special effects, I'll give it that, but that is the only real saving grace this movie has been blessed with. Almost all of the characters were boring and unlikeable, and I think Michael Bay tried too hard to make the Autobots act human. Sure, Bumblebee hacked a radio and they learned about our language. I understand that they're highly intelligent and everything, but you'd expect them to retain some of their own culture instead of essentially becoming humans. But whatever, that's just a minor complaint. First of all, this movie went on for way too long. When you make a movie in which action is the focus, don't drag it out for so long and keep repeating the same thing over and over again. Unfortunately, this movie did just that. The action sequences were highly boring (oddly) and seemed highly repetitive. In addition, the physics of this film are laughable. At multiple points characters are saved in midair as an Autobot runs to grab them and prevent them from falling. That's all well and good, except it would take about a second for the characters to hit the ground at most of these occasions and the Autobot in question comes from a fairly far distance. And that's just one of the incidents that makes Isaac Newton roll in his grave. I brought this up earlier, but the characters are all very bland and often I didn't really find myself caring what happened to them. Many of the actors were very wooden in this film were very wooden. (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, I'm looking at you) It is crucial to make us care about the characters in this kind of film, seeing as they are in constant danger. This movie failed to achieve this. Finally, the writing was very corny and cringe-worthy. It seems that Michael Bay tried far too hard to Americanize the movie, especially that corny scene where Megatron destroys the statue of Abraham Lincoln and sits in the empty throne. Both the writing and plot were very weak.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, this movie is mostly just eye candy. The special effects, if those are your cup of tea, are the only real reason to watch this film."

","I am a ""child of the 80s"" and grew up with Transformers, Ghostbusters, TMNT, ... so i am one part of the target audience. Nevertheless i couldn't get much joy out of this movie.<br/><br/>On the good side i found that the ""robot action"" is roughly the same than in the previous two movies, so if that's your thing you can cat least enjoy these parts. It's also a plus that they dropped the shaky cam combat shots altogether and added some beautiful slow-mo photography.<br/><br/>Unfortunately i couldn't find more positive aspects of this movie. The dialogue was mind-blowing stupid. The verbal fights between Witwicky and the ""intelligence boss lady"" Mearing, allegedly a veteran CIA operative, where so childish and doting that several people in the theater where moaning loudly. The plots of the villains (e.g. Dylan) where so one-dimensional and naive that they should be doubtful even for teenagers. No motives explained, no safeguarding, no leverage, ... nothing! Every comic book villain is more fleshed out.<br/><br/>The relationship between Witwicky and Carly Spencer was equally immature and very superficial. Which probably was a good thing...<br/><br/>Probably the worst part of the movie have been the constant comical relief attempts. Agent Simmons even more over the top and unbelievable than in the previous movies, the two small transformers as cliché sidekicks, the stupid ""espionage watch"" which constantly hinders Witwicky in actually doing some real espionage, the ridiculous behavior at the job interviews, ...<br/><br/>To sum it all up, i can not recommend this movie to anybody past puberty, and even the more clever kids will probably find the plot laughable.<br/><br/>3 stars for the expected ""giant robots fighting"", which was delivered."
"TheUnknown837-1","3","4","9","16 July 2011"," I wonder if the phrase ""three strikes and you're out!"" has any relevance in Hollywood
","I wonder if Hollywood (or at least 'director' Michael Bay) is familiar with baseball. If so, I wonder if they (or he) is aware of the old phrase ""three strikes and you're out!"" I am also kind of hoping that has some coherence in the filmmaking industry, for that means I shall never have to endure another one of these overproduced, headache-inducing clumps of schlock again. Michael Bay has struck out three times now and I hope he stays on the bench.<br/><br/>It's never been the premise of the ""Transformers"" trilogy, all directed by Michael Bay, that I've had trouble with. On the contrary, it was a setup that I really rooted for. It was the execution that I've always had problems with. The lumpy writing, the overblown running time, the unfunny (and mildly offensive) so-called humor, the action scenes so poorly directed that it was hard for me to even appreciate the skill and craftsmanship required to bring them to life.<br/><br/>My criticisms of the first two movies return once again for the third (and hopefully final) installment, embarrassingly titled ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" As it turns out, when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, it was to exploit an alien spacecraft piloted by refugees from the robotic planet Cybertron. Flash-forward to present day and we have Sam Witwicky (still played by Shia LaBeouf) with a new girlfriend (Rosie Huntingly-Whitely) and a bigger egomania than ever. When Decepticons start popping up all over the world again, he comes to discover that they are planning to revive their fallen planet. From there, the plot continues to thicken, all the way up to a preposterously boring climax which stretches a seemingly endless forty-five-minute stretch and wrapping up with a cold, lifeless halt instead of a rousing conclusion.<br/><br/>Like the two movies that came before it, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" has amazing visual effects. The transfiguring mechanical titans are blended seamlessly into the live-action backgrounds and with their flesh-and-blood costars. There is hardly a single weak special effects shot in the movie, and there are hundreds of them. And yet Michael Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger once again choose to toss their intrinsic awe and power out of the window in favor of overpopulated, bland stick-figure human characters. There are not only too many human characters in the movie, but they are all very badly-written and oftentimes poorly-acted. Even Mr. LaBeouf, who was charismatic in the first movie, is obnoxious here as all he has to do is act pompous and schizophrenic and shout all of his dialogue until his voice goes raw. Even great talents like Kevin Dunn, Josh Duhamel, Frances McDormand, even John Malkovich, are given excess screen time to do next to nothing. Gone is Megan Fox and that is a shame, for her replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a complete bore. Not only is she resorted to just standing around and screaming while the camera lasciviously ogles at her lower extremities, but unlike Miss Fox, she does not have any real star quality. I did not think Megan Fox's performances in the first two movies were particularly good, but there was a budding talent, a promise that she would one day become a considerate actress.<br/><br/>I never got that sensation once with Miss Huntington-Whiteley.<br/><br/>There's not one character who is interesting enough to deserve so much attention, and yet Mr. Bay lingers upon them consistently, over and over again. And when the transformers are on-screen, they have nothing to do either. They don't do any more than what they did the first two times around, which is change forms, make sloppy cultural jokes, and mutter pseudo-intellectual mumbo jumbo. When they take each other on, director Bay shoots everything at such close angles and so fast that it was impossible for me to tell which robot was on which side, who was transformed and who was not, which robot was betraying his side and who was not, who had died and who had survived, and bottom line, I just did not care. And that cheap gimmick of an action scene first playing at regular speed, them all of a sudden slowing down, and returning to normal pace does not wow here. It didn't work before Mr. Bay used it and it certainly doesn't work now that he is using it.<br/><br/>Now I will admit there were a couple of nifty moments that I did like. And guess what? They did revolve around the special effects. An out-of-the-blue battle on the highway scene, with Mr. LaBeouf being tossed out of his transformer-car and then caught again was quite thrilling, as were the scenes with a new robot equipped with giant worm-like tentacles. I wish he had been in more of the movie. But as a totality, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is just another clanging, obscenely overproduced mess from an aggressively misguided director. It clangs and clangs for a punishing 157 minutes, which seems like twice that long, and then cuts off without really ending. But that's fine with me, because I would rather not revisit this same scenario again."

Even the fight scenes are not as clear and sharp as the first one or even the second one, Michael Bay, I like to have my 2 1/2 hours of my life back. Not to mention we saw it in I-MAX 3D. There is a reason why Shia is leaving too.

","Continuity errors between each of the three transformer films (and within this film), bad acting and a weak plot made this movie unbearable. Too late because now my money adds to the $190m this film has already made so the joke is on me.<br/><br/>There is insufficient chemistry between Sam and the very attractive damsel in distress to warrant an entire theatre sitting through his attempts to get to her to save her. Watching them run to each other at the end made little sense since he was with her through the end of the movie ... not sure what was the need for a dramatic reunion. This coupled with the fact that through the film Sam had no real connection to any of the autobots (especially Bumblebee) to make you feel anything made the film hollow.<br/><br/>The plot was particularly weak (or perhaps poorly executed) so by the time the twist in the plot came around, it made for awful cinema. The writers for this movie need to look for another profession. <br/><br/>There were some unreal moments in the movie that should have been on the cutting floor of the editing, particularly when Carly stands up in the heat of an intense battle scene as she gets an idea, and somehow her hair blows in the wind as she pouts ... can't believe a director yelled ""And action!!!!!"" at the start of that action sequence!<br/><br/>I am not sure how many times I counted Carley's shoes changing from heels to flat shoes .... and I'm not sure how she got jeans on when she was abducted in white pants .... She runs for hours and maintains the best hair ... realism and continuity wasn't too big on the agenda<br/><br/>Great CG of course so they should give the graphics team a big fat bonus ...

It suddenly jumps from the main plot to Sam's life, and vice-versa, which gives you impression that your watching an action-movie with commercials on TV. No matter how hard you try to get yourself suck in it, BOREDOM still dominates. But 1 scene has actually impressed me.

The rest of the cast you expect to deliver, Malkovich,Tuturro, and McDormand, are good, but are so wasted, you'd believe at points there characters had been written out.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this film, is the new love interest, being introduced like a perfume commercial, she is the most unconvincing actress i have ever had the displeasure to see act, She is that bad, she oozes onto other actors and makes them look bad. But shes just there for eye candy and doesn't ruin the film. Just like Fox.<br/><br/>But Bay knows that this is a summer movie, and it feels like a summer movie. It has the good opening, the trudging bit where we meet the cast, and then the set up, and then the execution. Bay knows his stuff, and knows how to put a budget and a bang on screen.<br/><br/>Many may balk at Bay and his movies, but one cannot say his movies are boring. they are not plausible, but they never fail to entertain, and Bay has put some of the best set pieces of the year on screen (up to now). The takeover, The skyscraper falling, little bits of comedy, and an amazing skydive sequence are awe-inspiring pieces of pure popcorn.<br/><br/>And 3-D has never looked so good on screen. Cameron must feel a little gutted, because Bay has used 3D, but not just concentrated on effects, little scenes with the depth of field are just jaw dropping and inexplicably oceanic.<br/><br/>So if you see this movie, remember, it's not about the story, narrative or characters (this would have been a bonus), it's about robots, fighting, in 3D, and seeing great explosions, stunts, and soldiers walking in slow motion, in the orange tint Bay loves.<br/><br/>It's not a film, it's a ride, and Bay just wants you to have a good time.<br/><br/>I did.<br/><br/>Just remember the parts where robots talk, and you will realise not to take life seriously for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>Go on, treat yourself."

This one, much like the second, has become watered down by Michael Bay as he attempts to reach a wider audience while hardcore transformer fans (like myself) now have to suffer! The two annoying mini-autobots from the 2nd part make a return appearance and are still very annoying. Also the romance dialogue between Sam and his gf is quite weak and actually takes away rather than adds to the movie. I hope in the 4th installment that Bay sticks to pure action (a la Terminator 2) and stop trying to appease different demographics!"
"ironhorse_iv","6","3","6","2 April 2013"," Transformer! More than meets the eyes.
","My first thought of hearing Transformer: Dark Side of the Moon was that, Pink Floyd was going to do the soundtrack and that Transformer was going into more space Sci-fiction. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed. We start off the movie with some back story of the war between the Autobots and Deceptions fighting on their home world and one of the Transformer's spacecraft crash landing on Earth's moon. When Apollo 11, lands on the moon, they find in the craft, an invention capable of ending the war call 'the Pillars' that allows quick teleportation from planet to planet. This back-story, should have been place in the first movie (2007) as it will make more sense there. I don't know why we're given this information so late in the series. It would have made the wait for the third movie so much more. Also how does this become a government secret for so long? Honestly, you would think the military would be better prepared for the events of the first movie, if they knew this information about the alien spacecraft. Not once, during the events of the first movie, did they think, I don't know, try to use that invention as a weapon against the invading robots. Couldn't some of the back-story about Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) be put in the 2007 movie!!! He was an big character in the first animation movie. The story felt put into at the last minute and doesn't make any sense to the story already create in this world by the 2007 film. We go with the history of the moon landing to a 'Ass Shot' of Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington Whitely). The greatest mindless way to introduce your character to your fans, by saying 'yes, she's hot'. Her moon is hotter. In my opinion, it was mindless soft core porn. Couldn't we have something about her, besides that's hot? She's pretty much the hot Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) without any skills set. She takes Carly from the Generation 1 character Carly Witwicky. So we find out that Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is looking for job, yes, the man who save the world twice, can't find a job. Like I will believe that, why wasn't he working with the military or something? By this part of the series, Sam should honestly be a bad-ass, but no!!!! Let me give you an example. In Star Wars: Luke was just a farm-boy who was just a bit silly, who knew how to fly and shoot a blaster, in the second movie, Luke got trained to be a Jedi, and was becoming a bad-ass. The third movie, Luke was a Jedi. I was hoping the same with this movie, yes he can still be a bit funny, but the years of warfare and him losing his girlfriend should have made him more serious. Somebody once said that Sam was the 2007 Marty McFly, but even Marty McFly from Back in the Future had a development arch where he got smarter. Sam is same character, he see in the first movie. In my opinion, I would have shown a back-story of Sam losing Megan Fox's character based on the war, like having her character killed by the Deceptions for God's sakes!!!! Mikaela breaks up with him for no reason. What? It's doesn't make sense for him, to get with Rosie so easy as well. We don't really get to know how they met up, based on the movie, Carly (Rosie's character) was working at the White House when Sam met Obama for a medal and she find him cute. Yeah. That's lames, Carly go from working at the white house to being eye candy. A step back in career choice, in my opinion. When did actual skill become secondary to attractiveness? Carly like the actress playing her has a character arch of a model. There is no reason to like her. Carly is a model who looking to become more popular with the public, and she use Sam as her way to reaching that. Are we supposed to believe that Carly is in love with Sam just because he's cute? Come on! Back to the movie, after mindless comedy shots of Sam looking for a job, that didn't really need to be in the movie, because it will play no part later. We find out that the Deceptions raid the moon for the pillars to invade Earth. Honestly, if they were able to go to the moon, couldn't they invade the Earth without it? What is the point of the pillars if you can quickly get back from Moon to Earth without them? The only thing that made sense was to bring the planet, but if there were like hundreds of Deceptions waiting in the moon to invade the planet, wouldn't they invade with their ships??? It doesn't make sense. The best part of the movie was the Chicago battle remind me of the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King in it's epic scale. I like it. The CGI was great, but it felt like a visual orgy without any plot. The movie song by Linkin Park was pretty awesome as well. It's an enjoyable stupid popcorn flick. It's not Oscar worthy, but it's not the worst movie ever. If you just want explosions and hot chicks, it's so-so movie from Michael Bay. Michael Bay has a way to direct his movie as if it's mindless porn. If you are expecting something akin to the previous two, look elsewhere."

Of course first 1:30 out of 2:30 isn't so so epic,of course we have battles,action scenes but in this first 1:30 mins action is on second plan,but the final 1h (SPOILER*it starts with start of destroying city at night END OF SPOILER*) is such an amazing job of computers and first time you can really felt emotional on Michael Bay film,good work! Seriously watch this movie it has great effects,shots,music,plot (of course it's not a great plot but it's great TRANSFORMERS plot) and i don't understand how someone can say that this is boring."

","In 2007, we were introduced to a brand new species of another planet called Cypertron and the species that is not like any other - a species that protects the human race from extinction they are known as the Autobots. But to their dismay, the other side wanted something totally different to bring their own world to the planet that is was weak in their eyes – the Decepticons.<br/><br/>In 2009, there was a revenge from the Decepticons to take the earth's sun to destroy it so that they could bring the world to a extinction, but the Autobots including its leader Optimus Prime fought his own brother, Megatron and his other brother, better known as The Fallen. Both Megatron and The Fallen had their plans foiled by Optimus and the only human who could understand them – Sam.<br/><br/>In 2011, the Decepticons bring a whole new strategy to the big screen – they use a member of the human race to deceive the humans and the Autobots. The only way to stop the Decepticons to destroy them and to stop them from bring Cypertron and re-creating Earth to make it their home.<br/><br/>These movies can't compare to any other Sci-Fi movie. They are what we call great entertainment. I have to give props to the greatest iconic director of all time – Steven Spielberg and the genius behind the Transformers Trilogy – Michael Bay. There is no one in the nation that can outdo these 2 gentleman. The cast was incredible from the boy who started the phenomenon – Shia Labouef to the newcomer girlfriend, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The third movie was in one word – INCREDIBLE!!! I give Transformers a 8; I give Revenge of the Fall a 9; but I give Dark of the Moon a 10."

","OK, I am not in the demographic for this movie. I'm 61. The night started off poorly with my finding out I had only requested one pass, not two as usual. I at first felt bad that my wife had no ticket. She encouraged me to go ahead and see the movie.She got off easy. <br/><br/>The movie, in 3-D, started off with a close up of Rose Huntington- Whiteley's butt. Now, Rose is not an actress, but she is a Victoria's Secret model, so she has a cute butt. And the movie is PG 13 so you won't see too much of Rose, just enough to keep males interested. And this movie is geared to 12 year old males. Stupid 12 year old males. The directing was muddled, the cast of many good actors(Frances McDormand, John Turturo, and John Malkovich, etc.) was wasted. There are more holes in the plot than there are in a large Amish baby Swiss cheese. When the main story is already a comic book, then the roles should be played straight, not as a camp farce like Batman on TV. And speaking of the story, I know you have to have good and evil, very black and white for kids-but is it too much to ask to have a story that does not rely on every cliché ever written or spoken. ""We only have one chance at this shot."" ""We only need one."" Seriously? The parents are played as a joke. A bad joke. Why do the Decepticons spit when they scream loudly at the hero? A reddish fluid comes out of their mouths as they yell at whoever is in their grasp. The movie does move fairly quickly but lasts too long at 154 minutes. Things do blow up spectacularly and Chicago gets trashed thoroughly. So if you are looking for 2 12 hours of air conditioning with popcorn, or you're a not too bright 12 year old who has not seen too many movies, this film is for you. For the rest of you who want to see a good action adventure SF film, go see ""Super 8"". Even with a weak ending it is a much better movie."
"ThomasMagnumPI","Null","20","73","27 June 2011"," The curse of the number three movies continues... Terrible
","Most of their demographic seemed to like the first one. Then they ""kinda tolerated"" the second one. Logic dictates that the third one ""sucks"". Logic is right.<br/><br/>The curse of the number three movies continues. This movie is indeed worse than its predecessors and with Transformers, that's really saying something. While that may spell big box office, it doesn't spell long-term staying power and of the three films in the Transformers trilogy, the final installment may well go down as the biggest disappointment of them all. It's wild but it's as bad as most feared. The CGI action is indeed over-the-top and may induce some popcorn merit but there simply is not enough of the things that matter. All that video game action starts becoming dull without a film or characters we care about to hold it together. It's easy to see where they went wrong but the formula led to two big paydays, why would they change it now?"

","The basics of the story are pure genius, but they don't follow through. A little more consistency would've taken at least an hour off the plot, and I'm not talking about the endless end-fight only. The main story is nice 'n complicated. Lots of inconsistencies to keep it going, but nice in itself. The inconsistencies are pretty tolerable although they're clearly meant to augment the uptime. My girlfriend fell asleep during the end-sequence about five times, while suffering insomnia as I do, I could only think ""take out that goddamn tower, Optimus, so we can get on with the rest of the evening we planned."" Get it digitally and watch the main story till about 1h50', then feel free to skip 5' from time to time, you won't miss out. A cut version, about 1h30', would be pure genius, smashing action and storyline, never wasting watcher's time and giving us our money's worth. As it stands, I re-respect editors in their job, but clearly this thing hasn't had any. BTW if they allot Megan Fox the-kind-of star qualities, it only gets worse with this new kid. And she hasn't got 1/10 the looks (sorry, half wouldn't cut it). It would also be nice of IMDb to respect my carriage returns, but that'll be too much too ask."

"sam_fenn","2","5","13","1 July 2011"," Absolutely terrible.
","First of all, I would like to point out how predictable this film was. Considering the fact that it showed about 2 differences to the two previous films. You know, Sam's fine, he discovers a Decepticon plot, meets the Autobots, all seems lost, huge battle occurs, Optimus Prime saves the day. This, with a view slight variations, occurs in every film. So, by this, I quickly deducted what would happen at the end, and I was not far off. <br/><br/>Secondly, the seemingly never ending fight scene which just leaves you sitting there thinking ""Does this actually end? Am I going to be here for the rest of my life?"", I lost track of how long it went on for, but I got the feeling at least 3 robots got killed more than once. It was ridiculous, it was dragged out and unnecessary. And the slow motion was completely off, it slowed at the stupidest points, and never added any effect to the fight.<br/><br/>Third, as far as I know, Megatron has now been killed twice. I might be wrong but from what I remember, he got the All Spark pushed into him and killed him in the first one, then got a sword through the face in Revenge of the Fallen. It shows how dragged out these films are, I liked the first movie, the second one was a mess and now Dark of the Moon has nearly ruined them all. I can only pray they don't try to resurrect it in the future with a fourth film. Awful, awful movie."
"Jonathon_Natsis","4","5","13","29 June 2011"," Not one iota better than Revenge Of The Fallen.
","No, it isn't the re-release of one of Pink Floyd's greatest albums, it's Dark Of The Moon, the third explosion-packed instalment of Michael Bay's Transformers trilogy. The first film was average at best, and the sequel would have been the worst film of 2009 if not for the hopelessly unengaging Terminator: Salvation. Unfortunately, Dark Of The Moon fares no better than its predecessors, not to say that I had high expectations in the first place.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky, the anonymous hero of the human race and co-leader of the Autobots. For the most part, peace has been restored with the Autobots now working as covert operatives solving international conflict for the U.S government. But when a decades-long secret hidden on the moon becomes known, the Decepticons return to wage war against their ancient enemy and relocate their home planet of Cybertron to Earth.<br/><br/>Scorsese, Tarantino, Aronofsky, Spielbergall major directors of the modern age have gotten to be just that big on the back of reputation, and a toolbox of film techniques that they use to leave their mark on every project. Michael Bay could also be included among these filmmakers, but for all the wrong reasons. His films are typified by shallow characters, gratuitous explosions and a script that feels like it was written the night before the film's first screening. All of these traits are on full display in this film, and are just one part of why this movie is so disappointing.<br/><br/>At a little over two and a half hours, this is the longest film of the trilogy, and doesn't it feel that way. The entire film plods along with unnecessary opening scenes and a mind-numbing final set piece. The whole First Act, and most of the Second, is centred on Sam and new girlfriend Carly's personal life, dealing with his failed efforts to get a job, and growing paranoia stemming from Carly's friendship with her boss. You would expect these useless scenes to result in a rushed conclusion, if not for the fact that the climax is also painfully drawn out. This might sound primitive, but I can only watch robots fighting each other for so long before it gets repetitive and I begin to lose interest in exactly who's fighting who, and why. <br/><br/>But not all the blame rests with Bay. Writer Ehren Kruger delivers an uninspired script packed with action-hero clichés and one-liners that are just plain lame. If you want to give the goodies the odd 'tough-guy' line then do so, but don't have a two-on-two battle won by the Autobots end with 'class dismissed'. I don't expect Oscar-winning writing from these kinds of films, just enough creativity to keep it from feeling stale before even the film's halfway point is reached.<br/><br/>Dark Of The Moon also suffers from obvious follies, recognisable by even the most casual film-goer. Why does a robot need a headscarf? How does a robot grow hair? Why do two robots that have barely ventured outside the NASA headquarters have thick Scottish accents? And on at least two occasions, the protagonists hide behind a wall and go unseen by the baddies, when in actuality a five year-old could find them in a game of hide and seek. Things like this just scream of an overall lack of effort in allowing audiences to suspend their disbelief.<br/><br/>It's easy to say that Michael Bay and Paramount Pictures had the last laugh, since I left the cinema in disappointment having already parted with my money. Truth is, if another Transformers is made, I will see it if for no other reason than to expand my mental library. The mere fact that this film is cohesive enough for people to understand what in the world is going on is all that keeps it from falling into the chasm of films that should never be exposed to human eyes. But this is little consolation for an all-round failure in filmmaking.<br/><br/>I'm yet to check if any part of the soundtrack syncs up eerily with The Wizard Of Oz. Stay tuned.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
"Hellrazr360","4","5","13","29 June 2011"," It's a Mess
","I'm a light fan of the first two films (average/above-average sci-fi/action), so it should be easy to understand that I was anticipating this film. While I'll definitely admit the problems with both Transformers and Revenge of the Fallen, those issues didn't interfere with the entertainment and fun I got out of them. All I really wanted out of Dark of the Moon was good action and possibly some humorous scenes that would make it an enjoyable time in theaters. What I received, however, was an overbearing, convoluted mess that left me perplexed (not in a good way). <br/><br/>It's tough to provide a decent plot synopsis since so much occurs back-and-forth throughout the film; especially during the first two acts. We're essentially introduced with a montage-esque twist on the first Moon landing, before switching to the film's present day with Sam and his (new) girlfriend trying to get him a job. Meanwhile, the Autobots appear to be continuing their jobs originally seen in Revenge of the Fallen (finding Decepticons and taking care of other world issues--illegal nuclear plants--along the way). This leads to the first of Dark of the Moon's problems: the plot (and script) is all over the place. This is especially so in the second act where shifts and twists come by as fast as the explosions and crunches emphasized later in the film (we'll get to those). <br/><br/>Some of the more criticized scenes from the previous two films were those used for laughter. While it's true most of these fell flat in the second, they usually worked in the first. And while I'll say we get a couple more successful attempts at this in Dark of the Moon, too many are hackneyed and, at one too many points, misused. A key example of this comes from a character who acts extremely over-the-top (makes the brownie scene in Revenge look depressingly-toned) and doesn't get an ideal exit. Right when this happens, other characters make ignorant jokes that would have been funny and appropriate had he simply been knocked out, rather than meeting a serious end. 90% of the other frequent jabs of humor don't fare much better.<br/><br/>This leads to one of the biggest issues with the film: haphazard tone shifts. Once again, the second act is where this prevails. We get a lot of scenes that are intended as funny, but are scattered amidst more serious moments. The problem is that these are juggled around so quickly that it becomes tough to stay in a certain emotion, which only took me more and more out of the film. Comic relief shouldn't be used like a crutch and tossed about more serious points. Unfortunately, Dark of the Moon makes this mistake so many times until the final 40-60 minutes, that words like conflicted and bipolar become understatements.<br/><br/>Of course, what everyone truly wants out of a film like this is good action and effects, something Bay has always been known for and often delivers. And it's true, Dark of the Moon has some incredible visual spectacle. The action scenes are nicely shot, for the most part, and the final act is almost nonstop in the display we're given. When the real action sequence(s) kick in, they definitely leave you glued to your seat and the best part: they're not too short-lived like its predecessors (especially Revenge). <br/><br/>However, even for the excellent technology put up, I couldn't even feel (happily) enthusiastic about it. As I said, the last act has A LOT of effects and stunt work at, well, work. But there's not much action otherwise in the rest of the film; save for a little chase-to-battle scene about halfway through and a couple brief points sprinkled elsewhere. The reason I couldn't fully enjoy the action found in the last act, however, is that it all comes too late and is overbearing. It takes about an hour and a half to get to this point, which is about how long most action films can retain the enjoyment of their stay. And though the previous two films were long as well, they flowed well enough to where the ongoings didn't feel like too much for the film to handle. Here, the film feels like it was two in one. <br/><br/>As I said above, the plot goes all over the place which, combined with a literal (and to quote one of the characters) ""cluster****"" of comedic/serious scenes, makes the incredible action in the final act feel more strenuous than entertaining. Even though I'm a fan of longer films (Pirates of the Caribbean 3 being a personal favorite), Dark of the Moon really takes its toll when the second act begins to give way to the third. And since the ending is way too anticlimactic to feel like a proper resolution has been provided (we're given, at best, a minute of talking after the action stops, before the credits begin), it becomes that much easier to feel like your eyes, ears and mind have been fried. But this wasn't from the epic nature the film strives for near the end, so much as it was from how misused everything felt.<br/><br/>Dark of the Moon is a film I truly wanted to enjoy; it was what I wanted to be the ultimate summer action film of the year. The first two kept me entertained and interested, the trailers for this looked promising too, so I was expecting to have fun. Yet what I experienced was a huge, incoherent mess with next to nothing that helps it feel legitimately distinguished. My brain tried to shut down, but there are simply too many problems present; and they tragically outweigh what little redeeming qualities exist here. I'm glad others enjoyed it (my friend and the theater we were in gave it a huge applause), but for me, this will likely go down as the disappointment of the year."

"owen_d_kelly","Null","4","10","6 August 2011"," two thirds of this movie is an unforgivable waste and thats all there is to it.
","Im not one of those people who wants to hate this movie. I wanted this movie to be a fun action packed movie that played to Michael Bay's strengths (Lets face the facts , Michael Bay's main strength is that he's good at directing over the top action scenes) , to be fair the movie offers what I and the majority of the audience wanted ...in the last third of the movie.<br/><br/>The first two thirds of this movie is like they didn't learn from the mistakes of the atrocious second movie 'revenge of the fallen' . The one saving grace is that racially insensitive robots allow it would have been great comic relief if the movie had them been crushed alive instead.<br/><br/>The story is not my main quarrel with this movie. That been said its not a clever story. In all honesty it doesn't have to be though. Transformers movies have never been praised for innovative , new ideas like inception , or ideas that seem possible and encourage the mind to push the known boundaries of science and engineering (like star trek or space odyssey) . The transformers creators and audience know that the stories come second to the action in their movies. Thats fine in a movie like this. It doesn't have to be clever. It can be an entertaining thrill ride can knows what audience it wants to please.<br/><br/>This movie though is a mess... Its not the story that I have a problem with.. Its the filler. The movie seems to be filled with an never ending stream of annoying characters. The least annoying character for me was the female lead (played by Rosie-huntington whitley) and the lead soldiers. There characters did not necessarily have a lot of dialogue . Believe it or not thats why I preferred them to the rest of the human characters. The first half of this movie plays like a horrible comedy that only gives you glimpses of the autobots and decepticons (which is honestly what everyone came to see....that and rosie huntington)...No one wanted to see lame jokes and characters belch out fast paced , incomprehensible dialogue. I find the dialogue annoying, very annoying , and thats my major quarrel with this movie. It spends around half the film with these annoying characters spewing words very quickly but rather unintelligibly .For example what was with the Asian who cornered sam in a bathroom... I could not understand a word of what he said...It was like he overdosed on speed (like a lot of these characters mind you).<br/><br/>Everything in the third part was what I wanted from the movie , overpriced but great action scenes and I fairly badass fight for Chicago... that will never be enough however to make up for the first half or two thirds... You cant say this movie is good solely because of the end... Two-thirds of this movie felt like a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>I came into this movie saying what every person who liked the second movie said to me ''It's just a movie , Its supposed to be a stupid but fun action packed ride'' ... and now going to simply say to those people ... I wanted for the real action to come and it took ages , a movie can be dumb but It doesn't have to waste my time with pointless things that no one wants to see...So yeah if those people want to waste their own time with mind numbling stupid dialogue then step right in folks."

","Unfortunately this movie is not the final movie of the trilogy we had been waiting for. Its too long, over the top, pointless and takes a good hour for people to actually understand what the plot is.<br/><br/>It starts off with a neat and clever little homage to American history that promises so much more than it delivers. Then it gets messy! We see our hero for the first time with his new girlfriend. And this is where the special effects is most impressive because those lips are surely not real? But she is easily the most beautiful thing about this film. It is RHW that stopped me from leaving prematurely. Not for her acting ability of course. But cue a bunch of random explosions and slow motion action sequences that seemingly have nothing to do with the story. No character development, the script is terrible and some of the one liners are cringe worthy. Throw in a couple of big name actors and actresses that have no reason to be there, but maybe good actors can salvage the mess? No they can't. Alan Tudyk is probably worth one star in this movie. But not enough to make a bad script work.<br/><br/>Shia disappointed me in this too. I always thought he had brilliant presence and charisma as an actor, but maybe because of a lack of story, direction and script it ruined his last outing as Sam Witwicky.<br/><br/>Yes the cars are gorgeous, RHW is too, the special effects are impressive, but only in the chase scene on the highway which was, might I add, a carbon copy of the first Transformers movie. All other effects lacked something I can't quite put my finger on. The ending is a joke too. It is no more than anyone expected but although the film was about an hour too long, the ending seemed horribly rushed.<br/><br/>But thank god this is the last one at least for Michael Bay. Just because your making a movie with fast cars, beautiful women, explosions and spectacular SFX, doesn't mean it'll be any good! <br/><br/>3 out of 10 for Alan Tudyk, SFX and RHW's lips!"

There are 3 reasons to consider this movie a big mess: <br/><br/>1. The scenes are always repeating their selves (two robots fight with each other, robots beating in humans, robots saving alien junk) and you can't realize were a robot start and finish, it's just a monumental confusion. <br/><br/>2. It was obvious to all the fans that Megan Fox was a huge part of the previous movies. She's not the best actress in the world, but she knew her part and how to do it. While her substitute spends too much time showing how lost she is in the movie (and please someone can explain to me how is possible to don't stain or tear apart a white coat when you are in a war zone and you fall out from a really tall building ). <br/><br/>3. The movie is too big, I mean two and half is a huge time. For me his impossible to understand how people didn't fall asleep. <br/><br/>The only thinks that make this movie a 3 are a acceptable performance (not great or amazing) by Patrick Dempsey, the 3D on the beginning, Shia LaBeouf (but I'm getting to start bored by these actor personalities in his roles).

"Bunuel1976","4","4","10","18 July 2011"," TRANSFORMERS: DARK Of The MOON (Michael Bay, 2011) **
","The original TRANSFORMERS movie from 2007 was about the only Michael Bay effort I had enjoyed. The first sequel (which came out 2 years later), however, was a dreary mess and, while its follow-up has been touted in some circles as the best of the series, a local write-up gave it the thumbs-down; having watched the film for myself, I have to agree with the latter opinion! <br/><br/>To be fair to it, the first half is not bad – even if one has to swallow the ruse that Apollo 11's 1969 Moon landing (complete with stock footage, and barely look-alike actors in long shot, of JFK and Richard Nixon, not to mention the presence as himself of one of the real-life astronauts involved in that historic moment i.e. Buzz Aldrin!) was really a covert mission to inspect the crash-landing of a massive space-ship emanating from the dying planet Cybertron! It transpires that the leader of the benign Autobots, Sentinel Prime, had succumbed in that disastrous escape flight but his body is retrieved and revived by his successor, Optimus Prime (who had already featured in the first two entries).<br/><br/>Their nemeses, the Decepticons, soon learn of this and they determine to put their hands on the remaining set of pillars (they are already in possession of about a hundred others) that would save Cybertron and guarantee their dominance. However, Sentinel is not quite what it is played up to be, having sold out to the Decepticon chief, Megatron (which itself lies in a state of disrepair for much of the proceedings, the result of its failure to gain the upper hand in the two previous TRANSFORMERS pictures). In the wake of this, humans decide they can no longer trust the Machines and the Autobots are banished; this concept of 'aliens' being misunderstood, feared and ultimately hunted down was also at the core, as was the JFK cameo and the fact that a famous political incident has been incorporated into the narrative for that matter, of X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011) which actually preceded this viewing! <br/><br/>Anyway, mixed with all of this are the usual suspects – Shia LeBeouf (who after two adventures is still basically at the point where we first met him, despite his having been honored with a medal for valor by none other than President Obama!), his girlfriend (Megan Fox having been dumped by the production, her character is suddenly deemed fickle and unworthy of our hero{!}, so she is replaced here by the likewise stunning but even less able acting-wise Rose Huntington-Whiteley and John Turturro (returning as the eccentric ex-CIA operative who has almost gone bourgeois in the interim). Also on hand are Frances McDormand as a supercilious CIA bigwig (her would-be comic banter with Turturro belongs in a Coen Bros. movie but clearly not here!), the even more incongruous (and basically irrelevant) casting of John Malkovich – evoking Jack Nicholson – as LeBeouf's touchy boss and Patrick Dempsey as Huntington-Whiteley's own hunk of a superior (who is improbably revealed as being in cahoots with the evil Decepticons!).<br/><br/>The worst part of it, though, is the fact that the climactic action bout takes up the entire last hour and it does not even prove especially exciting (more often it is noisy and inordinately muddled) apart from the spectacular set-piece in which the protagonists are trapped inside a leaning skyscraper: when eventually thrown out and made to slide down its façade, they are required to shoot at the windows underneath in order to break their fall and literally drop back safely into the building!"

","I enjoyed watching the 1st and 2nd Transformers movies, they had a believable story. However the 3rd film was complete trash, the story was utter garbage. The only good thing about the film are the effects. the ending is just terrible. The movie would only look good in the eyes of children (some children may not like it as countless civilians are being spared amongst the havoc, as the main characters just stroll in and survive everything). The way the SWAT team fall off a building and then glide at a supersonic horizontal speed with such control is beyond my belief. Terrible ending. No consideration to the destruction and death toll caused in Washington during or after the battle."
"mattbarberuk","Null","4","10","16 July 2011"," Transformers: Dark of the Moon - gross, overfed and offensive
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon – another piece of evidence in the trial of Michael Bay. A while ago I reviewed the previous Transformers movie, and I suggested that I was discomforted by Bay's sexual politics – his slightly unpleasant juxtaposing of Megan Fox's arse with shiny cars and metallic technology. Bay has skilfully avoided this in the third film of the trilogy by sacking Fox. Instead, he unpleasantly juxtaposes newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whitely arse with machinery. Does this help? No – instead Bay comes out of directing this film looking like a cross between a teenage boy and a fetishistic sex offender. And that's just the start of why I find Bay offensive...<br/><br/>The film concerns the discovery in 1969 of an Autobot (good Transformers) spaceship on the dark side of the moon. Inside the spaceship lies Septimus Prime, the legendary former leader of the Autobots, and a collection of mysterious columns. The Decepticons (nasty Transformers) use the columns to revive their flagging forces and, having apparently dispatched the last remaining Autobots, plot to enslave the human race.<br/><br/>Good points? Not many – the special effects are satisfying, particularly the mechanical Transformers. There is a degree of Top Gun pleasure in seeing explosions and militaristic technology and if you don't appreciate this then you find yourself appreciating the loving, if adolescent, care and attention Bay has lavished on his presentation of these elements. There is also something compelling about the tying in of the space race with the Transformer mythos – though this, as I will later suggest, is also taken too far and tips over into offensiveness. To give Bay his due – there is more plot in this movie than in the previous two combined.<br/><br/>Bad points? Unfortunately I have a limit on my website server that prevents me from listing all of the bad points of this movie – so I might have to summarise the main ones...<br/><br/>First – the aforementioned sexual politics. This is nothing new – the erosion of the distinction between technology and sex has been a staple of the action movie and it even enhances some movies. Michael Bay uses it bluntly however. He pans provocatively and lingeringly up the long legs of Huntington-Whitely then allows the camera to dwell with as much attention on the lines of a sports car. When used critically or even ironically these kinds of shots can be interesting – but here the enthusiastic fusion of sex and flesh with machinery and metal is just unsettling. When combined with Bay's unalloyed regard for the American armed forces it becomes worrying.<br/><br/>Second – the conspiracy plot. In some ways this makes the movie – the moon landing is a rich source of myth and paranoid narratives – but bay takes it too far. He suggests that the whole space race was a military conspiracy, depicting presidents, astronauts, cosmonauts, NASA administrators as complicit in the deception - he goes so far as to engages the real Buzz Aldrin to play himself. I think it's the scale of Bay's proposed conspiracy that is uncomfortable coupled with a clear lack of its implications. The space race, whilst a component of the Cold War, has always had an idealistic aura much like the climbing of mountains. To suggest, albeit in the context of a fantasy movie, that the space race was a part of a wider, covert military exercise is analogous to his combining technology with sex – the act of juxtaposition is not uncommon, but the way Bay does it makes it offensive.<br/><br/>Third – the battle scenes are interminably long and indistinct. For the casual viewer the sight of one machine fighting another is bound to be confusing – the sight of one machine fighting another for half-an-hour is enough to give you a headache. But again I felt uncomfortable. The final battle, taking place as it does in central Chicago, seems to draw a great deal of imagery from 9/11 – building toppling, people falling, panic, dust, shots of office paraphernalia tumbling from sky-scrapers. Again this is not unusual – but Bay frames these scenes in a prurient, almost salacious way. When he shows a man falling from a building he sticks with him almost to the end. The 3D technology give the viewer a real sense of what it may have been like to fall from the World Trade Centre – but it is tied up in a vision of fantasy spectacle that is just wrong. And as my wife noted – despite all this carnage, Rosie Huntington-Whitely still found time to change her outfit three times.<br/><br/>Amongst all this sex, conspiracy, militaristic posing and inappropriate nods to 9/11, the worst aspect of the movie must surely be that for all the money spent and for all the technology used, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is rather boring. Aside from the traditionally eccentric displays from Johns Malkovich and Turturro, the rest of the cast is bland and unengaging. The leads Shia LaBeouf and Rosie Huntington-Whitely act like they know they're in an action movie and fail to wring and chemistry or believability out of their performances. With Huntington-Whitely this is forgivable as it is her first proper role – with LaBeouf this is simply another performance that falls flat.<br/><br/>So apart from the fact that I find Michael Bay mildly offensive and Shia LaBeouf boring; apart from the fact I found the combination of technology and sex distasteful and the conspiracy narrative to be degrading; apart from the fact that I somehow found the battle scenes dull and perversely distasteful – I'd recommend you to go and watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon.<br/><br/>But don't forget your sleeping pills, blindfold and earplugs."

There are then huge chunks of the film that are not relevant, and would not be missed if cut.<br/><br/>I have been a long time fan of the transformers franchise. It is such a shame that this film has been made, as it damages the brand.

","This is my review on the third installment to the Transformers series. Let me first say after i watched the second one I really was not going to waste my time with this one. Though it was in 3d so i decided to check it out.<br/><br/>This movie is a lot like the second one. About an hour of story line(if you could call that a story) then about and hour and a half of explosions and CGI.Now if you watch movies and take them in at face value and all your looking for is explosions and CGI then by all means this may be your favorite film. As for any true film lovers like myself though if you enjoy story line, solid acting, good script and direction then this movie is probably not for you.<br/><br/>This is dirceted by Michael bay which of course means he is going to pump exsplosions and CGI whenever he can. And hell why not he makes hundreds of millions off these movies.<br/><br/>Overall though if you are looking for a good movie you can skip this one. If you are bored and like just watching explosions and and incredible CGI then go ahead. Better then the second one not as good as the first. 5/10"

"KCspur92","7","4","10","5 July 2011"," Best of the trilogy, but not of the year
","If you're looking for an action-packed weekend filled with explosions, a decent story line, plot twists, and a quick ending, then Transformers 3 is the movie for you. If you're looking for an amazing movie, you might be a little disappointed, but it's still quite a film.<br/><br/>TF3 is by far the best movie of the trilogy, but it's not a huge surprise if you've watched the last two movies. However, there are many reasons behind why this movie is the best of the three. The main reason: better story and character development. TF3 finally finds a way to take each key element in the film and make them surprisingly interesting, including the history of Cybertron, which plays a huge role towards the end of the movie. The film's plot twists are also quite surprising. They catch you off guard when the story is really setting in.<br/><br/>Aside from the story, the characters are also just as good. Shia Lebouf plays very well in this movie, along with his hilarious temper tantrums. Megan Fox doesn't appear in this film (As Shia dumps her after the second movie), but Rosie Whiteley plays just as well as Megan as Shia's new girlfriend: still as hot as before. My favorite performance of all the characters is Patrick Dempsey, who really caught me by surprise by the role he ends up holding later on in the film.<br/><br/>I have a few complaints about this movie that just peeve me. The movie has a run time that's longer than it should be. The particular issue causing this is the excessive amounts of action and explosions, which have 30-45 minutes of screen time that could've been used to create a more developed plot and a more satisfying ending. Michael Bay has made this mistake multiple times in the past and the situation isn't any different in this film. More story, less explosions.<br/><br/>Overall, though, Transformers 3 is still a must-see for all fans out in the world. It's a delight to see the classic robot characters on the big screen, and then some. Don't over look this movie if you're wanting to see an action-packed film. After all, if you want some action, Michael Bay is the man for you. (No sexual innuendo intended) 7/10"
"xamtaro","6","4","10","4 July 2011"," Contradicts the previous movies.
","Long, loud and proud of that fact, Transformers 3: Dark of The Moon is the ultimate testament to everything good and bad about a Michael Bay film. Superficial thrills, cheap spills and wham bam action abound in the supposed final chapter in the Transformers film franchise. Forget the coherent story, thought provoking themes or even any hint of human drama. Also forget the previous two films since this one tries to pretend they do not exist.<br/><br/>It is never a good thing to alienate one's core audience of devoted fans by literally screwing with both the continuity and the characters, but now Bay alienates even the fans of previous Transformers movies. The concept of two warring races of intelligent machines is kept but much has changed. The all powerful ""allspark"", the artifact of contention among the Autobot and Decepticon factions, is never mentioned and the war is now fought over a miraculous invention and its inventor stowed aboard a lost starship ""The Ark"". Where the first movie established that knowledge of the Transformers came from discovering a frozen Megatron in the arctic, this movie claims that Transformers were discovered on the moon by the Apollo 11 lunar landing. It also contradicts the second movie by revealing the lost inventor to be a ""Prime"" when it was established that all Primes other than Optimus died to defeat the Fallen.<br/><br/>So continuity be damned as the story opens with human protagonist Sam Witcicky, now hooked up with his rich new blond girlfriend Carly. Despite being recognized as a nation hero, Sam is down on his luck, unemployed and missing his days with the Autobots. But conflict soon comes a-calling when the Autobots discover the aforementioned lost spacecraft and its cargo. Cue the needlessly complex yet convenient series of events that includes human-decepticon collaborators, hidden conspiracies, illogical allegiance switching and more. What are the chances that Sam gets a job at the one place where his colleague is a target of assassination by the decepticons because he worked on the moon mission that first discovered the ark? What are the chances that Sam's girlfriend works for a dude who is working for the decepticons? The entire progression of events is way too convenient.<br/><br/>Then the story makes another critical error by not just failing to address unanswered questions from the previous films, but making new questions to be answered. This might not have been so bad with well written characters, but the main leads are as shallow as ever. The only highlight is the witty banter and jokes courtesy of Shia Le Beouf. Shia's timely lines and comedic nature makes for a rather endearing character. Yes the entire movie is funny, you will laugh, but no it is not ""well written"" from a character development standpoint. Characters are one dimensional and either intentionally or unintentionally funny, from the token muscular black dudes to the sneering haughty decepticon collaborator to the comic relief parents. In true Michael Bay fashion, the new female lead is less of a character and more of a boob and butt display whose only role is stand there posing and looking pretty.<br/><br/>Speaking of camera, here is the one improvement this film has and that is ""less erratic camera movements"". There are many scenes of Michael Bay's trademark jitter-cam and weird shot angles but thanks to the bulky stereoscopic 3D cameras used, such instances are reduced greatly from previous Bay movies. Bot on bot action could never have been any clearer. The many slow motion scenes allow the intricately designed robots and top notch special effects, possibly the strongest selling point of this film, to shine.<br/><br/>Long time transformers fans might sit on the fence with this one. On one hand, the whole movie combines elements from fan favorite episodes of the classic cartoon series (Ultimate Doom and Megatron's Master Plan) as well as plot points from 2008's ""All Hail Megatron"" comic story. Numerous shout outs to the cartoons, the comics and other science fiction shows like Star Trek are more than enough for the geeks to go gaga over. On the other hand, Autobots and decepticons get their characterizations screwed over again. The scheming backstabber Starscream is reduced to a sniveling lackey, the powerful and logic driven strategist Shockwave is reduced to a mere miniboss and the typically benevolent and peace loving Optimus Prime now has no qualms about massacring bots en masse and carrying out public executions.<br/><br/>By now, Transformers 3 would not be changing anyone's opinion of the film franchise. The stuff that people hate about it are taken to whole new levels but so is the stuff that people love about it. It is shallow but fun, superficial but entertaining; The only intellectual talking point of the film would be the implications of a big metal planet entering into earth's orbit. Physics says that such an occurrence is supposed to cause widespread disaster and wanton destruction. But who needs a metal planet when you have Michael Bay's Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon."
"gigan-92","5","4","10","4 July 2011"," Shia LaBeouf Killed Starscream? I call shenanigans!
","Let me start by saying the release of this movie literally crept up on me. Despite its flaws, I was actually left anxious enough to wait the sequel in 2009. However, I was disappointed to the extent I was hardly looking forward to this one. My low expectations were met, and once more what could have been more simply wasn't. Let's just walk through this one.<br/><br/>First off, the characters sucked ore than ever. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do nothing but bark orders every five seconds and yell ""What the hell is going on?"" multiple times. Shia LaBeouf's acting barely qualifies as acting at all as he resorts to mostly his ""Even Steven"" twitching antics with dialogue so predictable I hated every minute of his screen time. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley isn't much of an improvement acting wise, after all the movie opens up with a shot of her cute little butt in her undies and just like Ms. Fox only serves as eye candy. Her acting was never high on my list because she's a model, not an actress! And we've all seen enough of the Wittwicky parents damn it, its overkill. John Turturro is back to make a fool out of himself as usual and nothing shocking really happens to the human characters. We're shown the same old cliché over-the-top comedy skits over-laden with teen angst crap I can't bring myself to laugh anymore.<br/><br/>Now to the guys I really came to see the movie for It's a mixed bag here, one I can't go into without revealing a few spoilers. It's all 85% epic bullsh*t. The majority of the villains aside Sentinel had hardly any screen time what so ever. Starscream suffers a humiliating death at the hands of Witiwicky, which made me want to go home right on the spot. Ironhide dies, which was sad, but not a single moment did the movie to mourn him. In fact, not a single line of dialogue implies that anybody misses him. More new autobots, voiced by talent s such as Francesco Quinn and John DiMaggio, but the camera never remain son them for more than a few seconds. The tiny robots, which thankfully aren't as perverted and annoying as last time, get more screen time. Shockwave was amazing but barely in the movie. Laserbeak was pretty bad-ass himself. Sadly, Megatron literally does nothing the whole movie, till at the last minute is actually mocked by the wannabe actress. Who for some reason he doesn't kill her and then kills by a wounded Optimus in less than seven seconds. What a miraculous send-off.<br/><br/>The score borrows heavily from ""The Dark knight"", abuses an Aerosmith song, and over uses the song Iridescent by Linkin Park. In short it sucked. The action is all death-defying stunts and awesome CGI, no doubt entertaining but after two whole movies and this one's strenuous runtime, it just gets old. I'm afraid Michael bay has out done himself with the number of slow-motion shots, explosions and agonizing amount of detail on those CGI monstrosities., and he's rolling in the money for it. With this movie he's not just raping my childhood, he's raping cinema in general."
"MarcusJ13","6","4","10","30 June 2011"," Dark the Moon, the mediocre one
","The Transformers series started out quite strong but I knew as I watched that film that any attempt to make a 'bigger' film would end up with a clunky mess. Thus we had 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' which was a terrible in parts, overly complicated and had a dull climax. For these reasons I had pretty neutral expectations going into this film where I expected action by the bucket load but more hoped to gain enjoyment from it this time. The film starts out with our human protagonist Sam played once again by Shia LaBeouf with shoehorned girlfriend Carly played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The reason why I say shoehorned is because there is no introduction, they are just a couple. Of course I realise the absence of Megan Fox but after all Mikaela went through with Sam you'd think something pretty big would end that relationship. Anyway we've got two and a half hours to fill, Sam has to find a job and the Autobots must face off against the Decepticons again. The first act of this film very much feels like filler until the action comes rather than set up and that is where we get most of the 'humour' which falls flat around 60% of the time. I'm not going to get too wound up as if the film got treated completely seriously this time round it would make for a cringe inducing experience. By now though it was more of a slight distraction. Performances wise LaBeouf does a fairly good job with what he's given. Quite a good actor in all honesty and wasn't nearly as annoying as he has the potential to be. Carly, our new female lead is not very good and doesn't provide an improvement on Megan Fox. Maybe its the fault of the script but she was just uninteresting and obviously only really served as eye candy. <br/><br/>Other characters like Simmons returned to inject little to no decent comic relief. Gladly John Turturro is a good enough actor to be in the role and not be bogged down by what he's in. Special effects wise it is mostly more of the same, the action set pieces are better set up and are superior to second film. In truth at times it was spectacular to see especially towards the end before becoming very familiar the more it progressed. This had more to do with the film's run time which again well over two hours, you do have to brace yourself for it as certainly I felt it towards the end of the film. The Transformers looked as good as they ever did and if it is one thing the film gets right is that they did look very real. The Decepticons seemed to have more of a presence this time round as there appeared to more effort put into them as antagonists. They were satisfactory but never came across as particularly menacing as they wouldn't the third film in. The film more works out as a middle ground but could never capture why the first was the best. It is superior to Revenge of the Fallen but the final action climax did very much remind me of when I was bored in the cinema two years ago. <br/><br/>Overall though this is the mediocre edition to the series, its enjoyable on its own merits but not on a general film level. If you want to see this and enjoyed the series so far you'll probably enjoy this one. It is just simply a half decent Transformers film and an average action film."
"Doddi","10","4","10","30 June 2011"," Exactly what you look for in a blockbuster movie!
","For me there are several kinds of movies. One of them are blockbusters, which are most of the time brainless visual feast, something you enjoy watching and something you don't nitpick every little detail (like ""ah, this is so unbelievable"" or ""yeah, not very likely to happen..."").<br/><br/>Michael Bay is the top director in this category. He knows how to entertain and he is a visual master. I don't see how anyone can deny that.<br/><br/>The Transformers movies are not something where I'm relying heavily on plot and script. And believe me, you will hear about ""ridiculous story line"", ""why didn't this one do that in the previous films"" and more. But all I ask of you is this: what is it that you look for in a summer blockbuster movie? The CGI is getting better and better. This is really spectacular in 3D and the noise ... wow! It's amazing! I'm predicting this film to be the second most popular film of 2011 (after Harry Potter of course) and the reason is that it deserves it. There is a script, and the funny part is that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the one-liners the characters shout at each other, I think Shia is a great actor and we got a new female lead who is a lot more believable than Megan Fox was. Even big names like Frances McDormand and John Malkovich are added to the mix and make this more enjoyable. It may be easy acting in front of ""nothing"" (i.e. the robots added later) but the believability of it is a lot stronger here than in many other films.<br/><br/>Jabolonsky's music is powerful, cinematography is great, cgi is perfect, acting is believable, you will laugh, you will be excited and you will enjoy it.<br/><br/>Give in and let go ... enjoy this visual feast for it will blow your mind.

","I'm a bit iffy on this movie. This one is... OK. <br/><br/>This movie had a good first half. I found it to be a good build up and it seemed like the movie was gonna go very well... then came the second half. What a bore. Unoriginal, clichéd, predictable, and overall a huge letdown. the ending fight wasn't that good either. <br/><br/>What bothered me the most about this movie was Shockwave. Michel Bay said that Shockwave was the main villain of the movie... He is on screen for 3 minutes. 3 MINUTES! THAT'S ALL! And in that 3 minutes, he literally did nothing. In fact, he only said one thing throughout the entire movie: ""Optimus!"" No folks. Shockwave isn't the main villain. That title goes to Sentinel Prime. He is the one who is the main villain. MICHEL BAY! WE WERE TOLD THAT SHOCKWAVE WAS THE MAIN VILLAIN! ""YOU LIED TO US! YOU HAVE MADE A GRAVE MISTAKE!""<br/><br/>Most of the characters seemed a bit boring. The only one I truly liked was Laserbeak. Laserbeak was just so awesome. He's the Decepticon's assassin. And he is great at his job. Though he may enjoy it a bit too much. But that's why I liked him. To be honest, Laserbeak was actually an improvement upon all other versions of him, including G1. Laserbeak was great. If only the rest were as good. <br/><br/>Special Effects wise, this is amazing. The Transformers looked real. As if they were really there. It was great in the special effects department... everything else, not so much. <br/><br/>Anyone who says that the movie never explains anything is wrong. The movie does openly state its explanations. True some of them seemed a bit improbable, but it's still an explanation. There are also several elements that are self explanatory. However, despite explaining it all, the movie's story is still lackluster. <br/><br/>Overall, Dark Of The Moon is a serious letdown. It starts out great, but by the time you leave the theater the movie has degraded into crap. It fills you with excitement in the beginning, but will leave you empty when you leave the theater. If you want to see this movie, stop either when Sentinel brings army from the moon or when Laserbeak dies. After that there isn't much left."

","Okay, truthfully, no one who goes in to see a Transformers movie honestly cares about the story. They just come to watch giant robots beating each other up and blowing stuff up.<br/><br/>On that end, Dark of the Moon delivers tremendously. The visuals are stunning, the battles are intense, and the final climatic battle between Optimus Prime, Sentinel Prime, and Megatron was my absolute favorite part of the whole movie. The 3D in this is used well too. Shots of robots shattering apart in slow-motion or people swinging through the chaotic mayhem are breathtaking.<br/><br/>Now the plot. Okay, warning in advance that there are spoilers ahead in this next chunk and that the plot was garbage. So read on. So the whole premise is that there's a teleportation device from the Autobots on the moon. Like the last two movies, they have to race against the Decepticons to get it first and, unfortunately, like in the second movie, there is a long, complicated, and elaborate setup to make it work for the Decepticons that gives the Autobots just enough time to destroy an entire city and save it. There is a twist near the middle where a seemingly good robot goes bad and just had me thinking - what? Also, there is a second twist where you find out one of the supporting characters is a villain and is working for the Decepticons. However his motives are stupid, his lines are cheesy, and that whole subplot just felt dumb. Between the instances of robots killing each other, Michael Bay fills the dialogue with some humorous one-liners and situations but they eventually grow old and feel overdone - the Asian guy (Ken Jeong) from The Hangover was funny in this but it got old after the first minute or so.<br/><br/>The acting I guess was so-so considering there weren't a whole lot of instances where they really needed to try. Of course, everyone's wondering about Megan Fox's replacement - Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. She does good for most of the film though I did catch a few instances where I just sort of cringed - kind of like, ""oops, she messed up."" Shia LaBeouf is pretty funny and for once, while the parents are still in the film, their roles do not feel overdone.<br/><br/>Overall, Dark of the Moon's plot was a horrible, jumbled, inconsistent, plot-hole filled mess that some amazing battle sequences at the end manage to help you with in enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>Don't expect anything different from the others but be prepared for the best visuals this year!"

","I'm a hardcore transformers fan and just got home from from the cinemas. Got to say I am very disappointed and after Bay promising this movie was going to be a big step up from the last 2, it never felt like it.<br/><br/>Michael Bay overdid this movie, he should have kept it simple. He should have known the factors which made the last 2 movies a success and re create it or at least include some of it but Dark of the Moon tried to do too many things and failed to focus on the core.<br/><br/>A small example, for any movie the soundtrack is a major part and I was surprised to see it took an hour and half into the movie for transformers trademark soundtrack. Last 2 movies they gave me goosebumps every time Optimus Prime entered the scene with background music on, but this time around it was more like 'meh'. <br/><br/>I always thought Megan Fox was just about looks, but the new girl made Megan Fox's acting look very good.

"yorker_eels","5","4","10","28 June 2011"," A more-than solid action flick and what you'd expect if you have an open mind
","To start off, I'm a big fan of Transformers. Loved the first movie. Second was iffy, but I still enjoyed it for what it was. This one however, is quite impressive for the third entry into what is supposedly only a ""shallow action"" series.<br/><br/>The movie creates a tone that is bigger and darker by far than either of the first two. Though integral to the climax of the first two movies, the idea of the fate of the world didn't seem all that imminent to the plot. In this entry however, the entire second half of the movie has that 'end of the world' feel to it, and it's pulled off very well.<br/><br/>In terms of pacing, I believe the first transformers was very strong here where as the second one sort of seemed to try and throw in as much action where ever it could. This one takes on a much different formula. The first two-thirds of the movie are very contemplative with only a few action scenes. They are much more dramatic than in the previous films though, and replace that comic-nature (that was pulled off in the first one, but overdone in the second) with a valid seriousness. This works well in establishing the final third of the movie, which is all hi-tech action.<br/><br/>I won't go into how great the CGI or 3D are, because those are a given. Nor will I go on about the Rosie vs. Megan debate, as that is only a minor issue regardless of who you favour. However, I will say that Rosie definitely holds her own.<br/><br/>In terms of appearance though, the Transformers seem to have a cross between the alien, militaristic style in the first one and the cartoon style of the second.<br/><br/>We have some new additions to the mechanical cast here, include a red Ferrari, an ancient prime and one huge mother of a mechanical worm that you may have seen tearing a building in two during the trailer. The transformers also get some new weapons and alternate modes to keep it fresh.<br/><br/>Annoying robots (ie. Skids and Mudflap) have been removed. Although they had some good parts, they detracted from the overall experience and made it a little silly. Wheelie's role and attitude have both been reduced so that he isn't so annoying either. Unfortunately, we now have the 'Wreckers' - who have a few of their own silly parts - but these are extremely minor and one-fiftieth as large as the role the twins played in part two.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that Megatron had such a small and insignificant role in this film. He is meant to be the main villain of the franchise and the leader of the Decepticons. In the first one he was nearly god-like in strength (to the point where I think Optimus Prime was hard done by). In the second one we find out that he has been mysteriously bowing down to the Fallen all along - which would seem to go entirely against his character. And in this one he is all depressed and doesn't take part in any action sequences until the very end - which only lasts for a few seconds. ***SPOILER*** His death at the hands (or hand) of a one-armed Optimus at the end was very disappointing. If I had to point out a downer in the movie, that would be it. From being indestructible in the first, and relatively even-matched in the second, Megatron is defeated extremely quickly, easily and cheaply. Even more disappointing than the ease with which the supposedly god-like Fallenw as defeated in part two.<br/><br/>Luckily though, Megatron isn't the central villain in this film. I won't give away which Transformer is though.<br/><br/>I also wanted a larger part from Shockwave. He looked menacing and got several camera angles and character remarks that suggested he would be a very important villain and character. But he doesn't have much screen time at all, doesn't do a huge amount of fighting, and only says one word in the entire film.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed this film for what it was - a great action film. I also enjoyed it that added bit extra because I am a fan of giant talking robots, but also because the enormity of the plot, the emotion put into the character's, and the overall darker tone - really helped to make this more than just an action movie.<br/><br/>Definitely better than the second. Hard to compare against the innocence of the first - I'd have to watch it again to do so. Definitely very different though, which is good. Good job on concluding your series Michael Bay.<br/><br/>PS: Shia really steps up his performance in this one, and shows us a new range to his acting abilities."

You have to watch it.Must watch in 3D in very big screen to have all of it.

","It was awesome. The best movie of the summer. The acting was spot on. The robots were amazing. The music was top notch. Rosie was hot. g g g As a huge fan of the Transformers animated series, I was disappointed with first Transformers film. I didn't really like the look of the Autobots and thought it was a little annoying. When I saw Transformers 2, which is a HUGE mess of a film, I was really angry. I vowed never to see a Transformers film ever again. But when the trailer of Transformers 3 came out, I actually got a little interested. I mean the special effects were pretty much great as usual. But this time, it seemed they took off the annoying little robots and that annoying mother and replaced them with good old fashioned action.<br/><br/>When I went to an advanced screening yesterday, I still came in with relatively low expectations. I have to say, that Transformers 3 is an overall improvement from its predecessor, Transformers 2. The film was pretty much at level with the first film, though. The action scenes were highly extravagant and at times, pretty epic. The movie had a lot less lame scenes, which is always a plus. The acting though, has not improved at all though. Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was not unbearable, but she's certainly not a good actress, but a mediocre one, at the same level with Megan Fox. Although Megan Fox is definitely hotter. As usual though, the story was unremarkable and extremely abysmal at times, but not as horrible as the first film though.<br/><br/>Overall I rate Transformers 3, an 8/10. Don't go in expecting a Best Picture winner/nominee. With the right amount of expectations, you will probably be fulfilled. A definite improvement over Revenge of the Fallen, which doesn't say much. But at the end, the great special effects and extremely extravagant action scenes more than make up its flaws. A summer flick that rises above the usual, noisy summer blockbuster films. I definitely recommend this film if you overall liked the franchise."

","Hi,<br/><br/>I saw the other two, first one was entertaining, second one was awkward and I just stayed up late to watch this third one......... its long, its rubbish, its by far the worst one......trust me. <br/><br/>I cant believe how bad the scenes were between the new bird (who is hot and English and cant act) and Sam, so cheesy, so pointless. Its hard to watch...<br/><br/>How do people get away with using such bad scripts, i don't get it. the film costed so much and they couldn't even be bothered to make it understandable, not that i couldn't follow it, i just couldn't comprehend it. It goes nowhere, the editing is terrible and i made no connection at all with any of the characters, the comedy was awful, i wanted to enjoy it and i'm open minded to all films, but please don't watch this, i beg you.<br/><br/>The only reason i didn't give it a 1 is because of the SFX, as usual the best bits are when the autobots are going off their tits. But the storyline, acting, stupid soppy scenes and inappropriate credits music are ridiculous, aggravating and tedious.<br/><br/>Imagine a great film, like taxi driver, or the lord of the rings or whatever you love. That feeling you get after seeing a great film, you know, when you know you have taken something away forever...its nice isn't it.....................<br/><br/>HOWEVER <br/><br/>THIS FILM WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING TO TAKE AWAY APART FROM A DEEP AGONISING FRUSTRATION, NAUSEA AND A NEED TO WRITE AN ANGRY REVIEW ON IMDb.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, I dislike you for planting this mess on society.

"james_c9110","1","3","7","29 July 2011"," The Transformers trilogy only gets worse...
","After apologising for the underwhelming second Transformers release Michael Bay, the director of all three films, promised that Dark of the Moon would get the trilogy back on it's feet. It seems that he has not only failed to learn from his mistakes but has actually managed to produce a film worse than the critically slaughtered Revenge of the Fallen.<br/><br/>The film is pretty much split in two in terms of plot. The first half follows the main character Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) through his failed job hunting days, in which he spends a lot of his time moaning about his lack of independence and sizing up the competition that is his girlfriend's boss. We don't see much of the Transformers themselves during this part of the film, besides an Autobot mission in Ukraine and an annoying assassin robot killing annoying people. The focus here is on Sam's relationship with Carly, that's right Megan Fox's character is gone. She is played by first time acting model (alarm bells should be ringing) Rosie Huntington Whitely who plays the posh, well educated British type. Why does Hollywood insist all British people are like that? We're introduced (reintroduced in some cases) to several other over the top characters in this part of the film including Sam's Boss (John Malkovich) and Agent Simmons why is John Turturro still in these films!?<br/><br/>The second part of the film is pretty much one giant battle in Chicago. Megatron; leader of the Decepticons (the Transformer villains) has come up with a plan to wake up a long lost army, invade earth and enslave the human race in order to rebuild Cybertron; the transformer's home world. The Autobots, the US military and Sam Witwicky go in to try and fight them off. There's a huge robot snake thing that destroys a skyscraper, soldiers skydive into the city from battle helicopters and the transformers Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and co tear apart Decepticons. This should be exciting and wake the audience up after a boring first hour and a half, but it is done in such a way that it has you muttering to yourself please end now please end now. Bay seems to have the need to shoot EVERYTHING in slow motion, including Huntington-Whiteley's ass. The dialogue delivered by the Transformers and soldiers whilst they're fighting is ridiculously cringe worthy. There are several moments where the film has the opportunity to do the unexpected; to kill off a main character! They come ridiculously close to dying each time but, surprise surprise, are saved by the perfect timing of something falling or a hero who you thought was miles away turning up. This happens far too many times<br/><br/>Michael Bay doesn't seem to understand that what matters in a film is a good story and scenes that are effectively put together, not how much stuff you can blow up in slow motion."

","Okay, first let me say, I loved the movie! It was exactly what I expected it to be... Now, that being said... Blondie bugged the F**K out of me! 1. Why bother with another female character at all? I mean, Sam LOVED Mikayla, and yet.. now he suddenly thinks this new one is THE ONE. BS! 2. Coupla holes here, why is Sam in possession of Bones (the dog, Mikayla's dog!) and why does he have the little decepticon, turned autobot, guy that humped Mikayla's leg in Revenge? 3. Anyone notice that even though Miss Blondie stick girl was being held HOSTAGE, she managed to change outfits three times? Seriously? She's a prisoner, but just happened to bring a change of clothing? Three changes of clothing?? Really??? 4. Anyone notice that no matter what happens, Blondie's white clothes are never dirty? She's never dirty? Why? I think they were trying way too hard to replace the ""romantic interest"" that they managed to lose my interest in her completely! I agree that John Turturro's character was more annoying that useful in this flick. I did love that Sam seemed to have grown some balls in this movie. The stupid watch thing, though, just about drove me nuts! One minute he's all bad ass and forceful, then he just goes stupid slapstick and it really kills the pace of the movie. It was an unnecessary scene.<br/><br/>Still loved the flick, still give it a 9, maybe even a 9.5. Yay!"

","After being very entertained by the first Transformers film,that I had somehow not heard about,until a friend kindly borrowed me the DVD of the movie.I felt that due to enjoying the first film a lot,I decided that for the second one,I would make sure to watch it at the cinema,and though the film did feature some impressive fight scenes,which were a stunning blend of real locations,and eye-catching special effects, (the great ""forest"" battle,being a fantastic centrepiece for the film)the movies plot sadly seemed to run out of steam at around the first hour mark,which left the rest of the film feeling very drawn out and too slow paced.With having been left a bit disappointed by the second one,I was happy to see from the trailers to the third film,that director Michael Bay may have gotten his grove back with the franchise.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>The 1960's/1970's:<br/><br/>With their only chance of winning the war to save their planet from being completely destroyed,being lost,due to a ship which contains their main leader and a very powerful secret weapon being shot down,and left to gather dust on the moon.The Autobots (now being led by new leader Optimus Prime)have to make an extremely painful decision to leave their planet, (which is now being over run by the Decepticons)and try to live in secrecy on a planet far away called Earth. Meanwhile on Earth,the US and Russia are going head-to-head in a fight to be the first superpower to send a team to the Moon,to try and discover what is inside a strange looking ship,which seems to have crashed.With the US astronauts winning the race,and being the first ever people to land on the moon,the astronauts are told that their main mission (which they have to swear under-oath to never tell anyone about)is to gather everything that is contained in the ship,and take it back with them,for extensive inspection on Earth.Opening the ship,everyone that is on the Moon and watching the encrypted video feed,suddenly have a strong shiver go up their spines,when along with five small metal pillars,the ship also seems to contain a huge (thankfully) shut-down robot!<br/><br/>The present:<br/><br/>Having helped the Autobots to beat the Decepticons, (and also stopping the world from being destroyed)Sam Witwicky is now struggling to make his parents and his new girlfriend (Carly) proud,by getting hold of a job.Suddenly,Sam gets the opportunity to work at a place where,he gave an intensionally bad job interview.Whilst doing his boring work duties,Sam is confronted by a man who claims to be an ex-N.A.S.A scientist. ,that worked on a top-secret project for the government.As Sam is just about to bin some very extensive hand written notes,that the ex-scientist passed him. (due to Sam thinking that the guys a conspiracy nut)The former N.A.S.A. scientist is found dead,after having ""jumped"" from his office window.Reserching with Carly,Sam discovers that most of the people that the man used to work with,have almost all died over the last few weeks from very sudden deaths and suicides.Suspecting that the Decepticons are up something,Sam goes to the Autobots to tell them what he has discovered.After telling the Autobots what he has found,Sam and the Autobots are stunned to learn that the US government has been keeping quiet about some ""artifacts"" that they discovered during the first moon landing,When the ""artifacts"" are at last brought down,the Autobots shockingly realise that these ""artifacts""- are in fact five pillars,which can be used to make a ""bridge"" to a planet,that would cause the whole solar system to be completely destroyed!,and an Autobot called Sentinel Prime,who used to be their leader.Fearing that the Decepticons are trying to gather up all the pillars,The Autobots tell Sam and the US government,that the only way they can beat the Decepticons,is to re-power Sentinel Prime. Although neither the humans or the Autobots begins to suspect, that bringing Sentinel Prime back to life might lead them to fall in to a very nasty trap...<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Whilst I was waiting in the queue,to get hold of a ticket to the film,I noticed a huge poster for the movie at the front of the box office.Looking down the list of credits on the poster,I began to get very nervous when,I noticed that the writer for this film ,(Ehren Kruger) was also the person that had written the screenplay for the terrible Scream 3.Thankfully,Kruger shows with this film a huge improvement,by giving the slightly injured franchise a strong,gripping back-to-basics feel,by mostly getting rid of the very ill-fitting juvenile humour,and instead replacing it with an unexpectedly thrilling conspiracy storyline,which helps to give the film a strong foundation,and also gives the stunning action scenes a sense that they are connected with the films plot and not just a separate entity.With having gotten a huge amount of attention due to replacing Megan Fox,Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is sadly given a disappointing role as Carly.Who due to coming from a militarily family,should really have been allowed to join in on the battles scenes of the film,instead of being a character that is pushed to the sidelines,mostly spending her time waiting to be rescued.For the fantastic 3D in the film,director Michael Bay cleverly uses it to give the Transformers and the destroyed locations a strong sense of depth,with only one scene in the film, (where a character gets a gun pointed to their face)having the 3D effect ""jump out"" to the audience,which helps show the feeling of terror that the character is experiencing.As the film starts to open up the plans of the Decepticons,Michael Bay really starts to open up some truly astonishing action scenes,with the last hour of the film moving at an amazing speed,which includes a mix of jaw dropping stunts (an excellent,almost James Bond style sky diving sequence) and incredible computer generated effects (the transformations of all the Autobots/Decepticons from vehicles to their real selves being given an incredible amount of detail.)"

","In fact I think I loved it.<br/><br/>I absolutely felt let down by ROTF and was totally apprehensive about seeing this film, I saw it a few hours ago and I'm still buzzed, I'm watching SATC2 to come down. <br/><br/>I felt like I wasn't angry with the movie unlike when I watched part II, everything was the same but slightly different, more muted, not a lot, but more grounded in reality, again a little.<br/><br/>Mike Bay is no longer The Fallen, it's official. <br/><br/>The movie is too long, loud, mental and semi offensive but all that gets a pass as Bay is on Bayform again. <br/><br/>People saying Rosie Huntington Whitley can't act can fall silent, I can act and for her debut performance in a feature film of this scope she pulls it off with aplomb and a slight coolness, plus for a woman she's hot. <br/><br/>Shia is the weak link again, I like the dude but he needs to take it down a notch, a notch the size of Jupiter. <br/><br/>Frances MacDormand apart from looking EXACTLY like my mum, and how off putting and weird is that in films, I've still not recovered from her turn in Burn After Reading, I mean she looks like my mum, anyway she is great in this role, slightly amused but not showing it, classy. <br/><br/>Military goes bang as expected and it's awesome to behold. <br/><br/>I hate, hate, hated part II Bays redeemed himself in my book. <br/><br/>Looked amazing, Sentinel was great, Shock and Soundwave totally underutilised, though looked very cool, imagine how much more cooler the end battle would be with less generic-decepticons and some actual characters, Laserbeak is excellently done. <br/><br/>I'm totes pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Part IV please Mr Bay."
"olympiantem","7","3","7","30 June 2011"," DOTM Is Certainly Not Perfect But The Best Of Its Franchise
","I would like to start off by saying That Transformers Dark Of The Moon is far from a perfect movie nor an Oscar winning picture, but its a great summer flick that entertains the audience with Eye popping 3D and state of the art Visual effects that doesn't fail to deliver. <br/><br/>DOTM, unlike its predecessor is a more intense and emotional movie and is obviously shown in the seriousness of war and the loss of lovable characters. Although DOTM does have its disadvantages, as well as plot holes and a scrappy, rushed ending that wasn't done right. The conclusion of the film left me thinking it was the end of an episode from the TV show and certainly not a farewell film for Michael Bay and Shia LaBeouf, who are both leaving the franchise. <br/><br/>The ending scene really really bothered me and I'm sure it bothered several others who thought the Transformers franchise deserved a proper farewell (for the time being) not just a quick, abrupt, narrated and almost rushed and heartless ending. The end scene just featured Optimus Prime narrating his epic ""speeches"" before the scene, not only quickly cuts to the Earth's atmosphere but also Michael Bay's name as well as Linkin Park's great ""Iridescent"". The movie deserved a proper ending scene, judging that it has come so far (1,2,3). The movie itself was done so well it was ruined by a poorly executed end scenario. <br/><br/>Sure there are some plot holes, not major ones and certainly the element of surprise when Ken Jeong made a funny, yet ironic performance as Wang as well as the sudden appearances of Barricade, of whom we haven't seen in action since cowering away from the fight in the first Transformers. The plot holes are obvious and its always made in the Transformers films as in this movie sudden disappearances of the Doc Bot and the decepticon hatchlings were subject to Bay's ""carelessness"" as well as some really corny scenes for example when Carly went to give Megatron a ""pep talk"".<br/><br/>The acting wasn't great, but neither was it bad. I thought Rosie Huntington Whiteley did the best she could, though it isn't great cut her some slack, she's a model. Not an actress. Shia did brilliant as Sam Witwicky once more, with his usual role a ""damsel"" in distress crying for help from his Autobot friends. Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving etc. did their characters justice once more and Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Frances McDormand, John Turturro, Patrick Dempsey and John Malcovich where also solid as well as the rest of the supporting cast in the film.<br/><br/>The 3D was brilliant, nowadays 3D is a regular thing and its as if it is a routine to go into a film with ridiculous looking glasses on and watch a movie, sometimes to no avail. But Transformers DOTM sure hit the money with the 3D. At some points it felt almost realistic. I urge everyone to see this picture in an IMAX theater or the best theater possible to get the maximum experience from this flick. I would love another Transformers with not necessarily new characters but a more diverse Transformers universe with additions like Hot Rod, Ultra Magnus and Galvatron with god-like Transformers like Unicron and Primus.<br/><br/>DOTM still has some corny jokes in there, some points unnecessary but at some points its just for laughs. The action sequences were there with great choreography and amazing ""Transforming"" from car to Robot. Surprisingly enough there was also some emotional scenes that were at the verge of heart breaking such as the scene Bumblebee seems to have given up his will to live as well as the tragic and sudden death of Ironhide. But the movie can't help but feel rushed. Starscreams death was at the verge of pathetic and Megatron's totally abrupt, as if portraying the two main antagonists from the first two films as weak. Shockwave has limited to almost no screen time. He gets a line or two and at some points hes a definite bad-ass but don't let the posters fool you. Shockwave (spoilers) isn't the main villain in this film, the betrayal of Sentinel Prime came as a complete shocker for me and perhaps the whole theater and in the end got what he deserved. The ""Megan Fox"" issue didn't bother me at all. I actually enjoyed the movie more without her. <br/><br/>In the end Transformers Dark of the Moon is a wonderful movie to watch with some friends at the cinemas. Its a great experience to just sitback, wear 3D glasses and enjoy the action of Transformers 3 as well as its ridiculously epic score and repetitive playing of Linkin Park's ""Iridescent"" to full effect. A great thrilling ride despite its flaws."

","This movie is nothing short of a disappointment. It was made into even more of an adult film than before(lots of obscenity and at one point Jerry Wang(Ken Jeong) acts as if he was going to rape Sam Witwicky while in the bathroom and also mentions sexual words such as deep throat), a human willingly cooperates to help the villains transform the Earth into a new Megatron, the movie is advertised as 3D but only a small fraction is in 3D, and there was barely any info given about what happened between Sam(Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela(Megan Fox) except for one small line which is she broke up with him the specifics were not mentioned and was probably done quickly due to Removing Megan Fox from the cast."
"OttoVonB","4","5","15","30 June 2011"," What is it with trilogies?
","Since the late 80s, the common perception has been that there are two ways to make a trilogy (if you absolutely must): the continuity-based, 3 act Star Wars type, or the ""keep the main character, throw out the rest"" Indiana Jones approach. Why Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean chose to follow the former, I will never know, but that proved their undoing. Now Transformers follows that same path.<br/><br/>Transformers I was simple, light fun. It seemed perfectly comfortable with the fact that it had giant robots based on a toy-line, and Spielberg's stamp counterbalanced Michael Bay's beautifully. Transformers II tried to be ""Empire Strikes Back"" when it could have gone ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". It deliberately ignored the fact hat we came for the giant robots, and to a lesser extent, Shia LaBouf's Sam Witwicky. And it didn't want to hear how little we cared about the military team or Megan Fox's plastic girlfriend.<br/><br/>Along comes Transformers III, a case study in Michael Bay's strengths and flaws. When it allows itself to be silly or crazy-violent (collapsing buildings, Optimus slapping the crap out of something, John Malkovitch) it works, it really does. But when it tries to be a Homeric drama, it stumbles badly. There are changes, many of them improvements on the dismal and bloated ""Revenge of the Fallen"": Megan Fox is replaced by another piece of plastic, less spunky but arguably more likable. People who accused part II of racial stereotyping will find less to hiss at. And there are no giant robot balls.<br/><br/>The flaws are the same: the messy plot and bloated running time leave more room than they should to question some gaping plot holes: the ""cunning trap"" allowed many effective moments to strike out at the autobots, and none were taken. The main villain's motivations only half make sense. And the historical revisionism is mostly pathetic, as is the omnipresence of flapping flags and Optimus delivering one too many sanctimonious speeches.<br/><br/>So see it if you want to see the series to its probable ending. But see it with low expectations, and if your idea of good 3D is stuff lurching out the screen at you, you can skip the extra expense here."

","Honestly, I've never been this disappointed before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by their hardworking PR, unless you want to see an easy popcorn movie with 2 1/2 hours to waste! I can easily list 100 consistency errors throughout the film and all kind of other ridiculous too-good-to-be-true details (such as why on earth these super transformers can't shoot straight but why our so called heroes always better shooters? why they always have time to chit chat nonsense whilst they seem to be in an extreme situation etc) and too common scripts without too much thoughts behind, just purely trying to get some cheap laughs from the audience!!!<br/><br/>There are so many scenes that are not relevant to the plot at all, that I don't know why they are there in the first place. The film is just all over the place! It seems like there's a different person directing each shot, and they kind of combining them together in the end! There are also too way many characters that are in the film for NO REASON at all. They contribute nothing, just talk nonsense, and purely serve a very cliché purpose of their roles like the soldier captains who always tried to be cool and the hot girl who always somehow managed to look hot, and ready for sexy posing anytime even when things flying around but managed not to hit her! Or simply she is Sam's some gf, she can follow him even to the most top secured places in military, and of course, in high heels!<br/><br/>You can always spot various clichés in the film like you go to a rusty bar in somewhere, showing your guns and hard talk and you dig out a top secret just like that! Or the timing always works in favour of our heroes, and against the enemies. etc...<br/><br/>Also, I kept asking myself:<br/><br/><ul><li>Why on earth the Transformers have to speak in English, a human language when they talk to one another of their own race???? </li></ul><br/><br/>(Come on, I just watched Game of Thrones on Sky recently, and they are even bothered enough to invite a language expert to create a whole new language for the Dothraki for the film, and of course the actors/actresses speak in this language themselves)<br/><br/><ul><li>Why on earth Optimus did not kill Megatron properly before? We're sure he knows well enough how to kill a Decepticons PROPERLY? At this rate, Megatron will never die and keep coming back!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why on earth most of the film has to be filmed at some very typical American cities like DC and Chicago, is it because the transformers love America that much that they would do anything in these cities, apart from very few scenes somewhere else? Or is it because it would be easier/cheaper to use their already-have studio to film? honestly, I got fed up with all the action films in New York/ D.C ! Come on, the world is a big place, don't try to fit the whole story in 1 or 2 American cities, that makes the film really lame and crippled.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The end of the film is supposed to be very dramatic, with our world on edge of slavery but there is NO SINGLE SCENE showing people/families in worry, in panic, in some emotional state! There is very few scenes of the public! Only Sam and his gf running around, the world has never seem to be so small and limited in any films about our world before!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why on earth the story HAS TO BE AROUND the boy named SAM? OK, I got it. he is a key person in the beginning story and may be the one after that. But look, I would really to know MORE ABOUT THE TRANSFORMERS. ABOUT THEM! Not any more single details about the boy Sam, who I can obviously see used as a tool by the film director to attract young boy audience who can relate to as if they were in the film, through the adventure, from nobody to somebody, has nice cars, hot girls, and be a hero saving the world (just coincidently, tick all boxes of all young boy dreams?).. and thus sell the tickets. If it were me, I would tell a really deep, SERIOUS story about the transformers race, their world, their planets, their history (a more full and comprehensive history rather than some bits and pieces like at the moment) and wouldn't it be fantastic to have battles on their planet or in the universe for a change? let's make it epic, and really on a world/planet/universe scale, rather than trying to push it around a boy named Sam! Its purely commercially driven and thus wasting its unlimited potential and freedom to make a great epic story itself.</li></ul><br/><br/>Sadly, transformers are one of the most exciting things but you can see they are no where the centre of the story, but instead being used as some toys adding some effects the film rather than the main characters themselves. Need more hard work, and passion to your supposed to be main characters, Michael Bay!<br/><br/>All in all, I just barely survived my worst cinema experience ever. Anyone with half of a brain can easily see the film is badly written, badly directed, badly edited but heavily commercial driven! Simply a popcorn movie."

Rosie plays a useless and meaningless character in the movie but exist in much of the movie. if you want to watch Rosie, download a copy of V.S. fashion show, that will be much better..."

","I gave this movie a 2nd viewing recently and oh my God it's horrible. What a rambling disconnected mess. This is a B MOVIE with some A list actors like John Tutorro and Leonard Nimoy but the script is just horrible. It's so bad that I can't tell if the directing is any good. The only part that was even remotely entertaining is Sam struggling with the Decepticon watch/spybot.
I remember liking Armageddon but I'm literally loathe to rewatch it for fear of this same 2nd-viewing disappointment.
How did Bay manage to make so many of these boneheaded movies??"
"hollo-peter","9","2","4","1 July 2011"," Excellent finish for an excellent franchise
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third and final installment of Michael Bay's Transformers franchise. Viewers had to wait 2 years for this sequel just like they did in case of the 2nd one. The question is: Was it worth it? Did the movie live up to its expectations? (Obviously, expectations were set by the people who did not become haters after watching the first two.) Well, it's a yes and no. In the main areas where we expect Transformers to do its job, the film excels. That is, visual effects, fun (and yes, I mean fun, laughter, because Agent Simmons and the Witwicky parents do their job for the 3rd time and also it's fun to watch Shia arguing with Bumblebee), heroic scenes, great villains and top notch voice acting (Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is just superior, and thanks for Leonard Nimoy, too).<br/><br/>We see some great cameos just like in the previous film. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand appear and those who liked Hangover will be happy to see the Chinese gangster. Alan Tudyk was silly but a necessary addition to Simmons' character.<br/><br/>And it's a no because there is just so much action in 150 minutes that there's no time to elaborate the characters' stories - including not only the new ones but good-old' Witwicky and pretty much the rest.<br/><br/>So why did I give it 9 out of 10? Because I am capable of realising that a movie that has a 2 and a half minute-long trailer full of explosions just like its predecessors sums up the film for the 3rd time and tells you what exactly you can expect: a lot of explosions.<br/><br/>If you have not watched the cartoon made in the 80's you'll not see the small references to it. You will not be relieved to hear Peter Cullen talk. If you want to see a film with the caliber of the King's Speech or The Godfather you will not appreciate the modest acting present in Transformers.<br/><br/>The 2nd film definitely had its flaws but Mr Bay fantastically ended the story. I give the film a solid 9 out of 10 because I can value Transformers for what it really is: an entertaining summer blockbuster movie fully utilising today's technology in terms of audio and visual effects."

","Sometimes I think this is the weakest out of the three and sometimes I think its as good as ROTF. My main problems with this movie is the pacing being very slow compared to the first two movies along with the human story and transformers story not linking up as well. The story however is the best out of all of them. The first movie's story is very simple and the second movie's story needs some explaining to understand it. There are only two additions that I like, that being sentinel prime, laserbeak, and shockwave. Megatron doesn't serve that much purpose in this movie and feels like a starscream to sentinel. There are some great action scenes as well but i feel like its more than half of the time surrounded on humans. Somehow Barricade is in this movie but never was shown or mentioned in ROTF. Sentinel was a pretty great villain with some good motives and Shockwave was pretty powerful and was just as amazing as sentinel. The editing is sometimes weird and even the soundtrack isn't as good as the first two movies. With the death of ironhide, megatron, starscream, and the trust shared between the autobots and humans shaken, the series should have perfectly ended here."

"fernandoschiavi","6","0","0","25 May 2020"," The destructive spectacle is real and genuinely impressive, but terrible as a cinematic experience: too many characters, many subplots, comic reliefs that do not work
","In 2009, with the success of the first film, Bay did what he does best: more destruction and more explosions. It is difficult to truly like the second film. But, of course, the film again made a lot of money at the box office, making part three inevitable. For those who thought that the second film was just about shots, beating and bombing, you should not have watched ""The Hidden Side of the Moon"". The plot even anchors at an important moment in the history of mankind, making a fun relationship with historical facts - that the script seeks to tie with archival scenes and digital (unfinished) recreations of US presidents - between the fate of Cybertron, the planet ravaged by the civil war between Autobots and Decepticons, and the space race fought by the USA and the USSR in the 1950s and 60s. This historical stuff and glimpses of the robot planet give renewed interest to the series, even though they disappear there in the middle of the film, right after Buzz Aldrin - himself - shows up.<br/><br/>In the plot, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), participate in secret missions alongside the humans, where they try to exterminate the Decepticons existing on the planet. One day Optimus discovers that the humans hid something that happened to him on the far side of the moon. It is the fall of a spaceship from Cyberton, commanded by Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), which triggered the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in 60s. The Autobots decide to go to the Moon to rescue the old leader, in addition to the capsules that are still in place. At the same time, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives with his new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and is looking for a job. He feels diminished, having saved the planet twice and won a medal from President Barack Obama, but none of this seems to help him establish himself in the job market. To make matters worse, Carly earns well and is harassed by the boss, billionaire Dylan Gould (Patrick Dempsey). Shortly after finally getting a job, Sam receives a message from Jerry (Ken Jeong), who works in the same place. Jerry worked at NASA during the space race and is now blackmailed by the Decepticons, who kill him. The fact makes Sam look for the Autobots once again, but despite his past achievements he encounters resistance from the new commander, Marissa Faireborn (Frances McDormand).<br/><br/>The prologue, which recreates the arrival of Apollo 11 on the Moon and the super-secret mission that is the real reason for its existence, is by far the best part of the script, for without something well structured and that really adds mystery to the narrative and robot mythology. However, the solidity shown in the initial 20 minutes completely collapses from there. We are re-introduced to Sam Witwicky (the embarrassed Shia LaBeouf being himself) who, despite having graduated from one of the best colleges in the United States, saved the world twice, winning a Barack Obama medal and winning one second jaw-dropping girlfriend, remains the same loser who gets nothing in life. It is inexplicable as is the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>The relationship of the ""Witwicky core"" is horrible and, in no way remembers, the great interactions of the first film and even a little of the second. The impression is that Sam's parents, played by the excellent Kevin Dunn and Julie White are there out of obligation. It may seem an exaggeration to disregard the work of the actors, but the feature itself leads us to believe that their role is merely to take us from one action scene to another. Here we have big names, like Frances McDormand and John Malkovich, lending their talent to characters who add little to the plot individually, but who together with the supporting cast make the precarious script work.<br/><br/>Since being announced as the hero's new girlfriend played by Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has been one of the cast's most questionable additions. The first scene of the British serves to show its purpose in the film. The camera follows Rosie - who is wearing only a T-shirt and panties - in a sequence that reminds us of the lingerie commercial in which the director found the then model. Shortly after, the director follows his camera from head to toe while Patrick Dempsey's character describes a luxury car, making the analogy of the perfection of Whiteley's body with the characteristics of the car. In the few moments when he has to act, his performance is reasonable, although this was clearly not the director's concern. The gorgeous model replaces tall Megan Fox - after a string of disagreements with director Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg - not that it is too difficult.
New robots are also featured in the feature, both on the side of heroes (Autobots) and villains (Decepticons). The new Decepticons have greater relevance in the plot, especially the hateful Laserbeak. Shockwave, one of the best transformers presented so far, unfortunately has little screen time, but leaves its mark when it appears. Sentinel Prime, widely touted in the promotional pieces of the film, has a disappointing role throughout history - its only appeal is to be voiced by Leonard Nimoy (Lord Spock, from Star Trek). We see a new species of metallic sand worm (that of the Duna book series) controlled by Sockwave, one of the most interesting robot designs created by Bay's creative team.<br/><br/>As in the previous film, the humor remains eschatological and bland. Until the story really starts to pass, almost an hour of projection passes, full of ""comical"" scenes without purpose and ridiculous subplots. Examples of this are the Autobots attacking nations in the Middle East, crude jokes, stupid quotes to ""Star Trek II - Khan's Wrath"" and Sam's mother making a joke about the boy's penis size amid an attack by Decepticons .<br/><br/>Michael Bay also ignores something called ""rhythm"", keeping the feature at a perpetual climax, which ends up tiring viewers. Enduring the whole projection becomes a test of endurance, given Bay's inability to show a consistent narrative. The last hour is a gigantic action scene that just doesn't stop until the last thirty seconds of the film, when it just ends. The final battle has the feat of overcoming the battle of Egypt from the previous chapter of the saga. Chicago is devastated and thousands of people have turned to dust, so there should be at least some notion of shock, but such scenes just don't connect with the audience. The city does not survive the attack of 200 decepticons (including a monster robot, combat ships, four-eyed soldiers, General Shockwave and a disfigured Megatron) in the final sequence, which has 40 minutes of explosions, acts of bravery, phrases of impact and many slow cameras. The latter, a kind of technological halter that the filmmaker found to be able to shoot in 3D. Nothing more than the obligation, since the money invested and Bay's poor reputation can justify that. It is one of the best 3D productions so far. But that's it. The solution works very well: you can appreciate the formidable work of computer graphics from Industrial Light and Magic in detail and high definition, with the thousands of moving parts in each of the robots, interacting with the environment and with the humans around them.<br/><br/>It is interesting to see the work of art direction and especially of photography when managing to portray a scenario of total destruction and even post-apocalyptic with shades of gray and specific lenses. Also noteworthy is another precise work by Steve Jablonski in yet another soundtrack that is consistent and that knew how to maintain tension and adrenaline throughout the film. ""Transformers: The Hidden Side of the Moon"" will easily make millions, which is perhaps why Bay still roams the hollywood sets. In the choreography of Bay's private war, real and three-dimensional explosions happen simultaneously, while armies collide in a space impossible to be discerned as real or imaginary, in what gives the impression of being the most expensive film ever made, so great its quality. The destructive spectacle is real and genuinely impressive, but terrible as a cinematic experience, the film has too many characters, many subplots, comic reliefs that do not work a script without emotional involvement. It's a great commercial for the effective uses of 3D, nothing more."

","I spent almost two hours of my life waiting in line to buy a ticket for this darn movie. That was a much better experience than watching this darn movie. ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is the worst American movie I have ever seen since I saw ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" Like murder and adultery, both movies have no right to exist.<br/><br/>For the third straight film, the Autobots and Decepticons are once again on a race for the possession of something. The Autobots must find it before the Decepticons or else. Let me ask you something. Does it really matter what they're after? Would it make much of a difference if I told you they were fighting for a washing machine? Not really, because its only purpose is to provoke these robots to pound each other relentlessly until one of them lose their head. That last sentence might sound like the entire blueprint for ""Dark of the Moon"", but I assure you that there's actually a plot this time. *wink*<br/><br/>Before we get to that, I must first state the obvious fact that Megan Fox's Mikaela has been replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's Carly. Different characters, but both are just about as irrelevant. Now how can I describe Carly's role in one sentence?

","After everything Michael Bay said about how he is embracing 3D, I was really excited to see it in 3D. I had given up on 3D after foolishly seeing Piranha 3D. Thus, I paid the extra $3.50 for the privilege and was enormously disappointed. I had expected to be drawn into all the action and be amazed at the 3D effects...but there weren't any. The movie was strangely flat. What was Michael Bay bragging about???<br/><br/>I have, in the past, seen lots of 3D movies...especially the ones made in the 1950's. The smart directors, like Alfred Hitchcock did in ""Dial M for Murder"", use the process to enhance the movie experience. With a picture like Transformers 3, (since this movie was not a work of art), the need was there to have things pop out of the screen. After all, it is a pure popcorn picture with explosions, action, and chase scenes).<br/><br/>If you want to see this movie (I thought it was too long and too silly) save your money and see it flat."
"devcybiko","1","4","12","1 July 2011"," Best of the three, but still bad.
","ONE LINE REVIEW: Best of the three, but still bad. RATING: Don't waste your time. (Ratings: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the Instant Download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>NO SPOILERS<br/><br/>I actually saw the first Transformers movie a couple days ago on Netflix. It was bearable. I saw the second film two years ago and it was terrible - the fight scenes looked like a tornado hit a scrap yard. Michael Bay appears to have learned from his mistakes and created a somewhat watchable movie this time out.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around young Sam Witwicki (Shia LaBeouf) who is friends with the good robots (Autobots) and his girlfriend Carly (Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who is a stunning blonde (and replaced Mega Fox - see the Internet for details on how she got fired). The movie tries to be about relationships and really falls down on the job (with comic-relief from mom and dad (Kevin Dunn and Julie White)). And it tries to be about heroism. And it tries to be about saving the world. But in the end all it is really about is robot fight scenes.<br/><br/>The subtitle of the film is ""Dark of the Moon"" - but I bet it was supposed to be ""Dark Side of the Moon"" but was changed so as not to affiliate itself with the Pink Floyd album of the same name. It always surprises me when people talk about the dark side of the moon because there is no such thing. The Moon rotates on its axis same as does Earth. It's just that it is locked in a gear-like orbit with us so only one side ever faces us. People think of this as the ""light"" side when in fact it goes through light and dark phases just as the Earth does. More accurately, what people should say is the ""Far Side of the Moon"". But hey, who am I to complain?<br/><br/>Michael Bay has hijacked some of America's greatest and most devastating moments to create a realistic feel to this film. And to his credit, he has succeeded. But I feel violated. He has retold perhaps the greatest achievement of humankind by turning the moon landing into an exploration of the moon for Decepticon (the bad robots) technology. He even enlisted the REAL Buzz Aldrin to play a cameo in which he tells the Autobots (the good robots, remember?) that all of Apollo was a covert mission to harvest robot bootie from the moon. My God! BUZZ ALDRIN! I hope they paid him a boat-load of money. I really do.<br/><br/>And again, later, the Autobots leave Earth in a space shuttle - Discovery - only for it to be blown up before it reaches Earth orbit. For me this was too close to the events of Challenger and Columbia. It certainly looked very much like the real thing.<br/><br/>And in the last quarter of the movie, the Decepticons attack Chicago - with scenes that look amazingly like the bombing of the Twin Towers.<br/><br/>This is just artistic exploitation. I found it foul and manipulative. I don't have much else to say about that.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film was a virtual who's who of cameos and other talent. Leonard Nimoy voiced the sage Sentinal Prime robot (there were several asides to his role as ""Spock"" in the original Star Trek as well). John Turturro as ""Simmons"", the conspiracy theorist. Patrick Dempsey as the human bad guy. Frances McDermand as the government agent. John-FREAKIN- Malkovich (!) as the eccentric guy who had no business in this film but to give Sam a job. Ken Juong who played basically the same character he did in ""The Hangover"". Bill O'Reilly as himself. And Alan Tudyk (""Firefly"", ""Serenity"") as a German uber-cyber-guy.<br/><br/>To his credit, Michael Bay succeeded in knitting all the robot fight scenes together with a plot. A flimsy plot, but it made some sort of sense if you didn't dwell on it. The movie had a fair amount of swearing in it and people being reduced to ash, so I was surprised it didn't merit a ""R"" rating rather than ""PG-13"".<br/><br/>I saw this movie in 3D. It was cool. But if you do see a movie in 3D, try to sit near the center of the theater. While all movie screens have a ""sweet spot"" where the light is focused (and it is around the middle of the theater), 3D movies have this in spades. I sat on the left-most aisle of the theater and had a lot of parallax problems. Things on the far right were split as though I had crossed my eyes. So, please, sit near the middle/center of the theater if you pay an extra $4 for 3D. You'll thank me.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf has said this is his last Transformers movie (actually, I read it was his last action/adventure role). Here's hoping that it's the last Transformers movie - period."

","There is no redemption for this movie. It is by far the worse in the series. LaBeouf gives a solid performance and that is about all the movie has to offer. Huntington-Whiteley is beyond plain... a cup of coffee is more expressive than she is. All others are very, very forgettable. This is bad movie because even though there are great special effects, the story sucks big time... too many loose ends, too many undeveloped characters, too many inconsistencies. This is an action movie, and as such we do not expect great psychological complexity; HOWEVER, movie goers are not THAT stupid (learn from e.g. X-men First Class). It feels like the marketing team put too many demands on the story (appeal to this group... and this other... and this other...), and the plot dissolved in thin air. Now all good guys (I mean machines) have thick very identifiable thick accents. I could not tell you how did it all end, because I left by one hour and 50 minutes into the movie. Give my my $10 back! The worst is that time is the most valuable asset a person possesses, for once gone it never can be recovered... I wasted nearly two hours of my life."
"Gordon-11","Null","4","12","29 June 2011"," An amazing, awesome blockbuster
","This film is about the secrets hidden in a severely damaged spacecraft on the dark side of the moon, and the subsequent chaos when Decepticons and Autobots fight for the Earth.<br/><br/>""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" may be 2.5 hours long, but certainly feels a lot shorter. There is so much material to cover, that the story starts already at the first minute, wasting no time beating about the bush. The first two ""Transformers"" had brainless plots, but this one has a great plot that engages and thrills throughout. Even though the ending is obligatorily predictable, I still find myself completely glued to the screen, waiting for events to unfold, and more importantly hoping things will turn out alright for the Earth. It's so engaging that I didn't even want to blink, for fear I might miss anything.<br/><br/>The special effects are simply breathtaking and jaw dropping. The uninhibited rampage on the city is so awesome. And the 3D is very spectacular, it looks as if I was watching the events in the film live, as if I was there to experience it. Even a trail of dust look so 3D. A friend of mine once said ""Why watch a film in 3D when you can watch everything else in 3D. Well, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" shows that watching a 3D film offers more than what the eyes normally see in real life."

","I really like the first Transformers movie. It was fun and entertaining. Revenge Of The Fallen was a terrible movie riddled with problems. So when I saw that this film grossed $1,123,746,996 when it was in theaters, Than it has to be good right? WRONG! This is one of the most frustrating movies I have ever sat through. This film has more problems than Revege Of The Fallen. Here are the Top 10 Reasons why I hated Transformers Dark Of The Moon.<br/><br/>#10: A Horrible Experience At An Unbearable Length. Not only is this film terrible but why do I have to sit through it for 2hrs and 35min?!!? Its bad enough just having to sit through the second one with Skids and Mudflap.<br/><br/>#9: Story, What Story? The films story is so confusing, especially If you have not seen the first two. This movie jumps around so much that by the time it was over I felt like I had just gotten off of a trampoline with 20 other people. The plot that I understood is that the Decepticons are going after a Cybertronian space craft.<br/><br/>#8: My Parents Are Not This Bad. The parents in this film are annoying and useless. All they seem to do in every movie is bring up something Sexual and uncomfortable. They bing absolutely nothing to the movie and are just pointless filler. Speaking of which.<br/><br/>#7: What Are We Going To Put In It? Half of this movie is just pointless filler. Whether it's Shia LaBeouf whining and crying about not having a job, Him trying to get a job or pointless humor it is not needed. Even the last hour of the film with the Chicago fight is so tedious to watch.<br/><br/>#6: We Won't Use Them For Anything Important. Some of the cast in this film is wasted. People Like Peter Cullen, Leonard Nimoy, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk, Francis McDormand and Tyrese Gibson are all in this movie and are wasted because they serve no purpose. The only two who serve a purpose are Peter Culllen who voices Optimus Prime and Leonard Nimoy who voices Starscream.<br/><br/>#5: We'll Call Him Deep Wang, Because It's Funny Right? There is a character in this film named Deep Wang played by Ken Jeoung. All he does in this movie for the 7 minutes of screen time he has is talk ghetto. An that's Funny right. Wrong because he serves no purpose to the story whatsoever. You can also check out Ken Jeoung in the soon to be destined classic, Big Mommas Like Father Like Son.<br/><br/>#4. What Is Misogyny? This film thinks that Women are just in these movies to be Sex symbol's. I hate to be a broken record but Rosi Hunnigton-Whiteley Serves no purpose. They just show her in her underwear and is completely forgettable. Showing her in her underwear is not needed in a Transformers movie. (Although it was nice) It still was not needed. Also the female characters serve no purpose they are just there to show themselves off and thats It. Oh by the way for those who do not know what Mysogyny is, it means a hateful or stereotypical view of women.<br/><br/>#3: Ehren Kruger Writes Better Than You (NOT). Literally 90% of these robots I could not recognize because they don't say who they are. Idid not know until this movie is over and that is an example of how well the writer, Ehren Kruger who wrote a good movie Arlington Road, Introduces these characters for people like me who do not have an encyclopedic knowledge of Transformers.<br/><br/>#2: You Know, For Kids! This movie is so Vulgar, Rauncy and Violent that I cannot believe that some parents took little 6 year old Timmy to see this movie. This movie is riddled with Sexual Content and Innuendo plus Too much senseless murdering by the robots in this film.<br/><br/>#1: Shia LaBeouf. I Really hate this actor. All he does in this movie is whine and cry about how he does not have a job and how he saved the world twice when it was all the robots doing the saving and boo hoo this and boo hoo that. I hated him in Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, Wall Street Money Never Sleeps and Transformers 2 and 3, Because that is all he does. Quite frankly I hope I don't have to sit through another movie with him again. I wanted to shut this movie off because of Him. If you Like Him, fine but me personally I just can't stand him.<br/><br/>Well there you have it. The Top 10 Reasons why I hated Transformers Dark Of The Moon. Runner up is invoking images of 9/11 and The Challenger Explosion and the fact that I know What The Challenger Explosion is at age 14 is impressive. The only Character That I was invested in was Optimus Prime. Even though he is awesome That really should not happen.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 For Intense Prolonged Sequences Of Sci-Fi Action Violence, Mayhem And Destuction, And For Language, Some Sexuality And Innuendo.<br/><br/>2hrs 35min/155min.<br/><br/>2 uses of the F-word.<br/><br/>1/2*/****"

Thank god it wasn't, but I know its coming. I could understand part two. Every one went to see the first one. So naturally there had to be a two. But when every one saw how bad part two was why did they go see three? There had to be better films in theaters to see than this.

"angie_l","2","3","8","19 February 2012"," Please stop making these movies!
","The first movie was cute and entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised that Bay could take a beloved toy and cartoon from the '80's and make it into a good action flick. Beyond the first movie, there really isn't that much of a story to tell and so they should have stopped. Transfomers also lack a wider culture to draw from so each movie feels the same- I'll compare it to Indiana Jones which usually has the same hero and villains, Nazis, but Indiana has the benefit of a plethora of interesting civilizations to write stories around. So please stop Hollywood, stop making these movies. They are merely a product for consumption and merchandising.<br/><br/>This movie was way too long with unending action scenes. Am I the only who gets annoyed by Shia's fumbling? I felt the movie also went into an inappropriate realm the others didn't. There was a scene where a man is killed and it is made to look like a suicide. It is depicted comically as he falls by the window and there are even jokes afterwards about him being splatted on the pavement. This is just one example. I don't mind dark humor, actually I love dark humor, but this just seemed out of place with the tone and audience of the movie. I thought these movies were at least in part for kids?<br/><br/>Lastly, since I completely zoned out in the middle of the movie and was just hoping it was going to end soon, something dangerous started happening - I got to thinking. Autobots are supposed to be gender neutral but are all voiced by men? Why? It is not as if they have synthetic voices. There does seem to be an affect on some of the voices to add a deeper growl but why can't that be applied to a female voice? The autobots could have the same personalities and be voiced by a woman. I would guess most people view the transformers as all male. I looked into matter and read how at one time female autobots were added but were somewhat anatomically correct and were stereotypically more feminine. Sigh... However, I'll take no female voiced autobots over giving ""female"" autobots breasts and gender specific roles which is far more tragic! These movies are decidedly male and I do not mean that because they have explosions.<br/><br/>I gave it 2 stars because someone works very hard on the CGI."

Boy was I disappointed. Half of the movie didn't make any sense. Most of the time the humans were running around in circles as though they had an impact on the final outcome. They had 1% impact at most, although 90% of the camera time was spent on them.<br/><br/>The explanations as to why they ran from one place to another were mediocre at best. To paraphrase: ""We have to get to that building to stop something."" Why are you going to that building? No reason.<br/><br/>Pros: The girl was hot. What can I say, I'm a typical man. It would be 2/10 if she wasn't hot. Also the graphics are good as usual.

Don't pay much attention to those who say it's better - it's just as bad but in a different way. The 2nd was way too packed with action and mindless scenes where we were supposed to care. The 3rd has much less action, which should not be a bad thing. However, the lack of action is replaced by meaningless characters doing, well, pretty much nothing of any consequence.<br/><br/>I'd just like films like these to have characters with some level of dignity. Why is John Malkovich such an ass? He's like crawling on the floor ranting something incomprehensibly stupid when seeing the Autobots. John: Walk in the room, have a look and have some dignity and grandeur about yourself.<br/><br/>A very very poor film indeed. With this budget, what could you have made... oh my.

As stated by others, our hapless semi-hero, Sam is dating a collagen infused model who works for a billionaire who gives her a multi-hundred-thousand-dollar car?! The Decepticons somehow keep getting these ridiculously powerful additions, while the Autobots get weak comic relief. Shia is still Shia--who is annoying and frustrating. All of the old characters return and Bumblebee is still the fave--funny because he doesn't talk.<br/><br/>The story could have been interesting, if they would have focused on it instead of slow motion explosions and long, boring scenes that include being slung through a building by a robotic snake for what seemed like an eternity. Worst of all was the repeated placement of Sam's parents throughout the movie. I mean, in the midst of the looming danger, Sam talks to his parents about relationship issues! I fast forwarded through it and lost nothing.<br/><br/>Other dumb things: Sam does parkour through Chicago. The decisions of the US officials were idiotic and only served to drag out the film.

There isn't one likable character (though John Malkovich and Ken Jeong are pretty funny in their brief appearances). Many characters are introduced late in movie, and then only because more bodies are needed to populate the screen. I'm not really certain who the intended audience is here. Hasbro produced the movie, ostensibly to keep the toys selling. Yet, the movie is clearly not for kids. Autobot violence is one thing, but there are scenes with guns that go too far. The language is also too strong for kids, with several s--t and even a couple f-bombs dropped in for bad measure. It is also much too silly to be taken seriously by adults. Despite a couple tearful attempts, there is no heart or soul to it. The direction is very inept and Bay seems to still be getting the hang of melding live-action with CG action.

The target audience were kids, so the marketers came with a list of what kids used to adore : comics, reptiles, kung-fu films and pizza! For the exact same reason, Mickael Bay and Paramount marketing dept are coming back with robots, race cars, heavy weaponry ... and centerfold girls! And that is why Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is an adulescent, a teenager who depends on his girlfriend and his parents for a living. Anyway...<br/><br/>The introduction of the film (linking the Apollo program with fictional events) is appealing, but the rest of the script makes absolutely no sense. The motivations of Sentinel Prime are absurd, and nothing is really logical in this movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography is awful. The action scenes have no rhythm, and Bay constantly relies on camera shaking and slow-motion. The SFX are awful, robot 3D models are difficult to visualize.<br/><br/>Acting is terrible. Of course, LaBeouf does not how to play, but I would expect something better from Malkovitch and 'Torturo'! This is really a film you should avoid."

","I watched this over the weekend and I have to say, about 20-30 minutes of it was kind of cool. I wish I could say something kind about the rest of it... This chapter manages to throw a bunch of wacky, useless human characters in this time in addition to the normal cast of blahish human characters (the crazy boss, or the insane Asian coworker, or even the can do everything assistant with gimmicky accent (and only likable because of the actor, none other than the pilot from Firefly), who happens to be more useful than his boss - the returning character by John Turturo, why is this character still in these movies?) Even the Sam Witwicky main character seems to have had his wackiness quotient upped in this chapter. Oh, and the new 'human villain', played by Patrick Dempsey... what a dreadful character made likable only in the slightest sense because of the charmingness of the actor, but otherwise, what a terribly drawn character in the movie only to have our 'hero' have something to fight against. The characters are pretty one dimensional, except for maybe Sentinel Prime, but only because they kind of forced character development on this character for the plot's sake (which is an awful way to develop a character).<br/><br/>It's too bad Megatron, who still doesn't sound right, is relegated to a secondary villain in this. The Decepticons all look kind of similar, again, except for Shockwave, though it's not like they do much with his character, and the Autobots fare better... but they seem to disappear during a huge stretch in the final part of the movie for no good reason other than so we can spend more time following the actions of human characters I could care less about.<br/><br/>What little bits of story about the actual transformers is kind of cool, but much of it is underdeveloped. Too much of the movie insists on following the Sam Witwicky character and his employment. The near post apocalyptic feel of the last stretch of the movie is kind of cool, if only the transformers weren't kept in the shadows (instead of us seeing them planning their strategy and see how that plays out, we see nothing but them popping up near the end to declare they will kill every last deceptacon and a little bit of battle between them to go along with that).<br/><br/>Ridiculous battle moments include the Sam Witwicky character shooting some stupid little grappling claw weapon to once again send the actor flying around (do we not remember how bad it came off seeing that same actor jumping around on vines like Tarzan in the last Indiana Jones movie.)? Come on! If you liked the first movie, you'll probably like this. Yet again, too much time on human characters trying to be funny and/or wacky through much of the running time instead of being about the actual Transformers (you'd think they might actually develop the characters' who the movie is named after). *sigh* Thank god this is Michael Bay's last Transformers movies. Maybe one day, I'll be able to see a Transformers movie (a reboot in a few years, maybe), that is actually ABOUT the Transformers. Give us a story where they are the focus, where they are multifaceted characters. Make us feel their struggle. Don't make a movie about a bunch of human characters with Transformers thrown in just 'cause as generic robots. I'd much rather have the movie streamlined and just be cool big f'in robots fighting each other in a war. Not my ideal Transformers movie, but I could at least have enjoyed that more, for more of the running time, if nothing else, but for its cool visceral, robot f/x and action sequences."

I mean this is proof that Bay has paid people to put up fake reviews for his movie, or maybe Bay himself is pressing the IMDb high ratings button HAHA hey you never know! Anyways, Bay, also known as Michael 'oh-look-at-meee' Bay - needs a lot of supervision when making movies. He can shoot a car chase and military paraphernalia, but other than that, nothing else. I was traumatised as a kid way back in 1986 when I watched Optimus and his old skool Autobot buddies get killed in The Movie; sadly to say I am once again traumatised watching this Bayhem of a Transformers franchise. I am slowly recovering knowing the Bayhem trilogy has ended. This Bayhem franchise reminds me of when Batman was with Clooney and Kilmer; so hopefully the next reboot will be how Nolan did to the Batman franchise. Transformers Begins perhaps. Dark Robot?

Let me summarize the plot: boom bang - bang boom - boom boom - bang bang - boom bang.<br/><br/>With such an amazing material even the good cast (Malkovitch, McDormand) can only go so far. As for non-actor Labeouf he still mixes up shouting and acting. Give him a beautiful and surprisingly decent Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and he can't for a second make us believe in a love story. Patrick Dempsey plays his character the same way he plays any character - charming but without any depth or believability - but I'm sure it won't bother his female fans.<br/><br/>Even the special effects are boring and the sound effects are totally annoying - and nothing is new or original it was already seen and heard in the previous 2 movies.<br/><br/>While I don't see anything wrong with cashing easy money for the old days and while I understand that this movie was aimed at young boys happy enough to see their favorite toys on screen, they still deserved better.

Shia LaBeouf entered in a high irritating mode, Josh Duhamel was there... well, he was there, with no exceptions, John Turturro was there, again for a comic relief, John is a great actor, but he did this for the money. Tyrese Gibson... again... he was there with a dry humor as most of his military crew. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley... a replacement for Megan Fox. I didn't actually care for Mikaela, but without her, a half of audience losses an impression from the previous films, so Bay had to pull out another talentless beauty, by the looks of things...

Where'd all the action go?<br/><br/>The first half of the movie actually is decent storytelling. We get some historic background, some nice big shots of space and the crashed moon-ship, and some character development. It almost made me care about the world-wide destruction, but not quite. Once you get past the major plot points, it's really no different than any other of the movies – far too many characters, not enough creativity in the fight scenes (see: You have no idea who is a good robot and who is naughty), and too much Shia by that point.<br/><br/>Word on the street be that this is the BEST EVARRR! of the Transformers movies. While it certainly felt like there was more of everything, it doesn't vary from any of the original plots or action sequences.

","At the beginning of the movie, Optimus says that Autobots protect humans from harming each other. Then they show Autobots attacking an Iranian nuclear facility(the Iranian flag is prominently exhibited). It's really too political!!! If the Autobots were really protecting humans from each other, then they should have disarmed the U.S & Russia first. Rosie Huntington-Whitele's(the new babe) performance is the worst acting I have seen in my life. Maybe she should stick to what she does best i.e modelling. Transformers 2 is the best movie of the trilogy & this one is the worst. Even in 3D, it was not that great. It is really not worth seeing this movie at the movie theatre. I was really disappointed. Better watch this at home on DVD or bluray."

","The summary I've written is actually paraphrased from Mark Kermode's film review which listened to the other week, and I must say I think it should also be the title of Michael Bay's autobiography whenever it gets written. I really think Michael Bay is good at one thing and all the elements of that one thing - spectacle; from special effects, to spectacular stunts, and set pieces that virtually melt your brain there is no doubting this word when watching the film. In that sense if you were able to combine his talents with another director who knows how to work with actors, and who knows something about plot and story then this person would be a true great. As it is we get one third, not even enough. The other vital two thirds which come together to form this Michael Bay experience are invented upon in a rush and as wildly like as a kid forced into doing his homework - for instance, present the issue of getting high quality acting into this film and the solution presented is John Malkovich. Anything more Michael? No, we just need an actor and Malkovich is that man in this movie - Malkovich will do the acting now lets get back to the explosions! As for the storyline - simply don't worry about it, because if you do you will end up bald from pulling your hair out. As a spectacle this film has something to offer - it is just a shame that scratching the surface only reveals more surface."
"alaskan_scout","5","3","8","23 July 2011"," *MY TAKE* on TF:Dark of the Moon
","After watching ""Dark of The Moon"" yesterday, I felt compelled to write a meaty review for the first time since registering myself with IMDb back in 2006. I've had a few reviews scattered about, all which have met the 10 lines that were required, however this will have more substance  and rightly so ..<br/><br/>Where can I start?<br/><br/>The GOOD:  The action and special effects are incredible. Top drawer and hats off to the FX department for bringing the transformers and scenery destruction to life!  Rose Huntingdon-Whitely is very hot .. her lips make me drool .. yummy. Would definitely ""hang out the back of that any day of the week"". ©Richard Keys  I'll mention the special effects again to beef up the positives!  Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime and Leonard Nimoy as Sentinal Prime are exceptional as the voices of the Primes  Shia Lebouf brings out his acting talents, and although wacky in some places and somewhat Over The Top in others, does bring out his emotions well.  Nice use of modern day vehicles  Strugglingto find more positives to be honest <br/><br/>THE BAD:  The movie is full of plot holes and unanswered questions thought out the movie. Not to mention the lack of a relationship between the other movies. Transformers disappear (Arcee, Barricade, skids and mudflap etc), new Transformers appear (Que, Brains, Shockwave, Laserbeak, Wreckers) and there is no explanation as to where they come from or where they went?  Why oh why does Bay have the same old tired tested clichés in his movies. Bad acting, explosions, lack of story, sexy female lead showing plenty of ass and cleavage but very little acting skills and more!  RIDICULOUS events take place .. Starscream and his downfall by first, a grappling hook to the eye? Shockwave taken out by a bunch of humans after .. wait for it, having his vision blocked by a parachute dropping from the sky! Shockwave being one of the biggest, strongest and deadliest decepticons in the series? Its the same as the first film where a bunch of humans can take Blackout .. OUT .. it just would never happen in the TF universe!  Megatron listening to a female and not killing her instead? Maybe if he'd have killed her AFTER she'd have given her speech then that would have brought back a little bit of reality .. but why would a Decepticon, who has so much disdain and little regard for humans, during the series, let the fit bird live? It just doesn't make sense?  In fact Megatron and Shockwave are absolute aberrations as Transformers in dark of the moon .. utter waste of time, metal and oil  What was the point of the cube and the pyramid contraption in the other films if the main point of the trilogy was about a space bridge?! WHY? WTF!?!?! POINT?!!!  And speaking of oil .. why do the robots now leak RED OIL? As to make out they are bleeding??!! They look much better oozing black oil, black fluids, thick heavy black fluid, not diluted watered down red diesel ribena crap?! ffs, Bay what were you thinking?!  What is the point of Sam's parents? Pointless – comedy value but they aren't even funny. The mother is particularly annoying and I ask you now, who has a mother that acts like that?  Patrick Dempsey – criminally underused - turns out to be a pointless character in the end and the same goes for ..  John Malkovich – WTF  Alan Tudyk (Pirate Steve from Dodgeball lol) again, has a minor role but could have been given much more material. In the bar when he disarms the female holding the shotgun, he mentions about his past. That is something I was interested to know about!  Frances McDormand – whether she thought this was a role she can ham up a little bit, I dunno , but it wasn't great watching her strut about as a spoilt older child sort of person  Product Placement – Ridonkulous!  I didn't know that Transformers made themselves .. FAT .. what was the Scottish one all about? And where did the wreckers come from?! Jeez, sort out some background for them please!  The story about the space transporting bridge (similar to the animated series) is bizarre .. <br/><br/>Dark of the Moon was very much a movie about the Autobots this time round .. the Decepticons take a backseat to the humans (yet again) and the heroic Autobots I'll have to stop writing this review as the more I think about the film, the more I become p*ssed off at Michael Bay for butchering the franchise and churning out some commercialised product that tries appealing to all but in the end confuses a lot of us and ultimately spoils the Transformer name as a movie product. I can't even contemplate what to think with regards Dempseys character arranging the budget to stop the USA from scouting the moon again, from the increasing number of plot holes that I keep discovering the more I think things over, the fact that some roles in the film are utterly pointless and are only in the film to remind us that yes, Sam does have parents, yes he did date Megan Fox, who has done a runner and gone into hiding, etc .. etc .. ETC .. ETC!!!!!Sure the action is amazing in this film, but like a lot of Bays films (action, romance, more action, more romance ZZZzzzzz) the same old tired formula springs up and thus we are left scratching our heads with a bag ful of unanswered questions and a giant tinge of disappointment.<br/><br/>Dark of the Moon 5/10<br/><br/>Transformers under Michael Bay – 3 or 4/10"
"kgny309","Null","3","8","24 July 2011"," This film transforms into a snooze fest.
","In 2007, Michael Bay hit one out of the ballpark with ""Transformers"". But 2 years later,he got a strikeout with the second film in the series, ""Revenge of the Fallen"". Now he's back on bat with the third film, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". This time, He gets a another strikeout.<br/><br/>This third film which looks like a 2 and a half hour toy commercial plug, deals with the battle for America between the Autobots and the Decepticons.<br/><br/>Shia Labeouf is still good as before as Sam Witwicky. Taking over for Megan Fox is model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whiteley may have half of Fox's looks but none of the charm. The rest of the supporting cast including Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro, Frances Mcdormand and John Malkovich are mostly underused. But the only shining supporting star is Ken Jeong {""The Hangover"" and TV's ""Community""}. Jeong is very funny as Sam's co-worker, but his role lasts a few minutes.<br/><br/>Bay's direction is, as Roger Ebert would put it ""eye candy for the blind"". Ehren Kruger's script is too banal and drags the movie on too long. The visual effects are at times both impressive and corny. Armi Morki's cinematography make us feels like we are watching a music video.<br/><br/>Transformers fans will be wowed by it. But for the rest of us, we see it as a endurance contest. Just in case non-fans, bring in pillows.<br/><br/>FYI: The film is in both 2-D and 3-D versions. I saw it in 2-D. My advice: Skip both versions, go see Harry Potter instead.<br/><br/>My Pick:Red Light{Skip It}"

The auto bots become ridiculously out numbered and out gunned but still manage to prevail over the evil decepticons. Its a tried and tested story which seems to be winning over fans.<br/><br/>Megan Fox's absence is felt which i was surprised about. Her replacement was flat dull and boring and brought nothing to the film. <br/><br/>Malkovich was a welcome breath of fresh air! The acting was pretty good through out and though repeated the story keeps your interest till the end. <br/><br/>The usual big metal robots smacking each other about and the good guys risking everything to save earth makes for a fairly good watch and a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.

"leplatypus","4","3","8","15 July 2011"," Too much for the eyes, too less for the brain (screen)
","Those are the two great defects of this movie and they don't leave anything else to praise: <br/><br/>For my eyes, i maintain my objection from the previous two movies, that is to say the robots aren't not well designed because they are too much designed. Next, the filming doesn't match up because the abuse of close-up, cuts make the action unintelligible. There are precedents with big characters and Spielberg (""Jurassic Park"") or Jackson (""King Kong"") have more talent than Bay for the big size! <br/><br/>For my brain, after now two sequels, i still can't name the robots except the truck, the yellow car and the bad leader. How can the writers skip those basics? Here, like the two previous movie, it's about getting a lost artifact that would end the war forever. That's recycling. To be more precise, it would be hard because as usual, i lost the trail of the story. Worst, if the previous movies could be balanced between action and comedy, here the story of Shia is terminated in half hour.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie (attack in Chicago) is better handled than the terrible gunfight of the last movie in Pyramids but it feels bitter: The scene of the building collapse is really riveting but as everyone kills everyone it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys."
"michael_svenne","5","3","8","14 July 2011"," He did it again!
","The first transformer movie lived up to my expectations, it was entertaining. Which I could not say that the second movie did at all, since it basically defined the word bad taste in humor. Although there was things I did and did not like in the first movie I could accept them, since the other parts of the movie were brilliant and ""new"". The second movie couldn't really do anything ""new"" and just made everything that I like and was brilliant into crap, pardon my language.<br/><br/>Now to the third Transformer movie, which I went to see, against better judgment, (after the second movie which was probably the worst let down in my life, you'd think you would be smart enough to not see its sequel). I only saw it because my friends had told me that he had more of what he wanted into the movie and had listened less to his advisor's about what the general population wanted. The third movie starts out pretty much as the second movie and you realize that it is pretty much the same crap as the second movie, just longer more illogical and boring. There are several scenes where Witwicky should have been killed, maimed, crushed, impaled, shot, but he simply isn't. I think they forgot to tell me that that he also is a auto-bot because otherwise it makes no sense to how he can be impervious to harm. There are many more things I could point out in the movie but it would only bore you. If you enjoyed the second movie go and see this one too! If you didn't like the second movie don't see this one either because its just as bad and you will feel that you didn't get your moneys worth!"
"diehard-305","Null","3","8","12 July 2011"," I found this film to be extremely boring
","Despite the continuous action, destruction and battles, I found this film to be extremely boring, and the final battle, which claimed the last hour of the film was far too long and drawn out and it greatly prevented me from appreciating the visual spectacle that is the final battle as it's so long it becomes tedious and I couldn't wait for it to end. <br/><br/>The extensive use of cgi action scenes was what ruined the film for me, and although I never fully agree with the typical view that modern films have too much cgi and effects and not enough good story, this film certainly presented a convincing case that the above statement is true. As there is so much shooting, exploding and fighting in this film there is relatively little time for dialogue, which was largely, poorly written, and full of clichés. <br/><br/>Finally, I didn't rate the casting of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or her performance. She has clearly been chosen for the role for her good looks and her great sex appeal although I think she shines brighter as an underwear model than blockbuster film actress. Also, It seems unbelievable to me that Shia LaBeouf's character, although not a bad looking guy, has been in relationships with 2 characters played by women who have both topped the annual FHM 100 sexiest women in the world poll. Rosie has clearly been cast to attract more male viewers, bring sex appeal that the film didn't really need and throughout struck me as being far out of Shia's league."

","I loved the first Transformers and while not it had its cringe-worthy moments I felt it was respectful to the original cartoon I grew up with and had amazing effects and a decent story. I hated Revenge of the Fallen for a lot of reasons which I don't think I need to go into. Dark of the Moon is NOT a good movie. Gradually these films turned away from the source material and morphed into some guy's vision. Some guy who never even watched the original cartoon. Megatron went from ultimate badass ""harbinger of death"" in part 1 to weakling in parts 2 and 3. Starscream was never that sniveling. Twirling his hands and hunching over like Igor. Laserbeak talks? Soundwave takes orders from a human? And who are all these lame madeup Autobots and Decepticons? The Wreckers? Dino? Are you serious with that? That green head robot licking Abe Lincoln's head? The worm thing? Where are all the Transformers we grew up with and loved? Dino.....unbelievable. The comedy was WAY too much and just stupid. The annoying twins are replaced with equally annoying tiny robots. I never really had a problem with the robot designs but in ROTF and DOTM they tried to make them look more human with hair, beards, glasses, ears, and lame garbage that makes them look stupid (see Wheeljack). The story was incomprehensible. Sentinel Prime was going to Earth to meet Megatron with traitor Autobots to steal natural resources then got blasted and crashed on the moon? So Cybertron is destroyed now? The only reason I went to see this dumb movies and waste my money was because the blogs and a lot of people (not critics)were saying it was the best of the three films. Bulls***! Avoid this movie if you thought ROTF was awful. I am done with this franchise and I hope they don't make any more. I guess they can't since all the Decepticons are dead now. Yay!"

She wasn't anything special. I wish they'd kept Megan Fox. And the Einstein and Scottish Autobots were just lame and pathetic and pretty painful to watch.<br/><br/>The special effects and fight scenes however, were very good but needed much more of it to keep me interested.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the only good things about Dark Of The Moon were the action scenes and the end credits.<br/><br/>Once again, director Michael Bay and the writers have embarrassed themselves by making a joke of a much loved childhood TV show as these films focused more on teenage romance, which just happened to have Transformers in them.<br/><br/>Its obvious that everyone involved had no idea what Transformers was before making these films as the story and characters stray far away from the original cartoon's classic story.<br/><br/>I thought Revenge Of The Fallen was probably the best of the 3, but they will never beat Transformers: The Movie from 1986.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie 5/10"
"skbubbly","4","3","8","10 July 2011"," A disappointment
","This was one of my most anticipated flicks of the summer. And at the end of the movie, I couldn't come to terms that the wait was worth nothing. It left me, a fan of the franchise and of Michael Bay, deeply disappointed. So much that I feel its necessary to review this.<br/><br/>Right from the start, the movie lacked coherence. Sure a plot was visible, but it was never seriously pursued. It was interfered very often by the humor that was no longer funny but became irritable. An excuse that every scene was significant wasn't good enough. The bots lost their characters. The cast seeming to get together from their earlier espionage wasn't planned well. overall, it didn't quite seem like a sequel.<br/><br/>The audience were lost in the screenplay. First half had its moments now and then. But the second was a total disaster. The climax seemed to drag on forever. There was very little plot and an endless amount of Roland Emmerich there. The slow motion scenes never made sense anymore and were totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>Sure the visuals were a treat but could never quite gel in with the script and the screenplay and thus lost appreciation. I tried to feel the emotions that the movie tried to radiate, but the mindless screenplay blocked out everything.<br/><br/>I give it a 4 for the visuals and visuals alone."
"LauBryan","3","3","8","10 July 2011"," Teenagers may like it
","One the poorest acting movies I have seen this year. It is too noisy, an obsolete ploy and hardly convincing in any of the actions. The director has no commitment into making a movie. Though teenagers may like it because the plot is good for their ""education"" in Computing graphics. Rosie Huntington looks like an ancient tree. Shia LeBeouf shines only in making the plot less credible. The rest of the cast can be replaced simply by CG too if the movie production house wants it. It is a shame for a good comics to be produced in such a poor way. Think this way, you want to see a good comics turned movie, take a look at spiderman, X-Men: First class."
"rawdeal007","4","3","8","9 July 2011"," Disappointment. *no spoilers*
","I loved and still love the first movie. It contained some of the most outstanding and 'cool' original action scenes I had seen in a movie since the Matrix. It wasn't perfect, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is firmly part of my blu-ray collection.<br/><br/>The second installment was a mess and should have hinted at what the third would bring, but hope of a return to the near perfect pacing of the original was anticipated.<br/><br/>So in a short and sweet manner, with no spoilers. Here's my account of TF3:<br/><br/>Story - it was there, but nothing is explained well. Pacing is horribly off and I could have watched in silence and still have known what I know watching with sound. Too many loop holes and pointless 'essential' characters.<br/><br/>Characters - Humans in this movie are pointless and pretty much ruin it in my opinion. Bot's wise - not enough development for non TF fans to care a note about who and why they are. New love interest, while being hot, is just plain annoying and unneeded. And What the hell are the parents doing?<br/><br/>Special effects - Boring, over long action scenes (that don't contain bot fight as I enjoy them). Regardless of the quality of the work done, it doesn't change the fact that watching half of the stuff happen on screen is just plain ball-crap.<br/><br/>One thing to note; I don't agree with a lot of people when they say they can't tell who's fighting who as I've always been able to distinguish grey from a colour of an Autobot - really has never been an issue for me.<br/><br/>Overall it was over long, boring, unfunny, confusingly paced, full of unneeded scenes, full of unneeded characters, unwatchable for a second time.<br/><br/>4/10"
"neftaliw","5","3","8","8 July 2011"," Michael Bay is the worst thing that ever happened to science fiction
","There, I said it. I haven't seen any adaptation made by Michael Bay that I liked. From X-Men, and Superman to now Transformers. In fact, he doesn't make adaptations, he only steals the name of the characters and makes something of his own and Transformers is no exception.<br/><br/>Even though the movie has amazing effects, the story runs extremely fast at first, and then super slow towards the end, you are presented with characters that you are supposed to know but they never explain to you how or why. From a Transformers fan I would say ""hideous"", as an common cinephile, ""confusing"". The comedy is very cheap, many sex jokes there, and the screaming, gosh!!!, two hours of screaming.<br/><br/>The worst thing of this movie is that Michael Bay transformed Optimus Prime, a wise and brave warrior that preferred non-violent actions, into a cold hearted murderer.<br/><br/>To sum it all, this movie is everything but Transformers."
"LloydBayer","5","3","8","8 July 2011"," Looks don't mean a damn thing
","At the time of writing this review, I am under the impression that the North American continent is still reeling from the aftershocks of a Global financial recession. But if the producers have $195 million Dollars to burn, literally, then at a time like this, it is evident that people with money are not prudent enough to avert another financial melt down. Sure, this movie will surpass its budget from just the opening box-office revenue. My big question is whether this Film has enough acclaim to propel the franchise forward? With due respect to the producers, director, actors, and fans of the series, I seriously doubt there will be a fourth compartment to this franchise. If ever there is one, it would be as lucrative as whipping a dead horse. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Michael Bay is a fine director with some excellent films in repute. Although Bay has produced (some with Jerry Bruckheimer) over 20 mega titles, as a director, he will always be remembered for ""Bad Boys"", ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"". Even so, Bay has never been considered for an Academy Award nomination. On the contrary, he has earned Razzie Awards for Worst Director for ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"". Although personally, I enjoyed both those movies. But if I were to guess, as a kid he must have been obsessed with firecrackers. This third outing has the Michael Bay signature scribbled all over it. Explosions, special effects, explosions, CGI, the other side of the moon, an underwear model that replaces another model who refused to show off her underwear, and some more explosions. Yes, the script tries to be better than the second installment titled ""Revenge of the Fallen"", and tries really hard to give depth to the characters. The tactic used this time is developing deeper emotions in the human characters while rendering a darker plot. There are some other bits and pieces which I will get to later, but that's about it. Did I mention there are explosions in this film? <br/><br/>If you have missed the first two titles, no big deal. There is no plot continuation whatsoever so there is no need to watch the previous two titles. Actually, I would recommend not watching the second installment. The first and biggest plot hole sees Sam Witwicky as a college graduate, but without a job. Apparently, after helping the Autobots save the world twice, and receiving the congressional Medal of Honor from President Barak Obama, Sam is still not worthy of a job. Go figure. Meanwhile, the Autobots continue to work with the US government in tracking down Decepticon stragglers until an alien fuel cell is found at an abandoned radioactive site in Chernobyl. On investigation, the fuel cell emerges as a classified object retrieved during the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969. Arriving on the Moon in search of the Fuel Cell's source, Optimus Prime finds a downed spacecraft that was also classified by the US government. Inside, lies a dying former leader of the Auotbots, Sentinel Prime, and beside him, five strange pillars. What follows is over two hours of special effects that will engage your optic and acoustic nerves to the max. Then again, what more can you expect when the main producer is Steven Spielberg himself.<br/><br/>You have action, you have fast paced action and you have mindless action. Guess which category this film falls into? At times, even the last category goes over the top. As I mentioned before, the film attempts at showing its never-before-seen sensitive side. But seriously, who are you kidding? This film and its predecessors were always meant to be a testosterone fuelled adventure. The acting is horrible and in now way conveys what the half-baked script tries too. I was under the impression that Shia LaBeouf is an up and coming actor. Sadly, this has to be his worst movie as an actor or his best movie as a bad actor. Introducing Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in her first ever acting role (let alone first ever major film production) may be controversial in itself for replacing Megan Fox, but she is proof that you can never expect serious acting from cat-walk sirens. Is she better than Megan Fox? Stunningly better looks, extremely two dimensional acting. While Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do not add anything fresh in their third appearance, adding John Malkovich and Kevin Dunn along with John Turturro does slow down the pace to some well received lighter moments. There are also well placed cameos from Francis McDormand, Patrick Dempsey and Buzz Aldrin. I thought this was a clever venture to have Aldrin pegged to the film's version of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Blending a Film's fictitious plot with historical events is always considered a scriptwriter's gift for thinking outside the box. However, the rest of Ehren Kruger's screenplay takes a massive beating with more holes in the plot than craters on the moon. Pun unintended.<br/><br/>This third installment will entertain you if you have nothing else to watch. Teenagers may lap up all two and a half hours of it, but will forget about it even as the end credits roll up. If Michael Bay AND Shia LaBeouf can salvage some critical acclaim after the box-office buzz settles, it would be an ideal time to quit. Another installment in this series with either or both of them will be a final nail to the coffin."
"kgprophet","5","3","8","7 July 2011"," I Really Liked Explosions #47 and #83
","You will read a common refrain in every review about TF3, the overlong series of explosions that make up the final hour of the film. I came into this movie with low expectations. I expected the low-rent dialogue that would normally be rejected by a bargain basement sitcom. I expected nonsensical plot points, that can be easily seen as a convenient way to BLOW SOMETHING UP. Yes, something must blow up every 15 seconds, or we are ready to pull up our twitters. I came for the spit shined special effects by ILM, still setting the bar of all VFX houses. Indeed there are more rendered frames of CGI than probably ""The Phantom Menace"". Thankfully, Michael Bay had to decaffeinate his editing in order to have the full 3D effect. I could actually understand the geography of the action sequences for the first time in a Transformers movie. Until the final hour, that is.<br/><br/>Bay did a lot of things right this time. He has less screen time of dumb dialogue and just goes straight to the eye candy we all came for anyway. The slower editing pace, finally, gives the audience a chance to look at these mangled pieces of metal animated as if they are surreal sculptures (or even like that icky exhibit of frozen bodies). Some have half their brains blown out, or an eye blown out. Every megamechatron has like ten thousand little parts that you can see, meaning it overwhelms your Imax 3D vision with information to digest. That's what was precisely wrong with TF2. No one could make heads or tails of who was the bad robot and who was the good robot. Now we get more than 10 frames to glimpse each CGI extravaganza of little truck or car parts. I compare this to ""The Phantom Menace"" since both are films are similar in which the filming of the live actors has no feeling of being connected to the uber-robot battle going on behind them. No matter whether our hero and heroine get trapped in a collapsing building, or get tossed into a brick wall, they bounce back like Looney Tunes characters.<br/><br/>There is not much to say about the story or the acting. Other than regurgitating file footage of the space program that has been seen already for decades on the big screen. I was yawning almost immediately as we spend the first twenty minutes watching something from the History Channel reviewing our proud accomplishments in space. Although there is the alternate universe being described, it's still the same cliché footage we've seen over and over. A complete waste of the audience's time. In my editorial mind I thought, I could have saved everyone's precious time by just cutting to the big hook, one of those voltron gobot thingies crashed on the moon. There, setup over, let's move on. Shia Labeouf is trapped with everyone else in a one dimensional character, so I do not blame them for looking like cardboard. I was almost ready to compliment Michael Bay for not even pretending any characters have any anchor in reality, and just having each moment of revelation be merely a beat and move on. Yeah we know the nice looking guy is really a bad guy. Yeah, we know the shady robot has something to hide. Now let's BLOW SOMETHING UP.<br/><br/>There are literally at least 100 separate shots of big explosions in this film. Each one is lovingly framed, many in slow motion, Ka-Bloom! A large ball of fire, then some smaller debris shooting away, and a cloud of smoke. Bay must of had played with fireworks as a kid. I found myself smiling at the incessant explosions at first, then by time we enter hour 3, it becomes simply monotonous. Believe it or not, each explosion should have meaning, or we are just watching a 4th of July show. This explosion is important because it is putting our good guys in peril. That explosion is important because it is sending dangerous debris into harm's way. Instead of that, TF3 has explosion after explosion, with no real context, that you start to get burned out. Bay apparently wanted to make the central character of the movie the actual explosions, anticipating that 12-year-olds will get excited after every explosion goes off. But I pose this question to the editor and director: If you are throwing literally dozens of explosions as part of the big finale, won't the audience start losing track of what the significance of one explosion was along with the others? ""Remember explosion #64? That was a real good explosion"".<br/><br/>Which brings us to the last hour. The film goes way overtime by making sure we get to experience every last building and vehicle blow up in Chicago. Someone should have confronted Bay and forced him to cut a few minutes. Literally, most of the final battle does not wow you, it begins to annoy you, since it has no meaning anymore. About 10 minutes after I felt like the film should have been wrapping up i wanted to yell, ""Can I go home now?"", But no, another 20 minutes of sensory overload to the point I didn't care if he got the girl in the end or not."

","Yes, according to our 13-year-old film critic, Raven Devanney. But, it is really only appropriate for kids ages 13 and up. View her video review here or read below: <br/><br/>""Transformers 3, Dark of the Moon is a non-stop thrill ride. This action packed film is a fantastic addition in the Transformers series. The cinematography and special effects are absolutely breathtaking in 3D! This film has so much action and the sound effects are so intense that it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film!<br/><br/>My favorite character is Bumblebee because he is so sweet and he is there to catch Sam when he falls. Literally! And of course, once again, I love Shia LeBeouf's performance! I have been a fan of his acting for years, even before Transformers. My favorite scene is in the beginning when it shows actual footage of the moon launch because it is fascinating to see how many people were so eager to witness that back then.<br/><br/>I love this movie so much because it has everything: Action, comedy, suspense and romance. The one thing I think is unnecessary in this movie is that every time the Decepticons are killed, they bleed. It's weird because that didn't happen in the first two films and they are machines—they can't bleed! Also, the blood looks very unrealistic so it seems pointless.<br/><br/>This film is for ages 13 and up because there is a lot of adult humor that is very inappropriate for younger audiences. This film has a lot more violence than the first films. There are also somewhat gruesome deaths throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I give Transformers 3 two thumbs up!!!!""

"Andy_Kirkham","9","3","8","7 July 2011"," He Delivered.
","In the world of smart phone applications, companies say that to publish an app, it must do what it says it does. Two years ago, critics slated Revenge of the Fallen with biased views and poor excuses. And so Michael Bay went away and created a film which has everything the fans and critics asked for. It has action, emotion, comedy and depth. He said he was going to create an action film and not one person can say that he has failed. The benchmark has been set for any future action movie and it is a tribute to both great science fiction stories and the Transformers franchise that this creation has grown into such a wonderful cinematic experience for any movie lover. If you dislike explosions and cutting-edge CGI, don't watch this film. But for what was asked of him, and for what we deserved as fans... Michael Bay delivered."

","The reasons I give this a four out of ten:<br/><br/>New Actress. She was attractive, but not a Megan Fox. But the main reason is, they spent too much time on the effects and eye candies. The storyline and plot was good, but they should have worked on it a little more. Some scenes were too short or too sudden, or not needed at all. The main villain didn't play much of a part, just at the ending. Of course, they had to have the cars thrown and destroyed on the highway, but what really threw me off on this part was that they used crash scenes from the movie ""the Island"" that I recognized because I have watched it so many times. Also, it wasn't too original. One like the famous scene from the first movie where the transformer crashes threw the bus was original. Some of the humor in this movie was more child-like or stupid (but that's my sense of humor, you may think it's funny). One more thing was the soundtrack. It was annoying. They used, of course, one of Linkin Park's new songs at the end. It wasn't very good. So my point is the effects were great, but the storyline wasn't well planned out. Not as good as the first Transformers movie in 2007. I didn't really take my time on this review so if I missed anything, I apologize."
"yohoyohorum","1","3","8","6 July 2011"," Bayus ex machina
","I say that because the Transformers are less the focus of the movie and more of a plot device. I have felt since the beginning of the series that Shia LaBoeuf had too much screen time in what should be a clash of the titans robot melee. The problem has gotten worse with each installment. In this one, they cram so many characters in there (Turturro, Mcdormand, Malkovich, Tudyk, Gibson, Duhamel) and try to give them all equal screen time. Somewhere in between all of their quips, they try to fit in this robot apocalypse that is happening around them. The Deceptacons show up and destroy some things, then the Autobots fight back and the entire cast must relocate to resume their quirky banter. There are scenes showing the special ops teams in action for extended periods of time that really seemed unnecessary (Is this Transformers of G.I. Joe?). I was really annoyed that Optimus Prime is tangled up for more than a half hour of the movie while the humans are trying to save the day, but then Megatron had an even smaller part. At times it resembled Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, but with the Autobots showing up from time to time to bail out the military when things got too tough. The actual Transformer battles were exciting and looked great. I wish they could have focused more on that instead of all the other junk in this 2 1/2 hour advertisement for Mercedes, Lenovo, the Army, etc."
"dan_marsala","4","3","8","5 July 2011"," Bay Could Be A Good Director
","The sad thing is, Bay has something others directors work out for years (even decades) to get: means. He gets what he needs, because investors know he sells thickets. So, when you hear about Bay and Spielberg, one can assure there WILL be something extraordinary going on. You will buy and people will be paying Bay for a merely entertaining moment and an absolute mess of a story. That's what I saw yesterday. <br/><br/>There were big robot monsters exhilaratingly killing themselves in confrontations better even than the ones seen on the first one and the second one. There's where I found some kind of relief for my money. The amazing hand to hand combat seen on the first movie was better this time, as I found the most of the Autobots were involved this time in close combat sequences against a giant army of invader Decepticons. I met Dino, Sideswipe, Que and other Transformers from which my favorites were Soundwave and Ratchet. This time, is about one spaceship that crashed on the Earth's Moon in the ages of Kennedy. Therefore, the first step of mankind on our natural satellite (one of the biggest achievements in history) was not even for the sake of science, but a race between the U.S. NASA and the Russian aerospace intelligence to reach the ship and find out what's inside of it. The NASA won, but not much was the prize, only the location of the spaceship. Years later, after a mission in the Middle-Eastern (which has no relation, to me, with the context; just a mere reason to kill Iranians) and a visit to the ruins of the nuclear central in Chernobyl, Ukraine (my God: Russians needing Americans for research), Optimus Prime (Cullen) found some kind of proof of what the space mission was all about in the first place. The spaceship, The Ark, is the rest place of an old buddy named Sentinel Prime (Nimoy), the master of the actual leader of the Autobots. He left Cybertron in the middle of the war and took with him ""something"" that could have given the Autobots the victory: pillars, hundreds of them. He got lost in space to hide those pillars and, after he crashed on the Moon, he locked himself inside the ship with five of them. The pillars are means of transportation which can be used by Transformers to bring troops to this world and, in Decepticon hands, they could be very dangerous, so it is imperative to keep them away from Megatron (Weaving) and his brand new band of robot-fellas, along Shockwave (Welker) and his giant robot-worm-pet, Soundwave (also Welker) with his scary robot-vulture-pet (Awesome!), and Starscream with his usual cowardice. Decepticons go after those pillars.<br/><br/>The story with the Autobots and Decepticons is poor, but should work alone if it were. There goes Sam Wickity (LaBeouf) again, but this time with the hyper-sensual Carly (Huntington-Witheley) instead of Megan Fox (Bay is a man of word) covering the role of his hot girlfriend. The lucky guy keeps his supermodel in a ruined store and she lives on with his love, cause he still looking for job. She works in a male's paradise and has a female's paradise (and even some non-female) of a boss, Dylan (Dempsey), the guy who cares for her so much to give her a Mercedes (hell of a car), while Sam has a substitute of his Bumble Bee (joke of a car). I had seen this kind of treats, where the girl rather to be with the deprived guy even thought there is a rich (powerful) and handsome guy who falls for her, but this is way too much. It is just ludicrous. Dylan does a deal for Sam to get a shot in a cars company, where seemingly isn't any possible way of a quality standard (or human real emotions). There is where Sam meets a marked guy (Jeong) who has information about something the Decepticons cares so much to send robot-mercenaries to take human lives off At this level, the script is very complicated (not complex) without the characteristically absurd jokes Bay always frequents in his movies. Yes, there are a lot of them in this movie, tons of them. So much, that anyone can begin to doubt about the credibility of every single character. And there, exactly there is where Michael Bay fails every time. Sexy and uninterested supermodel girlfriend; rich Simons with gay butler; armed ex soldiers surviving the fall of a building. Those are affairs that would probably build a good plot each one in a different and separate movie, but in one single movie all of them could be (and they ARE) a complete and irrevocable mess; one that not even all the fights of big robots from all the galaxies would compensate. As the time passed by, I started to think about the Island. If there ever was a movie that made me feel the progress of a director in the matter of legibility it was his Island. McGregor and Johansson provide real emotions, real dialogs and even an amazing change of personality in the same movie But that was then. No real emotions in this movie. No real dialog <br/><br/>Somehow, I know Bay don't want to be a real director. He does his own movies, I know that, but he doesn't take it seriously. He's like a child, a big child that sells thickets and makes movies appear good with exaggerated takes and freezing sequences. Fancy style is what it is. But, as long as he keeps selling, he won't change. If, in some way, I found this movie better than the second one is because the return of the body combat. But both movies are despicable, and if I had known that before I wouldn't have left myself to be tightened by the first movie to see all the other movies in theaters."
"nrabond007","3","3","8","5 July 2011"," Don't Waste your Money
","Michael Bay....I guess this was to be expected with his film. We should all know what his formula is by now. Hard to discern action, unlikable characters, weak villains, overabundance of slow-mo and crane shots. complete ignorance to the laws of physics, and racism bordering on ""blackface"" levels. However, we must be fair, this sequel was better than the prior because the story was a little stronger and there were not quite as many plot holes. The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime. look to revive an older autobot, Sentinel Prime (Voiced by Leonard Nimoy), whose ship crashed on the moon in 1969, and recover energy pillars so that they can recreate cybertron through Sentinel Primes' powers. The formula for the plot is fairly solid, but they mention the ""dark side of the moon"" at least 10 times. The fight scenes are forgettable at best as your average 5 or 6 decepticons die in a fight and the autobots basically survive. This film does not have the heart or the gumption that the first film did and is severely lacking in the pacing department. If you are going to see this movie it should be for reasons not ""Transformer"" related. Rosie Huntington-Whetley is a knockout and Patrick Dempsey plays a more powerful villainous role than the voice and presence of Megatron. This film is a broken and missed opportunity."
"martinrobertson300482","6","3","8","4 July 2011"," There was actually a little bit off a story in there somewhere.
","This ""Transformers"" movie feels as though it's slightly better than its predecessors purely because I've gradually found the series chaos easier too follow each time. But it fails in many off the same ways as the others did as well as in some brand spanking new ways! <br/><br/>First off,I'm probably one off the only ones in the world that thought number 2 off this franchise was an improvement on number 1 (These blockbusters being referred too as number 1 and number 2 seems justified too most who saw them i'd imagine) Ye it was over the top, but so was the original. I remember that the first film tried way too hard too be funny, while ""revenge of the fallen"" had me laughing. So succeeded more in entertaining me in my book. I also had trouble following who was who amongst the robots in the first flick, while the second had some off the characters I remember from my childhood featured, making it an over the top mess I could at least grasp a little better.<br/><br/>This ones attempt at humour is pretty poor, but restrains itself more too the first half off the film, leaving the second part as nothing but action. The special effects are as good as always, even if the ""3D"" proves as disappointing as always. Off course its all relying on its visuals this, but at least there is a story off sorts, and some more characters that I remember from the cartoons and toys I had as a kid. So I really can't complain about not getting what I was at least expecting from the movie.<br/><br/>What I will say against it though is that it really has a whole bunch off other priority's wrong! It brings back unimportant human characters from the first two (except for Megan Fox, who is replaced here by some annoying English model) while getting rid off the robot characters we're finally getting round too seeing way too early. All in all the whole franchise seems intent on barely featuring Megatron. The Main bad guy as far as I know. Demoted too a mere side character in this series. Oh, and the raciest robots from the second film have gone, but there is a stereotypical Irish and Scottish robot on board. I'm Scottish and can't really say I was offended, but I'm just saying because no one else will pull Michael Bay up for that one.<br/><br/>Its nice that Bay got John Malcovich, Frances McDormand and Leonard Nimoy too be in the movie but so what? He should be concentrating more on cutting out cliché slow motion and dumb comedy sidekicks from his movies. I wasn't expecting the film too be a masterpiece based on what came before it. But I was expecting too at least see the return off some cool robot characters, and in that respect the film just teases!<br/><br/>This feels like an abrupt end off a trilogy too. One that's finished before a proper story has even begun. I hate Hollywoods recent fascination with re-booting everything, but the ""Transformers"" really do feel like they're in need off one. A Transformer getting re-booted sounds just about right too me. Make it happen!"

","Another 3D fiasco - All effects, no plot. Ask yourself, movies you will recall for years... What do they have in common? Awesome effects, or a kick-ass story/twist? Michael Bay is ALL style, ZERO substance. When all is said and done, the movie can be summed up in 3 words: Crash, Boom, Bang.<br/><br/>Forgettable, which is a shame since Part 1 started out nicely. Hope he ends it here, rather than destroy the plot further. Only good thing about the movie was the 3d effects, probably the best use of 3d thus far. I miss Megan Fox already, her presence is still better than their best CGI.<br/><br/>Watch it with patience and time to spare, brain power set to ""Way too low"". Watch ""The Rock"" or ""Armageddon"" instead, if you are a Bay fan."

","I would rate this move a 7. There are tons of action, the special effects are great, the action sequences long and numerous. There is so much going on, it is hard to follow at times. It has less annoying characters and scenes than Revenge of the Fallen. But like the 2nd movie, it is not as original or good or as the 1st movie. The plot has holes. Rosie Huntington is incredible eye candy and does a decent job. But Megan Fox and her relationship with Sam was more memorable and interesting. The 3D is better than other movies and worth watching but not mind blowing. Overall, a decent movie but not the best of the series."

","The Transformers films have had a long problematic journey ever since the decent and promising original came out in 2007. The original may not have been the greatest or most intelligent movie, but it was fun to watch and looked like a hopeful start to a new series of films. In 2009 Revenge of the Fallen was released to the world and has since become the definition of dumb bad movie as it was filled with mindless action all tied loosely together by an extremely weak plot. As much promise as it held it was not able to deliver what audiences were craving. For many film goers it seems that Dark of the Moon has the huge task of not only being entertaining but also redeeming the terrible second movie. Michael Bay himself apologized for the failures of the Revenge of the Fallen and promised a better third movie. With Dark of the Moon it seems that Bay is aiming for a darker film that will finally wrap up the transformers trilogy which does give audiences hope for an emotionally satisfying ending. So the big question on everyone's mind is can Michael Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger pull off a dark, entertaining, and emotionally satisfying end to this usually dumb but still fun film trilogy?<br/><br/>Check out the rest: http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com"

","The three stars I have given the film are based on its technical accomplishments (in case you were wondering). These include the digital effects, the general quality of the action scenes and set-pieces, the Steve Jablonsky score, some of the art direction and designs (the word 'some' being the keyword here) and finally the implementation of the 3D effect (though 3D in film is just that - an effect. It does not alter the quality - or lack thereof - of a film).<br/><br/>My feelings on all other aspects of the film (and also 'Revenge Of The Fallen' and to a far lesser extent the first Transformers) I pose in the form of the following question:<br/><br/>How can such an appealingly simple, low-concept idea get so much, so wrong?<br/><br/>Even ""low-brow"" entertainment can be done well and done poorly you know folks (very poorly in this particular case)."

A lot of talks happening in the movie made me and a lot around me sleepy and they like talking about the film that what really is happening or where is it going i mean it was heavily loosing its interest as people today needs to see a movie that keeps them a lot interested and like what's gonna happen next?! That boosts a lot of + points in the movie's ratings i bet! But nothing was seen like that in this. Due to the other characters playing a bogus role and because of wasting time it was like there was no use of making this one and like the movie is just made for the heck of it. I give it a 6/10 because of the cars, good action, good acting by the main stars of the movie and really because of Shockwave (Character) which was awesome, would have been better if they would have shown him from a much further distance angle on camera to see it all clearly for long doing all the thrashing stuff but none the less was good as much of it was shown.

"MarkeyTheSparky","5","3","8","30 June 2011"," I have absolutely NO idea how this film got a 12A/PG-13!
","I enjoyed ""Transformers"" (2007), I enjoyed ""Revenge of the Fallen"" (2009) less, although the graphics and action kept me entertained and, let's be honest, you don't go to see ""Transformers"" for the ""avant-garde-ness"", the Oscar-winning script or the world class performances. First of all, I'll say this: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is HOT! However, Megan Fox is HOT! The difference is, Megan Fox can act... she can also act without looking entirely as though she's at a Maxim shoot whilst she's doing it. When you take into account that this film is an action and CGI-lover's wet dream, that doesn't really matter. There's no point in the film where Huntington-Whiteley is naked and so the BBFC and MPAA have no reason to go above the 12A or PG-13 certificates, I have no problem with that. I also can't think of a 12 or 13 year old who would be drastically affected by seeing the curves of an older woman (at that age, it's all they think about anyway). Now, I'm 18, I don't have any kids, I enjoy films and, occasionally, I like to see a film like ""Transformers"" just to take a break from hard-hitting, philosophical, thoughtful dramas. I am not personally bothered or emotionally affected by on-screen fantasy action, action or graphic violence (as long as it's not a snuff movie or a video of a guy splitting his face in half after jumping from fifteen metres onto concrete). This is probably a good thing, because at the age of 18 (in the UK) I can watch any film distributed in this country that has not been banned by the BBFC, a lot of which contain action, graphic violence, graphic sex, extreme profanity and heavy drug use. I like that this is the case. I like that this is a democracy where we have free speech and freedom of expression. Just by reading the synopsis of a film, you can tell if you're going to like its contents or not. When a film's name is ""Saw"" and you're not a fan of gore, JUST DON'T WATCH IT! The problem is, the BBFC and MPAA seem to have been lowering their standards since the turn of the millennium (especially for blockbusters - I'm not a conspiracy theorist) and ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" clearly illustrates that point. If I had a 12 year old child and took them to see this film, I probably would have covered their eyes, walked them out of the screening, berated the cinema manager and then burnt down the BBFC before catching a flight to LA and assassinating Michael Bay. In a scene on the freeway, at least twenty cars, being driven by innocent civilians are blown up, thrown carelessly away, crushed or used as objects to chuck at the aggressor's opponent. On the streets of Chicago, the Decepticons obliterate dozens of people with ray guns, vaporising them... but not their clothes, leaving bloody clothes where the people did stand, laying on the road. In another instance, there is a camera shot along the inside of a train or bus carriage which has been hit by an explosion of some kind: all of the passengers on board lay limp in their seats, covered with ash. An entire building is destroyed by a boa constrictor-esque Decepticon, imaginably causing the death of hundreds of employees. My final problem, early on in the film the Autobots are sent to the Middle East to an ""Illegal Nuclear Compound"", these massive robots break in and when the soldiers, in fear, put their hands up in surrender, they are demolished by the aliens' gunfire. What I understood from this film's predecessors was that the Autobots had stayed to protect ""man kind"". The beginning of ""Revenge of the Fallen"" sees them fighting unwanted Decepticons, in fact, the Autobots have never fought a battle against any humans in the ""Transformers"" trilogy until this scene... I would imagine the fact that the first humans to be killed by Autobots are from the Middle East is a complete coincidence (that was sarcastic by the way). Michael Bay would always defend himself by saying that he's a patriot of America and her allies. I do not mind patriotism; I do not condone illegal nuclear compounds in any part of the world (especially Iran - not to imply that that's where they were suggesting the compound was). What I do mind is Michael Bay, in a film that he knew was going to be given a PG-13/12A certificate, presenting the ""Middle East"" as Iran, an entire sector of the world that we should now hate because they make nuclear weapons and want to hurt America. I would have been OK with it if the subtitle said ""Iran"". May I just add that a patriot does not use any excuse to blow up as many US landmarks as possible in their films (including the Lincoln Memorial) and suggest that an evil alien race assassinated JFK. Not only the violence, but the themes in this film annoyed me, not me personally, because I, along with a large percentage of the population, am aware that Michael Bay is simply a rich, vacuous and pretentious idiot. However, I feel that a young audience viewing this without that understanding and whilst they are still developing their moral compasses and deciding for themselves what is right and wrong, this could have a detrimental effect on their growth. I'd be happy with a 15 certificate for this film. Obviously the USA doesn't have an equal classification and an R might seem steep, but a PG-13 definitely is not steep enough. This is just my personal opinion, I might have read into it further than the average viewer would, so if you'd like to share your opinion, then feel free, especially people with children around the age of 12 or 13, I'd like to know how you feel about your kids watching this. I hope no-one's too annoyed that this wasn't actually a review."

Transformers 3 is like the last two Transformers, only longer and with more explosions. Michael Bay's focus was clearly on the spectacles, and not in story telling. The story, if you try to follow it, doesn't make sense, and it's everywhere. If I can describe it to you in one word it's: vomit; it's all over the place, and it's the regurgitation of the first two movies.<br/><br/>Acting was okay. I thought Shia was good, Rosie okay, and the other actors, just doing the same thing. The one character that I loved was Dutch, played by Alan Tudyk (very underrated actor in my opinion). And Ken Jeong... I don't why he was there, he didn't fit in with the Tone of Transformers movie. And Patrick Dempsey as the bad guy? Please. <br/><br/>Overall, if you just want to see explosions, robots, hot girls, and 3D ... go see it.

","I called ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" a 2.5-hour exhibition of a hurricane in a hardware store. There should have been nothing exciting, therefore, about the prospect of a second 2.5-hour exhibition — this time of hunks of scrap metal perpetually raining over Chicago — filmed entirely in 3D. Yet with the added assurance of the 3-D fusion camera system and someone with as keen an eye for action as Michael Bay, there was something thrilling — at least in theory — about this installment.<br/><br/>It also helped, for me, that Bay apologized. He was among many involved to admit the problematic nature and various shortcomings of ""Fallen"" and vowed a better experience this go-around in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Redemption, it seems, would be a good way of categorizing ""Dark of the Moon."" It's hardly the disaster its predecessor was, but it's also hardly what most would classify as ""good."" Fortunately, it has plenty of (thoughtful) satisfying action with enough traction for us to actually give a damn about what happens on screen.<br/><br/>In this third chapter, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives in D.C. with his new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). She's a bit more charming, though equally positioned for the purposes of eye candy, than Megan Fox. Sam's trying to get a job, but finds that he only felt confident in himself or important when he was saving the world with the Autobots. When the U.S government makes a discovery proving that Transformers first made contact with our planet in 1963 when a ship crash-landed on the moon, a chain of events occurs and Sam finds himself with the chance to be a hero again. Basically, if the Decepticons were to get ahold of what's on the moon, destruction would befall Earth, unsurprisingly. <br/><br/>For one, ""Dark of the Moon"" provides a worthwhile 3-D experience. Bay and 3D seem like a perfect marriage of auteur and medium. Only he and other style-first types could imagine an action sequence worthy of capturing in 3D without intentionally making stuff fly out toward the audience. Some of it's breathtaking, but most of it simply looks good. The ""Transformers"" series has only ever been as good as its paint job, and the look of ""Dark of the Moon"" is crisper and cleaner than ""Fallen.""<br/><br/>Yet many of ""Fallen's"" problems transfer to this installment, in particular length, story and an overabundance of characters and robots. Other than a key plot twist halfway through, the story lacks any grounding. At this point as well, the focus shifts away from Sam and onto the Decepticons trying to take over the world. Writer Ehren Kruger takes so much time to set up the historical context of the dark side of the moon and Sam's feeling of insecurity, yet he throws all that setup out the window when the action finally takes off. By then, we're ready for Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots anyway, so who cares.<br/><br/>An extended lineup of new mechanical friends probably made the folks at Hasbro happy, but there are too many Transformers to count in this film and so many lose the attention they deserve. Rather than focus on the effective ones like Soundwave and Laserbeak, Shockwave and Sentinel Prime, we get various bots shifting into the spotlight so that no one gets a distinct personality. Only those who've seen the prior films will feel moved by scenes involving Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and Ironhide, for example. The ceiling to care about these bots is high, but the sheer number keeps us from getting there.<br/><br/>More problematic, however are the number of people actors. The human characters outside of Sam have always been obnoxious and inconsequential to the story, so to fill so many roles with A-listers such as John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and Patrick Dempsey feels more wasteful than not recycling a dead Transformer. Audiences are paying to see the robots fight in 3D, not the humans talk. Unless you're going to deliver a story where the humans matter, don't bog us down with them.<br/><br/>Then there's the humor and political incorrectness that the ""Transformers"" movies can't seem to shake. Although nothing's as insulting as the racist twin motorcycle bots from ""Fallen"" that have been eliminated, the two ""mini transformers"" and some English race cars that McDormand calls assholes take their place. Some of the jokes are surprisingly spot-on, but it ends up excessive and uncalled for more often than not. Michael Bay also continues his lady- ogling with Rosie making her ""Transformers"" debut from the waste down.<br/><br/>So maybe Michael Bay is just a stubborn old filmmaker who knows what he likes, but one gets the sense with ""Dark of the Moon"" that he sharpened up a bit to make sure this film didn't outrage the fan base. Some filmmakers whose movies make $900-some million take that as creative license to make edgier projects, but in Bay's case, he makes it more how he likes it: big, loud, slick and sexy. It's unlike most filmmakers to make their films more Hollywood- pleasing as they gain notoriety and respect, but Bay's turned it into an art form. In the case of ""Dark of the Moon,"" he's upped the emotional and visual stakes to create an engaging feat of blockbuster. Although some of his contemporaries would have us believe that explosions and fighting should come with a side of philosophical sermon, Bay reminds us that there's value in wowing an audience and that doing so requires talent, even if that talent normally rates behind great storytelling.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"Penderworth","6","3","8","29 June 2011"," Transformers 3: When the third time is not the charm
","Please note that there are few small spoilers so be careful before reading on.<br/><br/>I see you're brave and have ventured to the review. First off I'd like to tell you that Sam's (Shia LeBeouf) new girlfriend Carly's (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) acting was decent and no worse than Fox's; and in the long run it was better.<br/><br/>The CGI was, as you would assume, amazing but still doesn't take home the trophy of Avatar and is rather far from that. This movie relies too much on the special effects and in doing so leaves you with three main battle scenes and rubble. At the end there is no indication that everything is okay, but it obviously is since this is a movie. Megatron doesn't need to get killed again either; it needs a better plot because this one is just old.<br/><br/>Transformers 3 wants to be one of those amazing battle movies, and it tries hard at this: only to fail. The problem is that the battles were short and things just get destroyed all the time at a ridiculous frame-rate that you can't keep up with. Someone would have to watch this a few times to actually remember what took place during the battles besides the good guys winning, as always. LeBeouf's ""Optimus!"" will always be classic, but doesn't necessarily need to be in every movie.<br/><br/>The biggest annoyance of this movie was its soundtrack. I was appalled to hear what sounded like Hans Zimmer's Inception soundtrack during the dramatic scenes of the movie. The melody was far too similar to it, and I thought it was the same thing at times. The other tracks in the soundtrack were just boring as they were the same Transformers melody that we've been hearing since 2007.<br/><br/>Overall the reason I really didn't care for this addition to the Transformers series is because of the idea itself. The first was great and we didn't need anything other than that, but now they've gone to make an unnecessary trilogy or more, who knows. I didn't feel like the movie took me through a fun adventure, but a dramatic journey instead. Different, yes, but for good or bad?<br/><br/>I'll let you decide that as I do recommend that you go watch it, unless you want to save that money for the final Harry Potter or Captain America."

As a friend of mine said,Michael Bay isn't known for making movies with an actual story.Only,guns,explosions,two people fighting themselves or others with a drop dead gorgeous actress.Even though Rosie-Huntington doesn't do much in the film(lie),she does better job than Fox.All other characters are in place.

","I wasn't sure how this one was going to turn out. I liked the first two, but didn't love them. The first one disappointed me the first time I saw it because it was too childish. The second one I liked much better, but even though the fight scenes were great, there was still too much mangled metal flying around the screen to really tell what was happening.<br/><br/>This time around Bay promised a darker movie. It wasn't a lot darker, but enough to satisfy all audiences I think. I think Bay went into this wanting to throw just about every possible action sequence into one movie. He accomplished that goal. What a wild ride. Epic action/destruction scenes. <br/><br/>The action was much easier to follow this time. The camera wasn't so jumpy, and they slowed stuff down just right so we could tell what the hell was going on. Much appreciated improvement!<br/><br/>My only complaint is that when they fired Megan Fox, they had the perfect opportunity to leave a lame ass love story out of this action/scifi flick, but instead they write in another sucky girlfriend plot. Lucas couldn't do it, and Bay should have taken notes. Quit trying to write a love story into our action/scifi flicks already! The new girlfriend wasn't hard on the eyes, but all I saw was a pointless character. If I ignore her like I do Jar Jar Binks, the movie was a solid 9, with her in it, it was an 8.<br/><br/>Very satisfied this time around. LOVED IT! When they fired"

"PersonaNonGratis","1","5","18","28 June 2011"," DOTM will dazzle and disappoint in equal measures.
","The question you have to ask yourself is, ""Do I like Transformers?"". If its no then this film is not going to appeal to you , so don't watch this movie. If its yes, your going to find it a little harder to like them after this one.<br/><br/>Now you didn't have to care about Transformers to like the first movie. There was a good balance between all elements in the 1st movie, whether that be humans fighting, conspiracy theories, humour, action, etc. It was an excellent introduction the 'Robots in Disguise'. It appealed to a broad demographic.<br/><br/>The second got a bit out of balance, but still had the spectacle of Transformers in action. Doing what they do best, Transforming. They also had some character traits about them. Dialogue was somewhat expositional for the robots, but there was enough screen time given for them to expand upon their personalities. There was even more emphasis on the humans.<br/><br/>By this, the 3rd film, there is an assumption that you 'know' the Robots. Not 'care', but 'know'. Whereas in the previous films, despite any shortcomings they have, a relationship is built up between robots humans and most importantly audience. To a point where you care for Bumblebee, Optimus, Ratchet, et al. You may even feel sorry for Megaton, when he gets his face punched off by Prime. You possibly hated the twins, but at least there was something there that made you do that.<br/><br/>Not in this film. So much MORE time is given to the humans, that the Robots are just background characters. From the brilliant opening, and Shockwaves introduction, that's about as much bona-fide Transformer action as you get. And when I mean 'action', I want to see Transformers TRANSFORMING, (clues in the title) which you hardly get in this movie.<br/><br/>I wanted to see Shockwave TRANSFORM, which he doesn't, he just rides that gimmicky snake thing (briefly) which has more screen time than all of the robots put together.<br/><br/>I wanted to see how Prime combines with his trailer more , which he doesn't ( is that a spoiler?), he just 'appears' in mid air to take out the snake thing.<br/><br/>I wanted to see the abilities of the Wreckers TRANSFORM and do 'stuff', maybe do an impromptu race, to make use of the Daytona car modes, because its just seems arbitrary to have them in this movie as they are written.<br/><br/>Or maybe just so the Wreckers have some screen time instead of being abruptly introduced and do some plot shifting. Oh, if only the internet rumours were true of them being rednecks, at least there would be something to complain about.<br/><br/>All the hope of the you-tube videos for the filming in Chicago has amounted to zero time for actual TRANSFORMERS. You get lots of the protoformer things and when there is a glimmer of hope that you may see an awesome TRANSFORMATION (a la Devastators in ROTF) you getnothing.<br/><br/>'Q' and 'Dino', (oh yes they do call them that, sigh) have little to zero time to develop character and they have so much potential, yet are woefully wasted. I can only assume that there has been important cuts made to this film to include MORE humans running around. Also if the humans are that good at taking out robots, whats the point in the Autobots anyway? <br/><br/>It just gets puzzling why there's even Transformers in this movie at all, as they seem to get in the way of humans messing around. Yeah there's some humour from the reliable John Tutorro, the cast is actually good enough to carry the plot, but I came see a movie about Transformers doing their thing. Instead they seem to inexplicably 'morph' more in this film, such as laser beak, which is completely contradictory to what Bay intended (and succeeded ) for the first two.<br/><br/>Alright, from a fan perspective it s going to be the hardest one to like (yes even over ROTF) simple because we need to 'connect' to love or hate the robots. It means they need some screen time to develop personality and connect with the audience. Or be in situations that demonstrates a robots characteristic traits.<br/><br/>For example, what's the point of Sentinel Prime changing into a beautiful fire truck (did he 'scan' one on the moon?) if he doesn't put out fires? Silly as it may seem, the audience needs to buy into this characters 'heroism' 100% for the plot twist to really have emotional gravity. They need to be convinced of his loyalty. They need to know his relationship with Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>On Cybertron we should have seen the Primes fight side by side, but we don't. So as a consequence, the ending has less impact, despite the expositional dialogue between them.<br/><br/>The oversight of this poor scripting isn't so bad on established characters but on new, or legendary transformers, its unforgivable.<br/><br/>It even seems at times that the plot itself gets in the way of Humans. So much so that Megatron has less screen time than the first two films and gives no explanation for why he is a tanker, or why he likes campfires and cooking pork 'n' beans.<br/><br/>DOTM will dazzle and disappoint in equal measures. True, it has spectacular 3D visuals, its has the 'action' scenes' , a twisty plot, (big!) references to the original cartoon and some intriguing allegories.<br/><br/>It has the all hallmarks of a summer blockbuster. Production values are very high. You may even enjoy the film for what it is. But, if you didn't see the other films, you won't understand what's going on, and even if you did, you wont understand why its turned out this way. It looks like someone lost their way with the underling theme of TRANSFORMERS, that being ROBOTS IN DISGUISE.<br/><br/>Nerd rage over!"

Don't be afraid to discriminate with what movies you spend your hard-earned money on. Don't rate something above average and the say ""it was pretty good.""

"Agent10","2","3","9","4 July 2011"," Oh the loathsome treachery of Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay....
","I kept telling myself, that this is a bad franchise and my childhood was raped and corrupted by the evil fascists that are Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay. But like pretty light is to a moth, I felt compelled to watch and once again stumbled into my own fiery death.<br/><br/>Dark of the Moon is filled with so much lunacy and idiocy, the numbing effect of this movie has created a generation of stunted, mindless zombies that continue to flock to this detritus and fill the coffers of evil, vile men that were once artists and created movies one could enjoy and not have their intelligence completely insulted. Bay used to make decent action films, and even The Island asked some heady questions between the explosions and chases. Now he is just a parody, and bad one at that. Spielberg should be even more ashamed with himself. He is plopping three horrible films on the public this summer (Super 8, Dark of the Moon, and Cowboys and Aliens) that lack any sense, logic or even a script. We are culpable in turning once talented men into black hearted corporate barons. These people don't even have to try anymore and people throw money into their laps.<br/><br/>The movie itself is an insult to film making in general, utilizing a plot that completely disregards the other two movies. But due to the disposable nature of the franchise and each of its chapters, very few people will care or even notice. The idea of a 50-year plan to attack Earth is ambitious in its scope, but all of the plot holes and inconsistencies from the first two movies coupled with bad clichés and stereotypes leaves a more savvy film goer a bit disillusioned. It all comes back to the idea that the movie is about explosions and robots on robot violence. Why don't they just do that instead of waste our time for two and a half hours with nonsense they pass off as plot.<br/><br/>The acting was bad, the action was overblown, and the film was littered with stupidity and scientifically incorrect moments (like buildings falling over and Shia LeBeouf surviving a harrowing ship ride that crashed and rolled but he miraculously survived) as well as other moments. I could keep going, but I'm getting a headache trying to wrap my head around this movie.<br/><br/>I'm done with this franchise. Plain and simple. Enjoy if you like people...I'm moving on."

"blacklist-1","6","3","9","29 June 2011"," The Transformers franchise still has a few flaws, but Dark of the Moon is a decent addition to the franchise and an enjoyable summer blockbuster overall.
","I enjoyed Transformers in 2007 and rated it on here a 8/10. I was really looking forward to Transformers 2 and despite the negative reviews I went to see it and was appalled at how awful it was with the most cringe-worthy dialogue and acting. The jokes were immature, offensive and became extremely dull and repetitive with two ""jip and hive"" Autobots who were really annoying. This made the film over-bloated with an in-exhaustible length of two and a half hours. It had shameful ethnic stereotyping of a couple of the human cameo characters and the women namely Megan Fox was just on show for eye candy (which would be no problem had she been able to act and had some interesting character traits.) The biggest problems I had though was the camera and editing, with when it came to the action the camera was switching so fast and edited so frenetically it was impossible to comprehend what was happening to the humans or robots making the action (which would have been the movies biggest asset) a bore too.<br/><br/>Anyway my friend against all resistance from me managed to persuade me to see Dark of the Moon and in 3D and I have to say I was extremely sceptical and groaned inwardly when I saw the length was two and a half hours. Two others things I wanted Bay to improve on was cutting down on the jokes and making them less offensive and the camera/editing of the action sequences.<br/><br/>I went in and sat down. I will say that the first ten minutes before Sam Witwicky (La Beouf) and Carly, Sam's new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) turned up in her apartment was fantastic. Bay cleverly inter-cuts with real life and archived footage the achievement of Man's landing on the Moon in 1969. It was very interesting to watch. Unfortunately after that for the next forty five-fifty minutes Bay introduces nothing but pointless scenes, which should have been left on the cutting floor of cliché and boring jokes and even though he said he would tone down on it, he really hasn't as there are two small Autobots who try to act cool, but really they're just annoying. What's more the jokes are still really insulting with a few homophobic and racist jokes, particularly of one Asian character Jerry Wang who is so obviously stereotyped with the way he acts. We are also meant to laugh because he dies. Seriously any Asian's or guys that are gay who watch this and find it offensive have every right to feel that way. As ethnic/social groups they are consistently marginalised in most mainstream Hollywood movies as it does not fit into the ideal Conservative American Ideology. The thing is with Bay though is he makes it so obvious and uses it for cheap laughs, which is just cruel he might as well have it tattooed on his forehead for all the world to see. At least other directors that do stereotype don't make it as offensive and achieve it more subtly. Anyway where Bay has toned down the comedy well is the appearance of Sam's annoying and dim-witted parents Ron and Judy who are in it for less than ten minutes, though they could have been cut out all together. <br/><br/>The plot is simple but too overextended for it's length with the narrative being incoherent, a bad script with more cringe dialogue and acting bad from some but from Whitely being the worst. She is a model and looks fantastic but has no acting ability or interesting traits as a character and she knows it. Her and Shia have no romantic chemistry either. <br/><br/>So what has Bay done well at? John Malkovich turns in a great cameo as Sam's boss (his comedy sequences are actually funny). Shia is solid in his lead acting and Hugo Weaving was great at voicing Megatron, but the best was the voice-over acting of bot Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) who was really convincing as a villain and cleverly inserted the phrase from Spock in Star Trek, which you will know when you hear it. The CGI of all the robots was stunning, in fact the best CGI since Avatar with the 3D being impressive though mainly during the action sequences. It was terrifically photographed with some stunning scenery. The soundtrack music was quite good too. <br/><br/>However where Bay has come the furthest is he ticked at least one of my three things I wanted change was the camera-work/editing during the action, it was much better! The camera flowed much better and was edited much less frenetically. It was superbly done and looked very professional. In fact there were scenes where there was slow-motion of the action, so I could see the action even more, actually happening and it was much more enjoyable as a result. Bay has wisely restrained himself in that respect and deserves credit.<br/><br/>It's true Dark of the Moon does have it's flaws and Bay hasn't redeemed himself from all his mistakes in number two, but he has tried and the camera-work out of my three was my biggest gripe, which he changed. Also even after the 45 mins of bad jokes,the next 30 was good with one great action sequence on the motorway and the last hour of non-stop action, which I highly enjoyed and was the best part of the film. This dosen't deserve all the low ratings of one and twos, which it undoubtedly will receive as it's better than the second. I did get bored some times but it was tolerable, even at 2hr 30mins. It is far from the worst film I have seen this year and a decent summer popcorn flick that mostly entertained me. Believe me it was a pleasant surprise and if you see this with a more open mind, you might enjoy it too, though that is not guaranteed. I though am glad I saw it."

","Michael Bay's third entry in the Transformers franchise gets off to a promising start, with an exciting, history rewriting pre-credit sequence which involves the Apollo 11 Moon Landings. Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill. While Bay seems to have attempted to take on board some of the criticisms of the previous instalment, Revenge of the Fallen, many of the same problems are present here.<br/><br/>Sam's parents have much less screen time here, and problematic robots Mudflap and Skids are absent. Despite this, the movie introduces several new irritating characters played by John Malkovich, Ken Jeong and Alan Tudyk, while Mudflap and Skids have been replaced by a drunken Irish robot and an angry Scottish robot.<br/><br/>Megan Fox does not return for this instalment and is replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, who is fine but unremarkable in the role. Her chemistry with Shia LaBeouf is marginally better than Fox, and her character is slightly more likeable. Frances McDormand also joins the cast and is the best aspect of the movie. She at least makes her scenes somewhat interesting and watchable.<br/><br/>The main issues with this movie are almost identical to its predecessor. The movie is filled with dull, unlikeable character that you have no investment in, even after three lengthy films. While Shia LaBeouf gives a better performance here than in previous films, his character isn't interesting enough to lead this franchise.<br/><br/>The same crass, awful humour is present here, although it is mainly absent in the final hour, in which it is nonstop action. While the action here is more coherent than in Revenge of the Fallen, it can't hold the audience's attention due to its overload of CGI and explosions and its characters with who you have no emotional connection. The fact that the primary objective for a majority of the action sequence is to rescue Sam's girlfriend while the fate of the entire human race is at stake felt ridiculous. The film then ends very abruptly without any real resolution for the characters.<br/><br/>As expected, the visual effects are great. The addition of a robot that seemed to be inspired by Mad Max was a nice touch along with a vulture-like robot. Unfortunately, they are given no characterisation.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie to be another disappointment. While it does improve ever so slightly over Revenge of the Fallen, it is never engaging, emotional, funny or exciting, beyond the well-executed opening sequence."
"sinjinza1984-1","5","2","5","30 March 2014"," Sigh - Michael Bay does it again
","The reason why I've given this review a *relatively* high score is because the effects are simply spectacular and even though I am not a fan of 3D, I still found it to be amazing in this film. That being said, you watch most movies to root for the hero (even if on some level you like the villain, you usually want the protagonist to come out ahead). Take Die Hard for example, you really like the way that Alan Rickman portrays Hans Gruber - he's a cool-headed, calculating, just-plain bad guy that you end up enjoying watching. Even so, you want John McClane to beat him at the end, you don't feel bad when Hans dies at the end of the movie. On the other hand, in this film I really wanted the villains to win, even if it was just to make Shia and one-dimensional, ex-model girlfriend character #2 shut up about Sam being ""a hero"" - Sam and his new love interest whine, moan, complain, and belly ache through the entire not-quite-3-hours of the movie. The only likable parts are the voice actors and Alan Tudyk as John Turturro's assistant (and a couple of Tyrese Gibson's ex-military buddies, notable Lester Speight, but I'm biased 'cause I'm a fan of Gears of War). <br/><br/>Rather than finally giving us characters to care about, Bay has created Asian stereotypes as tasteful as American World War II-era anti-Japanese propaganda; villains whose motives don't make sense (why is Megatron a hobo?, why did Sentinel Prime not want to colonise an uninhabited planet?, why doesn't the 20-foot tall robot squash the wafer-thin human girl when she insults him and his integrity?); protagonists who do more to make the audience wish that Earth would be destroyed; and as for Sam's parents - maybe the writers should've shipped them off to Mexico for their holiday instead of a round-the-U.S. tour. Hey, Michael Bay, in the middle of the worst recession in almost a century, don't alienate large portions of your already annoyed audience by having Sam's father spout endless lines about how unhappy he is that his son hasn't gotten a job ""three months out of college"". I bet he probably thought that Sam's predicament in joblessness was probably a great way to get the audience to emphathise with him, but it's not such a good idea to do it in a way that portrays the guy who is actually out there trying to get a job but has trouble doing so during a downturn in the economy as a hopeless loser. Well done, Mister Bay, well done - you've taken a franchise that people were already in two minds about in the first place and convinced even more people to not like it."

","When my friend said that due to the popularity of the original Transformers movie that they had another five in the franchise, I guess he was not wrong. However, the franchise seems to follow the same format, but as with most films, begins to degrade in quality (this is not always the case, but it is a general trend that films seem to follow). Transformers is no exception, with the quality of the films generating, and I suspect the more that are released, the worse they will become. I still remember another friend wishing to see a live action Transformers movie. I guess he now has three of them to see.<br/><br/>Anyway, the films follow a similar pattern with the first part being a little farsical as they introduce the plot and bring the Transformers into the picture. The plot usually revolves around one of the famous mysteries, or events, that dot this world. This third instalment focuses on the moon, and it turns out that the race to the moon was because they had detected something crash onto the moon and Kennedy decides to send Americans to the moon to find out. It also brings in Chernobyl, and explains that the catastrophe was because of some Autobot technology that had gone wrong.<br/><br/>The first two movies were quite amusing at the beginning, however I simply did not find this film to be the same. The characters had become a little dry, and Witwiki has become more annoying wanting to continue to be a hero. He has finished university and must now look for a job. His first job seems to be amusing, but in the end it really isn't. As sure as the plot goes, the Transformers are then found to be dangerous and exiled from Earth, and the Decepticons then reveal that they will not leave Earth alone, but rather seek to enslave it. Thus comes the second part of the film which involves Autobots and humans fighting the Decepticons and the city of Chicago being smashed up. Lots of explosions, nasty robots, and machine guns, as well as a city getting trashed. Entertaining, but to be honest, I think that is really as far as it goes."

","In this case hiring a good author (for a decent storyline) and hiring good scriptwriters (for original quotes) was far less important than special effects.

"MaximumMadness","5","2","5","6 March 2012"," ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon""- Misogynistic, bloated eye-candy Fun to watch for the visuals, but the 'writing' will make you gag
","Looking back, I find it hard to admit that I actually defended the last film ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"", and gave it a halfway decent review here on IMDb. I don't know what possessed me to try and defend it. Looking back, it is a bad movie, but it was full of so much eye candy that I found it highly entertaining and I didn't really analyze its faults as I should have. So I'm going to be giving a more objective review of this, the third film.<br/><br/>Michael Bay delivers ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", perhaps the single most entertaining pieces of misogynistic, exploitative filth I've ever seen. It is an awful movie, I will admit that up front, and it's depiction of women as nothing more than objects is flat-out disgusting and shameful. (Does Bay not understand that women are people as well? Because he shoots every woman in this film like he was shooting a car commercial- sleek slow-motion shots that show off the curves while paying no attention to development. It actually made me queasy after a while.) But, it's also very pretty to look at, and its clear that Michael Bay doesn't give a hoot about the story, as long as he can deliver pretty pictures, and in that sense, this film works.<br/><br/>The plot is.. Um a plot? I guess that a long time ago, an auto-bot named ""Sentinel Prime"" (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) crash-landed on the moon, and there's some sort of Doomsday device that will cause the Transformers home world to materialize in the Earth's atmosphere, and Sentinel teams up with Megatron to make it happen, so Optimus must save the day. Blah, blah, blah. It's the same exact movie as the last two- some Doomsday weapon from the Transformers past shows up and Optimus must stop it. First it was the ""Allspark"" cube in the original film, then it was a Sun-Harvester Energy thingy in the second film, now it's a transportation device. What-ever.<br/><br/>Shia Labeouf is back again as Sam Whitwickey, the human hero of the film, although his purpose in the series is no longer clear. He isn't needed in this film, nor was he needed in the second film. He's just used to set up some crummy jokes. Megan Fox has been replaced by some model named Rosie Huntington (I think, I honestly can't remember her name) who can't act to save her life and is the object of fascination for Bay's disturbingly perverted camera work. She literally has no development, and her establishing shot (a tight close up on her rear end for about 30 seconds and she ascends a flight of stairs) makes it clear that Bay only wants to objectify her, so I really didn't care about who she was. John Turturro also returns and is quite funny, and new characters played by John Malkovich and Frances McDormond are also a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The effects are astonishing. The level of detail has again been vastly improved in the CG models, and the Transformers look more real than ever. The facial detail and expressions are so well-made that I often forgot I was watching effects. As far as I was concerned, they were real. So props to the effects department.<br/><br/>Also, I will comment that this is one of the few films to use 3D ""properly."" The 3D Bay uses here is not only the best 3D since ""Avatar"", it's also possibly the best 3D I've ever seen in a live-action film. Better than ""Avatar""'s 3D. Everything is lush, and bright, and there is very little noticeable ""blurriness"" or ""murky images"" that plague other 3D films. The effects also don't give themselves away- there is almost no ""ghosting"", and nothing too crazy or gimmicky. Bay essentially shot the film as he would a 2D film, and that's what makes it work- the 3D adds an immense sense of depth, and doesn't rely on things flying out at you. It was technically a very impressive 3D film and is worth seeing in 3D if you have a 3D-tv.<br/><br/>Also, the action is a huge step up in scope. From an incredible opening space battle (that makes excellent use of 3D as ships soar past the camera), to a scene where our heroes have to flee a sky rise building while it is collapsing, every piece of action is astonishing. I'm torn with what to give this film. It is a terrible movie, with a weak, derivative plot and almost no character development, plus a nasty misogynistic side, but the visuals are worth seeing at least once. I give this an average 5 out of 10. Bad movie, great action. Buy the Blu-Ray (or 3D Blu-Ray if you have a 3D-tv) and watch the action, but skip over everything else."

","For the curious parent:<br/><br/>Here's the bottom line... Some sexual content (the new girlfriend is some sexy supermodel type), but no actual sex scenes. The movie was pretty good. My boys LOVED it (14 & 16)...I thought it was OK. It was just the whole concept; ie the ENTIRE space race in the 60's being based on hiding a Transformer ship that crashed. It was...laughable. They tied in Neil Armstrong's moon landing, there's a cameo with the real ""Buzz"" Aldren and actual footage of news reports. I enjoyed the cleverly edited footage from the 60's tied in to the movie...I also enjoyed it in Forrest Gump! Also irritating was that their JFK looked absolutely NOTHING like Kennedy! Do we blame casting or makeup? The 3D was meh. This cash grab of filming every summer blockbuster in 3-D for the sake of more dollars, is getting old, fast. The action scenes would have been just as good without it IMO.<br/><br/>If you can get past the seriously laughable plot, and the fact that you've paid an additional $4 per ticket and must now fit 3-D glasses over your prescription ones, then the rest is somewhat enjoyable. Good action scenes. Typical Michael Bay explosions & whatnot. Comical lines by the parents and some very annoying little bots (on the same level of annoyance as Mudflap & Skids from the last installment) I much preferred Shia's chemistry with Megan Fox to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, but they at least managed to explain the switch effectively.<br/><br/>All in all, I just can't not like Shia LaBeouf; Particularly in the role of Sam Witwicky.

","When the first part of Transformers was released I wasn't interested in it. Robots transforming into cars? Seemed pretty weird to me. One day I decided to watch it anyway. Ever since I'm a big fan of Transformers and I cut down my prejudices on movies before actually watching them, they can turn out quite different from what you expect. Shortly after I watched part 1, part 2 came out and I watched that one at the movies. I liked it a lot even though many people thought it was bad or not fulfilling their expectations. But ever since I've seen Revenge of the Fallen I was excited for a part 3.<br/><br/>After 2 years of waiting for Transformers: Dark of the Moon it finally was released and it blew up my excitement, in a really good way.<br/><br/>I was skeptical after hearing Megan Fox would be replaced by the model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley because she had zero acting experience and was to play a big role as new girlfriend. I don't like her but she was really doing a good job. The whole acting was definitely great. It was also interesting to see Patrick Dempsey as the bad guy which he acted fantastic.<br/><br/>To me the effects didn't overlay the story at all. They were great but didn't distract from the actual story. It had something conspiratorial, something funny, charming, there was action and romance, everything you could ask for. The storyline was brilliant, the old characters and the new ones were perfectly mixed together.<br/><br/>There is not a single point where I'd say the movie was bad or boring, I enjoyed every single minute of it and can't give less than 10 stars. I can only say the same about the Soundtrack, every song of it is amazing! Just as the first two.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth it to watch the movie and check out the Soundtrack."

","My son had a couple of Transformers when he was a kid. They intrigued me as toys: I liked the idea, I quite liked the TV series, and I greatly enjoyed the animated movie.<br/><br/>When the first live action movie came along I was pleasantly surprised, particularly at the script being as snappy as it was. The second instalment was a bit ""Oh dear"", however. I didn't find the story particularly engaging, and the action was terribly difficult to follow because all the Transformers looked the same.<br/><br/>Number 3 is much better. Megan Fox is gone (her absence is due to her dumping poor old Sam, we are told), but Shia LaBoeuf, his mum and dad, John Turturro and a couple of the forgettable military people are back (as are Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving in the voice department), with several well-known faces who I was surprised and pleased to see, all of whom seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. And the new romantic interest, Rosie Thingie-Wotsit is OK, albeit I found her top lip hugely distracting.<br/><br/>The story has more going for it, and it is pleasing to see Leonard Nimoy voicing Sentinel Prime (Nimoy voiced Galvatron in the animated Transformers movie back in 1986). Nimoy's presence gives rise to two pleasing moments in the film.<br/><br/>The action - and there is a lot of it, the last 40-odd minutes is a non-stop action sequence - is much easier to follow than it was in the previous film. There are places where the 3D is absolutely spectacular, particularly in the first 10 minutes or so.<br/><br/>This is a superior popcorn movie."
"catajedimaster2004","8","2","5","30 June 2011"," A visual treat for all action-sci-fi fans!
","I just watched the Michael Bay's Transformers Dark of the Moon several hours ago and I'd like to share with you my impressions. <br/><br/>I went to this movie with great expectations hoping for an improvement from the last installment and I believe they were met. The movie opens with a great scene depicting a very important moment in human history - the landing on the moon - in a slightly different way than most of us know. Thus the movie introduces a certain different purpose for that particular historical moment. I won't go into details here as I want you to go see it for yourself what this movie has to offer to action-sci-fi fans like me. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie delivered a visual extravaganza for all who enjoyed the previous two movies. It is visually stunning, almost incredible in the level of detail the CGI team created in depicting the robots and their ships. The 3D treatment only makes it 3 three times better. There are certain scenes that will take your breath away. Two of them involving Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf)and Bumblebee (offered in slo-mo to make them even more exciting) and another one with Sam and Starscream. Also Optimus Prime's fights with the Decepticons are really fantastic (the CGI team did such a good job that in 3D you see parts of the robots big and small jumping towards you as they are hit by Energon blades or alien machine guns and rocket launchers. Regarding action scenes there is a long one involving a sky-scraper in Chicago that is pure adrenaline. Also the Michael Bay trademark explosions are there, a lot of them to be exact, even more than in the previous installments in the series I'd say, but this only makes the action scenes more entertaining. <br/><br/>All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. It was a very nice summer blockbuster and for those criticizing it all I have to say is what do you want from a summer blockbuster? Not Academy Award-class acting or a very well-developed plot but action, special effects, breath-taking moments and again action. It is not a drama, it is exactly what it is, a summer blockbuster not a multiple Academy-Award winner (well, except for the visual effects and sound editing categories which in my opinion it totally deserves). I doubt that those who go to see this movie want an extraordinary acting performance or well-developed and coherent plot. No, they want to see giant robots and their human allies fighting each another in the middle of massive explosions and this movie really delivers all the above mentioned. <br/><br/>What I didn't like at this movie was that the robots, except for Optimus Prime and those two little robots hardly had any lives, especially taking into account that this is the last installment in the series as it is rumored. Also, there were some moments when I missed Megan Fox and I still think it's a pity that she was cast out. The new girl is eye-candy, but she not as beautiful as Megan Fox and her acting is not better either. At least she has a bit more of a contribution to the plot than Mikaela had, besides screaming, running around and looking good on the screen. However, taking into account that this is her first role in a movie she was pretty good for a rookie. <br/><br/>Also, this movie was a bit more gory than the last two as we can see Decepticons blowing people apart with their advanced weapons and the dismemberment of the robots seems even more detailed (probably due to the 3D treatment).The movie includes some moments (brief as they may be)of sexual innuendo, which are not recommended for children under 13 and make it seem targeted to an older audience. <br/><br/>If it were only for the visual effects I'd rate it 10/10, but given the minor (and I say minor) inconsistencies in the plot and a bit too long running time I rate it 8/10. In my opinion it is an improvement on the previous installment, almost on par with the first movie. I even hope they decide to make another movie or at least a reboot of the series with another director if Michael Bay really doesn't want to come back to directing it (I one hope that they would make the robots look more like their counterparts from the animated series and original Hasbro toy line as in my opinion the Decepticons look too menacing and insect-like)."

","As a fan of the first, and even second, Transformers film, I had mixed expectations going in to see this third entry.<br/><br/>I don't believe anyone's mind will be blown away by this movie, but I don't understand how anyone can walk away disappointed either. It's Transformers.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is a visionary director, and sometimes he gets carried away in his work. The second movie was relative immature. This one has a good balance; brief enjoyable humor underscored by a sinister undertone.<br/><br/>With Dark Of The Moon, there are moments where you'll wonder, ""why is this in here?"" or say ""he (Bay) could have done better than that."" But the hairs on your arms will be raised, and you might even get all emotional inside at moments, because when the movie does try to sock you in the heart, it does so with a crippling blow.<br/><br/>As with the first two films, there is room for improvement.

","Hi. I'm a pretty huge fan of the three Transformers movies because I think the action in them are great. This may surprise many of you but I actually quite enjoyed the story in the second and third movies. I recently watched Dark of the Moon and I loved it! Mainly because of the awesome 3D, special effects and action scenes that I loved it and gave it a 9 out of 10. Now again, this may surprise you, but the story actually engaged me at the beginning of the film and I thought it was interesting. The final battle in Transformers 3 is great, especially with 3D. It's a pretty cool ending to all three action movies. I think one of the main reasons why many critics dislike Transformers 2 and 3 is because they aren't fans and they don't understand the Transformers' characters well. Because I understand all the characters in the movie, I loved it! I gave it a 9 out of 10 for an interesting story for the first half of the film then for an awesome ending."

","Welcome to my first review here in IMDb.<br/><br/>Before I give my review of Dark of the Moon I'll give a quick review of the past installments.<br/><br/>The first part of the trilogy is a hell of a movie. The story is so so.The acting is average and some of the original Voice actors are present. But what made the first transformer movie epic is the special effects. CG and Special Effects is so awesome that it l blur the line that separates the real from the CGI. It grossed over 700 million dollars in the blockbuster paving the way for a sequel.. my rating 10 out of 10..<br/><br/>The 2nd part of the trilogy which was released 2 years from the first movie is pure garbage. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the worst installment. What made this movie suck is the exaggeration of humor to it. They should've made a comedy if they want a funny movie. The movie has so many plot holes that its like a kindergarten had written the story. Although the CGI and special effects is still awesome. This movie is full of crap.. my rating 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>And now, for the ending of this epic trilogy. Six years after Bay's Transformers franchise began came the finale of the trilogy. Michael Bay promised that Dark of the Moon will take a different path from the path that Revenge of the Fallen took. I was so excited when the trailer of this movie was released. What made me more excited is the fact that it will be in 3D. Although I'm still skeptical of the quality of this movie I still hope that this will redeem the whole franchise. <br/><br/>After watching it behind a pair of ridiculous 3D glasses, I came to the conclusion that Michael Bay fulfilled his promise. The movie did redeemed the whole franchise. The story is great, acting is average, Special effects is 5x cooler than the past movies which is due to having it in 3D. The robot fighting sequence will leave you breathless.You will see lots Metal and people flying around. I don't mind if Megan Fox is not present because the new love interest of Sam is quite watchable. Michael Bay abled to balance the action and humor which made it way better than the 2nd movie.The story took some elements from the Transformers Generation 1. Dark of the Moon has taken a darker path. You will see humans getting pulverized and seasoned characters getting turned into chunk of metals<br/><br/>Although this is a good movie. It is still inferior from the first Transformers. It lacks emotion.Some plot holes are present but tolerable ones. Lack of exposure of the main antagonist.Megatron and Starscream suck in this movie. This is not worthy to become the ending of the trilogy. <br/><br/>this is my opinion of the entire trilogy.. Transformers>Dark of the Moon>Revenge of the Fallen<br/><br/>For people who loved the Special Effects of the past two installments.. This is a must see movie. For fans of the Transformers cartoons. Maybe you will get disappointed. Over-all.. All I can say is to watch it in 3D in order to appreciate it more. This is a good movie.. Your money will be worth it,,:D"

","there's explosion after explosion, mixed with some comedy and several gratuitous shots of the lead actress in form-fitting clothing. It's nothing new, but why fix it if it ain't broke?<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf reprises his role as Sam Witwicky, who, when we last saw him, was helping the Autobots – the good guys – fight the Decepticons – the bad guys – and keep hidden secret images imprinted away only in his mind, that could destroy the world, if they fall into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>This time around, he's rooming in D.C. with Carly (the excellent Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), as he desperately seeks a job doing something more than sort mail. While the skeleton of the story's different, the action is much the same. Trade Megan Fox for first-timer Huntington-Whiteley (who was better than Fox ever was at playing a not just a pretty face), and viewers still have a hot piece to look at, although it should be said, in the end, Huntington-Whiteley's character Carly has a very important role in helping save humanity.<br/><br/>Bay and filmmakers take viewers on a journey back in time to see man's first step on the moon, and we learn that it wasn't only a mission of exploration, but that we were there to cover up the crash-landing site of an Autobot named Sentinel Prime.<br/><br/>Flash-forward 50ish years to present day, and humans are allies with the Autobots as they help us fight many of the world's wars. This allegiance comes to a screeching halt when Sentinel Prime, ""the Einstein of the Autobot world,"" is brought to Earth. For decades, he's been protecting pillars that, if joined together, would create a teleportation machine. Needless to say, if the pillars end up in the wrong hands, who knows what might be brought to Earth.<br/><br/>And that's just what happens, and war is waged once again between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and it comes down to Sam and the rest of humanity to help the good guys fight the bad guys.<br/><br/>Even though this is the same old story within the same old format, it's not bad. Bay sticks to his recipe of a good – not great – summer action flick, packed with great young actors in LaBeouf and Huntington-Whiteley, and perhaps an even better supporting cast in Frances McDormand as the head of the human team, John Malcovich, as Sam's pain-in-the-ass boss, and Patrick Dempsey as an evil villain; and returning favorites including John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel."

","I'm not a fan of the Transformers but I did enjoy the first two films and I don't ask for much when it comes to movies about giant robots fighting each other. Transformers 3 however failed to even live up to my low expectations and in my opinion it is easily the worst film of the series. <br/><br/>In the first two films director Michael Bay was at least aware that a movie based on large robot toys should be fun. This movie tries to get clever by infusing robot lore into actual historical events such as the moon landing in '69 and the Chernobyl meltdown of '86 which had great potential if only they'd bothered to think it all the way through. Stagnating in pits of exposition with plot holes large enough to ram Optimus Prime through sideways, we get bogged down in lengthy scenes where everyone tries to act more crazy and over the top than everyone else, presumably to hide the fact that nothing much else is happening and it's all very boring. To compensate for the absurd over acting displayed by most of the cast Bay throws in a new leading lady who barely acts at all but in her defense she does do a decent job in the role she was really hired for and that is to fill the 'sexy eye candy' void left by the controversial departure of Megan Fox, who should be glad she was left out of this debacle.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is filled with little more than scenes of Shia complaining about everything, so much so that I almost switched off around the 30 minute mark but thankfully the second half of the film ramps up a little and we get to have a bit of fun as the story starts to unfold with some twists (albeit mostly lame or obvious ones) and an injection of much needed WOW moments of visual delight. At last we get some of Bay doing what Bay does best - total mayhem, but regrettably by the time the film really kicks into gear I was way past caring or investing into the movie on any level.<br/><br/>Watching Transformers 3 I couldn't help but feel Bay was growing bored with fighting robots and the complete lack of extras on the Blu-ray could be a telling sign that I might be right. It was like he was on auto pilot, there was a definite lack of typical overly stylistic signature Bay moments and I wondered if he actually bothered to turn up on set most days. In fact he has become so disinterested that he's now reusing songs from the soundtracks of his previous movies (Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion also featured in Armageddon). It's way past time for Bay to move on, especially if there is to be a fourth film because this franchise is in desperate need of fresh ideas and some enthusiasm. <br/><br/>Despite being a pretty terrible film Transformers 3 grossed a truckload of money and there are rumors that parts 4 and 5 will be filmed back to back. The bad news is that Bay is meant to be directing. The good news is that LaBeouf may be replaced by Jason Statham so hopefully there'll be less moaning and groaning from the leading man which might, if nothing else, free up some time for Bay to blow more stuff up earlier in the film."

","Well? What can I say? That's a pretty awful film, though I still found it more tolerable than Tree of Life. Here at least we got some explosions and giant robots fighting (though I couldn't make much sense of it). There is no plot, however, or at least something resembling a plot: There are some robots that turn into cars and stuff and they fight and stuff and then, suddenly the film ends. The acting is terrible as well, which is expected, specially considering that the new pretty girlfriend of the main character was performed by a model and not a professional actress.<br/><br/>Michael Bay certainly is one of the most financially successful directors in Hollywood, being the best paid director in 2010, earning over 100 million dollars. However, it remains a mystery of how these transformers films have made nearly one billion dollars in box office. While the general public doesn't generally has the most refined taste for films, I still think that generally films that are successful in the box office tend to be decent. That was not the case here."

","I find this movie to be a total and utter disappointment. To me it seems like Michael Bay is trying to milk the franchise and people of their money because he knows that the movie will do okay in theaters based on the fan base. The plot is very dull and very uninteresting and I find it incredibly hard to believe that Sam witwicky would abandon the girl that HE SAVED THE WORLD WITH for another girl so quickly. It would have made more sense to me if they had left the girlfriend part of the story out completely. Instead, however, they wrote a girlfriend part of the story in and made Sam seem like a total dirt bag. All in all this third installment, as far as I am concerned, takes a big dump on the series as a whole."

","I'm really surprised how much hate all three films have gotten over the past four years. People moaning about this and that.. it gets to me in a way that I think to myself ""damn, why can't people just be satisfied"".<br/><br/>I've been a big fan of Transformers since I was a kid.. and that sure is going back some years. Michael Bay's movies have satisfied me, and I love every minute of them.<br/><br/>As a kid, I would watch Transformers not for the story.. but for the Autobots fighting it out with the Decepticons. The lasers and explosions are what drew me into the cartoon in the first place. That's what these live-action movies are all about. The action. The explosions. The fighting.<br/><br/>This movie is what a summer blockbuster is all about, you want to be entertained and feel like you're in with the action. And that is exactly what this movie delivers. Fantastic. Solid. Summer. Movie. Action.<br/><br/>I hope that this franchise NEVER gets a reboot, and that the characters and story lines are left well alone."

","Warning: spoilers<br/><br/>anyone who has seen this movie knows what i'm talking about when i say that the first two movies had a small plot: this person wants to take over earth. we have to kill him. and i really like the first two films a lot, but the cast and crew really put some effort into making this movie as good as it can be. the movie starts with the moon and a ship, but then evolves into betrayal, the destruction of Chicago, and involves HUMANS working with decepticons. because of all of these reasons and many more, Transformers: Dark Of The Moon most definitely deserves at 9 rating. <br/><br/>the only problem i have is that it was predictable in some points. (ex) when Carly gets into the car after her and Sam find out that Dylan is working with the decepticons, i think almost everyone predicted that the car that Dylan gave her was going to transform into a decepticon. Also when you see the shuttle go up in space, i knew that they were going to blow it up to tie up loose ends. also that they weren't really in the ship when it got destroyed was a given."
"nicolas-174","1","16","96","28 June 2011"," Transformers 3: shame without Megan Fox
","I have enjoyed the 2 first opus, for different reasons. The 1st one was a bit like a Disney/teen movie, funny and the story between Megan Fox and Shia LaBouf was cute, my kids loved it. In the second opus, it was more about pure action, like the 2nd Alien, robot fighting without any plot whatsoever I liked it because I am a fan of CGI and Sci-Fi movies...<br/><br/>However, I always found that Megan Fox was great here to compensate the excessive number of robots and metal, cars and trucks in the movie. Her character could have been more deep and I was expecting that M.Bay would give her a chance one day.<br/><br/>The first thing that really made me spend a bad time in the theater is that each time I saw Rosie Huntington-Whiteley I was thinking ""she does not match"". It is like having Lara Croft instead of Ripley in Aliens. Then, in my opinion, the chemistry between the 2 main character was not working at all.<br/><br/>I have nothing personal against Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, she is probably a great artist, but she do not do a good job at replacing Megan Fox. It distracted me to the point that I could not connect with the characters. Too much boom, bang swing, splash and no connection: I started watching my watch... There is a point where CGI and technical skills, kills the movie if there is nothing else. I got enough action in Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, so I was not so impressed by the new actions scenes. Since Godzilla, blowing up things is nothing new...<br/><br/>It seems that M.Bay decided to follow the Batman, or Star Wars series where the 3rd opus is more dramatic and dark than the other ones.<br/><br/>But to get back to my point, robots even with a soul cannot replace the cute face of Megan Fox. Even if she was not the best actress (or she had the worse script and dialogs, we will never know), she was bringing some human beauty and feelings to the opposite mechanical actors, giving Shia a real goal to save his lovely lady: this was connecting me with the characters and adding some humanity to an otherwise very cold movie...<br/><br/>M.Bay maybe think he can replace an actress with another, but us, the public will greatly miss Megan Fox. Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon is like a good and expensive meal where the Cook forgot to salt. I wish they did 2 versions and they could switch to the version with Megan, because without her, this movie series lost its heart."

Boring characters, boring designs of the transformers, boring scenario, plots (is there any?), endless explosions, endless catastrophic machines fighting machines, machines fighting human beings, stupid dialog, stupid parents, stupid companies, stupid NASA, stupid military operations, transformers of cars, flying robots, evil against good....blah, blah, blah, and blah.

","If most of the girls go crazy about ""The Twilight Saga"" (2008-2012), I think it's totally OK if the boys have their own toys as well! All the boys need is insanely super cool robots and sexy girls. Thiz one is the third movie following ""Transformers"" (2007) and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" (2009). The story still revolves around Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his new super sexy girlfriend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Thiz time, they have to uncover the mysterious origins of Autobots and Decepticons which later take them to a hidden fact when Apollo 11 landed on dark side of the moon 42 years ago. The movie featuring a real hero, the second person ever to walk on the moon, Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin. The Director is still Michael Bay. I aware that Michael Bay always has a young spirit in all of his movies, even in his war movie like ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). But I also have to say most of his movies are always filled with exaggerated brainless actions and comically overacted characters like in ""Bad Boys"" (1995), ""The Rock"" (1996) and ""Armageddon"" (1998). If it's not because of Steven Spielberg's involvement as Executive Producer that contributes lots of technical elements, I think that thiz movie would have been easily forgotten. Yes, the detail of Special Effects is incredible. It's very clear that the main attraction is on its robots. The Autobots consists of Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Dino, Brains, Wheelie and the leader Optimus Prime. They are back in action to fight for freedom. And the villainous side named Decepticon consists of Starscream, Shockwave, Soundwave, Laserbeak and the leader Megatron. All of them still dream of tyranny. The robots are voiced by some well-known Actors such as Hugo Weaving as Megatron and Star Trek's Mr. Spock, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime. Thiz is one of the very rare cases which the robots have better performances than the human Actors. All actors are drawn to be unnecessary comical characters without exception, including John Malkovich, Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong and Tyrese Gibson. The model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has the same color of lipstick and hair, it doesn't mean that she can instantly replace Megan Fox's character. As you can see, she is there only to provide the visual pleasure, not acting. Julie White repeats her overacted performance as Sam's mother, thiz is one of the ugliest actings you will ever see. Sam's character is not lovable at all. I don't know what Shia LaBeouf thinks when he delivers such a character. Sam is just a jerk with amazingly gorgeous girlfriend beside him. He looks so cocky and egoistic by always yelling and swearing during the entire film. It comes to my mind, maybe they need to get rid all of the human characters in next films, and let the robots deal with their own conflicts, just like what we had in original animated TV series ""The Transformers"" in 1984 to 1987. Thiz movie has shown that's one step back for the Actors and one giant leap for the robots.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

I love huge CGI over the top nonsense. I like pretty much most movies, simply because someone took the time and effort to make them. I even like the first two installments of this series. There is a very short list though, of movies I loathe, detest, despise. Eyes Wide Shut. 300. Pan's Labyrinth. And now I must add Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Both Peter Travers and Roger Ebert describe the movie perfectly, and give the appropriate zero stars; so a review here is unnecessary. This is for anyone thinking they might go see this horrible waste of film- donate the money to charity. Starving children in Africa deserve your money more than Michael Bay."
"dfranzen70","2","2","6","21 March 2012"," An unflattering, debasing humiliation
","Good things don't always come in threes. Or twos. For that matter, the first one could be pretty rancid, too. But the intended audience for the Transformers movies don't care; no matter how wretched and incomprehensible these movies are, they make money. Probably partly because they're now being released in 3D, tickets to which are more costly, but I digress.<br/><br/>Some people like to watch things blow up and require little else in a movie. We refer to these people as Michael Bay fans. Bay here continues his long-standing tradition of churning out a pile of exploding crap - but with robots! They make all the difference. Imagine a movie in which every scene was essentially a ""we're running out of time"" scenario, with every other minute filled with something either getting hit or hitting something else, and you have a Michael Bay movie. This is not news.<br/><br/>I can't blame Bay for making the movie or for actors like Shia Labeouf and John Turturro and Josh Duhamel appearing in them. The movies are mints, both domestically and internationally. Explosions are the true worldly language. And I can't blame those who want only this kind of movie to exist; after all, in theory their patronage allows smaller films to exist. But all of that aside, this is a trainwreck of a movie. It has a laughable plot, hysterically bad acting, and unfathomable fight scenes and seems to have been filmed by a pixie in the middle of a glue-sniffing marathon. It's inept and probably shouldn't be watched unless one is actually under the influence. Or paid.<br/><br/>Anyway, it seems something's been dormant on the moon lo these many years - hence why no one's conveniently been back since '72 - and it has something to do with our new friends, the Autobots. Megatron, evil bad guy supreme, is back; Optimus Prime, super good guy revives an older prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) inside the ship found on the moon, but before you know it the Autobots are fighting Megatron's Decepticons in an effort not to take over the world. Some robots return from the first and/or second movies. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Labeouf), the luckless loser of the first two films who somehow manages to get the girl and his own pet robot/car, is also back - with a new girl, played by the very British newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and is now looking for a job. He's constantly whining about it, too. Oh, and his new girl - whom he met while getting a medal from President Obama, no less - has a kick-ass job doing something or other with a suspicious-looking Patrick Dempsey.<br/><br/>In short - robots attack, other robots fight back, good robot-on-robot action, boy saves world again, gets girl, and roll credits.<br/><br/>What's there to like about this one? Well, Huntington-Whiteley is not terrible. She may even be better than the deposed Megan Fox. But she doesn't screw up, and that's good. She looks pretty, and the camera notices. Hm, other than that, there's some interesting fight scenes. But let me tell you about those fight scenes.<br/><br/>When you have two robots fighting each other, particularly amid an urban landscape, you should make sure they are discernible from each other. I know, sounds elementary and obvious, but not to Michael Bay. There are plenty of fight scenes in which each or all robot participants are gray/beige. Optimus Prime is easy to pick out - he's blue and red. Bumblebee is yellow. Most, if not all, of the Decepticons are gray and black. Even some of the Autobots are gray and black. Then the action is so whiplash inducing that it's tough to understand who's actually winning a battle.<br/><br/>This kind of movie requires that one suspend disbelief. This movie in particular, however, requires that you expel disbelief from your mind for an extended, indefinite leave. First, there's the robots. They're sentient and have weaponry. And yet somehow they're not bulletproof. Now, I'm not bulletproof, although I can strap on a vest that will make me so, to a degree, but the reason we humans don't wear them is that a) we're not always in peril and b) the vests are pretty heavy and not at all slimming. Why aren't these robots impervious to Earth bullets? Then there's Sam Witless. Fresh out of college, he expects - because he saved the world twice! - to land a Top Job. He's an idiot. There's literally no reason for him to be hanging around at all in this movie, because he shouldn't possess the skills to fight alongside the Autobots. He's small, he's dumb, he's weak - or so he seems. Yeah, in the fight scenes he's suddenly Superman. He runs like a stuntman. (For that matter, so does Huntington-Whiteley.) How did he come to have such power and strength? How come he's given - more than once - firearms? Has he training in operating these weapons? I am thinking no. He's like a little kid who thinks he's Indiana Jones and John McClane rolled into one. Just awful.<br/><br/>To top it all off, we also get the return of Sam's parents, who apparently are RVing around the world and visit Sam a week earlier than he'd thought - oh, sitcom time! As before, his mom's incredibly dumb but well meaning and his dad's a sullen jerk who obviously turns good at the end. (For half the movie he brings up how his son doesn't have a job yet.) I hope none of you saw this in the theater. If you did, I hope you didn't pay extra to see it in 3D. Why bother? This movie's an embarrassment. Amazingly, Frances McDormand is in this movie. She has a rather large role. She should burn all copies of this movie and pretend it never happened. She should return to, you know, good movies. I felt so bad for her here."

","Just think, some people thought they were disappointed by Transformers 2. If that's the case, then wait until they get a load of this thing. Dark Moon makes TF2 look like Casablanca by comparison.<br/><br/>Dark Moon offers nothing new in any way, shape or form. It's a convoluted mess that's caught in no man's land. It actually takes itself too seriously yet offers ridiculous action (ridiculous as in dumb, not as in wild or fun) and even more ridiculous characters. It wants to be taken seriously but functions in bizarre surroundings with a foolish plot. Movies like Thor and X-Men worked this year because they evolved characters, told a smart story and grounded the concept but still delivered the action. This movie tries to take a similar approach but it simply can't stand on its own as a film. Does silly, wild but dumb appeal to even the youngest crowds? Maybe it does but the rest of us want way more in our summer movies."

But I felt so compelled to write this review because the movie was so bad in many ways. I mean really bad. As bad as the most bad movie in the world.. ""Street Fighter: Chun Li""<br/><br/>#1) Shia La Buff just was awful. Are we to believe someone who's saved the world twice can't find a great job? I've gone to a crappy college and I can do a better job of finding employment than this character. I guess I just need to suspend belief.<br/><br/>#2) Again, Sam has been awarded by the president twice for his heroic efforts in the previous transformer movies, but constantly throughout the movie nobody within the US defense dept will listen to him. Hey, he even has trouble contacting just the transformers. Again... suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>#3) For some reason they tried creating a relationship between the new blond lady and Sam. I can see why Megan Fox didn't want to be in this movie. There was no reason to make this movie about Sam and his girlfriend. The girlfriend was a waste of time as was having sam's parents in the movie. <br/><br/>#4) How is teleporting cybertron to the planet earth going to save cybertron? As written by another reviewer, it seemed like Sentinel's plan was to destroy both planets by teleporting the planet right next door.<br/><br/>#5) Robots killing robots. For a race that's supposedly becoming extinct, this Optimus Prime has no qualms killing people of his own race. Heck... its a robot destruction fest. When growing up watching transformers,.... what i liked about watching the cartoon was that Optimus Prime always did the right thing. Optimus prime in this movie series is pretty cold and heartless. He was killing decepticons left and right...laying down the autobot justice. <br/><br/>#6) Sam and Company somehow survive a falling building to save the world. Yes, again... it does look somewhat cool to have people flying within a crashing building but.... how the heck were they supposed to survive the crash.<br/><br/>#7) I need to watch the movie again, but did the two scrawny good robots really destroy the huge mother decepticon ship? WTH?... pull some cables on a ship and BAM... falling enemy ship. They pretty much save the most important transformers. REALLY?<br/><br/>I could go on and on about how this movie forced me to have to suspend disbelief in order to sort of enjoy the movie.

As with the marvelous car-race scene in The Matrix 2 and Die Gõtterdammerung shown in cinemas in Norway from The Metropolitan last year. Sweet dreams.Sorry for that, but I lost the red line as the story was disturbed of too much action and could not hold my attention. I am kind of sorry I have to add 10 lines as a minimum, I prefer to be short. When that said I liked to see Patrick Demsey other than Dr.Sheperd from Greys Anatomy. Shia LaBeouf did a great role, he will grow better with the years when his face develops more character. Also Rosie Huntington- Whitley did all that was expected, But why in hell did you have to cast such beautiful people in the main roles, like cheap American series, all beautiful with no lived lives, It is not enough to say I did that and that and nearly died hear all the tragedies of my life, and so on.

"Keyzer99","1","2","6","26 December 2011"," I can only review 1st half of the movie (becoz I just couldn't finish watching it)
","After about an hour or so, I got too tired of watching messy metal parts, explosions, clichés and boring dialogs, that I chose to stop watching the bluray & spend my valuable time by having a nap instead. At least, my dream was more understandable. After reading similar previous reviews, I'm glad I didn't waste more time on it.<br/><br/>I should have got the hint that the movie editing is so poor right at the beginning, when they used real footage of JFK turning his head 3 times for 1 short scene. The rest of the movie (that I watched) suffer the same from poor effort of editing that make the movie unpleasant to watch.<br/><br/>Editing aside, the story is also weak. If human have to be involved in a robot war, at least make them interesting or appear useful to the story. Neither important reasons are ticked here. Alas, showing more robots is not helping the situation either. Our eyes and brain have to suffer trying to comprehend what's really going on. Majority of the bots are greyish silver, on every single fight scenes, you have to watch closely to know which side is winning, Decepticon or Autobots? The robot consist of small and messy metal pieces that I can no longer think, imagine or care which part of their body transformed from what part of vehicle. The metal beard and few strains of metal hair are cringe-worthy. We desperately need a reboot of this franchise. Just like what they did to Batman. The next people making Transformers should just use Michael Bay's versions as case studies. Just do all the opposites and the movie will mostly be better already."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","6","24 November 2011"," How about we transform into a better movie?
","Having endured the mind-numbing dumb-headedness of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, I arrive at this second sequel with a sense of overriding weariness. We know the pattern by now because it doesn't seem willing to change: The good-natured Autobots have a tiff with the hate-fueled Decepticons and they have brought their war to our planet so we can watch one of our most beautiful metropolises (In this case, Chicago) demolished for well over an hour. What did Chicago do to deserve this? Transformers: Dark of the Moon has more story than the previous films, but it is still another loud, dumb, crude, overlong monstrosity. The story is convoluted and involves a plot that begins in the early 1960s, surmising that President Kennedy's determination to put a man on the moon was fueled by an alien spacecraft called The Ark that landed there (Kennedy occupies the film via a bad special effect that is ineffective and rather creepy). Between the giant robots that inspired the moon landing and the mutants that got involved in The Cuban Missle Crisis in this summer's X-Men: First Class, it is wonder that JFK didn't resign.<br/><br/>Here in the good old 21st century, the war between the two robot factions has come to earth and the only real question to be raised is which faction will occupy the planet once our cities are reduced to rubble in the mechanical struggle. I didn't really care why the robots came to earth or what they did when they got here. After the movie explains their intentions, I somehow felt that I was better off not knowing. I thought back to the simplistic purpose of this summer's superb Super 8, in which the visiting alien's central focus was a willingness to tear this planet apart just to get off of it, The Transformers plot over-extends itself.<br/><br/>On the human scale, the Autobot's top ally is Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) who has graduated from college, taken up with a gorgeous new girlfriend named Carley (Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whitely) and is frustrated because he can't find a decent job. On top of that, a billionaire car collector who is Carley's former boyfriend. Sam is frustrated a lot in this movie. He screams a lot, throws fits a good chunk of the time and seems so animated that we wonder if he isn't on something. It is possible that Mr. LeBeouf may have figured out what I have about his role: If we stand back and look at this plot from a distance, Sam really has no purpose in this movie.<br/><br/>Humans are beside the point. My overriding problem with Transformers: Dark of the Moon rests with the robots. The Autobots and the Decepticons are incomprehensible when you look at them. I can't tell one from the other. They seem built from a morass of metal that forms something 40-feet tall with arms and legs and something that might be mistaken for a face. This time around some have hair for reasons I can't begin to explain. Those faces aren't expressive, but hidden within all the metal. They have mouths but why do they need them? When they fight and their bodies are pressed against one another, you can't tell one from the other. They're metal, therefore they can't get hurt, so why do we care? If they get destroyed, they can be rebuilt. Right? Plus, they make no logical sense. How does a 50 foot-tall robot have enough metal in his body to transform into a full-sized pick-up truck? They are on this planet to fight one another, but what are they fighting about? What makes a robot good or evil? Who decided which side they would be on? What makes them intelligent? What makes them able to think and talk? What do they do when they aren't fighting? Who sent them here? Who built them? Why were they built? Why do they transform into a automobiles? The robots are all male, so are their females? Was this trip really necessary?"

","This disaster is even worse than the last. Both the studio and bay have been amply warned to get their $h""t together after the insulting debacle of ""revenge"". They did not listen. Bay still got the job and the script is still vomit. But this time it's bigger, longer and it stinks even more.<br/><br/>There is no point in describing the plot or story as there is none. Just nonsensical convolution, bad acting, boring action, and robots that are not robots because they: have human vocal chords, speak human slang, drool, have grey hair, wear a cape, age, get fat, speak with human regional accents, bleed, roar like a tiger, talk like a teenager. Enough.<br/><br/>I didn't pay to see this in the cinema as i knew what to expect. But even after just renting the DVD I feel insulted.

","Once again Michael Bay had a chance to redeem himself by making a plot to equal the only good part of this movie... the graphics and animation. I don't know who else liked the stupid little robot in the first movie, but it must have been Michael Bay's favorite character of the movie. Why you ask? Well, with their return to the third film, they were the true heroes of the day. I always thought it was Optimus Prime who was the hero, but no (Here's my small spoiler)while Optimus clumsily got himself tangled in some wires on a crane rigging, these two moronic little geeky robots somehow found their way into the Decepticons ship and managed to take it out virtually ending the whole battle. Seriously?!!! I like that Optimus finally kicked some butt in the end but it just didn't feel right. Kinda felt cheated by the fact that he was such a wuss earlier and then somehow all of sudden got this extra burst of power and could now kick some butt. Plus earlier in the film Optimus was the one that said, ""Retreat!"" If I remember correctly from the cartoons that was always Megatron's line. Yes this was far better than the second movie which I rate with the slime of the earth with it's over sex charged and immature middle school humor. It really did seem like they had a middle school kid right the script with all the stupid cheap humor and over done sensuality. Sorry to say but a movie really does have to have a good plot, you can't just throw in cool graphics, cheap humor and lots of hotties to make a movie good."

","At least, that's the only reason I can think of for it pounding so hard. And no, I didn't even watch the 3D version.<br/><br/>So here we go again, another edition of Bay-watch. In this episode we'll discover that Michael Bay is still suffering from terminal 5 year-old syndrome and is unable to do anything that might remotely interest an adult audience.<br/><br/>I could wax lyrical about film-making, the effects, the acting etc. But all that would do is give Bay some credibility and admit that he actually produced a movie, instead of the headache inducing, brain-inflaming mess that I just watched.<br/><br/>So instead, whilst it's still horribly, and garishly, fresh in my mind, I'll spell out the things I observed from this hideous assault on the senses.<br/><br/>1. When Bumblebee is a car, he is spotless. Not a scratch on him. But when he is a robot he is battered and scratched (even the car parts). Good continuity there...not! <br/><br/>2. Rosie Doodad Whats-her-name cannot act and has lips that were so over-pumped I thought Bay was going to have them explode, too.<br/><br/>3. Building design has reached the stage where it is almost impossible to destroy a skyscraper, no matter how much abuse you subject it to.<br/><br/>4. Let's give our alien robots human-like traits and personalities, right down to ethnic accents. Because, like, you know all alien species develop like humans, right? <br/><br/>5. Planets that are teleported right next to each other won't cause the slightest gravitational disturbance, honest! <br/><br/>6. If in doubt, make cuts that make no sense and miss out vital bits of the story. Instead, leave in the bits that are totally pointless, like Sam's parents and the rubbish actress with rubber lips.<br/><br/>7. Chemistry. 5 year olds like Bay don't know much about that, which is why the pairing of La Bouef and Rubber Lips have none.<br/><br/>8. If in doubt, explosions! People love explosions! Explosions for two hours! No plot or meaningful dialogue, just explosions! <br/><br/>9. Bumblebee's speech processor...they still haven't fixed it after three movies. Just what kind of highly ""advanced"" alien robots are these that they can't fix that? <br/><br/>10. Tomahawk cruise missiles...can apparently be used to target aerial combatants. No, seriously! It's in the movie! It must be true.<br/><br/>11. No, that's enough. My brain is reaching meltdown. I can't type any more.<br/><br/>Needless to say, if you're bored enough to risk watching this...DON'T! If you're that bored then watching this will KILL you! It's totally mind-numbing and tedious. Suitable only for those with exceedingly low expectations and even lower IQ's.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Dull, 45 minutes too long, a terrible assault on the senses and the intelligence. There, I've warned you...don't come crying to me when you have an aneurysm from watching it."

I didn't feel that the new chic was the best looking match for Shia and to not to have a continuous story as to why is confusing. Story line wasn't as interesting as I anticipated too.

"XweAponX","Null","2","6","29 September 2011"," ""Down in Flames""
","I'll say this about Michael Bay, he can handle Action and Suspense like no other director since Hitchcock. And Just like Hitchcock, he gets a little over-ambitious sometimes.<br/><br/>In this very ambitious third installment of the Transformers Saga, Bay literally ""Reaches for the Moon"" - Someone else commented that this film is riddled with clichés, but I say the clichés are turned on their ear. This film starts out with Documentary style filming, combining ""News Footage"" scenes with ""Live-Action"", first-person footage (If you can call the CGI here, which is very photorealistic, ""Live Action""). The inclusion of real-life footage of Kennedy mixed with a pretty convincing lookalike filmed in Black and White Video style *almost* had me believing that it was really Kennedy in all of the scenes- ""Almost"" - Because the final cameo of ""Kennedy"" has a different angle, and in colour, and at that point, the differences are apparent with the lookalike actor.<br/><br/>Although the story told here does not quite match the story that has been told in the first two films, it is still a very good story: ""Down in Flames"" - Bay cannot now back up and make any new Transformers films, he has destroyed his world, literally. And so I am expecting that, this film is the last film of the Franchise, if more Transformers films are made, some serious ""Rebooting"" will have to be done.<br/><br/>This film loses ""Mikaela Banes"" (Megan Fox) and 'gains' ""Carly Spencer"" (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) - Which from the start is a total loss, as the ""Mikeala"" character had been developed from the beginning, this ""new chick"" is dumped on us and we are supposed to believe that Whitwhickey has developed a relationship that rivals his earlier association with Ms Fox. No - It does not work, and Sam Whitwhickey's puerile salivatings and palpitations and teenage jealousy rages are just not believable, the character Carly is simply not believable, she's a card-bored cutout. As a real actress and woman and most importantly high-style Fashion Model, she works VERY well, I believe THAT. But in this film, I do not believe HER. Mikaela, on the other hand, was shown as a talented and gifted Mechanic- That I believed.<br/><br/>So from the moment Spencer walks up the steps in first-time reveal, on tip-toe even, the average viewer might go ""Oh Come On"" with in-credulousness... Incredibility? Disbelief maybe. Personally, I DO NOT believe that a chick like that would ever be interested in pimply-faced Shia Lebouf. But I can suspend that a bit cos of *my* ex gf's<br/><br/>So with my only spoiler of this review over with, I can get into the way this film looks, mostly happening in ""Washington DC"" and ""Chicago"" -And on the Dark Side of the Moon, I believed THIS. The first time we see an Autobot, one of the little guys, I'm still not sure what they were called, and then later as we see the Autobots on various missions, the transformations are better, the overall look of the Autobots are better, the CGI is very very good... This is why I gave this film a ""9"" - It would have been a ""10"" if not for the female-lead change.<br/><br/>Excellent performances here from John Turturro, Frances McDormand, ""General Glenn Morshower"" (Who I think lately is always a character named Morshower in his latest films), Alan Tudyk, John Malkovich, and even Shia LaBeouf - Plus the return of Tyrese Gibson as ""Epps"" which makes this his reunion with ""Lennox"" (Josh Duhamel), makes this a great ""Mega-Ensemble"" cast. And Leonard Nimoy who just had to be given lines referring to things Spock said in ""Star Treck"" - That was another mistake, but mostly he plays his character well, as do all of the Autobots and Decepticons.<br/><br/>This film is just too overwhelming. There is no relief, no space to relax, this film is a juggernaut- It plows over you. Some of the editing is confusing, mostly it adds to the very rapid pace of the film. (And I have said this before and will probably say it again}: Too Much ""Future Shock"" - Enough to kill 1,000,000 Alvin Tofflers.<br/><br/>But despite the changes in female lead and other small inconveniences, this film is a warp-15 thrill ride, I was wholly exhausted after watching it, especially the final ⅓rd of the film. For those who like massive mechanical destruction on a scale that makes Brobdingnagian look like Microscopic, insane stunts that no human could possibly perform (but they did), well then this is for you.<br/><br/>It's just Mindless Entertainment, insanity on a galactic scale, and the warping of not only time and space, but of our minds as well. Michael Bay has come a very very long way, parsecs, light years, from ""Bad Boys""."
"lotharofthehillpeople420","Null","2","6","25 September 2011"," If you spent $24 seeing this trilogy, you should ask for $16 back
","This movie was not good.<br/><br/>Tons of posturing. If you want to see scenes of the actors standing just right, this movie is packed with meaningless shots that look great. The one that put it over the edge was with the replacement to Megan Fox. The new girl was standing there with explosions behind her and a car flipped over. She blinked, but other than that there was nothing. However, from this she moment, we can make the connection that she went on to manipulate Megatron into action, which means she actually saved the day. During a literally explosive situation, this girl did two things: thought up a plan and looked nonchalantly amazing while doing it.<br/><br/>Difficult to follow action sequences. The fight sequences were like watching spaghetti get tangled around itself and other noodle in a thick, rich soup of tomato sauce. Putting it in slow motion, ""it"" being punches that blast robots apart or transformations from and to car form, did not make for good entertainment. If you did not get enough slow motion transforming in either of the first two movies, this may be your fix.<br/><br/>And, a tired franchise. Belligerent Sam. Boring/cliché jokes.<br/><br/>Energon detectors. Autobots doing the dirty work of the US government. Going to the moon only to peep aliens. Sam lands another model grade girl friend.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams, Mike Bay, and Jerry Brukhimer, love to take kind of controversial topics and use them as a platform. I cannot wait until one of these guys gets hold of a script about Christopher Columbus just to see how he gets into the minds of pre-teens, high-schoolers, and other impressionable demographics. Maybe they'll think up that Columbus left Europe to flee the zombie hordes only to discover an alien race building hydro electric dams on the bottom of the ocean and enslaving sea horse to carry the electricity on saddles made of silver to power a matter altering camera which would be meant to destroy humanity at a point just before it became to powerful to match, only find out they were too late; the humans were already too powerful because of their will to live, love, endure, and make movies about it.<br/><br/>Sam Whitwhicky had something funny about him in the first film. When Megan Fox was in his bedroom in the 1st movie and he had to deal with his parents, that was funny. But he grew quick tempered. His belligerence grew to be pretty excessive by the second movie, and in this one, he would have been tazed by any normal law enforcement agent with a zapper.<br/><br/>The over use of mini Autobots as a source of humor is akin to the Star Wars prequels using Jar Jar Binxs as a source of humor. Mildly amusing at first, but not enough to last for parts 2 and 3, for almost 5 hours. And, the minor character jokes get rehashed, too. The fat guy doing donut jokes was funny in the first one, by now all the jokes were forced and weak.<br/><br/>ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, sorry to ALL CAP, but this was mostly a nag so far, the brutality was great. I do not like on screen violence, so the humans being evaporated is not what I liked. Rather, it was some of the robot deaths that were pretty good. When you know a bad guy has got it coming and he only bleeds out -- that is not as satisfying as seeing his robot skull being taken apart. Plus, Optimus leveled the boom on some bad guys and the degree that he kicked butt had good ""Wow"" factor.<br/><br/>All in all, a less than average movie. What started as a good series should have stopped after number 1 and stayed in the realm of imagination or comic books. However, the money it pulled in for the movie company must have worth it for them, this site reported an income of over $1 billion, and that is what they they are in the business for."

","Transformers: Dark of the Moon starts with a short story introduction. And already the introduction lets me dislike Shia LaBeouf again, with his rudimentary, not believable acting and those banal dialogs. I also preferred watching Megan Fox a lot more than Whiteley, because Whiteley is not really able, during the whole movie, to contribute something to the show. Acting and speaking is not her thing and maybe it is not even wanted, so she just tries to look good, but even in only good looking she cannot even get close to Magan Fox performances.<br/><br/>The action scenes are nice designed and well presented, but half of them were just annoying. I really do not like when people scream the whole time in action movies. It lets me feel i am watching a catastrophic or drama movie, in which all people are screaming, talk in platitudes and acting foolish. And at least for 30min in the middle of the movie it would be better to turn off the sound, because in this time there is no soundtrack playing and no exciting special effects sound, there is just screaming, and mostly from Shia LaBeouf.<br/><br/>Finally i liked some scenes in the end battle, but it does not really help the movie in the overall performance. I missed here some story and action feeling. I guess it would have been better for the movie, when there were more stories and scenes about the Transformers and a lot less about sissy Shia LaBeouf."

","This is the best Transformers yet. I really enjoyed the first, was okay with the second, blown away by the third. The cast seems to have really enjoyed working together and every scene comes out great. I was impressed with the casting. Leonard Nimoy follows his Star Trek role with another great performance. Frances McDormand is funny, tough and cool headed and she owns every scene she is in. Shia LeBeouf plays the frustrated, under estimated hero perfectly. I was disappointed in his Indiana Jones performance. He has redeemed himself. John Turturro in a welcome return, gets to play it over the top, without overdoing it.<br/><br/>Giving the Transformers even more humanistic traits and appearances made the characters/personalities really come across. This is hampered by having them speak with distinct international accents. Are we to believe that alien robotic life forms would build a robotic planet as one race but develop different accents and dialects? It just doesn't fit for me, but I can live with it.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were a so overdone in the second, you couldn't follow the action. That is not the case this time around. <br/><br/>The story line is great. Mixing history with fiction, was a terrific idea and the melding of archival footage with new actors was very well done reminiscent of Forest Gump).

","The final Transformers film Dark of the Moon was no disappointment where action and adventure were concerned, although I must say I thought it to be rather lengthy. I was most impressed by the way history was so eloquently woven into the story, some Forest Gump-like effects were at work, but well done just the same. I have to say that the Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeof) transformation was just as noteworthy as that of the hasbro characters, he has grown up in this role and wears manhood well. He now has a new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whitely), who I have absolutely nothing against it just felt like the final matrix when the Oracle was replaced. There were some lines to explain the new girl, and maybe that did it for everyone else, but I missed and prefer Mikeala (Megan Fox). And that's as much as I will say about that. There were some new characters added to the list of humans and to the Transformers, most noteworthy on the human side was Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who was a complete surprise, even with a luminescent smile and an extremely well groomed exterior he was so unlikeable. I liked the fact that this time around a woman was running things, Mearing (Frances McDormand), I did not like the fact that she was so inept at it. Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) was a cool addition to the Transformers as the former Autobot leader now resurrected. I wondered which came first the homage to Star Trek and then he was cast or if Nimoy was cast and that prompted the homage. This film had some of the best CGI imaginable, but where the special effects were concerned they actually paled to the flying squirrel scenes, those were awesome! There were a lot of exceptional autobot versus decepticon fight scenes, and I must say that Battle: Chicago, was so much better than Battle: LA. All I want to know is when will D-Town get its turn at being digitally pulverized. Our metroplex has some great landmarks that can be torn apart, like the Electric Moon, the rocket shaped building, the green lined building, the AA center and certainly the Cowboys stadium. I want to be able to sit in the theater and say, I was at a game there or I ate there or I used to work there. Since no more Transformers are on the horizon, maybe Dallas will get its turn when giant mutant armadillos roll in.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon manages the seemingly impossible task of being a film nearly three hours long that manages to move along with a plot so apathetic and piecemeal for that long, without giving the slightest suggestion that it does anything close to engaging you or holding your attention until all the big action starts and everything starts blowing up at the end. Like being told of The Promised Land and having faith until the big pay off comes, it has what can barely described as a 'story' (especially by someone not bowled over by the first two films) that after a hard day I have neither the time nor the inclination to describe.<br/><br/>""In the beginning, we were a peaceful race of mechanical beings..."" From the off set, the serious attempts at dialogue serve as an indication of the unintentional laughs that are to follow, which are some of the few high points of forcing yourself to slog through this unthinkable third part of the soulless modern day Transformers franchise (but as long as they're making money, right?) Once again the script writers manage to get it all wrong, delivering characters that never come off as real people and dialogue and situations that sound even faker and less likely to happen. I said in my recent Wall Street 2 review that it would be better if Shia LeBeouf was in another Transformers film, well here he is, as bland and lifeless as the last two times, just one of quite a few actors failing to deliver rubies when handed pearls. Respectable, established actors like John Malkovich and Frances McDormand pop up in secondary roles, obviously trying to keep their dignity and not get dragged down with everything else but both really should have known better.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I have no right to complain about any of this, as I expected no less, but I had expected good stuff from what the film had been sold on, the special effects and in particular, what some had described as 'the greatest action sequences ever recorded to film' at the end, but even these I found to be under-whelming. Maybe I'd had enough of the relentless onslaught of mediocrity before it, or maybe there's nothing that can impress me any more, but it was the final part of what, like the last two films, had been a complete waste of my time. **"
"estebangonzalez10","Null","2","6","26 July 2011"," Where is Bay trying to go with this franchise?
","¨You may lose faith in us, but never in yourselves¨<br/><br/>Somehow after the third Transformers film I have managed to lose my faith in the highly successful blockbuster director Michael Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger who have turned one of my favorite cartoons into a terrible franchise. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first Transformers and thought it was awesome to see those characters brought to the big screen, but the sequels just haven't managed to live up to expectations and my faith in the series is long lost. As Optimus Prime states, at least I haven't managed to lose my faith in myself. The special effects are extraordinary and we get plenty of action, but there is no character development whatsoever. The movie is exceedingly long (over two and a half hours) and not even with all that extra time do we get to see some character development. The final showdown is also extremely long, but I guess action fans won't be disappointed because they get a lot of excellent fights and cool visuals. As for me, I would have liked a better story with more character development. I could have also used a bit more comedy; the jokes just get old after three films and I would've really enjoyed something fresh and original in the series instead of relying on John Turturro all over again for the funniest moments. There are some new additions to the franchise, some interesting actors, but none of them are enough to save the franchise. Transformers is one of those movies that is extremely loud and makes a lot of noise, but really never ends up saying anything at all.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is back again to save the world for a third time from the Decepticons, although this time he has a new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). He meets her at the White House after receiving a medal of honor from president Obama. Sam is out of college, but is having trouble finding a job, although he is living with Carly who is doing well at her new job working as an assistant for a rich man named Dylan (Patrick Dempsey). On the meantime, the Autobots are helping humans maintain peace between them while the Decepticons remain silent. Lennox (Josh Duhamel), who works with the Autobots, receives a call from Ukraine saying that they have found some form of alien life at a former radiation plant. The Decepticons seem to be searching for something and the answers can be found in the past: they have to do with man's first arrival at the moon. A few select men at NASA have been hiding some key information about what really was hidden at the dark side of the moon: a Cybertronian spacecraft containing some dark secrets. Both Decepticons and Autobots begin a race to uncover this secret that could threaten life on Earth. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, and the rest of the Autobots are back along with some new ones, while Megatron leads the Decepticon's new army. There are some plot twists so I do not want to give too much of it away, but the main focus of the film is almost entirely on the action and the almost hour long destruction of Chicago.<br/><br/>In this third film we discover that Optimus Prime isn't the last remaining Prime after all since Sentinel Prime has been unconscious in the dark side of the moon during all these years. When Optimus Prime finds him he revives him with the Matrix; but Sentinel isn't the only new character in this film, we also have Frances McDormand as Chief Mearing in charge of the NEST operation, the funny Ken Jeong as Jerry Wang, Sam's co-worker who might know what NASA was hiding doing the trip to the moon, there is also John Malkovich as Sam's new boss, and then there is Alan Tudyk as the Dutch who is Simmons's personal assistant. Even though we have all these new characters (remember I also mentioned Carly who replaced Megan Fox, and her boss Dylan) the film still seems more of the same and lacks freshness and originality. None of these characters were able to bring something new to the franchise because the script was mediocre and the film relied solely on the spectacular visuals and action scenes. Much of what Michael Bay puts on film is eye-candy, that is the reason he brought Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to replace Fox as she isn't much of an actress, but she is just as hot as Fox. I just wished Bay spent the same amount of time he does on the action scenes with the screenplay. The 3D visuals work really well in this film, especially with the action scenes and the destruction of Chicago, but the movie just felt way too long in my opinion. I'm also tired of the open ended finales which suggest there might be another sequel on the way, and wish they just brought closure to the Transformers franchise<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

There are many places where they could have shot it in awesome 3D. But they decide to do it the TRON legacy way. And it lacks in what the other two parts have in their script. Soul. Without it its just a movie which looks like action sequences taken from other movie. But i liked it. hardcore action. if you like the games halo call of duty or even grand theft auto this is the perfect movie for your popcorn entertainer. the transformers series should definitely continue. But i just hope that transformers 4 is not in 4D or else the seats will be moving so much that people might just fly of. and don't watch it for the story watch it for the special effects and mind blowing action."
"Starlitelet","5","2","6","20 July 2011"," How about an explosion here? No, how about everywhere?
","I was eager to see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, but there were no more seats left so I decided to go see Transformers: Dark of the Moon (TDotM). My brother went with several of his friends and said it was a good film, like somewhere along the line of Fast Five or Thor.<br/><br/>After giving Transformers a chance, hoping that it would live up to the first movie of its franchise, it disappointed me TERRIBLY. The third instalment is nowhere near as good as Fast Five or Thor, let alone the first Transformers. Even though, I can't compare it to Thor, I definitely felt more entertained with Thor than TDotM. The funny part is that I was yearning for more action sequences in Thor, whereas in TDotM, I was wishing for less. The action sequences could have been replaced with a decent story line or better dialogues near the end (that would be a miracle because the first half of the film was tremendously terrible due to the corny/cheesy wannabe funny dialogues with redundant/idiotic characters). Now, by comparing Fast Five and TDotM, there were some similar elements. Both movies definitely were aimed to attract teenage boys. There were hot girls, awesome cars, unrealistic/exaggerated moments and manly underdogs. Nevertheless, Fast Five was a much more entertaining movie with a good plot development and just the right amount of action.<br/><br/>Acting: Shia LaBoeuf's acting was the only one that stood out. I always liked him as an actor because he carries a lot of emotion and heart into his movies. He knows when to act serious and when to add in a sense of humour. Michael Bay obviously abused LaBoeuf's strong points and made his character Sam seem dull by the third instalment. In this third movie, LaBoeuf is a teenager who must speak super fast, while stuttering. I don't know how he does it, but I'm surprised he didn't get a spasm yet. So if LaBeouf's acting was mediocre in this movie and he's known as a good actor IMO, then the rest of the cast is pretty abysmal or unnecessary. <br/><br/>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (RHW) who replaces Megan Fox does a decent job for her first movie role. Though, she still doesn't do anything except wearing mini dresses and high heels with her natural pouty lips. She looks like a living Barbie doll, not that I'm complaining, but she seems oddly misplaced in the movie. I don't really appreciate Megan Fox and her acting, but I have to say that I prefer Mikaela compared to Carly because I feel that no matter how RHW acts, she gives off the Victoria Secret Model aura. <br/><br/>The rest of the casts were pretty much useless and they just did what they Were supposed to do, which was basically being useless.<br/><br/>4.5/10 <br/><br/>Storyline: I don't even know where to start. It was horrible. Bay tried to incorporate historic details along with military issues that I felt like it bombed the movie because of the way he wanted to make his viewers believe that it would be a great movie revolved around that. When I was watching the movie, I felt like I was watching separate clips mashed up together. I believe the reason why I liked the first Transformers was because they didn't delve into the history and military business. In fact, they added more sentient robots to the point where you don't care if one of them dies because there's always another one that pops up randomly.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was not needed. If Bay was going to focus on the action sequences, he might as well left out the beginning. The parents were not required at all. They used to be funny in the first instalment, but now they've been long butchered. Carly wasn't needed just because Mikaela left Sam. Though, you can definitely tell why Bay needs her in his movie. The stereotypical Asian dude was horrific that I rolled my eyes. He wasn't funny, but rather disturbing! Also Simmons and Bruce are similar characters. Why not just cancel one of them or both of them? Dylan was also a random character. He was misplaced and I'm sure any human would be smarter than to side with those huge robots that can crush them at any instant. <br/><br/>I didn't find any correlations between these characters that would lead up to the climax. Besides, where was the climax? I didn't even know where the halfway point of the movie was because the story all seemed very monotonous. <br/><br/>Overall, the beginning, the middle, and the ending were HORRIBLE.<br/><br/>1/10<br/><br/>Special Effects: Without a doubt, amazing and that was the reason why I gave it a chance.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Entertainment: Till now I don't know how much I was actually entertained because it didn't feel like a normal movie, but just a bunch of spectacles. The last 40 minutes was action packed and very well done. Though, it left me voided. I didn't feel anything. The action was supposed to fill up the void, but sadly it didn't. Don't get me wrong, I was entertained at first, but after around 25 minutes into the action part which was supposed to be epic, I saw that Bay just added an explosion after an explosion in random areas or anywhere he could. It felt like going into a firework hoping to see huge ones that will surprise you. Eventually, you see those huge ones that surprise you and you tell yourself it's worth your ticket or your time; though it keeps on shooting huge ones without a pattern to the point where you don't care anymore. It's just a random blotch of huge fireworks. That's exactly how Transformers made me feel like. <br/><br/>6/10"

","I went into this film, hoping for all sorts of pleasures for my eyes. This film did not disappoint, however everything else ruined my overall experience.<br/><br/>Start with the good - CGI and action scene...beautiful and extremely engrossing....thats it!<br/><br/>Finish with the bad - Story....non existent, this film seems to be just patched up together with no real idea of where it is going. For most of this film I was wondering what the hell is going on! The script is awful awful awful! I do not know who wrote this script, but they need to grab their P45! The new girl....oh dear lord where was she found?? I know she is an ex Victoria Secret model, but may I suggest that she does not give up the day job! She is terrible!! Cannot act, and most the camera angles are firmly pointed at either her ass, boobs or midrift. The few lines of dialogue she does have are just so terrible you have to pinch yourself that you are watching a multi million dollar Hollywood film. She is awful, I cannot emphasise this enough!<br/><br/>Generally speaking, I could have spent my £5 and 2 1/2 hours of my life much better! Thankyou Michael Bay, you have destroyed this great franchise!"

","We loved the movie but their were many unanswered questions? What about Machaila. Who is the new girl with the fake lips and poor acting skills. Other than a shot-tie exchange of female key actresses, the action was fantastic. Their are a couple of scenes showing action in slow motion with the new girl and her lips look horrible, eyes seem to be sunken in and she was way to tall for the kid. Why was she always wearing white and High Heels???? Really!!! The shift in the plot and graphics...WOW...my wife even got into it.

","None of the transformers movies have been all that good, but this one is the worst. Even the CGI (which up to this point was pretty good) is bad, there were scenes where I felt like I could see where the green screen was. The frustrating part of it is that you can see the potential of this series, the transforming robots are cool and the comic book story behind it is interesting. But other than the robots everything else in the movies is total crap. Cliché after cliché and the girl they have playing Sam's girlfriend is totally useless, she is nothing but eye candy the whole movie and then at the end they give her a few lines to try and make her character matter. Another thing that angered me was the lines they give the robots, why are they all using slang? They are a millions year old race of robots and they use our slang? But I think that sums up the problem with this movie, Michael Bay took a good story and changed it into a stupid pop culture music video. Also, I am waiting for him to make a movie where all people do is get out of cars, apparently his signature scene. I also hated the Star Trek line they threw in at the end. This is more than just a bad movie, its an insult to movie goers, Michael Bay is telling us this is what you like. I hate myself for going to see this movie, but I am a sucker for the blockbuster and so I found myself sitting in the theatre wringing my hands. I would love to see Christopher Nolans take on this story, not sure if this is his style but at least he would spend more than 10 minutes writing the story."
"peeky1","Null","2","6","16 July 2011"," a truly bad film
","All in all, a terrible movie which stinks due to no creativity, a lack of understanding of the laws of physics, woefully hammy acting, over use of close ups and shaky cam, a gimmicky sound track and some badly designed robots. I feel for all you parents out there who have just had to pay out ridiculous prices for tickets for your kids to go and watch this film, which in a nut shell is the exact same film as the last two. With few exceptions, a new love interest who looks oddly like a duck, acts like a duck and really has no place in this film, in fact most of the cast were just there as an after thought to try and salvage something from a badly written script. And an autobot that seemingly visited the SS Enterprise some time in the past, scanned and taking on the appearance of Spock. Bravo to the design team on that one..not! It seems like the industry are having one big laugh behind our backs. In fact, i'm going to terminate my post now as it's likely to become censored if I continue... if only we could rate stuff zero!.."

","As is with a Micheal Bay film, you can expect the story to be bad, and such is the case with this movie. Before I go on, I will say that this movie's story has less problems than that of Revenge of the Fallen, but that's not saying much. I won't go into the problems with the story, as other users have listed it's problems for me, but I will go into a plothole I noticed. At the 2-hour mark, the Autobots make a triumphant return, even though we saw them get blown up on a shuttle. ""How did they even survive?"", you wonder. They say they were never on the ship (CLICHE!). ""Then why did they hide, instead of helping get rid of the Decepticons?"" No answer, of course. Other than that and the other problems other users noticed, I will say the effects are great as always and the voice acting is decent. If you haven't seen the Transformers movies yet, I guess you can start with this one."

","The transformers franchise has always been one I've expected to involve great movies. Until now it has just scrapped through with the previous to movies, but the 3rd movie in the trilogy is average to say the least, if it were not for the amazing graphics i probably couldn't review it as i would have left (like i saw one or two people do) It is hard to watch Shia LeBeuof run around on screen for nearly 3 hours without wanting to bang your head against something.

"MovieProductions","Null","2","6","15 July 2011"," Bloated, overlong, messy, and that first half? Ugh
","** out of (****)<br/><br/>Walking into ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", you don't expect Oscar caliber or anything good for that matter. You go merely to see gratuitous explosions, an attractive love interest that's as hot as butter, and this time around, it's in 3D! I'm all up for leaving my brain at the door, but when you ask me to do that for nearly 3 hours, where I'm bored the hell out of my mind for 2/3 of that, you can count me out. The problem with ""Dark of the Moon"" isn't because of the story or acting (we expected that since day one), it's because it takes a millennium to get going, the action scenes are way too repetitive, and the resolution always leaves something to be desired. I sound like a bitter old man but in actuality, I'm in the demographic for this film. When Michael Bay puts some originality into his set pieces, takes out the convoluted and tiresome story arcs, and trims about an hour off of his movies, then he can give me a call.<br/><br/>See, that's also the problem. For these movies, the plot is always so long and details, but it goes nowhere and doesn't make any sense. It's a movie about robot vs. robot, can't we just leave it that way? We don't need a long, unnecessary explanation that serves as filler. That's why the whole first two acts suffered. Nothing interesting, nothing worth my time. It's just filler. And by the time the action rolled around, I just didn't care. It's almost as if Bay copied and pasted the action from his last film into this one. <br/><br/>As for the 3D? While I disliked the movie, I cannot deny it, it was worth it. The depth is just outstanding and the explosions have layers. It wasn't at Avatar's 3D brilliance, but oh boy, was it close enough. And the special effects? The robots look the best this time around and it shows Bay knows what he's doing. Too bad the action is repetitive and the film is a total bore.<br/><br/>While I've had my rant, I have to say, this wasn't the worst ""Transformers"" and was actually an improvement over part two. Less corny jokes (thank god!) and this time, we can actually SEE what's going on! <br/><br/>All in all, I didn't hate ""Dark of the Moon"". It could've been worse, but it could've been so much better. The day Bay makes a solid popcorn flick, I'll give his film a good review. Yes, your film doesn't always need to rely on story and development, but when you make trash, at least put some effort and excitement into it. When you have over-inflated trash, I don't care if I see it in 20D, it's just trash."

","I've given this a four as it has a lot to be commended, including some nice cast members, some great eye candy and some beautifully designed and rendered CG. I've seen a lot of criticism for Rosie Huntington-Whitely which I found a bit unfair. She is, to borrow the vernacular, 'smoking hot', but she also gave a credible performance. Sure, she won't be troubling the Academy next year, but this is a Blockbuster action flick, not Richard III.<br/><br/>But my problem with this film is that it's SO DULL! Non stop action isn't exciting for long - it gets tedious quickly. When this film reached it's natural set piece finale and it still had an hour to run I just got up and walked out, and that was the first time in my life I've ever done that.<br/><br/>I'm sure this movie could be saved with some ruthless editing. It could lose an hour. A whole hour. Comfortably."

It made you not gunning for part 3.<br/><br/>But Dark of the Moon surprised me, Michael Bay did a lot things right, the movie managed to use humor at the right time, and not all over the place like in Revenge of the Fallen. The effects are amazing, battle scenes are beyond epic. The acting was pretty good, except Shia LeBeuof overacted in a few scenes. Patrick Dempsey is good in his role. Rosie Huntington-Whitely is new to the cast, but after a few minutes of her being on screen, ya'll be like""MEGAN WHO"". Leonard Nimoy is good has the voice of Sentinal Prime.

"freemantle_uk","5","2","6","9 July 2011"," 'You may lose you faith in us'
","No Optimus, I don't have a problem with you, it is the way Michael Bay directs the films you are in I have lost faith in. After the mess that was Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, many people involved, including Bay and Shia LaBeouf admitting it was bad and wanted to make amends. Dark of the Moon is an obvious improvement on Revenge of the Fallen, but lacks the claim of the first film.<br/><br/>Starting with a montage of how the Space Race to the Moon between America and the Soviet Union was to get an alien spacecraft that crashed on the dark side of the Moon. Soon we discover that the Soviet tried to use Cyberonian technology that resulted into the Chernobyl meltdown. Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the Autobots bring back Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) and revive him. But more important Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) has a new British girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whitely) and is looking for a job, which he gets with a aerospace company lead by John Malkovich. On the Deceptions front they are killing humans that worked for them and trying to revive all of the Autobots Pillars to make a sky bridge and turn Earth into a new Cybertron: sounding very much like a plot from a two part episode of Doctor Who.<br/><br/>One of the first big improvements is the removable of the Twins, the two annoying, racial stereotypes who should have been given a unpleasant death. During Revenge of the Fallen I was pretty much cheering for the Deceptions to win, showing how much Bay failed with this 'lovely comic relief' characters! Megan Fox is also gone because we all know of the aftermath of calling Bay, Hitler. Huntington-Whitely replaces her and Bay showing that Transformers does not need actors. Huntington-Whitely's performance has been criticised but I personally thought she was passable. She is better then Fox who is a really bad actress and her character is more charming and likable, but at the same time not going to win over feminists because Bay leers over Huntington-Whitely's body and she is just a damsel in distress. The comedy is toned down and the plot is a little more focused. The other new feature is 3D, Bay being won over to shoot the film with the technology. It has been called the best 3D since Avatar, Avatar still has the best 3D in a film so far. There were times in the film when it was not in 3D and the affect was pointless: it only really worked during the slow-mo scenes.<br/><br/>The action is really strong, shaky cam is not used as much and there are excellent set pieces, particularly with Optimus Prime using a sword and an axe. We do get robot on robot action and Bay's love for military porn. But like the previous films Bay focuses on the humans, the characters people do not care about. Optimus gets more screen time and you got to love it when he kicks butt. But the film suffers when he is not around and like during the Battle of Chicago he does not have that big a role and Bay focuses on the soldiers and even when Optimus is in the middle of a big fight Bay makes as watch LaBeouf in a fist fight. Like the previous two films the special effects are excellent and Steve Jablonsky does give a great score, obviously influenced by Inception.<br/><br/>Bay also still sees the need to have bad comedy, whether it is in the form of annoying and pointless characters like Wheelie and Brains, or Ken Jeung role as a guy who worked with the Deceptions and ends up being made out to be a strange weirdo, ending up with a gay joke, oh high class wit. I would have made Transformers to be a little more light-hearted and tongue in cheek, but still pretty serious, Spider-man and Iron Man would have been great models to follow. Dark of the Moon is too long and should have been a fun two hour film, it focuses on a human characters too much, including a boring and unfunny montage of Sam going to job interviews. Many scenes could have been cut out. I also have a problem with the swearing because a lot of families went to see it and the film did use strong language. Compare it to other PG-13/12A releases like the new Batmans, the X-Men series, the new Bonds, etc, swearing is toned down and kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand was a fine addition as the Director of NEST and John Turturro is a lot less annoying as Agent Simmons, given a more serious role. But the role of Shockwave was marketed as if he was going to be the main bad guy, but Dark of the Moon suffers the 'Angel' like X-Men: the Last Stand did, making a character has a bigger role then they really did.<br/><br/>To me Dark of the Moon felt like a end of a trilogy and I would not be surprised if the series has a mini-reboot. If it does I hope the filmmakers make the Autobots the main characters and the humans as support, not the other way round. If Dark of the Moon was the sequel after the first film I properly be a lot more positive towards it. The action is fun, it is escapism, but there are too many problems."
"thale05","5","2","6","8 July 2011"," You Can Forgive Bay for Revenge of the Fallen
","I came out of the theater, after watching ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon (DOTM)"" in 3D, feeling torn between the greatness and badness of the movie. This third installment outdoes ""Revenge of the Fallen (ROTF)"" but it never surpasses the grandness of the first ""Transformers"". It ends Michael Bay's successful series on an assuring note, leaving no potential possibility of a sequel; rather, it leaves a sense of satisfaction for wrapping up any loose ends.<br/><br/>The plot is much simpler than ""ROTF"" but it is still complex to follow compared to ""Transformers"". The background centers on the American-Soviet race to the moon. The American government, unbeknownst to the public, sends Apollo 11 to investigate alien wreckage on the dark side of the moon which turns out to be a ship from the robot planet Cybertron. In the present day, the Autobots learn of the secret mission and discover that the ship holds pieces to a weapon used to teleport matter between two points through a space bridge. The U.S. National Intelligence Director (played by Frances McDormand) fears its use as a means to invade Earth and the Autobots feel betrayed by humans who promised to share information so a mutual distrust ensues. Elsewhere, the Decepticons collaborate with certain humans to eliminate individuals involved in the space program and plot to invade Earth again. As all of this continues, we periodically follow Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf) struggling with two things: a relationship with a new girl (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and the search for a job. But, once again, he is going to be part of this war and fight for the survival of his planet.<br/><br/>In an interview with USA Today, Michael Bay promised to trim the ""dorky comedy"" including the twin ghetto robots (Mudflap and Skids) and make the third film darker. He keeps his word, for the most part, by showing more death and destruction than his previous works combined. Bay has the power to make his scenes emotional when he gives it his all yet he gives ""DOTM"" too little dosage of that power. There is enough to get people caring but not to the point where they succumb to grief and despair over hurt or loss like in ""The Rock"" shower room sequence. The slapstick nature that haunted ""ROTF"" has been cut massively in ""DOTM"" in favor of Bay's routine commercial comedy. I have to confess something; while a lot of people say Bay's sense of humor is overdone or foolish, I find it strangely entertaining. The comedy pays off with funny (even if goofy) dialogue and surprise cameos; however, all pale in comparison to the secret weapon: Ken Jeong. The man has officially become a sensation and now he serves as the secondary comic relief. He delivers the bulk of the commercial comedy and is gut-wrenchingly hysterical. I say ""Kudos"" to Bay and writer Ehren Kruger for being more certain of this movie's direction than in ""ROTF"".<br/><br/>""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a 3D visual fiesta for the audience and I think they will get their money's worth with the glasses. Debris, people, and robots fly through the third dimension for an experience unfelt since ""Avatar"". The action scenes, patched with slow-motion instances, still command the screen with awesome spectacle even if they don't quite take the breath away the way ""Transformers"" did. The transformations are fun to watch while Bay's explosions are less wild than before. Cinematography and sound are at the top of their game; it wouldn't surprise me if they, along with the visual effects, are nominated for Oscars.<br/><br/>The robots are treated with more respect this time around: Optimus Prime has a bigger role, Megatron reveals his fears and dismay, the miniature Wheelie and his new partner Brains are not mere merchandise for kids, and there are no gargantuan robot balls clanking anywhere. Several new robots make their debut such as Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), a bird-like cyborg called Laserbeak who serves Megatron, and the Decepticon Shockwave who controls a snake-like machine for transportation and decimation. As the robots have become leaner, the fighting, especially in the long climax, has become more brutal and violent. The robots are definitely revamped although one of the main problems of ""DOTM"" is its lag from peculiar human characters.<br/><br/>Acting was never a great strength in the ""Transformers"" trilogy and it is not significantly good in ""DOTM"". Shia LaBeouf gives one of the most weird, bipolar performances of his career. In some scenes, he angrily freaks out, an unusual mood swing from his likable, humble side; it's a strange case of role reversal. On a more positive note, Ehren Kruger's script gives Shia's character into his doubts and troubles, enough to create a substantial protagonist. Newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a terrible actress and I abhor saying it. Of all the actresses out there, she is the one selected to replace Megan Fox. Although Fox may have underperformed her role in the first two movies, she is much more realistic and alive than Rosie. Almost all of the supporting actors behave childishly from John Malkovich to John Turturro with a few exceptions including Frances McDormand and Patrick Dempsey. Sadly, both of these fine actors failed to give ideal characteristics to their roles: Dempsey should have had a more tough personality whereas McDormand could have hinted a slight fragility in her strong character like she did in ""Fargo"".<br/><br/>Do not let my final rating discourage you from seeing ""DOTM""; it is only my individual opinion of the entire movie as a whole. Nevertheless, ""DOTM"" is destined to be a mega hit in the box office and a standout summer blockbuster. If you wish to see jaw-dropping action, you found the right film. If you prepare in advance to follow a hard story, you will probably have an even greater time. If you want to have fun, simply have fun! My Rating: 5/10"

","First of all, for everyone giving this a bad review, you knew you were going to a Michael Bay movie did you not? Michael Bay is a grown up child with a creative imagination, and indisputably, a very hard work ethic. He makes movies to entertain, and knows what every male wants to see: action, sex, humor, action, action, and more action, and knows how to deliver those in a solid manner. With blood pumping entertainment and orgasms for your eyes. Some may complain this movie has too much visual flare for your brain to process, even more so in 3d, but this has set a new bar in the eyegasm genre, and it's damn entertaining to watch. And that is what we go to movies for is it not? To be entertained? What he does NOT always do sometimes, just like many film artists, is make movies with an outstanding plot or outstanding actors. Does he have the potential? Absolutely. Does he try his best? Of course. But his specialty is fun for the audience and damn good entertainment.<br/><br/>Bottom Line is, this movie is entertaining, from the visual and audio effects alone, regardless of plot or acting. If you were disappointed in those two and it ruined the movie for you, I'm sorry. I personally thought the plot and acting were good, not amazing, but good enough in the package, it was enjoyable for me, and if you go to movies to be entertained and can look past your pet expectations of amazing plot(It's not exactly easy to pull S7vens and Shaw-shank Redemption's out of a hat) THEN GO SEE THIS MOVIE.

After the critical failure of the second installment, Michael Bay vowed to make a much better film, and he did just that. Now, being better than the second film is like saying this rotten egg tastes much better than this dung pile. The movie was overall enjoyable, but was extremely long (2 hours 45 minutes). <br/><br/>A lot of the movie could have been cut out, and a lot more action could have been put in. The first hour and forty minutes is filled with very stupid humor, and very unimportant things, like Sam Witwicky's job. In addition to all of this, a lot of random actors get thrown in for a dose of star power (I'm looking at you Ken Jeoung. ) If they had cut all of that out, and put a little more needed action into the film, it would have made the movie about two hours long, and much more manageable. <br/><br/>Transformers was also lacking what it was supposed to excel in: action. There were only two memorable parts of the film, and they were about five minutes long each. If Michael Bay had added more action, it would have made the film much more balanced, and much more watchable."

"vladimirtumbev","10","2","6","7 July 2011"," Perfect Movie, for people with hearts.
","I read a lot of reviews on the movie and I would have to say, people you have no hearts. Most of the people that wrote the review seem like (I have this mental picture) they had a notepad and a pen while watching the movie to write down what they believed was not good enough or could make them shine on the review section. With all do respect, people you need to saver and enjoy the moments. The movie revolves about the love and nostalgy of the robots, the final battle started in 2007 and just 2+ hours of pure fun and amazement filled with effects and actions. You can find bad comments and reviews on ANY movie. Look at it this way. Optimus was as great as ever, heroic, brave and for not imbalanced (had a stronger enemy). Autobots are dying, there is drama and so on and so forth. I also read a review by Mr.Roger Ebert posted in the Chicago Sun-Times. I remember him saying, that he would not care about Optimus Prime if it was just him. Well to him and all the followers, that's where you are wrong. That's where this movie is not for you. I, for one, do not watch horror movies, because they provide no entertainment to me at all. If I sit down and write a review on a horror movie, I'll make your heads spin! Bottom line is, you should not write a review to a movie you dislike before you entered the cinema.<br/><br/>I'm trying to say, that this movie is an absolute 10 for any person that loves the Transformers Universe. Michael Bay is obviously a misunderstood director by many, but in my eyes, he gets you closer to the story of Transformers, than anyone or anything else. I do not picture this movie made by any other director! The 3D, the effects, the soundtrack, the passion and love towards the movie, actors (human and non) and their role in the movie, actually makes me a little bit sad that I'm not in it!<br/><br/>An Absolute 10! If you loved the idea behind the 1st Movie, you will most probably become a maniac about this one, like i did!<br/><br/>Worth every penny spent on it!"
"vsg07","5","2","6","7 July 2011"," Would have been something with a little bit of story in it.......
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Michael Bay's third time handling the world of Autobots and Decepticons with some humans thrown around in there. Once again, the story revolves around Decepticons trying to bring life to their barren planet Cybertron and guess what they need - cheap labor. I guess if pondered on, this film might bring a new meaning to the word Outsourced.<br/><br/>Anyways, once again Michael Bay tries to make a movie which could have been good and satisfying. Unfortunately, it's not.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is not good and this time there no attempts to hide it. Sentinel Prime is a good guy and somehow turns bad when he wakes up (he made a deal with Megatron some centuries ago). This was such a good plot that Michael couldn't wait to flaunt it and let everybody know that in the first half itself. Sometimes, I imagine what the result would have been if Sentinel had turned out evil in the last half. It would have been awesome. (of course the story would have been different but the idea is so enticing).<br/><br/>The direction is average. Michael has already proved that he is the Roland Emmerich equivalent - only he can direct much better fights. Shia LeBouf is okay and guess what this time Michael gave him a gun. Finally. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is Megan Fox' replacement but just not that good (Can anyone tell me if they were convinced of her having the guts and luck to talk to Megatron alone and walk away unhurt?). The robots as always were awesome and fight bigger than anything you can imagine.<br/><br/>Well, thats my take. The last thing I can say is whoever directs the next Transformers - Please let Michael Bay create the trailers because they are the only reason why this movie is said to be so awesome and good (in some cases)."
"darklydreamingrahu","8","2","6","7 July 2011"," The best in the series.
","I see a lot of reviews for this movie that are so overwhelmingly incomprehensible and juvenile that it makes me realize how true the statistics are about the education system in America. I promise to give you a sound and logical review for the new Transformers film.<br/><br/>In 2007, the world was blown away by Michael Bay's testosterone filled extravaganza - ""Transformers"". It was loud, over-the-top, and packed a heavy punch to the senses. What made it so special was the beautifully rendered action sequences, and the concepts behind them. This was Michael Bay being Michael Bay, and not giving a s**t what you thought about that. <br/><br/>Fast Forward to 2009. Bay releases one of the most commercially successful movies in box office history - ""Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen"". This time the critics were less accepting and universally bombed virtually every aspect of the film. I, along with most, agree that it was a step in the wrong direction for the Transformers franchise. While the action was stellar and even bigger than the first, key elements helped completely ruin the experience. The comedy was slapstick and stupid. The story was jumbled and incoherent. The finale was cliché and stale. Nevertheless, for Transformers fans it wasn't all terrible. The CGI was brilliant and the action was still breathtaking. <br/><br/>Now here we are in 2011 with the complete Transformers trilogy out in the world. ""Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon"" is the finest film in the series hands down. Gone is the poor slapstick humor asserting itself in the middle of our beautiful action scenes. It has been replaced with funny situational comedy and genuinely humorous anecdotes. The story is now coherent and easy to follow, and the characters (both bot and human) are well built and likable. The bots now share the film's universe on screen instead of overwhelm it. The action is as always intense and over the top. The finale is wonderful and intriguing and keeps you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat. Michael Bay has truly made this series his own and ended it with a loud and thunderous bang. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are an action fan then you will love this film. There's beautiful women, exotic cars, mass destruction, and gigantic robots that beat other's as**s in full 3d. There's conspiracy theories, government cover-ups, and huge military operations with equally awesome military equipment. There's heroes and enemies, betrayals and redemption. This is what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be. Go in, kick back, and enjoy the carnage! <br/><br/>As a lover of good action movies I must give this one a 8/10.<br/><br/>(Transformers - 7/10) <br/><br/>(Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen - 6/10)"
"gmarx-100-342061","6","2","6","7 July 2011"," The sad thing is . . .
","A lot has already been said about the movie, the actors, the excellent CGI, both the right and the wrong of it all . . . <br/><br/>I can't but think that, if nothing else, the movie - especially towards the end - clearly shows Michael Bay's complete and utter Transformers fatigue <br/><br/>In an obvious effort to prevent being pressured into doing Transformers 4 all the potentially central baddies are killed off one after the other, Starscream, Schockwave, Megatron, Sentinel Prime, each one dispatched messily and finally, with no possible chance of being brought back to life . . . <br/><br/>Does it mean the end of the franchise . . . I think not<br/><br/>If the trend of pushing a franchise to the utmost extreme of believability and the current fascination with ""how it all began"" bears out, I can see Transformers 4, The Prequel coming out in a year or two, with a convoluted plot line involving a manned space mission from earth ending up in a wormhole, being transported back to Cybertronian pre-history, just as the Decepticons start to rebel Imagine the prime who will become The Fallen getting hold of their ship, learning that Earth has a viable sun, deciding to spend all his efforts on coming here to establish a second Cybertron . . . <br/><br/>It could happen, right . . ."

"xPopDisasterx","8","2","6","6 July 2011"," Tons of Fun, Favorite of the ""series""
","If you're a fan of the cartoons, you'd probably enjoy this one. It took the story right out of the show with some modifications to work with the semi-continuity of the ""movie series."" (season one - see ""The Ultimate Doom - Parts 1,2,3). And honestly, anyone who looks at these films as a true trilogy probably isn't going to enjoy them. If you look at them as 3 different movies using the same universe and characters, it's a lot more fun. There were also some cool homages. (A scene where laser beak plays a part of the transformers song, a comment about ""this must be Japanese,"" introducing Carly, using more G1 characters, even the plot itself etc.) And despite all the cheesy comic relief (some of it wasn't all that bad and partly funny) and over-the-top typical Michael Bay shenanigans, the story and characters had more depth than I'm used to seeing from him. It actually felt like the film focused on the transformers and the autobot/decepticon conflict rather than the human stories, which was my biggest complaint with the first two films. (Transformers was never about Spike/Sam, but the robots themselves.) Of course the visuals were stunning and action sequences top-notch (we can always count on that from Bay).<br/><br/>I've read through about half the reviews here and am increasingly surprised at how ridiculous they are. First off - most of them seem to be written by people who AREN'T fans of the original cartoons. I've seen many nit-picking complaints about utterly and completely unimportant things. For instance - ""Optimus uses an axe? *RAGE* How retarded!!"" Umm, kid, I don't think you understand how warfare and weapons work. First of all, he had it in the show and it was BA. Secondly, different weapons have different purposes... that's right. Missiles and cannons and bombs are long range weapons meant to do damage to multiple targets. Melee weapons are for close quarters one-on-one (or in Optimus's case, one-on-six). And it doesn't matter how advanced your race is. The Autobots are outnumbered and have resorted to hit-and-run tactics, surprise attacks, etc. Their primary weapons should be melee weapons to quickly and quietly kill the opposition. But I digress. And the popular ""defying laws of gravity"" argument is trash. Who cares?! It really has no effect on the story. It was a super cool action sequence. And you can make complaints like that about virtually every action/sci-fi movie ever made! ""The acting is bad!"" Well, it is an action film based on toy robots... what were you expecting? Grammy-winning performances? Be realistic here. It's really not that terrible. The way these reviews are written, you'd think it was the 'cool, anti-culture thing to do' to bash this film and M. Bay. I really have no idea why they're so bad. It seems most people aren't even a little familiar with the source material as they describe ""these weird/bad-looking robots"" and summarize plot points. You should probably disregard most of them..."
"prashanta_guha","10","2","6","6 July 2011"," I never miss a chance to watch and review a Michael Bay movie
","I've always reviewed Michael Bay movies, because I've actually liked them. All of them. This is because I consider Michael to be among the top ranks of directors, at par with notable names of today, like Christopher Nolan etc. I believe everyone has an area of expertise. For Nolan, it's creating something which will utilise every single neuron in your brain, and you'll still probably not figure out the actual story or get confused in between. With Bay, it's creating ""awesome, mind-blowing"" scenes of mayhem, action, destruction, and larger-than-life CGI and VFX shots. Both are very good at it.<br/><br/>Like I've pointed out before, the Transformers movie DO have a story. The first one was excellent in all aspects. The second, a little bit disappointing (only on the story part), I'll admit, but then, that's the problem with most sequels isn't it. This one, the last one probably, had to go out with a bang, and that's exactly what it did, so I don't really get what people are complaining about.<br/><br/>The story is better than the second, though not quite up to the first; the IMAX-ready shots, complete with excellent animations of transformations and added VFX, CGI etc are again the USP of the movie; Shia, John, Josh, Patrick, Frances convincingly play their part; eye candy gets replaced by eye candy, so no complaints there. The 3D increases the viewing experience, but like the pioneer of 3D movies James Cameron said, it's always better to shoot in 3D with his Fusion camera rather than convert it later (makes a hell of a difference).<br/><br/>I again stress the fact that critics will do what they're meant to do - criticise. You want action, you go watch this movie, and you'll be surprised that that's not all there is to it. All in all, very entertaining, despite the run-time (all Michael Bay movies are long) and an IMAX 3D experience not to be missed."
"bogdinamita","9","2","6","6 July 2011"," Won't disappoint fans!
","Seriously, people trolling or lets just say pointing out the lacks of this movie forget it's a Michael Bay film. It's of the Transformers franchise.<br/><br/>Agreed, it has no redeeming plot, no storyline, it's exaggerated beyond words and acting sucks.<br/><br/>But people walking in the theaters for this movie don't expect any of that. They just want the 2 and something hours the movie runs to be in another world, to be kids again and enjoy the special effects. And boy they're in for a treat.<br/><br/>So I'm just saying, why not just like Transformers for what it is? A mindless action movie for the kids in us. And who expects drama or looks for plot-holes in a Michael Bay movie is in the wrong place. I think he deserves all respect for what he does well: special effects!<br/><br/>For the fans: it won't let you down!"
"kaporal-kriss","6","2","6","6 July 2011"," Can we have a reboot now?
","Hurrah! 3 transformers movies, and that third one is quite better then the precedent ( and since it was rise of the fallen was one of the worst movie of 2009, its was not very difficult to top). But here we are, it was a fun brainless ride and I really like it, mister Bay finally was able to create actions sequences that wasn't just scraps metals shaking on the screen. By making the Autobots in brighter colours the fight scene now make sense and are quite enjoyable, two or three time i just had to turn toward my girlfriend and exclaim, ''whoa! I just understand what happened!'' But it leave me a bit bitter.<br/><br/>It took me time to figure out what was so wrong with dark side of the moon (and the trilogy in general) and here goes, I wont rehash what have been said a thousand time about the bad script and mindless explosion, no, I will just say that Micheal Bay don't understand is source material but more importantly he got a lousy moral compass. We have a movie where heroes (yes, the heroes) MUTILATE, DISMEMBER, EXECUTE and are hellbent on GENOCIDE and the list goes on, the malaise begin when Optimus put a bullet in the head of a random Decepticon in the second movie like it was nothing.<br/><br/>And that, beyond anything else show that Bay doesn't care, its okay for the heroic character to dismember opponent for fun, for Optimus to kill brutally is mentor and none of them seem to raise and eyebrow when their home(cybertron, who look like a huge, ugly, planetoid, hive) got seemingly destroyed, because they are NOT characters, they are NOT heroic sentient machine, they are special effect pure and simple. I wouldn't mind if the movie was called Marines VS Machines or something, but hey its the Transformers where talking about here.<br/><br/>So it was okay,in a dumb and fun kind of way, buts its time to move on, lets someone with real audacity and imagination take a shot, awesome thing could be done with that property other then selling Bud light and GM truck.<br/><br/>Oh and as far as pointless insertion of useless token babe goes, Megan Fox was better, at least she as some real acting skill."
"littlewernlo2006","10","2","6","5 July 2011"," are y'all serious?
","GI read a lot of these review on here and I am honestly offended by what I read. Y'all complain about the smallest and dumbest things, who cares if you don't know where they are at all times, if he did that then y'all would be complaining about the movie jumping around too much. I personally think ""Dark of the moon"" is one the best movies I have seen in a really long time, it rivals the first transformers. Yes, the first transformers had a better story but this had the best spectacle out of any movie to date, including Avatar, not hating on Avatar. Michael bay is a visionary when it comes to action, y'all want to complain about his directing and the fact that he likes explosions and blowing stuff up, that is what makes his movies so much fun and entertaining, honestly if anyone else was directing these movies they would straight up suck, there wouldn't have even been a second or third one if Michael bay wasn't the director. I'm tired of reading that dark of the moon doesn't have any heart and soul, this is the closest anyone will ever come to crying over a robot, I honestly don't know how he could've put more heart into this movie. The only thing I do agree on is that megatron didn't do anything but that was just him letting sentinel take care of everything like all leaders do these days. Him and Spielberg's best move for this movie was getting rid of Megan fox and bringing in Rosie, she is a million times hotter and a ten fol better actress."
"theshadowoftheghost","4","2","6","4 July 2011"," You can see the light, but it's mainly on the dark side.
","There are spoilers in this. <br/><br/>Shia is getting better with every film. His comic timing is genius and he really is young talent. He's emotional in the right way, pulls us in and you sympathise with him and his relationship to the Autobots. The action scenes are becoming slightly easier to handle, with less of that crappy shaky-camera effect and the actual CGI on the Transformers has been improving since the first meaning we're starting to see more human features on them in comparison to what we've seen previously- just a clunk of metal making noises. They're getting slightly more colourful because I think Bay realised that some things were indistinguishable.<br/><br/>The CGI is, of course, amazing being a multi-million dollar film and we had a few nicer long shots that let you soak all of the battle scenes in rather than meshing it all up into a headache of an eyesore.<br/><br/>And that's all I have to say that's positive.<br/><br/>On the negative side of this moon, it's gloomy. Megan Fox's replacement is tripe, to be frank. She can't act to save her life and even Megan ""one facial gesture"" Fox does a better job, it's sad to say. Their relationship was more believable.<br/><br/>Rosie's brilliant acting skills are obviously not why she was chosen for the role. Inconsistency seems to be a major factor in this film with a few things. One minute she's whipped on her boyfriend and the next minute she's saying she can't deal with it, then she's riding off with him again. A blonde, dopey maiden who's in dire need of saving and can't do anything for herself. And Bay, the black-on-black, epic ""homey slap"" between two characters who have been given no back-story were palm-to-forehead moments. I thought we'd come a long way from stereotypes, but obviously not. Anyway, more inconsistency with the battle at the end: explain to me how Optimus Prime fights Sentinal Prime and nearly loses, then a fully-pumped and rested Megatron pulls him apart no problem, but then Optimus leaps up and rips Megatron open, easy-as-you-like? I hate that in films so thanks, Bay. I was kind of expecting an epic battle between the old foes to finish off the series, but we don't get that. Instead we get one of the most gruellingly tedious action montages that I've seen in recent years right up from when they're in the falling building to when the Primes start fighting. That whole last section lasted for a good twenty minutes or more. You could have had an extra few scenes with Megatron and Optimus to really delve into their history and friend/rivalry relationship (Magneto/Prof. X style). Bay's got no respect for the original program and displays this well.<br/><br/>Also, Hugo Weaving IS NOT Megatron. I cannot forgive Bay for this. What is even more bizarre is that Frank Welker, Megatron's original voice actor, took up on his old role for the first two video games of the movies AND did the voices for Soundwave and Shockwave in the last two films! Bay, where is your logic? I wouldn't even let him into my studio if he wasn't reprising his old role. It's a travesty because Optimus was given his nostalgic privileges, so why not Welker? For true fans of the original series, it's a major let-down and since we get some more dialogue from Megatron in this film, it's a distraction for those already familiar with the Decepticon they know and love. When I heard Soundwave and Shockwave, even I thought, ""Wow, that sounds like the original Megatron"". <br/><br/>Anyway, forgive an old fan's rant. I love Weaving, but not as Megatron. When I saw the scene between Starscream and Megatron, with him complaining at him as he always did, it felt good and reminiscent of what I loved about Transformers, but that was short-lived because then I had to endure some completely stupid and nonsensical scenes with Ken Jeong just there for ""let's rinse out a popular actor of today"" factor. His performance was funny as hell, as he is a funny guy, but it felt wrong for this movie. But nothing was more awkward than John Malkovich being a stern boss to someone who play-fights with Bumblebee the next... And don't get me started on the wealth of inconsistencies in the plot. It's just convolution handed out in droves. Bay, you're a confused, greedy and selfish man. As mentioned earlier, I can't stand inconsistency like this.<br/><br/>The movie actually starts off pretty well, in fairness. The plot seems as if it's going somewhere and that Bay isn't afraid to show the more ""human"" qualities of the robots. The Autobots make their trademark cliché phrases and stuff, and even Starscream sounds fearful of Megatron again, which he didn't in the previous two films which I thought was brave of Bay and it paid off. There are some interesting ""cover-up"" tangents, but it soon very quickly loses any momentum it had and then you realise it's the same old crap. Very pointless.<br/><br/>Anyway, everyone's a critic and you may have thought it was the best film of the year so far. I thought the film was entertaining enough if you want a decent action movie, minus that really long stretch of tediousness near the end, and was impressive on a visual scale (didn't see it in 3D because I don't believe in giving these companies money for something that hasn't worked since the '40s and probably never will- 3D is useless and gives me a headache) but was a 5 (6 at best) as a standalone movie, but overall, I gave it 4. Two stars for CGI, one for an OK action movie if you're not a Transformers fan and one extra for some MINOR improvements."
"lagudafuad","7","2","6","4 July 2011"," Dark of the moon
","Transformers 3, this movie is a whole package of beauty, the best out of the three transformers. This movie is guaranteed to leave you glued to your sit till the credits start rolling in. Michael Bay, definitely saved the best for last, the dialogue in the movie is exceptionally well crafted to get the attention of both the lovers of comedy and drama. The fight scenes at times look a little clumsy, but after a few seconds you'll find your way around it. Bay did a good job in infusing Sam's parents in the movie in a way to add some drama. They made good use of slow motion in the movie so as to get the audience not miss a thing. Also the movie was sometimes too noisy and the use of visual effects was way up there. The story continues from where the last one stops, our protagonist now looking for a job after college and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), blah blah blah, Optimus goes to the moon to save and bring to life an old autobot leader named Sentinel (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), we see the new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), a blond sexy chick (needing more acting class and less Playboy drama), this happens that happens, Government as usual up to something (which we know they know nothing about) run by a bossy woman (Frances McDormand). Blah blah, is the end of the world someone get Sam!!! Bring in the U.S. military and somehow Sam gets wisdom from above and knows what to do to save the world. And there was a scene where Carly is trapped in a Decepticon car and it looked like the Car was fondling her??? What was that? Comparing Megan to Rosie the acting was okay, Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is not much of a good actress at all, but Bay must have really had it in for Megan cause you kinda actually I like her more than Megan Fox. I liked how the movie used the Apollo landing as a part of its story."
"nithinmmukundan","6","2","6","4 July 2011"," Weak Screenplay let the movie down...!
","Transformers 3 is a movie that reminds us of the importance a strong screenplay plays in a movie. The film never met expectations put up by the other 2. This does not happen often but it is interesting to notice that the director Michael Bay has done fantastically well to convert a lackluster script into something. The way he maneuvered the movie the whole 3d effects and graphics is appreciable. The importance of Sam in the movie is questionable. In a good movie, you usually avoid unwanted stuff which here unfortunately was Sam and Carly, thanks to the script. To add to this there were some absolutely indigestible scenes.Why the heck wont these human guys die and how come the transformers miss at such close range with all their advanced weaponry? The gap of capability between human and transformers was huge.<br/><br/>On the good side, there is good music, LP's Iridescent was good, sound effects were awesome. The graphics and special effects ware outstanding. Acting was OK... How much do you expect a transformer to act? The direction was good but felt that he could have done better .All other stuff were great except for the script which let the movie down...! <br/><br/>Overall the movie lacked the basic logic...! Very much kids stuff...! Yeah I overhead a kid saying how awesome the movie was...!"
"sonny-alex-1","7","2","6","4 July 2011"," Started good, became lost, ended the same.
","Dark of the Moon – Started well, became lost, ended the same. This pretty much summarises the film in my opinion.<br/><br/>Although the special effects were simply amazing and the basic story acceptable, I was so disappointed by the lack of twists and surprises. For example, Shockwave could've defected to the Autobots without the viewer finding out until the final scenes in Chicago. We always knew he was going to appear, so why not surprise us? The film followed the same pattern as the others – we have peace, the Decepticons hatch a plan and become the dominant force, the Auotbots take some kind of beating and then come back and win in the end. I can't believe that Bay allowed the plot to proceed in such a similar pattern once again.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Dark of the Moon, but it could've been so much better with a few twists and turns. I give it a solid 7."

"DarthRaen","6","2","6","4 July 2011"," What happened to Strategy in this movie?
","First of all,Optimus Prime seems to be a simple minded weakling. Compared to him, Megatron is an evil genius.It's incomprehensible that the Autobots could beat the Decepticons time and time by following such an unimaginative leader. So Megatron puts plans into motion for hundreds of years and the Autobots do what?? Optimus naively offers the leadership to Sentinel and Sentinel doesn't take it- I ask why??? Secondly,why the hell is the best stuff with the Decepticons? The Digger which simply devastates entire buildings is so frigging cool. What do the Autobots have to compare? Michael Bay says this movie is like Black Hawk Down in Chicago with Robots. Good idea-but why is the US Military so incompetent in Hollywood movies? What the hell happened to cruise missiles? What about tactical nukes? hell, if your city is overrun, wouldn't they authorise use of ICBMs? Think the Decepticons would find that difficult to handle.I mean, the heroes are instructing snipers where to set up-that's laughable.<br/><br/>Lastly, Rosie what's her name?? She should stick to lingerie! Don't get me wrong-this movie entertains for the vast majority of the 3 hours it plays.Since Shia and Bay won't be part of the 4th installment, here's to an reinvigorated franchise -or we could end up with a version like Pirates- On Stranger Tides!"
"walter2-1","7","2","6","3 July 2011"," Very crowded but not very satisfying
","Like too many movies recently, this rides the unnecessary 3D bandwagon for no reason. It adds nothing but increased ticket cost and eyestrain. No question, the effects are great (and would have been equally so in 2D), but the plot is very disjointed, with many odd segments that really make no sense, even when well done. The best performances were John Malkovitch and the barely credited Alan Tudyk. They were just great to watch, but so far off the main plot line, I was just not sure why they were there. I did love hearing Leonard Nimoy's voice as an autobot, but again, it was just too much in an already over-stuffed film.<br/><br/>Let's face it, an overly long feature movie based on kids' mechanical toys is certain to have its detractors, but it does have a lot of rapid fire eye candy, and is a great summer movie. I did enjoy it, but I can't help but wish it had skipped the 3D, and invested that money in better editing, writing and some attention to continuity. It's always depressing to see a major production that really fails to be great, despite huge effort and expenditure, because it simply forgets the key rule of movie making. Have a great story, and tell it well."

"dthoupis","9","2","6","3 July 2011"," Accept it for what it is
","I really cannot understand people or critics who try to take an action packed movie really really seriously and blame everything that goes on on the director. <br/><br/>This movie is obviously an action packed movie and people should accept it for what it is. People going in and waiting to see serious drama and answer questions like for example why does a tilted building does not come crashing all the way down really have serious insecurity problems.<br/><br/>First of all this movie is clearly made for action, fun and for people to enjoy 2 and something hours just watching a spectacular ACTION movie (note the capitalization on the ACTION). I am not a big fan of action movies as I prefer epics but I do appreciate the art director and people put into movies like this because they are deserved it. Although a bit too long, I want to give it a 9 out of 10. Sure some of the acting sucks, Shia is not my best choice of an actor don't know why but the movie really kept my eyes locked on the screen and not bored at all which is a big + for any movie. If you want to look this movie as an Oscar wining melodramatic feature which should take all physic laws and reality into consideration then you for sure would give the movie a -10 review! <br/><br/>Demetris"
"dragonlord1377","Null","2","6","3 July 2011"," Mot Impressed !!!!!
","First off this is coming from a guy that loved the original series and liked the 1st movie with the exception of bumble bee not being a VW bug etc. Transformers 1 was a good movie. Transformers 2 was OK. Transformers 3 was a colossal waste of my time.<br/><br/>About half of the special affects were mediocre at best and the rest were not bad. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who played Carly came across as a really bad actress. first time or not, she was a really bad actress. The story plot to add her in was a total loss. Bay really should have thought a little harder before firing Megan Fox as Mikaela. This plot was not believable because near the end of the 2nd movie Mikaela and Sam profess their undying love for each other and in the 3rd one they give an excuse that she dumps him ???????? um wake up. In the 3rd Movie it says that it had been a year since the Transformers appeared on earth. They didn't even have time to lose that love for each other and move on with someone else ?????????? The ending to the movie was way to rushed and could have had a few more minutes possible ( 5 min ) overall the movie in my opinion was a total bomb. I think bay should retire from making Transformers movies and let someone else take a crack at it as they can't do any worse."
"creedreaper","4","2","6","3 July 2011"," The story was all over the place! And Yea Michael Bay u really Dropped a Ball for not including MEGAN FOX
","Okay I am a huge Transformers series fan, absolutely loved the first two. I liked this one too but the storyline was just all over the place. The movie seemed all rushed and same stuff over and over again. In fact at some scenes it looked like the movie ""SKYLINE"".<br/><br/>So let's start, in the second movie Sam Witwicky was tired of all this chaos and wanted a normal teenage life, and in this one his character was just looking for trouble (MAKES NO SENSE). Now let's start with not including Megan Fox: Michael Bay really dropped a ball for not including her in this one, yes we all know she's very pissy and has a nasty attitude, but dammit she was perfect for these series. For God sakes settle your differences and REPRISE her character back if there will be a next one. This newbie was horrible and they both look horrible together, they had no chemistry nor any past like Sam and Mikaela did.<br/><br/>Leo Spitz was such a lovable character in the second one, why the hell wasn't he in this one? He had and awesome comedy timing with agent Simmons. Also sam's parents role was so short. There's a reason why reviewers are saying this movie was ""missing the heart and soul"".<br/><br/>Transformers is loosing it's originality, same stuff over and over again ""end of the world"" blah blah. I really thought this movie was gonna be about Deceptions planning to destroy our Moon which would eventually destroy our world, and humans and Autobots would try everything to save it, that storyline would've been interesting to watch but the title ""Dark of the Moon"" made no damn sense? <br/><br/>Common Michael Bay give us something new and interesting to watch! Yes we know machines can transform, yes we know there are two sides, yes we know other side wants to destroy the world, yes they have failed in 2 movies already, was another 3rd movie necessary on the same subject? Graphics as usual was great which is y I am giving the rating 6 out of 10. Some new characters were great like John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk, and Ken Jeong. But you have to to realize if Shia LaBeouf is heart of this series, Megan Fox was the Soul. Therefore this movie was just half as good as the others!"
"premium90","6","2","6","2 July 2011"," Disappointing... not as 3d as you think. 1 is the best. 3 not so good.
","The vote of 6 out of 10 reflects the fact the hype did not live to my expectations. Just to say, I watched the film in a IMAX 3D cinema. The sound effects were brilliant.<br/><br/>Back on track. The film starts off and tries to connect the first man on the moon with the autobots. If you have seen the trailers and the title, it kind of gives it away.<br/><br/>Anyway, with out destroying the plot and giving away too much as I bet you will still see it.<br/><br/>The film itself? Overall there is more script in the film. Shia, John Turturro and surprise, surprise - Ken Jeong makes a decent appearance in the film. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley acting is absolute appalling. I'm sorry, but although you are absolutely pretty - they should have give you a none speaking part.<br/><br/>The film really does not have a nice story to it. They should had made sure the script was much better.<br/><br/>Visuals? Excellent. It still lives to the hype. A lot of bang for the buck.<br/><br/>Biggest disappointment? 3D! Out of the whole movie, the nearly end scene in which the building fall apart - are the main 3d scenes. None of it jumped out at all. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>What else? The only reason I could give it a 6 out of 10 is due to the effects. Story line stinks but I can still see this franchise make a lot of money.<br/><br/>Please, please, please.... if you do make another Transformers movie. Please go back to transformers 1 and understand the story and not effects is the most important thing of the movie."

","Warning: This review was translated from Spanish electronically. Any misunderstanding, please consult with me before. This review may contains spoilers, it is recommended that before you read, watch the movie.<br/><br/>One of the many pleasant moments that a person can have as an adult, is to remember the heroes of his childhood. This time we bring to the screen memory and a new story about the struggle between the Autobots and Decepticons. The producer and director Michael Bay, along with a great team, shows us a third time to Optimus Prime, and this time the opportunity to enjoy 3D. The story is great, so much that it makes you want to look away from the screen, you wouldn't lose any word you they say, and don't know where to look or with many effects and characters that come out. Even the plot is so good that I did not mind the love story between Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and the blonde Carly (Rosie Huntington- Whiteley). Rosie Huntington, is a model of a famous brand of lingerie and this film made her acting debut on the big screen and had replaced Megan Fox as the ""maid"" of the film. The truth is I miss Megan Fox, I think this new girl I do not fill the role that his predecessor had acted. The effects and animation are great, I dare say they are in the exact point at which the technology can see all the fans of ""Transformers"", a magnificent transformation of Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee and Megatron. A turn that seemed perfect, was the addition of another antagonist, which was allied in the past, including leader of the Autobots. Another plus were the cars on display, I personally would have liked to see the transformation of a Bougati Viron, but I'm content with seeing the Ferrari and a complete Optimus Prime. One drawback, which includes the two previous films, the plot is that the base and focus on the human character (Sam Witwicky) and not Transformers. If I remember correctly in the animated series was the other way. I even dare to say and seeing a very sour view, the Transformers are just ""fancy weapons"". However it is understood, because otherwise the movie would last 28 minutes and 157 minutes which is what takes this third film. The third dimension (3D) is good, but so far I have not seen any movie or beat ""Avatar,"" which for me is the 10 (if it could be more) in this area. Qualify this movie on IMDb to 10, I give the Movie Ratings on Wednesday of ""Very Good"" and hopefully soon a package to buy the trilogy."

"afrolegend","10","2","6","1 July 2011"," A fantastic well rounded film with Fighting Titan galore
","Personally, I am a transformers fan, and I've always been excited by the films, I really enjoyed the first film due to the stunning re-imagining of my favourite heroes, the only issue i had was the story being so different to the original comic. Then i saw the second.... and I was brutally disappointed... but i did go away with some exciting moments and a breathtaking forest fight scene. Now.. My expectations were indeed low for this film considering the last one, But i have to say after seeing it... Lets just say it was difficult for anyone to get that goofy smile off my face for the couple of hours after i left the cinema. Now, there are slight issues like characters such as megatron being in-visioned differently and maybe more comedy than there should of been in the beginning (However tasteful), but the story and the characters i loved to pieces and despite other hater reviews claiming the stories last scene was long winded... i was actually left wanting even more. It maybe loud... but its the good kind. More characters are fleshed out with some new insight into optimus's relationships and every character actually having their own little moment and a satisfactory twist to really get you going. I'll just quickly add that although the character shock-wave has no lines... he quickly becomes the most intimidating of them all and the last act with optimus going toe to toe with an unlikely villain has to be the best fight scene i've personally witnessed. (Spoiler alert) someone unlikely actually saves him from a brutal death ;')........ HOWEVER... its not just about the big guys, the human characters are great, Sam continues to grow and create some original humor and emotion and Carly makes you quickly forget about Megan fox because shes generally a better actor and actually (Another spoiler) Is the reason optimus lives in the last Act... Also no twins... thats gotta hit the spot (Y) Now... i am 16, but although I've got a social life I got this account just so i could combat against some of the ridiculous bad reviews posted. ;)<br/><br/>All in All... Best of the 3, even bringing back a lot of the feels from the first. Transformers 1 (7) Transformers 2 (5) Transformers 3 (9/10) Go see it and enjoy this epic sci fi comedy/thriller"

There have to be some psychology behind it; some sort of Stockholm syndrome for movie goers. Bay abuses you on every (cinematographic) level possible but gives you great visual treat now and then.

"ozairahmed","7","2","6","1 July 2011"," Michael Bay - The Accidental Auteurist
","Michael Bay is certainly nothing short of an accidental auteurist! With his latest offering he takes the ockham's razor to the summer blockbuster, carving out the superfluous- story,characterization, et al, while distilling the necessary and tweaking his distinct Bay-ian aesthetic to a maximum to produce the purest testimony of an evident cinematic apocalypse.<br/><br/>Also worthy of interest is Bay's provocative depiction of the British bimb0. Her reduction to an object of the gaze is evident throughout the film. In one glorious shot where she scuttles to the telescope to view the enemy forces Bay cuts from this collagen prone bombshell(sic!) to a fancy golden maned bitch seated on a similar chair passively viewing the ensuing mayhem!Talk about free association! Such honesty and fearless purity of vision effectively transcends the entire camp of critical left field detractors! <br/><br/>As a final note : I'm sure future post modernists shall hail this film as the newest reincarnation of B-movie conventions . the 'b' now read as Blockbuster. Move over grind house! The CGI ridden future is here!"
"anarchronox","4","2","6","1 July 2011"," I have money but no brain....Bay
","While i generally don't review titles on IMDb as i find the already existing ones generally appropriate but this i had to do.<br/><br/>I was pretty excited about the sequel and was hoping to see some creativity from the director. Instead Mr.Bay casually cut-copy-paste the scenes from different hits around without putting much thought about the story line.In order to make my point i will enumerate my findings :<br/><br/>1.Since the movie had a huge budget and due to Mr.Spielberg, Bay did managed to produce spectacular affects but all in vain. The movie has parts borrowed from a different movies like the infantry action on the ground reminds one of Battle : LA, the snake-like twisted metal thing borrowed from some Asian movie with similar monster etc.<br/><br/>2. In the first half the director Bay did tried to evoke a comic feel but then again he just pasted it w/o using any sense. The corny dialogue between Shia and his mother when he was having troubles in relationship makes you sick because of the way it was filmed and inappropriate timing.It's like how Hellboy with its serious tone was a bit manageable but Hellboy 2 was a pain.<br/><br/>3. The fight between the Autobots and Decepticons is so much overdone that it becomes mundane and you actually loose track of who is attacking whom and why should i care. While initially the autobots can't fight the decepticons and struggle but at the fag end they can rip a hole in the decepticons by just punching.<br/><br/>4.The pet robots of Shia try desperately to put on a comic relief but oh! the humanity.<br/><br/>5. Shia as Sam ""The Wise"" is obviously invincible and is able to fight the menacing robots while holding her girlfriend's hand all the time. He can swing around like Tarzan and still not break a sweat, while the elite military unit is running haywire(Proves how much talented he is, all the while he can't get a job for himself)<br/><br/>6.The plot of the movie COULD have been awesome but i can't understand why Mr.Spileberg didn't watched the movie and let it be released.<br/><br/>7. The stupid acting of Shia was topped by Rosie in nearly all aspects. (Makes you wish that if Megan Fox had kept her mouth shut it would have been better)<br/><br/>8. Lastly I am really disappointed by the treatment handed out to such a series and won't be watching another sequel if Mr.Bay is even present on the set, forget about his involvement in the movie.<br/><br/>Peace to all!"

","If you've had the misfortune of watching Battlefield L.A, you will know what I mean when I say that this movie doesn't know what it wants to be. The ancient Greeks said that for a story to satisfy the spectator, it needs to have a start, a middle and an ending.<br/><br/>This one starts with endless scenes of Shia LaBeouf's new love life, ends with a cheap message from Optimus which makes us wonder what was there any different from TF1 and TF2, and the middle is a clusterfck of useless characters, pointless drama/jokes scenes and slow motions which show us nothing we haven't seen before. TEN MINUTES, you will watch one of the Decepticons take down a building. TEN MINUTES.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, is this the WTC September 11 reenactment of American valour and heroism, or a TRANSFORMERS MOVIE. A lot of the battle scenes are once again poorly shot like in TF2 in very close up shots so you can't really feel the awesomeness of huge robots fighting and the story has more plot holes than the Iraki navy.<br/><br/>I started to even miss Megan Fox, at least she was eye candy."
"arnieiam","8","2","6","30 June 2011"," Hopefully this is the last one
","I still liked it and enjoyed it, especially in 3D but I hope there's no more to this. Each film in the series progressively pushed what was acceptable in the defilement of a Saturday morning cartoon. The first film paid way too much attention to the humans. I know they had to show less robots for budget concerns but did we really need to know about Anthony Anderson's character's grandmother? The second film really had its contrivances like the character Leo or the unnecessary sexual dialog or Sam's mother high on weed but somehow it remained a little more faithful to the show by actually mentioning things like 'Energon' or 'The Matrix of Leadership'. Now this film improved a little bit but not so much. There were still some scenes that made me uncomfortable such as when Sam was shoved into the bathroom stall by Ken Jeong's character or when Ken Jeong out of nowhere draws two pistols in front of Laserbeak or the occasional awkward dialog from Sam's mother. Still it remained faithful by adding more from the franchise such as Sentinel Prime, Mirage, the Wreckers and the Pillars. One thing I really enjoyed was the Decepticons have human allies and therefore we have our first human villain. And I didn't mind Megan Fox's replacement at all. She is actually quite tolerable and isn't bad as a first time actress seeing that she is able to cry. I actually like her because she doesn't have that look of conceit that Fox has because everyone thinks that Fox is the hottest woman on the planet. Personally, even though I think Megan Fox is hot, she still isn't the hottest. Anyways, I do hope there is no more and I think Michael Bay should move on. I want to see another Bad Boys film!"
"ceszx","6","2","6","30 June 2011"," Ehh..
","I really like the story line, but I did not like Michael Bay's decision on getting rid of Megan Fox and bringing in some random Victoria's Secret fashion model. That decision changed the whole entire movie. I really enjoyed the first two movies, but why would you have Megan Fox's character dump Shia La Beouf's character after the scenes at the end of the second movie. It makes no sense what so ever. I read some article about how both their characters had ""become one"" and that they ""needed something new"". Well I feel like they were just trying to hide up the fact that Megan Fox has an attitude that Michael Bay couldn't deal with it for one more movie.. Oh well, I guess, six out of ten."

","Just come out of a showing, and in summary, yes, it's a definite improvement, but is still not a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>The 3D was actually very good. There were some scenes where I was really impressed with the depth, and it added to the 'experience' without a doubt.<br/><br/>In addition to the excellent 3D, the FX artists have used far less motion blur, and the action and fights are much clearer for it.<br/><br/>I also felt the story was more cohesive than both 1 and 2 - and I was pleased to see we didn't have a repeat of ""you need to get item X to position Y"" and then rather then dropping Sam off at position Y, they leave him a mile away so he has to run through a war-zone just for the spectacle of it.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, there's still running, and it's still there to segue between massive set pieces, but at least there was a semblance of logic as to why the characters needed to be there.<br/><br/>It wasn't amazing, but it was enjoyable, and from a story perspective (as I'm not going to go so far as to call it a plot) it did seem to have the best pacing of the trilogy.<br/><br/>So in summary, if you enjoyed TF1, I'd say it was equally enjoyable if not slightly more so - as long as you don't expect anything more than a popcorn movie."

"fluro-converse","6","2","6","30 June 2011"," Mixed Feelings
","I have been a major Transformer's Fan for quite some time now. After watching Transformer's in 2007, I fell in love with the stunning new rendition of the well known franchise. When Transformers Revenge of the Fallen came out I was also very happy with it overall, although their were some aspect's I wasn't entirely happy with, I overall did really like it.<br/><br/>When I went into the Cinema for Transformers Dark of the Moon, I think however that I was expecting to much because in my opinion it didn't live up to what I imagined it would.<br/><br/>Firstly I will say this. This movie is a great Movie in some aspects. The Special Effect's are simply jaw-dropping, with crisp, immaculate detail that look's like the Transformers are visually there on the set. The Action also is insane, and at certain part's of the film left my saying ''Wow, that was awesome''. So there is no doubt in my mind that the Action and Special Effect's side of the Film is incredible and top notch as usual.<br/><br/>... However, the Storyline and some other aspect's of the Movie though were very disappointing and quite confusing. Without sounding too harsh, unfortunately for me this is the worst story line in the entire Transformers Movie. After thinking about it non -stop all night and all morning, even i found it difficult to recall what was happening. After discussing it with some of my fellow friend's, they also found it very confusing. I felt the story - line was rushed, or wasn't consistent, and it felt like they were going for that objective ... but then they were going for that objective. So for me, this is the worst story -line in my opinion.<br/><br/>One of the other thing's I did not like was some of the Acting skill's. The acting was at time's fairly good, however at other time's it was week and degrading. The new girl who is playing a different role, is not the best actor either I'm afraid. At first I admired her sweet tone and fairly well presented acting skills, however - and excuse me for sounding a bit prejudice - I found her English accent quite frustrating at times when she was suppose to be conveying a sense of sadness or fear. Unfortunately the acting skill's for me were average, Megan Fox in my opinion did better in the acting field.<br/><br/>Another thing that was very frustrating is they did not show us or give us enough information or detail on new Transformers. There is a lot of new Transformer's that we don't know there name, didn't see them Transform and didn't see their vehicle form or hear them speak. I saw one Transformer only in it's vehicle form, I never saw it Transform. And their was countless other Transformer's that I wanted to see more. Also a large minority of character's were killed and in a way I felt like they were only shown for a couple of minutes and then they were dead or gone just like that.<br/><br/>Overall, I wouldn't say it is the best Transformers. It is still worthy of seeing. I would rate it 10/10 if it were just for the Special Effect's and Action, however the confusing and jumbled story - line, lack of knowledge on a range of character's and the poor acting skills from some of the actor's leave me to give it a 6."
"ktelliman","5","2","6","29 June 2011"," More than meets the eye... Less than needs the fan
","OK. Let's do this:<br/><br/>For me, this movie is a 6/10, but there's one reason why I'm voting it as a 5/10: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. And I think is very important to begin with her, because every time she appears on the screen, you will feel that somehow ""she's not fitting there"". Please don't get me wrong: She's beautiful, she's very good looking, but she can't act! Now, if you ask me How much a character can make a movie to loose its rhythm, after watching her, I could say its a lot (and I'm not a Megan fox's fan).<br/><br/>Lets say that after ""revenge of the fallen"" This franchise deserved an unforgettable last chapter. As an action movie it was good at its best: The Bay's old formula worked pretty well this time(slow motion + explosions + hot chick's cleavage/skirt close ups) and the topping was the excellent 3D work, but the lack of a good plot turned this film into an ""average film"" when everybody was expecting a total blast.<br/><br/>I let you here some numbers, so you can get an idea of how this movie goes:<br/><br/><ul><li>Successful jokes: 2 - Unsuccesful jokes: 42 - Rosie's close ups: 100 - Rosie's different facial expressions: 0 - New characters: 214 (including the new decepticons) - Unexplained new characters: 210 (including the new decepticons) - Sub - plots: At least 8 - Finished sub - plots: 5 - Slow Motion scenes: 24 - Events defying physics : 13 (including that flying guy who explodes when he crashes into a building)</li></ul><br/><br/>As you can see, I can't go beyond this point without revealing too much.<br/><br/>So, if you want to go and watch an entertaining movie, that is a visual feast but with no plot, this is your movie. It is very enjoyable, but not what I expected.<br/><br/>6/10 (-1) = 5/10"
"hpoirot88","5","2","6","29 June 2011"," Classic Michael Bay
","If there is one thing Michael Bay is good at, it is the spectacle. If you're hungry for big explosions, robot-on-robot battle scenes, sprinkled in with shots of the lovely Carly played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley- you'll receive your fill and then some. The primary cast from the previous two films returns, with the exception of Mikaela, Megan Fox's role, who (all sex appeal aside) was easily replaced as by the aforementioned Ms. Huntington-Whiteley. New additions to the cast include Frances McDormand, who was overly qualified for her one-note part as the Secretary of Defense. John Malkovich is excellent in his limited role as Shia LaBeouf's new boss, Bruce Brazos. (I have a sneaking suspicion that the part was written for him specifically) Patrick Dempsey does well as Dylan Gould, Carly's rich and handsome boss and for Shia LaBeouf, competition for her affection. Special acknowledgment goes to Alan Tudyk as Dutch, Simmons' (John Turturro) special assistant, who nails every scene he gets. The primary Autobots and Decepticons return, with some new looks and some new additions here and there to each side.<br/><br/>Critics will pan this movie for this reason. All special effects aside, the plot is only an excuse for the action that occurs. The characters (new or old) are not very compelling and I felt more emotionally for the 'bots more than anyone else. I didn't seem to care about the human casualties because most of them are pretty damn useless. But listen critics, this is strictly clap your hands and smile stuff, this is the equivalent of Michael Bay jingling car keys in front of us and (just admit it) we love it. It puzzles me why Frances McDormand got into this, she's been part of so many gourmet movies, why would she be part of this greasy cheeseburger of a movie? I think it's because she's the same us- we love junk food every now and then. So when you see this flick, sit back and relax, and enjoy it for what it is. Oh, and bring extra napkins- at 2 hours and 37 minutes running time- this is a big helping."

","I loved Transformers, so much so that i watched it more than once in the Cinemas and it wasn't cheap. Transformers 2 'Revenge of the Fallen' was a massive let down and it put me off this one, i was reminded yesterday that it was out today.. i should have known?! Transformers 3 'Dark of the Moon' - if you have watched this film then go on YouTube and watch the Trailer for Inception (2010) and imagine the music over it slowed down.. that = The sound from Transformers 3, it's like they stole not only that but other things and if it wasn't for Orange Wednesday i would have been annoyed that i wasted money on it. It was funny at times, it had me laughing at one point where the joke was long gone and i was still chuckling to myself, the effects were cool although some of the Robots didn't even need to be there, along with the characters.. a few inc. John Malkovich, his character was pointless.. the ending was like a middle finger to those who have watched all three *SPOILER ALERT* Megatron gets conned into killing Sentinel Prime and horribly as well.. the gigantaship was destroyed by a remote control car.. it wasn't good or it could have been a million times better.. not a solid Trilogy.<br/><br/>Sad it's ended though, Linkin Park AGAIN at the end made me laugh.. Transformers (One) is by far the best."
"jdrebel13","6","2","6","29 June 2011"," Definitely Landed on the Dark Side
","Transformers Dark of the Moon, a promising title followed with equally promising buzz over the last several months that swelled with intense anticipation. I can't review this movie from a die hard fan p.o.v. because in all honesty, though I loved the original animated series and the classic movie, my history is a bit rusty and my ass would be blended into a tasty boba treat for some spectacle wearing fan boy with a hard on for Optimus Prime. So, in all fairness I will simply review this as someone who loved the previous movies. And yes, I even loved Revenge of the FallenÂ… If you've stopped reading at this point because of lack of credibility I understand, if not then let me continue. There were several things I appreciated about the movie, the first being the visual effects as always were impeccable. The orgy worthy robot on robot fighting was amazing and exciting. Honestly, I almost wish Bay would do a prequel following along the lines of the fall of Cybertron.You know, just ignore the human aspect of it all together since we have a habit of being awfully messy with emotions and intentions gone awry(cough cough every suit wearing pencil pushing government agent Bay puts into his films cough cough). The stunts were nothing to sneeze about either. Something about soldiers leaping out of burning planes with wing suits under wave after wave of assault by the pursuing Decepticons just makes you tingle inside. Or that might be this morning's coffee? Either way, there are moments of jaw dropping stunts mixed with visual effects that make you sit on the edge of your seat. I was also impressed with the plot that starts to take shape early on in the movie but sadly it drifts off lazily in the background halfway through like my Grandpa during our family gatherings for Christmas. It also gets a little far fetched at one significant point where even I, someone with little knowledge on physics and global dynamics, had to shake my head and ask out loud ""What?! We're just gonna pretend that that wouldn't have any repercussions?!"" I can't divulge too much because then I would be spoiling the surprise but once you see it, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. What makes me especially upset about this is that (and yes, here comes my redemption for the earlier comment)with Revenge of the Fallen the plot was filled with so many holes it looked like the Swiss cheese I put on my breakfast bagels. However, at least in the second one they made an attempt to fill in as many of those craters as they could with one of (or both at times) Megan Fox's ass cheeks in daisy dukes or the never tiring air acrobatics of Shia Lebeouf. Yes, throw your Bumble bee collector cups from Burger King at me and boo at the statement I am about to make: I felt the second one at least delivered more closely to the first both in satisfaction and entertainment than Dark of the Moon. I liked it better, so there. I feel this movie could have been great had Michael Bay simply followed the story line and tried to keep his Bayisms at a minimum. Much like the random moments of humping dogs and pants less people in the second there are times during the third that seem rather arbitrary and eye rolling-ly awful. Not to mention even though Fox has a backlash against her that would make Vanilla Ice blush, her character, Mikeala, seemed to fit the mold of female lead better than Rosie Huntington-I don't care I lost interest in the remainder of her last name. Fox's interaction with Shia also felt more realistic; yes, maybe it was because they were actually getting it on behind the scenes but that's not the point, point is both his character, Sam and the new girl, Carly, have a forced physical attraction that doesn't seem as convincing. The same go for other character interactions that don't seem as genuine as they did in previous movies which unfortunately becomes a little emotionally detaching from the story. All in all, if you are still awake, I would say the movie is worth checking out but I don't feel it lived up to the hype or delivered as well as the others."

","well, first seen the trailer i thought this is it, they did it again. it will be better than the second one.<br/><br/>it has by far the biggest possible cgi mass-destruction, but the story is not thought through. a patchwork of elements we know from the first and the second movie is not enough to make a good movie.<br/><br/>but i must give Bay credit that the fransformers movies keep the spectator in hope for a revival of the first part.<br/><br/>OK, mr.

I felt that certain scenes didn't link well and the take over of Chicago didn't seem to have a middle.... to the point I'm wondering whether they had some skips in the playing of the movie. As lots of reviews have noted the wing-suit scene is stunningly filmed and really adds to some great action sequences. The humor in the movie is of a much better level and got real laughs (I so hope to never see another dog dry humping scene again as in T2)Well worth going to but I'm still left with the feeling it could have been more. Oh well I'll just prebook for T4"
"ssvikas","6","2","6","29 June 2011"," Scores for action and special effects alone
","Live-action Transformers movies make great business sense not just at the box office but also for Hasbro's merchandise. With the action getting bigger in every version, 'Dark of the Moon' aka Transformers-3 is a typical Micheal Bay movie, which promises loads of action which, as usual is scantily clad with a semblance of a story.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), the central character in the first two films has now finished schooling and looking for a job. He has also moved cities and also to a new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington- Whitley). Sam and the Autobots dive into the thick of the plot when the truth behind moon explorations is apparently revealed as an investigation into a crashed Cybertronian spacecraft on the dark side of the moon.<br/><br/>Sentinel Prime is a key character inclusion as Optimus' mentor and Cybertronian genius who his keen on using advanced technology to revive his planet and also brings a twist in the story. The one-eyed serpentine cannon bot Shockwave is TF3's most formidable antagonist. Old enemy Megatron has lost his edge but not his ambitions and moves around as a rusty old truck with a cowl covering the injury inflicted by Optimus in TF2. <br/><br/>The film's selling point is its special effects, largely shot in stereoscopic 3D which deserves unreserved applause for the resultant spectacle. Intricate action sequences are slowed down for detail and camera angles are simply great. The freeway chase that features in most of Bay's movies is seen again though. With more bots and the threat of imminent global danger make the climax worthwhile. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, there is a lot missing with the script and acting. The flow is also affected by poor transitions between action and storytelling. Sudden cuts in some action sequences and the lucky bunny romance scene that suddenly pops up from nowhere are just a few examples. Also, some of its humor is downright silly.<br/><br/>Sam's character that was central to the story in the earlier movies as he held maps or clues that either group was chasing. Here, the battle has nothing to do with him and all that LaBeouf has to do is to play his usual scared hero. Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie brings in her charm, but none too comparable to Fox. Both something in common though; they're both equally awful at acting.<br/><br/>And, nearly everyone else is just a caricature. Be it those reprising their roles such as Josh Duhamel as the army commander or John Torturro as the former Agent turned author who aren't critical to the story or new new faces such as the largely wasted John Malkovich or a nervous Ken Jeong of Hangover fame. A significant exception is, Patrick Dempsey as Carly's moneyed boss with a deeper secret to his role.<br/><br/>Clearly, it's a case of special effects donning the role of a back-seat driver. But, full marks for special effects, the lone pillar on which the Transormers edifice stands."

NICE not excellent but passable.<br/><br/>3D wise ill say 90% of the movie was just converted in a VERY LOW way to 3D just like my Samsung TV does at home from a regular 2D source (where u can almost see the movie with the naked eyes). However there is COOL but fewer scenes where there is that deep 3D effect specially the 360 camera scenes, but again just a few.<br/><br/>IMAX wise we all know that there is only a few scenes taken with IMAX cameras or that are true IMAX, i wouldn't doubt only 25% or less is IMAX however the Digital IMAX does really make up for it, as if u were to watch it on analog u will kinda notice the non IMAX content if u put attention to it. Still not any close to that AVATAR movie that we saw 2 yrs ago, but its definitively underneath it =) is it worth the Xtra $$ yes but only on digital IMAX theaters <br/><br/>Bottom line.....this movie will be the summer HIT no doubt about that.... its a must watch !! for kids n kids inside of an adult, best yet if u have not seen the previous ones guess what it does NOT matter!!!!!!!"

Yes, the transformations and effects and most of the Chicago battles are spectacular (not the janky JFK) but after nearly three hours the fatigue is real. There are some surprising horror moments with the bird thing, some great actors doing some bonkers ad-lib by the look of it, and there's an orgy of creatively mad ideas, like integrating NASA space program and going to Chernobyl, and some great practical effects.
But overall, the editing and pacing is epileptic and lurching like a kangarooing car. The 3D varies but the spottiness, lack of consistency and disregard for 3D framing makes it almost negligible if not the for the utterly bright, crisp photography unhindered completely by 3D.

I have a similar opinion to most of the films but having not seen them all ( Don't kill me die hard fans) I felt each film was just. Autobots tell humans about something with the Decepticons, Autobots are wrongly accused, Autobots get sent away, Autobots are actually right, Autobots fight to stop somebody bringing Cybertron to earth.

"josephrygaard","5","1","2","23 December 2019"," Before Watching: Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)
","""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" (2011) is yet another action movie with the infamous fighting robots. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>In this movie, The Transformers saga continues more or less in the same tone as the previous two instalments. The effects and scenery continue to be well done and at moments exciting, but beyond the extravaganza and explosions, little to none substance remains. These movies aren't in that sense made for depth or thoughtful philosophies, which remains the main point to be aware of.<br/><br/>Secondly, the characters can feel very one-dimensional. The main protagonist Sam spends most of his scream time running, with his new girlfriend (which poses a major plot inconsistency) running behind screaming. Rarely does it feel like the characters are human, which robs the dramatic as well as the more tender moments of impact.<br/><br/>In terms of consistency, this movie is, nevertheless, the soundest. It's a clear improvement from Transformers 2, but not enough to really be satisfying except to its target audience.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a bland 5/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

They might have been gorgeous in 3D IMAX but on a 2D television they look worse than the first two movies and often become ridiculous when they were optimized for #item to be thrown into the cameras' direction again and again and again or $character is displayed in front of a destroyed city, which was obviously designed only for the 3d effect.<br/><br/>It's 2019.

This third movie has moved little past its cartoon predecessors, adding only modern computer graphics in excess to such point, that sequences become a blurred mass of pixels.<br/><br/>In retrospective, I really loved the initial 10 minutes of the movie.. after that, it rather chokes the viewer hoping to draw away attention from the poor script and failing ability to create truly captivating personas."

The film was the last film to have Shia LaBeouf in the film as Sam Witwicky and the end of the original trilogy of films.<br/><br/>The film is set three years after the events of the 2009 film, with the Autobots, during the collaboration with the NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers) military force, discovering a hidden alien technology in possession of humans, which had been found by Apollo 11 on the years earlier. However, the Decepticons unveil a plan use the technology to enslave humanity in order to restore Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers.<br/><br/>The story was a really good story and it took inspiration from a novel called Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday, written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel was a prequel to the 2007 film, TRANSFORMERS. Due to the critically panned REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, the Twins were cut out of ""Dark of the Moon"".<br/><br/>The acting is just amazing, but can get dreadful. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky one last time and he does a great job. Megan Fox was originally signed on to play Mikaela Banes in the third film, and Patrick Dempsey's character Dylan Gould was to be the employer of Fox's character, but she was fired, instead Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays Carly Spencer and she does a great job.<br/><br/>She is not as good as Fox but considering the shoes that she had to fill, she could have been a hell of a lot worse. Josh Duhamel, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and the rest of the cast are great in their performances, especially Tyrese Gibson, who was also in another 2011 film, Fast Five, which I previously reviewed.<br/><br/>The CGI is amazing and the action is so fantastic in this film and the best part is at the end of the film, and it was so long but I enjoyed it and the film is 154 minute long feature film.<br/><br/>The music by Steve Jablonsky is fantastic and much more cool and amazing was Linkin Park's song at the end of this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON is not the best Transformers film, but it could have been worse.<br/><br/>6/10."

","Watching this is like being the five year old me all over again, discovering big action blockbusters for the first time with my eyes wide, jaw dropped and full attention, this is the ultimate blockbuster. <br/><br/>Critics may not like most of his films, and a lot of the audience are divided up, but Michael Bay knows how to entertain and bring in the big bucks, and make your money worth while. His films contain sweeping scales that show off his skills in technicality, and the action will make you gasp. If Bay delivered at the top of his game in one film, the perfect example would be Transformers: Dark Of The Moon, the third adventure in the wildly successful blockbusting franchise, a franchise that has made well over $2 billion. <br/><br/>This is the best movie in the franchise, and one of my all time favourite movies and easily the best 3D experience! Throughout the film locations pops to life, from the Cybertron-War at the opening, to the intense Motorway chase and the mind-blowing, hour long Chicago climax that will knock you off your seat. Depth is monumental, even in faster cut shots the ability to sense space is easily done as it's so convincing. Dark of The Moon delivers incredible action alongside a solid storyline that just gets better and more involving throughout, it's the strongest plot of the franchise and I love how the Space Programme is used against the backdrop of a darker mission to the Moon. This entry also introduces new characters to the epic franchise as well as returning cast members. Shia LaBeouf, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, John Turturro, Ken Jeong, Alan Tudyk, exceptional newcomer Rosie Huntington Whiteley and co are all on top form with razor sharp performances. <br/><br/>Like I said Michael Bay is the master of scale and chaos, the finale of this film is the best I've ever seen. Chicago falls to it's knees in the last act, an epic battle of robot-smashing, pyrotechnic carnage that goes on for nearly a whole hour. Sometimes I get the temptation to skip most the movie and just watch this part but the build-up is just too good to miss. The visuals are perfect, the sound roars to life and it's the best battle in film, jaws will drop at the size of this movie, and it's the best 3D I've ever seen speeding ahead of Avatar and Gravity. Dark Of The Moon packs incredible action shots, some of the best I've ever seen including actors walking amongst backdrops of explosions and collapsing structures. Overall a spectacular special effects bonanza with Michael Bay at his best."

A few times during the film's dream thought, that scene or how this is impressive or how did they record that scene. You can spit on the story, if you like, or acting, but the spectacle is nothing to do personally. Women are not even kept her as much as would be expected. Subtract that.

The humans meant a lot more than in the previous. Want Surprised Me they got rid of Starscream and Megatron as the were both killed, Starscream exploded and Megatron Was killed by Optimus. In this one u saw the dark side of Optimus As Megatron saved him By pretty much killing sentinel And wanted a truce but Optimus declined and ripped of his head. I wish they gave Starscream a bigger death scene or a better way to die."

","I was extremely disappointed with the latest Transformers movie. Granted, I didn't have much faith in it to begin with as the second one was also a major slope down from the first; however, I didn't think it would be this bad.<br/><br/>OK, so the first thing I noticed was the mysterious disappearance of Megan Fox and the appearance of her replacement it seems Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, a British Victoria's Secret Model. Well, where did Megan Fox go?! The only explanation given is that she dumped Sam. There's no hint as to why, when, where etc. This really bothered me for some reason. I'm not a very big fan of Megan Fox but I felt that she played quite a large role in this franchise and I was disappointed that the producers messed with the flow of Transformers by replacing her. This was their first mistake.<br/><br/>Secondly, if I'm perfectly honest I had no frickin' idea what the hay was going on for most of this movie. The first part was all about how sad Sam's life is and how he needs to get a grip, get a job and stop thinking about the decepticons. Whilst all the action is going on in this movie Sam and Carly's relationship unfolds and develops which is a bit distracting for the viewer as the story switches and merges plot lines. Sam is jealous of Carly's relationship with her new boss, a rich man (Patrick Dempsey), who buys her a car and then *shocker* her boss turns out to be in league with the Decepticons.<br/><br/>There is a new bad guy: Sentinel Prime, who in my opinion just looks like a robotic ent. He was Optimus Primer's predecessor and was in charge of guarding the 'Pillars', but he secretly made a deal with Megatron and is now one of the bad guys. Using these Pillars the Decepticons want to set up a teleportation link bringing all the Decepticons to Earth, which has the resources they require. In my opinion this made the film look like a race between giant robots to find some sticks. Meanwhile, the Decepticons are murdering members of the US and Russian space missions to cover their traces, but of course, they're not very subtle about this. (Hint: man mysteriously flies out the window of a high storey building). The Decepticons threaten to wage war on Earth if the humans don't agree to exiling the Autobots, so of course, the humans pack off their only means of protection up in a space shuttle and shoot it into the sky. Then, after a bazillion fires, explosions, special effects, peace is restored - as expected.<br/><br/>I don't know why but for some reason the only thing I could think of every time I saw Shia laBeouf was Even Stevens. I didn't feel this way during the other two movies so perhaps LaBeouf's acting had slipped back into old ways and he was reprising the role of Louis Stevens.<br/><br/>What is quite cool is how they incorporate history into this movie by saying that the 'Space Race' of the Cold War between the USA and the USSR was caused because a Cybertronian spacecraft landed on the moon.<br/><br/>Some people really liked this movie, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. I guess the special effects are fantastic but it's effect is significantly lessened as there is no plot line to back it up. All in all I thought this movie was a bit of a mess. It lacked plot and detail that was needed and by the end of the movie I could see, hear and think was explosions, explosions, explosions. Thank god this is the last instalment so they can stop tarnishing the name Transformer oh wait that is what I would've said in 2011 but now we've got transformers age of extinction YAY!!!!

"dburris-45933","10","2","7","29 September 2017"," Transformers: Dark of the Moon
","(SPOILER ALERT) Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the best out of the Transformers trilogy in my opinion. Story goes that Optimus Prime and the autobots discovered that the ark from the battle on Cybertron crashed landed on the dark side the moon. There mission was to revive the pillars and a lost autobot Sentinel Prime!"
"brchthethird","5","2","7","9 July 2015"," An improvement over REVENGE, but still rather tiresome
","Isn't Transformers supposed to be fun? The first one was, and even though the second one went overboard with the toilet humor, it still had its moments. To this threequel's credit, the story is better and more disciplined, though. The first 20 minutes set up an intriguing premise about the ""real"" reason for the moon landings. Yet it never really follows through with it. After that pre-title sequence it's back to the usual with Sam and company as they try to stop the Decepticons' latest (and greatest?) scheme. For what it's worth, Michael Bay reined in some of his baser tendencies. Sam's parents get a whole lot less screen time, and he ditched the racist Autobots from the previous installment. Also, since he shot this in 3D this forced him to tidy up the camera-work and editing. The visual effects also top everything that came before it. There are some really jaw-dropping visuals that probably looked amazing on a cinema screen, and still looked pretty awesome on my HDTV. On the casting side, he got some more veteran actors to do glorified cameos and add legitimacy to an otherwise mostly talent-starved ensemble. However, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime was a stroke of genius (along with an obligatory Star Trek reference/quote). What didn't work in the film's favor was the tiresome and endless nature of the carnage and destruction. The last hour of the film is basically an extended action sequence, and it was a chore to sit through. The human drama is clichéd at best, insipidly stupid at worst. Michael Bay certainly doubled down on why the films have been so popular, but it seems like he forgot to make it a little more enjoyable. As a result, lengthy stretches of action were rendered boring and depressing. The score didn't help matters much either. Like the previous two, Michael Bay was content to use the kernel of a good idea and slather it with visual effects and mindless action. He knows his audience, to be sure, but his cynicism is on full display here. TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON corrects some of the more egregious missteps of its predecessor, but it unfortunately loses its soul in the process."
"azeiteminator","Null","2","7","28 September 2011"," Not another Transformers movie...
","Michael Bay success formula for the Transformers trilogy: 1)Stunning CGI/poor story; 2)Sam Witwicky somehow steps on a Decepticon plan or simply that plan is thrown at his face; 3)A war between Autobots and Decepticons begins for the sake of mankind; 4)A hot girl in an all apocalyptic-war scenario only to show her goods; 5)Finally Optimus Prime comes to the rescue and saves the day.<br/><br/>Basically all of the Transformers movies followed these guidelines and for better the CGI has been it doesn't compensates the poor story-line. And the actors are not that good, mostly because their characters are more shallow than an empty oyster. Now, the adding of John Malkovich was a plus to the cast and the entry of Rosie Huntington Whiteley is more than welcome because, despite this being is first time as an actress in the big screen, she showed more acting maturity than Megan Fox.<br/><br/>Recently Michael Bay open the door to a new Transformers movie, possibly a new trilogy (let's hope so because i'm tired seeing Megatron dying and being resurrected only for more humiliation and death);now the important here, new story with a new enemy or sequel, is how things will be made, how the story will be told. Because if it's to follow the same premises than it's predecessors, what's good in making 4, 10, 100 Transormers movies when we know at the beginning how things will go and how it will end? If a new movie is on the go, i think it's time for a chance? Do you?"
"tomgillespie2002","4","2","7","27 September 2011"," Basically, rubbish
","Big, loud, with various incomprehensible objects gesticulating in front of the screen; must be a Michael Bay film. The first Transformers (2007) film surprised me. A film based on childhood toys, and their 20 minute narrative adverts, about robots that can change into vehicles and other such objects, should not have worked. And to boot, directed by a well known pyrotechnics obsessive, and general hack of bullshit. But the first film had a certain charm, which was elevated by the Shia LeBeouf performance, which pretty much catapulted him, and encouraged Steven Spielberg (also executive producer of all the films) to take him as a new toy. After the debacle of the second in the series, 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, the fans and general audience wanted a Tranformers film that was as thrilling, funny, and silly as the first. Well, the idea is quite neat.<br/><br/>Turns out that the 1969 moon landing was not carried out just cause we could. No, it happens that there was something ""alien"" on the dark side of said moon. So Buzz Aldrin et al had the top secret mission of taking a peek at the craft that crash landed. And that craft was, of course, one that was occupied by some dead Autobots. Back to the present day and Sam Whitwicky (LeBeouf) has been shunned by the government that works with the Decepticons, and has to get a regular job. As Megan Fox was essentially sacked from the franchise for suggesting that Bay was like Hitler, we are led to believe that Sam has got himself a new stunner of a girlfriend (as Sam's mum states in a later scene, he must have a big cock!). So we are introduced to Carley (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's lips on legs), in a simple, tracking shot that follows her legs and arse: nice! She has a nice body, but her face is dominated by over-sized lips, and is about as charismatic as a transformer that can't transform: i.e. a van.<br/><br/>What transpires is a series of battles, instigated by some objects that have the potential of bringing the robot world through space and time to occupy planet Earth. Humans have been working with the Decepticons for years, which has helped them get information from various companies. When this action begins, the main setting is Chicago. An alien invasion- style visual style takes over, many scenes looking very similar to 2005's War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>The film does have some effective action sequences, but doesn't really deliver anything different that the previous sequel. Basically, it's rubbish. What always amazes me about these kind of films, is that we have developed our English language, that apparently also developed in a civilisation of robots, that existed in parallel in a distant galaxy. Well done Mr Bay, you have released yet another film littered with CGI spunk stains. Plus, the toy company, Hasbro, has a new film to sell their new line of transformers toys!! I have discovered recently that the new toys are not easy to transform, not like the ease of their 80's counterparts.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Michael Bay has reached the lowest point of his career!!! And it's not personal because I gave T1 & T2 a 8 each. There are so many flaws in this movie that I don't even know where to begin with, but I'll do my best.<br/><br/>1. Poor editing. Many Scenes didn't go with each other. They could either be deleted or shortened without anyone will ever notice! 2. The 'Lead' actress, whatever her name is. How many of you feel she's got 'I'm Hollywood & I'm fake' written all over her face?? 3. The 'Lead' actress...<br/><br/>4. The 'Lead' actress...<br/><br/>5. Plot. It's so awkward & shallow that if we threw in a different story in, no one would even care as long as there are robots in it.<br/><br/>6 The running time. This definitely has something do with the poor editing and its plot. The entire movie could be shot in 90 mins or less, but apparently they didn't think so, in which it starts to getting boring at a certain point.<br/><br/>7. Casting. NSA director, Sam's gf's boss, that former fat black marine and again The 'Lead' actress.<br/><br/>8. Were Sam's parents really needed in that movie? I totally forgot what scenes they were in, how about you?? In fact, I forgot about 99% of the movie right after watching it.<br/><br/>9. It's T3 now, not T1 anymore! You guys need bring up a notch if you want to keep your loyal fans. What has seemed cool in T1 & T2 might not do it for the audience in T3.<br/><br/>10. Michael Bay, Michael Bay, Michael Bay!!! Here are my suggestions to improve in T4 if there will be one: 1. Fire Michael Bay and bring Christopher Nolan on board.<br/><br/>2. Fire Michael Bay 3. Fire Michael Bay 4. Kidnap that 'lead' actress, whatever her name is. Make sure she won't be in any movie during our lifetime.<br/><br/>5. Write a better story and be more creative (Hint: Don't be boring!) It's a 200 million dollar movie and I'm sure it's possible to achieve that!"

And this film just confirms the death of Hollywood, this film has it all but just does not deliver. Sure it has fantastic effects, but even by bringing in a cast of forgotten over the hill actors just can't save Hollywood from becoming a sinking ship!

I think he just literally lost his f*/king mind somewhere along his controversial career of utter financial success and total intellectual failure.

"Chiron1987","8","2","7","5 July 2011"," No Longer My Transformers...But...
","I adore the Transformers. For me, they rank third behind Superman (and the DC Comics Universe as a whole) and ""Star Wars."" There was something so intrinsically and viscerally cool about normal looking vehicles and contraptions that could turn into giant, sentient robots. I ate up the original Generation One toys and the three seasons of the Sunbow cartoon up with such relish, and pretty much believed that these characters and this story could never be fully realized in a live-action movie.<br/><br/>Of course, I was wrong with 2007's ""Transformers,"" a film I enjoyed then and thoroughly love now. It filled me with such nostalgic gladness, but I knew even then that, despite hearing Peter Cullen's baritone protruding from the metallic lips of an honest-to-God, real (well, CGI, anyway) Optimus Prime, that this was no longer my time or my era. Generation One was dead and gone, and something entirely different had replaced it. However, I felt that the spirit of ""The Transformers"" remained and that was good enough for me.<br/><br/>Then, came the train wreck that was 2009's ""Revenge of the Fallen."" Blame for this debacle comes in many forms, not the least director Michael Bay's rush to start production on the film in the oncoming wake of the Writers Guild strike. The film was sloppy, poorly edited, choppy, and at times, really offensive. Yet, there were good things about it, just not enough to make me want to see the movie more than once.<br/><br/>""Dark of the Moon"" corrects many of the mistakes of ""Fallen,"" and expands and expounds upon the original film. It hearkens back somewhat to Generation One, but really does ring the death knell for that era of the franchise. This Optimus Prime, despite the same voice, is not the same Prime we all grew to love and look up to. This is a character that comes off as an actual general at war and a leader of a displaced race seeking refuge and peace. This Prime made the hard decisions to finally stop the Decepticon menace and fully embrace Earth as his home and mankind as his protectorate. That make me love this version of the character and look up to him even more than his G1 self.<br/><br/>Now, ""Moon"" is overlong, by about an hour. Excise the goofy, sophomoric, potty (literal) jokes, the stupid characters like Sam's parents, Agent Simmons -- hell, most of the human characters, then you have a nice, fast-paced, stream-lined action film. I never really cared for these people, at least not in the way I cared for the Transformers, particularly the Autobots, and what's oddest to me is that the newest additions to the cast of characters, like Carly, were the most intriguing and interesting.<br/><br/>The entire Chicago battle sequence is breath-taking and shows Michael Bay at his gratuitous best. The guy knows how to film battle scenes and ILM's CGI work is seamless and realistic. Everything about this movie seems expensive, but in a good way.<br/><br/>And what can I say about the original Galvatron, legend Leonard Nimoy, portraying good-guy-turned-villain Sentinel Prime? Well, it's good to hear Galvatron's voice one last time.<br/><br/>I don't know what will happen next with the Transformers' live-action franchise, but I'm intrigued to see it continue on in the hands of another set of filmmakers and designers. I'd love to see the blocky, chunky Transformers of the G1 era return, and maybe even hear Frank Welker as Megatron at last...but I doubt it'll happen. Why? Simply because these just aren't my Transformers any more.<br/><br/>And I'm okay with that."

","This film dragged. The story was weak so I was just waiting for the final showdown between the Autobots and Decepticons. I was hoping for something different from the first film but it seemed all the same. I guess you can only do so much with a bunch of machines pounding on each other. This film, like the second one, was a rehash of the first with similar stories and battle scenes. What's new in this film was the lack of chemistry between the lead actors. <br/><br/>Michael Bay simply got lucky with the first Transformers. I didn't like any of his previous work until that one.

It seemed like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was modeling for a shoot while in the movie<br/><br/>The action scenes were all fine, except there was shortage of them. Shia la bouf and team were jumping from floor to floor of a glass building while being shooted down by decepticons sounds really good, but when it occupies half an hour of an already prolonged movie, the only thought you have is to take out your 3d glasses and start playing on your ipod<br/><br/>The movie could have been way better if Sam Witwicky was not involved.<br/><br/>So, all i say is watch it if you are bored or below the age of 12 years, but watching Kung-fu Panda 2 again would be better"

","Having been a fan of the Transformers series from when i was a kid, i had some reservations about where this trilogy would go and whether it would live up to my expectations Now before you start thinking that maybe i set the bar way too high i ASSURE YOU I haven't, after all this movie is about fighting alien robots that can transform into various vehicles. The action sequences were always going to be good but the issues with plot that plagued Revenge of the Fallen have not improved on Dark of the Moon.<br/><br/>Without giving away spoilers for those who haven't seen it, i found myself constantly asking open questions-lots of why's, how's, what's when's and who's. It almost appears as though the film at its running time has been over edited(yeah you heard me) or maybe the wrong parts of it have been edited. Side stories that have no purpose being in the plot as well as characters you wish were annihilated by a stray decepticon rocket are given screen time. The rampant product placement, the idiotic childish attempts at humor, obvious plot twists and some of the unnecessary action sequences all designed to make you forget the plot holes big enough to swallow Cybertron. This film just need a simple enough plot to tie together the gaps between the action sequences and maybe 45-50 minutes shaved off the periods of dialogue that were simply not needed. Honestly you will find better story lines in the cartoons from the 80's.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this movie for people who honestly don't care about the story and are happy to spend their money seeing explosions. You will enjoy the visual spectacle even if you don't understand. However if you are the type of movie fan that needs a story that makes sense as well as action sequences than spend your cash on Captain America or Green Lantern."
"ticket_for_one","5","2","7","4 July 2011"," Will Transformers roll out for good? I hope so!
","I wasn't really impressed with this. In saying that, I believe that Michael Bay has matured as a director. Much better the dreadful 2nd film. Revenge of the Fallen being one of the worst films I have ever seen. Dark of the Moon is an improvement, but not by much. <br/><br/>WHAT I LIKED ABOUT DARK OF THE MOON. <br/><br/>The action is ramped up to pretty the same level as the first film with a bit more added. The solid set pieces towards the end of this film are what save it from being a complete disaster. One scene in particular that stood out in mind was the skyscraper scene involving Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese) and his band of rebels. Well choreographed stunt work and a brilliantly directed action, make it the best scene in the movie. Other than that, every other bit of action is more or less what we come to expect from the Transformers films. Robots beating on each other in slow motion. To be fair, it made the 3D stand that extra bit. Performance wise, Shia La Beouf continues to show his emotional range by yelling 'OPTIMUS' a couple of times. He's a capable actor and handles the comedic as well as the dramatic very well. Rosie Huntington Whiteley is an improvement over Megan Fox, but should stick to wearing lingerie in magazines. John Malkovich and Ken Jeong offer some laughs and little else. And Frances Mc Dormand does a good job playing quirky government agent. Finally credit to Bay for making this sequel darker than its predecessors. Finally you saw civilians being killed or blown up. There's no way the Transformers being what they are, can decimate half a city and there not be any civilian casualties. And that was one of the changes I asked to be made from the second film. It sounds sick doesn't it? The battle scenes in general were well filmed, plus on the technical side, I was impressed with visual effects. Human/ Transformer interaction and Transformer/Transformer interaction looked seamless. Industrial, Light and Magic living up to their reputation as the best in the business. Bay at best, is a action director and a very good one. The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbour are proof of how good he is when filming action. I'll watch with interest, to see what projects he has lined up in the future. <br/><br/>WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT DARK OF THE MOON. <br/><br/>Screwball and Wheelie return for more foolishness and continue to talk more nonsense and garbage to fill up the minutes. They're worst than Skids and Mudflap from Revenge of the Fallen. John Turturro returns for a third time. Why? I just hate his character. Great actor with a great CV, but his brand of comedy is overacted and unfunny. Would've been better if his character was killed off. Patrick Dempsey is a poor mans George Clooney, playing another useless character. A human Decepticon spy posing as an antiques dealer? Was he killed off in Grey's Anatomy or something? Josh Duhamel is just there for being there sakes. And Sam Whitwicky's millionaire parents (have no idea where the money came from) return with more nonsense. Thank God they only had 10 mins worth of screen time. This film is TOO long! Most of it is just boring. Seriously BORING! Unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the actual story. And some scenes that were part of the actual story, that didn't make any sense! It drags and drags! Then you have Sentiniel Prime. An old Autobot with a beard who turns traitor and sides with Megatron. Megatron who was a powerful jet in the first film, has now been reduced to a rusty dump truck on it's last legs. Script contains some of the worst dialogue ever and the plot about the magical interstellar pillars was just laughable. I now hear they'll be a Transformers 4! Is there any point? In saying that, if Unicron or Hot Rod were involved, I'd still go and see it. Because I'm a Transformers fan and I grew up watching Transformers All in all it is worth the release! But I saw nothing here that got me really excited or made me jump out of my chair and cheer. <br/><br/>Will Transformers roll out for good? <br/><br/>NEXT REVIEW CAPTAIN America."

","Too many questions than answers. Does he write his screenplay on the set? With the set pieces and the thought process that has to go into the action sequences (which covers most of the movie) seems impossible for that.. Is he that genius where he shoots what he feels like and covers it up with VFX later? Does Chuck Norris writer cringe hearing this movies dialogues? What is the gorgeous girl doing outside of a calendar or a ramp? Watching the graphics expertise makes me feel like a crazy amount of money, talent, time and effort is being drained down in the wrong hole. The VFX work is sophisticated, complex and involves heavy planning, thinking and execution effort and in my opinion Michael Bay would go a long way and win many hearts if he can try just being a visual effects supervisor. Really the work here is much better than Avatar or Avengers.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Fox is replaced by another hottie. Characters from the previous editions reprise same roles and dialogues. Nobody know what Decepticons are fighting for and Autobots are like overstayed guests.<br/><br/>With a long list of mechanical characters, Bay tried to bring in the entire Hollywood to elevate the missing aesthetic value like Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, John Turturo etc. Instead of utilizing their special talents to arrive at a fresh flavor, all these talented actors succumb to buffoonery along with the rest of the cast. The robots behave more human than the actual actors themselves which is another thing that makes me cringe. There is actually a weird scene where a division captain instructs his team to hold fire until he commands, while actually all of them are shooting.<br/><br/>If not for the visual effects grandeur, its rating would have been on the negative."

","First of all, I want to make my point : I have nothing against summer blockbuster ! They can be entertaining as hell, well packaged and visually impressive. Well, Mr.Bay, having a huge amount of money doesn't make you the right to do ANYTHING ! Where the first Transformers movie was right at many levels : the story and the characters weren't original but credible and the action maybe a little chaotic but the whole product was OK. With this last (I hope !) episode, Michael Bay and even the full cast don't seem to care about the movie : the comedy scenes are cheesy, action sequences are full of these outdated slow-mo straight out from Matrix, there are zero emotion and it's awfully TOO long ! There is too many shortcut in this movie, the invasion of the Earth rushed in 5 minutes like Bay was saying : Why am I wasting time telling a good story when I know I'm gonna hit the jackpot whatever happens ? And I rate this movie 5/10 because there is a few good action sequences in there like the fall of the building or the battle in NY, those moments should have been the crucial point of the movie."

","I did not know what exactly i was going into, I was ready for a flop follow up to Revenge of Fallen, but kept in mind it could be great, and it was quite that, wicked, wicked action scenes, the plot was mostly pulled straight from the show, and certain things were predictable, but only because that's how it should have happened. However it was also filled with an incredibly obvious amount of ""America! eff YEAH!"" but is overlook able for the rest of the music. I'd have to say truly the movie's biggest set back was the song(s if the ending credits song is a different one) by Linkin Park in it, there are very few songs that were as cringe worthy as that, and i felt my ears just might bleed...luckily it was only played once during the actual movie, also Carly, was way better than Fox's character(who they bash fairly hard in it) and actually did something in this movie that was worth a damn (other than awesome eye candy shots)"

I can't believe that a toy company with such a strong brand would allow their name to be tarnished with such trashy scenes when the primary audience is likely to be kids.

","Reading all the negative reviews about Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon was quite bothersome. Its pathetic seeing all these people going into a movie trying to pick at every single detail then downgrade the movie based on that.<br/><br/>Why not just watch a movie to enjoy it for once? Honestly, people must be very stupid going into a TRANSFORMERS movie expecting something artsy like Pams Labyrinth or what not. I've gotta say if any of you did expect that then you're a downright imbecile.<br/><br/>BUT does the movie deliver what it intended to deliver? YES IT GIVES US BRILLIANT CGI ACTION SEQUENCES and THE BEST 3D EFFECTS SINCE AVATAR.<br/><br/>Now I will agree to most of negative comments I've seen.<br/><br/>First and foremost, most of the acting was TERRIBLE and furthermore, the dialogue was just cheesy 90 percent of the time.But are these aspects really sufficient for the low ratings I've seen?<br/><br/>However, who is the intended audience? Is the intended audience elderly? Is the intended audience those whom are looking for a critically acclaimed film? OR Is the intended audience YOUNG and into brilliant CGI effects, explosions and machine vs machine mayhem? Ask yourself that.<br/><br/>Bear with me now, sit down and think VERY carefully. What is the main focus of this movie? Is it the main character? Is it even the human race? You may think so but essentially its not. Hence the title ""Transformers' In fact, Michael bay integrates the transformers as characters so well into the movie, that WE end up caring more about the integrity of the Autobots than the actual human characters.<br/><br/>Come now honestly, do we REALLY care if the main character dies? Not so much compared to say .....Ironhides death which was obviously employed by Michael Bay as an inflammatory device to evoke an emotional response. I have many people to vouch for me in this department because frankly, MOST people were angry when he got back stabbed by the Decipticons.<br/><br/>Now to those who were unhappy at Sentinel not taking his chance to kill Optimus. From the start it was BLATANTLY obvious that he may have had similar intentions to Megatron but his ideals were different. He was not a 'pure-evil' antagonist, and to not realize that would be quite naive to be honest.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are looking for an action packed movie with stunning 3D CGI effects and explosions to watch and ENJOY go watch transformers. If you are those people whom cannot enjoy a movie without criticizing every bit of detail then this is not the movie for you."
"bensonmum2","3","1","3","24 December 2017"," ""Whoa, we got us a little Mexican standoff!""
","There's so much I could write about Transformers: Dark of the Moon that I'm not sure where to begin. I think I'll start with my one word review - wretched. It's one truly wretched movie. I'm not sure how you spend almost $200 million and make something this bad, but Michael Bay found a way. I usually begin one of these with a plot summary, but with Transformers: Dark of the Moon, I don't see any point. The plot here doesn't really matter. The plot is pointless. It's all about big explosions. And if there's one thing Michael Bay can do, it's make a movie with big explosions. The problem is that without a story I cared 2 cents about, the big explosions get pretty boring pretty fast. At 2 hours 34 minutes and with no interesting story, this thing is like running a marathon in mud. It takes forever. By the time the film's big finale rolled around, I was done. I couldn't take anymore. What a bore! But to be fair, I went back and watched the last part about three times because I kept falling asleep. You would think that any movie that ends with giant robots doing battle would have an ending that would hold your interest. That's not the case here. And if you're going to begin your movie on the moon, why not end it on the moon? We've seen Transformers battle on Earth before, so why not take the final battle back to where it all began? What a missed opportunity. And does Michael Bay believe in editing. There's so much fat here that could have easily been cut out. For example, ss I said when writing about #2, why are Sam's parents even in the film? They add nothing but minutes to the runtime. That's just one example of the many I could cite. <br/><br/>And I realize I'm starting to ramble, so I better stop here. I could go on and on about the poor CGI, the bad inside jokes, and the embarrassing treatment of Leonard Nimoy's legacy, but I won't . I don't want to overstay my welcome like Transformers: Dark of the Moon."

Well, Age of Extinction was pretty good... Dark of the Moon was not. There is a lot of action and a lot of transforming robots, so if you are just in it for that you should be fine to watch it. If you expect a decent story or to be ""pulled into"" the movie, well that won't happen. Honestly this movie was dull. You don't need to see this movie to follow Age of Extinction, I would have to recommend skipping this one."

","Falling buildings, a very hot girlfriend and a lot of running, jumping, diving, falling and shooting. That's what sums up this utter piece of crap. <br/><br/>I never ever saw a movie this bad in my entire life. Even the superb visual effects couldn't cover up the lack of storyline and well constructed dialogs. <br/><br/>Maybe I can say something about the acting skills? Nope. There simply were none. It's really sad, because Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is one of the hottest girls I've ever seen on screen (at least when she doesn't purse her lips trying to look hot).<br/><br/>Overall it's a pity Michael Bay was in charge, because I remember the transformers cartoons as having an interesting storyline where you could really connect with the characters. In this movie, I couldn't. <br/><br/>Dark of the Moon lacks those same characters. Bay didn't even try to give them personality like the cartoons did. The action was to rapid, the scenes to short to get to know them on a deeper level. <br/><br/>And yes, even the action was horrible. As I said, the scenes were really short, jumping from one scene to the next without waiting, without explaining, without giving the watcher something to understand. I still don't know what was behind the dark of the moon... Something really creepy I think. <br/><br/>OK, I need to stop dissing this motion picture. The visual effects were at least great. But Dark of the Moon sucks on soooo many levels, I get angry every time I think about it. The creators of the cartoons didn't deserve this crap.<br/><br/>Please don't watch it!"
"taikung1","4","1","3","3 July 2014"," Spare Parts
","If you go into this movie with the assumption that this is just capitalizing on the other 2 Transformer movies, you will not be let down!<br/><br/>The movie was 2 and a half hours long which could and should have been shaved by at least 45 minutes. It started off a bit like having to listen to a book report that needed a certain number of words to be acceptable but eventually jumped into some action. The movie was extended to write all the fun characters back into the plot from previous moviesÂ… all except for Megan Fox who was replaced by Victoria's Secret's model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. This appears to represent a correction made to the 2nd installment as now there's another way to gauge how popular the movie was by how many hits her name gets on the internet.<br/><br/>There were more than a few quirky moments that made the audience laugh. The CGI was still off the charts which can almost justify renting on blu-ray and hitting fast forward to the good parts. Shai LeBeouf is talented and still has good delivery but even his lack of on screen enthusiasm is apparent for this role. John Turturro has to be credited with having the best comic relief and even wraps up the final scene to give viewers the impression that this was a good movie. Sadly there aren't any other notables as most of their character development has already been set in stone and starting to fade away over sequels. <br/><br/>To get the same effect of this movie, start watching the first movie and then pause anywhere in the middle of the last fight scene. During the break, gather all your unwanted electronics and throw them in a blender on low (to get the slow motion dramatic effect) for 20 minutes. Look up the new actress on line to catch a piece of the strange they're going for and then hit play.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the trailer for the 4th installment or read up on it but I predict either a prequel or maybe, to keep the plot on earth, the introduction of a new enemy that existed before the separation of the alien bots. To give the movie some credit there was a handful of people that did clap at the end. Happy it was over or maybe they missed the first 2?"
"fhuckbelieberstruebieall","6","1","3","8 June 2014"," It has its ups and downs
","To begin this is an extreme down-grade from the first two. I don't know about everyone else, but I LOVED the first two. Watching the third one once again I appreciate it MORE then I did the FIRST time I watched it. But, this is because I understand it a LITTLE bit more watching ti the second time.<br/><br/>I find this third installment extremely hard to keep up with. I take my eyes of the screen for 1 minute and suddenly they (the main characters) are no longer where they were and are some how in danger or out of danger. <br/><br/>This movie feels like they tried to jam a whole lot of information in one movie, they mention one idea, and that's it. They mention it ONCE, and so you are left behind thinking ""What, explain again?"". I still don't even know what the hell they were all fighting about. Something about something. It feels like it should have been TWO MOVIES, but then you think ""NOPE, I will not watch this thing stall out into bullshit"". <br/><br/>There are however some EPIC scenes. These scenes just keep you glued to the screen, even though you have no idea what is going on, and you're still wondering why everyone is fighting for, these scenes MAKE the movie.<br/><br/>Another great aspect are once again the creative and new designs of Aliens, weapons and gadgets. As one said in the film (no spoiler, just a quote) ""Why do all the Decepticons get all the good stuff?"" very true. It is extremely fun to see all these new unique Auto-bots, they are characters you just love. <br/><br/>As a fan it is hard to get attached to this new girl... I can see they try to enforce their love (I'm not into Romances, but!) BUT they get it right. Although it would have been nice for a change of personality, maybe a girl with a different body type, something different. But, it worked. I did miss seeing Mikaela (Megan Fox) I just loved her in the last two. <br/><br/>There isn't much comedy relief, and if there is you simply don't understand it as much because you really understand the plot. But it has its moments.<br/><br/>I GAVE THIS FILM A SIX (perhaps 6 and a half if I could). The first two were worthy of a 7-8. But this one lacked almost everyone that was good about the first two. It JUST CONTINUED ON AND ON. You get to the point where you think ""Omg just finish already, get to the point"". It was a drag. BUT it DOES have its MOMENTS. In every 'Transformers' film Sam has a problem. Number 1 was getting a girlfriend. Number 2 was saying 'I love you' and number 3 is getting a job. At least they kept that idea going. <br/><br/>Good film. Unfortunately the writers rushed it a bit.<br/><br/>Also, how do they procreate? I understand they're Robots... but they could clarify how they get the solid mental to change into them. PERHAPS in the future they will make a WHOLE FILM about the Auto-bots and Decepticons. No humans, just these two rivals battling on unknown planets. That's always fun."

","The first Transformers can at least be called a decent action flick. It had nearly all the elements which Revenge of the Fallen would go on to run into the ground. Dark of the Moon somewhat rectifies this, but still leaves a rancid taste in your mouth. The humor is still obnoxious and overused, Megan Fox's replacement is only somewhat less annoying, and the Decepticons have only regained some menace, but still remain paper machete targets for the Autobots and military. The camera work makes battles extremely hard to watch, not that you're missing out given Decepticons are simply punching bags these days. This movie really can't decide if it wants to be a Saturday morning cartoon promoting Hasbro toys or a series of raunchy jokes followed by scenes of robot organs being ripped out. Still it has some perks. The CGI is better than ever and there were two fights I actually enjoyed. If you want to see giant robots battling it out, see it if you must, but you're better off watching the first film or Pacific Rim."

The story was good as it unfolds from start and reaches the climax in the end. One must really enjoy watching it in a cinema and it really gives the best for the money spent. I took it so willingly that I watched it many times and every time the interest and entertainment was different. I must suggest all of you out there to see all three movies in one go to get the right enjoyment. I must admit that a new movie of the same franchise should be there to assist the previous three versions. The voice of ""optimus prime"" was so appealing and so invigorating that it really feels he is so concerned about the safety of the world and his fellow transformers and that he has full command on his voice. The movie is light comedy, full action; slight romantic and I must say all qualities in one feature film are quite appealing.

The jokes that involve robots didn't work, but the wackiness of the new human characters adds to the funny bits. Alan Tudyk is easily the funniest of the bunch.<br/><br/>The action bits featured in the trailer are actually most of the highlights of the action in the movie. Due to the use of 3D cameras in filming the movie, the fast cuts and camera shake that were prevalent in the first two movies are gone. The action is much more discernible.

And now, seeing the creation of new director ya3D can confidently say - Mr. Bay entirely kept his promise. The main advantage here is a very good and coherent script written by Ehren Kruger, this time alone - without colleagues to create the second part of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. Now the script, as compared with the second film, refined almost to the smallest detail, there are no inconsistencies and gaps. It becomes evident that received ""Golden Raspberry"" for the script to ""Revenge of the Fallen"" Ehren Kruger rehabilitated.<br/><br/>As a result, the script came from a terrific story, perhaps the most dramatic and tense, compared with the previous parts. The third part of the history of robots almost completely riddled with treachery, which enhances the drama.<br/><br/>On changes in the cast will not talk much - because of the well-known conflict with Megan Fox, director of the film took place girls photomodel Sam Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, igra3D which was the debut in the film.

Also I liked the brightness, and as a side note my eyes hurt much less than say on Avatar, and movie is almost 160 mins long. <br/><br/>2. F@ck the cardboard characters, I did not expect much and was there only for pure brainless kaboom action, which I got. The human baddie was weak though, and I still have no idea what Malkovich was doing there. <br/><br/>3. The girl. I see many of you demand Hellen Miren or Meryl Streep acting qualities from a chick in a Bay movie. I expect MY girl to be smart, intelligent and pretty, but in Bay movie she can be brainless idiot and seriously I do not care - so why so much whining? Don't understand. <br/><br/>4. The design. I see people bitch1n on the robots' design. What the f@ck where you expecting? Megatron transforming into giant gun? In my opinion, seeing how lazy production designers happen to be nowadays (see Skyline, or Green Lantern) the overall look of robots' devices, ships was t1ts. <br/><br/>5. Unlikable main protagonist. Wait... what? He was a pure everyman - b1tchy, frustrated and tired of how the world is constructed, looking for a job being pressed by parents and having issues in his relationship with a girl. I do not see any difference between him and guy posting rant SaM WUZ soooo 1RRRR1TAT1ING ZOMG WHAT A F@G GOT. <br/><br/>6. CGI. The composition was far superior to Avatar, I have not noticed any ""low-res"" textures that people complain about. I saw every dollar spent on this movie on the screen. Few scenes were done with so much taste that I was really proud of Bay (re: scene introducing Megatron, and dialog between Sentinel and Optimus about the latter being now the mentor since he's been on Earth long). The squirrel people jumping off the burning plane gave me goosebumps and that was what I expected from this ride (because I do not consider it a serious movie.) <br/><br/>Now. Having addressed these few issues I would also like to add I really loved the one sweet moment - in the highway chase scene there was a significant zoom on the rear view mirror of the car with standard OBJECTS IN A REARVEIW MIRROR MAY APPEAR CLOSER THAN THEY ARE text being shown with blurred bots in the background. Well it was a song by Meat Loaf for which Bay made a cool video and I truly loved this little trivia. <br/><br/>Closing my wall of text - and I know a lot shall not even bother to read it - I quietly ask you guys: do not overanalyze this. It's fun summer action flick, more of an experience than a film, a mixtape of cool action clishes for a tweleve year old in every one of us. Much better than the second one, and maybe even the first - but hey! stop analyzing! Cheer up and stop hating, life is better without hate isn't it? <br/><br/>PS. Buzz Aldrin scene was so touching and directed with great taste. Brilliant."

","Director Michael Bay's 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a Visual Treat of a Film. The Special Effects, The 3D Impact, The Direction, are awe-inspiring. However, as a film, though better than the 2nd part, This action-packed saga still falls short, in comparison to it's first masterstroke! However, the devotees of the franchise, won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is the same thing again. Human vs Machines, The Good versus The Bad. It's old wine, that comes intact with, as mentioned before, stunning Special Effects, good 3D & Effective Direction, working on it's advantage.<br/><br/>Writer Ehren Kruger, should have worked on the film more. Though not at all boring, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is very long & slightly dragged. The climax, which runs for nearly 40-minutes, is visually captivating, but as a whole of a screenplay, is lazy and takes advantage of the top-notch technology it's blessed to have.<br/><br/>Michael Bay Cinema is different. It's Escapist, Ambitious & Explosive. I have liked him as a storyteller, and even though the writing material isn't as sharp as expected, Bay still manages to do his job effectively. Cinematography is good. Editing is average. Art Design is nice.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Shia LaBeouf continues to impress, in a role, that he plays for the third time. Rosie looks good and does fairly well. John Turturro & Frances McDormand are first-rate. Turturro, is sure bring the house down with his witty dialogue delivery, that is truly funny. Josh Duhamel is decent. Tyrese Gibson gets limited scope. Patrick Dempsey plays the bad guy ably. Kevin Dunn is sweet. John Malkovich is wasted.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is meant for Transformers Fanatics, mainly."

","When this film came out in 2011 I fully intended to go to the theater and watch it, but I never got around to it. Flash years later and I found it for cheap with the fourth Transformers film so I thought I would get it as I had seen neither film. I really enjoyed the first film and I thought the second film had its moments. A lot of people had told me that this one was a better film than the second one so imagine my surprise as I found it worse...a lot worse! I literally have to scratch my head as the first film had such potential and had the makings of an awesome franchise. The second one was not great as it was too long, but the action was cool and I liked how Optimus Prime was the one to take out the bad guys instead of Shia's character Sam. This one though just was bad. When I watch a film based on Transformers I expect a film where the Autobots must do battle with the dastardly Decepticons. I do not watch it to see an advertisement for the military and see Sam get another really hot chick on the heels of the last one. I also do not watch this film to see humans perform stunts while showing the minimum amount of robot fighting it can show. It is almost as if they have a limit of a few seconds before they have to flash to more human action! <br/><br/>The story, well it is rather a incomprehensible mess. We see that the moon landing back in the day was actually a way to examine a mysterious ship crashing onto our planet. Flash years later and we get to see Sam's latest girl's butt. We also get to see a man who has no business with her whining about not having a job and not feeling important because he saved the world so he deserves more. The humor is worse than the second film and the scenes of him interviewing are not fit for an action film. Once again, I want to see robots, not filler garbage. The film ran 2 hours and 20 minutes and they want to show a bunch of nonsensical crap. It adds nothing to the plot and is just a way to have humans relevant in a story they should not be relevant in. Meanwhile, the Autobots are doing missions for us and keeping a lookout for the Decepticons and there is something that ties in with that moon landing that may turn out to be a deadly secret and there is a boss who has nice cars and John Malkovich in a very bizarre role that makes as much sense as the rest of the film and an even more awkward scene with Sam and some guy in a bathroom stall. We get a battle at the end with the Autobots against some very nondescript Decepticons which makes me wonder if they even try. The only Decepticon that stood out was Shockwave who was sadly underused as he actually looked cool and Megatron was almost not relevant.<br/><br/>So the Transformer films seem to get progressively worse as they continue. I am finding part of the problem is that Bay wants to focus too much on the humans. Shia was insufferable in this one and I wanted to see him less not more. I did not want to see a guy who I could beat down in a fight in less than two minutes taking down a Transformer. The guy and his gal survive some stuff in this one that makes the old Indiana Jones action scenes seem less ridiculous. I also cannot stand the way the Transformers keep getting less distinct as the series goes on. I didn't even recognize Megatron at first glance and why is it so difficult to give him his trademark bazooka gun? Why do they keep using swords and stuff? Never did that much in the comics or cartoon. Why can't Optimus have his awesome gun and have it sound the same way it did in the cartoons? <br/><br/>So this one just was not enjoyable for me at all. I did not want to see humans versus robots, but rather Autobots versus Decepticons. That last portion in Chicago was just one long bore as you get to watch people paragliding, people in collapsing building and then you see Optimus and think, ""Oh boy, now the action begins!"" and he promptly gets caught in wires. Just does not make any sense, nor does the series. Lets have little cute annoying robots because the film is enjoyed by kids, but the first time we see Shia he you get to see his girlfriend's butt. I honestly do not see how this one did so well at the box office, it was just a mess with a overly complicated story to get humans more involved. In the cartoon, the Decepticons wanted energy from Earth and the Autobots tried to stop them, that's it! Oh, and during their movie they had a huge planet that transformed! Heaven forbid they do that. Speaking of that 1986 film, it was a way to introduce kids to a new line of toys, so I find it sad that it had a better story and better action than this film! Going to watch the fourth film as I got it as part of the set, but I do not have high hopes for it; however, at least Shia will not be in it."

","This is the dumbest of dumb movies. There is just nothing in it to recommend it to cinema-goers. Obviously shed-loads of money have been thrown at it but they forgot to make it good. It might have been better had the actors been any good but it is hard to say that anyone did a good job of their contribution to this mindless trash. I suppose the special effects and CGI are fairly well done but that is just not enough to make it entertaining to the viewer. A movie has to involve its audience rather than have them checking their watches every five minutes. I think I lost interest in it before the title of the movie appeared on the screen and it just got worse. I am really astonished that the target audience (12-22?) is willing to put up with this - better sci-fi movies have been made with a fraction of the budget and a lot less effort. Perhaps they do so well with these movies because their audience manages to still have hope over their experience. So sad to witness actors of the calibre of Malkovich getting involved in this crap."
"Leofwine_draca","4","1","4","23 August 2016"," More noisy nonsense
","DARK OF THE MOON is the third and final instalment of the TRANSFORMERS trilogy and a film that's pretty much indistinguishable from the previous two entries in the series. It's another overlong, noisy, and completely over the top offering from Michael Bay, who as a director understands nothing of nuance, subtlety, or how to properly direct his actors.<br/><br/>The plot is vapid and routine. Once again the Autobots and the Decepticons are back on Earth and battling it out. The best thing about the film is the calibre of the special effects; the CGI is endless and exemplary, and shiny chrome and plate metal have never looked so good. Kudos to the special effects guys for creating such a realistic-looking race of giant robots and featuring them for so much of the screen time.<br/><br/>I admit that I got a basic enjoyment from this film from watching the endless destruction of both cities and robots. There's something of an appealing kaiju quality to it. Unfortunately, the rest of the elements of the film are rubbish. Shia LaBeouf is really awful in these films, not even making an effort, although the worst actor in it is Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley, who doesn't even try to act; she just stands around and looks dumbly on. Jon Turturro is here, doing a bad impersonation of Al Pacino, while Frances McDormand comes in to pick up her pay cheque. The worst thing about Ehren Kruger's dumb-as-nails script is his insistence on going for the lowest common denominator throughout, i.e. aiming it at the teenage male crowd, thus including endless stupid comedy relief (those mini-Transformers) and generally spoon-feeding to viewers."

","As the battle rages on Cybertron between the Autobots and the Decepticons, an Autobot craft carrying a secret cargo is launched into space, eventually crashing on the dark side of the moon. Years later, the Decepticons put into motion a plan to secure the contents of the craft— artefacts that would help them finally win their war, if only it wasn't for the intervention of plucky teen Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), his 'clearly out of his league' girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and their metal pals.<br/><br/>I watched the first two Transformers films in the company of my son, but I'm watching this one alone: I simply cannot subject my poor boy to any more of this mindless drivel. Admittedly, I thought it would be impossible for Michael Bay to make a more terrible film than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but here it is 154 minutes of noisy, CGI-filled crap that easily ranks amongst the very worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>A man for whom more is never enough, Bay smothers his ridiculously OTT action with expensive CGI special effects, overloading the senses, yet never managing to generate any feeling of excitement or tension. Frequent ill-judged comedy only goes to make the whole thing an even more painful experience, one that not even Huntington-Whiteley's hot bod can prevent me from awarding the lowest possible rating."

Give any film school 19 year old a billionth of the budget and only his mother Frank as an actress and a light bulb as the only prop and he or she will still make a movie that has more plot, content, acting, visually entertaining anythings, drama, humor, entertainment and light bulbs. <br/><br/>It will have less explosions.

Does Micahel Bay sit at home at night making list of actors he wishes to ruin?. To be honest i couldn't get through this movie the first time and even forcing myself to watch it so i could properly review it i could barely stand to watch the whole thing from start to finish. Shia La bouf gives his normal screamy whinny performance and how we are meant to believe that he can land a gorgeous and successful Rosie Huntington-whiteley by walking up to her and bragging about getting a medal off the president and then continuously acting like a jerk for the whole movie is beyond me. I could rant about this movie all day but i digress, save yourself the trouble and never ever watch this movie ( or any other Transformer movie). I hate this movie."

","I spent an evening in a room with a TV set, for reasons that don't matter in this review. It turned out that a producer on one of the channels wanted to treat the audience with a Michael Bay double feature. The reason for that was the cinema premiere of Transformers: Age of Extinction.<br/><br/>Quickly i started treating the TV set as moving picture on the wall and did some other things while occasionally casting a glance in it's direction. But i didn't really miss much. It quickly became clear that this movie has great special effects bordering with a video game brought to cinema. Therefore the second star in my rating.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf has one and the same facial expression throughout most the movie which also summarizes his acting in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley might look interesting in some men's magazine, with or without her clothes, but as soon as she opens her mouth, her inability to act becomes obvious, even at the low level implied by this movie.<br/><br/>Even this is too much text for such a moneymaking masterpiece."
"phubbs","2","1","4","22 September 2014"," Transformers: Dark of the Moon
","So here we are again and right from the start with the intro of Shockwave I was disappointed yet not particularly surprised. Moving on we are introduced to a talking LaserBeak and a small troll like Autobot called Brains! oh my heart sinks and we haven't even begun.<br/><br/>OK well on the plus side there is some nice humour in this new installment from various characters that did make me smile. Turturro as always is quality with his snappy dialog where as Malkovich adds an impressive little performance I didn't really see coming, small but sweet. Ken Jeong is an uprising star in my books and his performances have all been good so far, in his short role here he doesn't disappoint with a cracking little show. Unfortunately we still have to sit through the annoying screaming and twitching of LaBeouf whose participation in these films has damaged his credibility big time. <br/><br/>As for new entry Rosie Huntington-Whiteley...well I've not seen a more horrifically bad performance in sometime, the girl is beautiful, she can pout like no ones business and I'm sure she models well but acting is clearly a step too far and should never be tried again. Its actually fitting she's in this film as to be honest this glitzy overblown mess fits her pretty princess attitude perfectly. Shots of Whiteley up against super cars? check, anyone notice she's still wearing her posh high heels during the finale showdown!.<br/><br/>Anyone actually asked themselves how a geek like LaBeouf's character somehow manages to get these girls in these films!? talk about fantasy! Basically the inclusion of bling actors such as Gibson pretty much sum up the whole franchise.<br/><br/>The film gains a tad more respect with the continued talents of Weaving and Cullen. Added to the gang are Nimoy and Remar, Nimoy of course being experienced in voicing Gavaltron in the animated and better Transformer movie of 86.<br/><br/>Credit where credits due you must applaud the CGI effects, they are very impressive and look good as they screech around highways with multiple explosions going off around them. It looks faultless and along with Bays pretty direction and fetish of the military, explosions and slow motion against sunsets its a picture for sure. As before we still have the same issue as the previous films where its virtually impossible to tell what the hell is going on when the bots fight. You still can't distinguish between Autobots or Decepticons accept for their eye colour with most Transformer characters just coming across as large shiny whirring clicking statues of CGI metal. The rather long finale highlights this problem by adding massive amounts of building carnage and debris into the mix making it completely impossible to make out what on earth is going on, its just insane!<br/><br/>I still can't stand the recreation of classic designs for the new film. The new creations they come up with for new Transformers are terrible and why do all Decepticons look like monsters, insects or wild animals? did I even see a 'Predator' type Decepticon with dreads at one point? <br/><br/>The film is overly long and HUGELY clichéd (every cliché in the book). Much of the film feels like a music video or adverts for super cars as Bay tries to evoke emotion but fails miserably by adding rock music over sequences of supposed trauma and horror, plus the whole thing is sooo God Bless America.<br/><br/>There are also so many poor sequences with questions such as how did Sam kill Starscream exactly? what was that gauntlet thing he had? how did the Sam and the others manage to get out of the skyscraper that was practically destroyed and virtually at a 90 degree angle? they just walked out of the doors it seems with no worries? Where does Optimus and the main Autobots vanish too for most of the finale battle? and who was that crappy balding professor looking Autobot with the British accent that got executed!!? just faceless characters for killing...poor film making.<br/><br/>People say this is the better of the trilogy, I can't see it. Its a bit darker as we see people killed in this film plus Optimus being brutal at the very end but for me this is just as bad as the previous two making it hard to try and decide which is the better film, is there a better film?<br/><br/>(Can't believe Optimus lets Cybertron get destroyed!! as if!)<br/><br/>2/10"

","Growing up in the eighties, I used to watch the Transformers in their earlier cartoon incarnation and long for a proper big-screen film to do them justice. Three films in and I'm still waiting.<br/><br/>Number Three starts off well - the linking with real twentieth century history is a nice touch, but then the usual set of two dimensional 'heroes' take over and any promise turns to cliché.<br/><br/>The humans are either macho soldiers who only live (and die) to serve the U.S. of A. The scientists are all only there for comic effect. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looks great, but does little to add to the story (plus has an interesting ability to simply stand still in the middle of a warzone in order to safely survive it). Shia LaBeouf does what he always does, i.e. kill more Decepticons that the entire Autobot army put together. Seriously, the guy is completely indestructible and has the superpower of being able to shout several miles across a trashed city to his friends. I don't know why he doesn't just take on the big bad robots all on his own and give Optimus and co a holiday.<br/><br/>I reckon a cut should be made of this film where it completely takes out all human characters as the robots are far more interesting. Optimus and Sentinal Primes are the stars. Even the other robots are bland and you can't tell one from the other (apart from the two small really annoying ones who must come from the same planet as Jar Jar Binks).<br/><br/>Enjoy the robots. Ignore the humans (and the plot and the over the top special effects and the numerous plot holes and the 2D acting and the clichéd characters and the fact that it's only designed to sell toys). I could go on. I hated every human moment of this film. I'd rather just watch Optimus Prime do some sort of monologue for two and a bit hours.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

Purely because they don't like how much it follows Sam Witwicky. I can only presume these haters, either never watched the original 80's TV series or movie, or just never payed attention, because the Witwicky family has always been around. Daniel Witwicky was one of the main characters in the 86 Movie. He was always with the Hot Rod and the Autobots in Autobot City. Which we can only presume he is a descendant of Shia LaBeouf's character since the events o the old series take place after the Michael Bay Movies.

","For the eyes, this film hits it on the spot with its high quality CGI and convincing almost real looking battle scenes between the now well known transformer auto bots. The scenes of huge explosions and mind blowing action scenes will leave you on the edge of your seat. However, like previous films the storyline is weak, and this time Imean REALLY weak. Although in someways believable, the storyline has so many plot holes that leave you thinking ""why did he not do that earlier?"" and moments like ""come on, kill him already!"". This would be great for the younger audience but is almost belittling the older audiences to this film. The actors also lack some of the most basic acting skills. Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) lacks one of the most basic needs of an actor. Emotion. Her performances are completely dull, her face couldn't look more boring. Of course the casters only wanted her for her ""outstanding"" good looks, but you'll soon become fed up of her scenes which lack any depth and any sense of realism. This includes the many incredibly cheesy love scenes between Sam and Carly where there ""loving"" relationship which is portrayed in all of the stereotypical ways you would expect to see, but acted so incredibly badly.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is great for its CGI, but if your IQ is higher than 12, this is not a film to be taken seriously."

","Micheal Bay's idea of what makes a film ""epic"" is that it has to be bigger, louder, and longer (the longest one yet), than ever. And that's really all there is to the process. No sense in nit-picking apart this familiar heap, because even with something as drastic as the female lead of the movie undergoing not just a change in actress, but a change into an entirely new character, this is exactly the same deal as before. This is a tad bit better than the preceding installment in the series, because the action sequences are a bit more comprehensible than the putrid blur of overly polished CGI colliding with impossible to grasp chaos that was the spastic seizure of colors and lights called Revenge of the Fallen. But even with the slightly noticeable refining of the control and pacing in the special effect mayhem this time around to show that Bay is serious about his special effect action, it's still more than obvious that it's still the only aspect of his movies that he focuses on, and pours any effort into. And these action sequences are of course awesome if you just want straight up kick-ass action, as they're everything fans of blockbuster brutality will get their adrenaline fix over, but it's an incredibly tiresome and painful time getting to them with all the unnecessary filler scenes of immature comedy that drag on and on and serve no ultimate purpose. People argue that Transformers movies are good for good action and great special effects, but they seem to forget that this argument isn't valid if these dumb scenes are overlooked. Nothing has changed or at least improved in these movies by the now third installment, and it's getting incredibly predictable and annoying, and it's a bad sign when something gets more annoying with each installment, and goes on LONGER than before with each new installment. If Dark of the Moon is an indication of anything by this point in the series, then it's that no matter how many Transformers movies are made after this one, it's all downhill from here at this rate."

With a runtime of 154 minutes, the movie is simply too long.<br/><br/>On the good side, the special and sound effects are top notch (as expected for a $200 million movie) and the action scenes are less hectic and with less use of shaky-cam than in the first two movies, but still quite annoying (During the battle scenes the situation still occurs where you simply don't know who's a Decepticon and who's an Autobot).<br/><br/>The movie works ultimately way more as a big ad for the Hasbro toys as an independent full length feature film. (Where do the new Autobots that weren't in the first movies come from? Probably from the Hasbro Marketing Department.)<br/><br/>But what really makes me scratch my head is why they would cast Frances MacDormand and John Malkovich. Their parts give them no chance at all of showing their talent, while at the same time the target moviegoer has no idea who these actors are.

Once again Shia LeBeouf must fight alongside the Autobots to defeat the Decepticons, this time they are after Sentinel Prime an Autobot disabled when his ship crashed into the moon. It turns out it is all a plot to rebuild their home world using humanity as slave labour.<br/><br/>At two and a half hours this film is far too long; the action does look great with robots transforming, fighting and blowing things up; the problem was the best action isn't exciting if one doesn't care about the characters. The central character is fairly annoying; whining about how his deeds in previous films went largely unrecognised, getting jealous about his new girlfriend's boss and getting upset when government officials didn't welcome him with open arms when the Decepticons started to cause trouble again. The film's attempts at humour did nothing for me although I must admit my ten year old nephew thought they were funny! Over all I wouldn't recommend this unless you are a fan of the franchise; no doubt if you liked the previous films you'll like this too."

And things do blow up, get smashed and otherwise destroyed in every way imaginable within a ridiculously long 154 minutes.<br/><br/>While not the worst in the series, ""Dark of the Moon"" is miles away from the first film (which isn't saying much). Just like ""Revenge of the Fallen"" the film is crammed full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. New characters both human and robotic crowd the screen many spewing ""comic relief"" lines that detract from the story.

Did the director or the writer get a blow in the head or something since the last movie? Transformers 3 is horrible. It was hard to follow, Rosie was modeling another new dress or new lingerie on the screen, her acting was not entirely bad however she did not appeal to me as a nice character. Megan Fox did so, and I was actually complaining about her acting before. Not any more. There is now a new level zero for acting. Also, the language was so foul and I am not a puritan, but I don't think I have heard so much cussing before in just one movie. They did not cuss much at all in the previous movies. This was a cussing extravaganza. I consider it of VERY bad taste in that respect.

Where's the emotional roller coaster? Where's the up-and-down modulation pace-wise? Interesting film in some ways, but I'd have to agree with one reviewer who said that the near-$200M budget for ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a horrible waste of money. Michael Bay evidently made this film this way because he COULD, but not necessarily because he SHOULD. Michael, next time save back half of budget, create a more intimate film, and put the rest in a trust fund for starving artists."
"Antagonisten","Null","1","4","14 November 2011"," A complete waste of time
","I know that Michael Bay is the king of crap, and in that regard slamming one of his movies for being a jumbled mess is probably pointless. But still, despite myself I enjoyed the first two Transformers-movies. The first more than the second, but the second was alright all things considered. There has always been a mental cramp when it comes to comic-relief and the scripts have always been paper-thin. But something still appealed to me, I guess I could blame my 1980's childhood with a box full of Transformers-toys.<br/><br/>First of all, I said before that the scripts were paper-thin for the previous Transformers-movies. Considering that, this movie seems written on a napkin and then added to and subtracted from in a system of loose papers. Then someone dropped the pile of papers and all the pages got mixed up and nothing was where it was supposed to be... But Michael Bay seemed to say ""screw it, we'll just shoot the movie anyway"". If I say that this movie makes no sense, I'm being as kind as I could ever be. Most of the time it's just a confused mess of events piled on top of each other. There is no cohesion at all, there is no plausible connection to the story from the first two movies. I understand that the writers were probably struggling here to find a new approach and create something out of nothing story-wise. But they chose the wrong direction. Completely.<br/><br/>Second point, this movie is almost one hour too long. There are so many places where this movie could have been cut, trimmed and polished. It would even have helped with the story because it's such a mess now that you could remove most of it without it really detracting from your understanding.<br/><br/>Third point, this movie wastes a few pretty good actors. And no, I don't mean Gray's Anatomy, but rather John Malkovich and Frances McDormand. I think that for them this was a fire-and-forget movie. Just go in there, do the scenes, forget about it and smile when you see your bank-draft. Because people are not the main thing here, the special effects are. There is no room for characters, proper dialog or building good drama. It seems like Bay sat in his directors chair and said ""Oh, these people have been talking for almost a minute, let's have a robot smash through the wall and break something before people fall asleep"".<br/><br/>In the end this really is a complete waste of time. Special effects are, just like in the previous movies, very well done indeed. Product placements are very obvious and hugely embarrassing for all involved, especially for the companies that payed to be shown in such a crap movie. I guess if you are twelve years old and have ADD there might be something here for you, but everyone else should just stay away. This is a brainless blockbuster in every wrong way imaginable."

Rose Huntington Whitley just isn't beautiful. She is tall and slim but her face is way below average - actually quite frightful and her acting isn't good. Her diction is poor for a British actress too. Huge mistake replacing Megan Fox who was the only good thing about the last 2 movies.

"bob the moo","Null","1","4","23 October 2011"," A dark plot ruined by silliness, corny touches, pointless franchise characters and everything done OTT just because they can afford it
","What is there left to say about this endless franchise? I guess that the summer season will always produce overblown effects movies that make for easy crown-pleasing noise – it may as well be the devil we know rather than one we don't. This third film opens with a surprisingly engaging rewriting of history to place the Transformers at the heart of historical events from the middle of the last century. This is the preamble to a story that sees the city of Chicago in ruins, people vaporised in front of the camera and a plan to enslave humanity to rebuild the lost world of Cybertron. I'm not suggesting it is Shakespeare but for sure the plot on the face of it offers at least something of interest.<br/><br/>Sadly within seconds of his opening, we are introduced back into the same nonsense that makes these films so difficulty to enjoy. The silliness of the dumb ""comedy"" that they try to introduce, the overly wordy plot exposition (these films normally assume that most of the audience are too dumb to follow without it all being explained via one character explaining things to the other) and just the sheer unnecessary overblown nature of everything that does hurt the film badly. The plot is hurt by it because it is not given room to breathe, while we see plenty of devastation, we are never allowed (or even encouraged) to feel anything about any of it. I'm of the opinion that interesting sci-fi can still be full of action – but this film seems to be in an either/or camp because it is all about the spectacle here.<br/><br/>Once we do get rolling with that though, it is hard to deny that the film is technically very impressive. The effects are great and the sheer scale of it as a film is impressive – Bay has an ego for sure, but given the cost and the complexity of the projects he pulls of, one can understand why. And make no mistake he has done what he set out to do with this film – it is just that personally it is not enough for me to simply have effects thrown in my face. If only some of the effects shot money could have been put towards the script then maybe we could have had decent characters, or comedy that is funny, or a tone that actually draws the audience in. Sadly we get none of these things, all we get is a constant audio/visual assault that is good for that, but that alone. The action does impress even if it doesn't engage and, as much as it is an overused device, I did appreciate the slow-motion simply so I had a fighting chance of seeing who was hitting whom etc.<br/><br/>The script is responsible for the silly dumb comedy (Sam's job interviews?) and also the unnecessary characters that are now just cluttering up the screen. So Sam returns which is understandable, it is hard to jettison your main human character, but he is a poor character – an unlikeable little oik portrayed with the usual lack of charisma and presence by LaBeouf. As we all know Huntington-Whiteley replaces Fox and her part in the film is made clear from her first shot (it is of her legs and ass). This is all she is and, while easy on the eye she is stiff and unnatural throughout the film, feeling like little more than a doll. While she is poor, she is not as annoying as the many returning characters who simply add nothing but brand-familiarity; it also hurts that several of them are played by very good actors. Turturro is an embarrassment – nothing else to say. Gibson and Duhamel are both good at the ""running with guns"" thing but their presence as characters is daft and again hurts the narrative. Dempsey is a decent turn while McDormand at least has the decency to look like she's there for the money and do as little as possible. Dunn and White return as his parents – someone thinks their characters are funny and worth bringing back to do the same old stuff over and over, they are wrong. John Malkovich does a stupid and unnecessary character that achieves nothing but earn him money and lose him respect. But this isn't an actor's film is it? It is about the action Overall Transformers 3 is just what you expect it to be. Not quite as bad as the second film but it has all the strengths you expect (technically expensive) and all of the weaknesses too (almost everything else). It is an ""event"" movie so the normal rules don't apply, but I liked the plot and I liked the effects – a bit of work on the script, dropping loads of characters, dropping sappy rock ballads and maybe letting the camera stay in one place for longer than 2 seconds and MAYBE this could also have been an enjoyable film rather than a technically impressive battering. It is empty and lacking atmosphere, heart and intelligence while it rushes to throw as much action and money onto the screen as possible – whether the audience care about what they are seeing or not."

","For those who saw the previews and commercials, I'm guessing you were probably waiting for a mystery that would be cleverly be revealed during the middle of the show and make you think a little, instead, almost right from the start of the movie, the mystery behind the ""dark side of the moon"" and discovery of the ship is explained right away, and it really killed the excitement in me. To put it this way, I felt like, ""That's what this is about? And you killed the mystery in one minute?"" It was a very cliché movie on top of it, and Sam had developed into a cute-guy, hyper-stressed, young-adult with a cliché inferiority complex. When his parents came to meet him, it added to the painfulness of the movie, having to hear his mom's awful unfunny Hell-voiced little lectures and her usual sexual-innuendos, which I'm sure made a lot of kids and teens uncomfortable to watch, with or without their parents. They might has well have been tossing sex toys around and using full vulgarity, because the innuendos were so obvious. The movie was also fast and hectic, and a nonsensical slapstick weirdo ugly Asian co-worker was added to the hysteria (mostly unfunny hysteria). I really did not like the cliché mean, strict interviewer-bosses sam was meeting. From what was shown, you'd think all managers of companies were evil. The model-looking woman that replaced the original girlfriend was a really bad match up for Sam, she just didn't fit in the movie well. She looked like too much of a model and like a fish out of water. She looked and sounded like she belonged in Australia... hey wait a second, beautiful girl with Australian accent, why does that seem so familiar... And of course, there were the glorified government saviours of the citizenry, who mainly are the good guys. Of course there would never be anyone bad in the military, nope, all soldiers are good guys, and Leave it to Beaver was such an accurate show reflecting reality.<br/><br/>The movie was a tragedy in that there were incredible special effects seens, ones that were worthy of awards and for ground-breaking special effects setting a new bar to be surpassed, but it was mixed up with a few really funny parts, but also the incredible shallowness and narcissism of the main characters, mainly Sam, Optimus Lies and his cliché Australian moron transforming thugs (I don't even remember those two transforming!) and the Transformer Nimoy. There was also some grossness in the movie, with little mechanical repair-bugs moving around Megatrons' ugly uncool-looking body, which genuinely seemed like some nasty cockroaches, which unlike the ones in the Predators movie that ran around those weird aliens, WERE truly gross-looking. It was a very kid-appealing movie, and which unfortunately, has probably influenced many kids and adults into thinking that being a hyper, neurotic, insecure but self-centered impatient bipolar person is what to aim for in life if you want to be happy. To think that many millions of dollars went into that, and many more will be spent into spreading this cosmetically prettied up disease, is tormenting, to me at least.<br/><br/>eternian.wordpress.com"

I am not concerned about continuity with the first two movies (I never saw the first and the second is just as forgettable as this one will be). The Sam character should never be given words because the writers have no clue how to develop a character. I can suspend my disbelief for giant mechanical extra terrestrial life and even an unlikely hero, but not for the painful dialogue that was supposed to flesh out the latter. I am not looking for poetry, but something that will not make me groan. Pairing Sam with a pretty woman largely for exploitation also cheapens what could have been a much better action movie. Leave out the fan service and focus on the story. Transformers has potential to be good grown up entertainment. Like Batman, I hope that somebody else tries to recreate the characters one day.

I would understand the disappointment if the movie was low-budget, but it wasn't. It was full to the brim with cgi action scenes and special effects, the action was almost constant and yet not satisfying. The only kind of action scenes I can remember are with with things collapsing, people falling, and Sam (Shia LaBeouf) shouting his girlfriend's name. The autobots where absent in the majority of the film, and there were almost no fight scenes involving the transformers. Even the last battle, which we've been waiting for the entire film, lasted for less than 5 minutes, and it wasn't so epic after all. The creators also tried to make Sam look tougher in the third movie, which doesn't suit him. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as the new girl was beautiful (too beautiful for Sam to be having her from the beginning of the film actually), but that's as far as it goes. Furthermore, they put more characters to make the script funnier (Malcovich, Frances McDormand, and the two little autobots) but they overdid it and the result was kind of childish. To sum up, I just believe that they could have put all this budget to better use."

John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and John Torturro are wasted in horrible roles with very limited screenspace. While most of the human characters are dull, another major disappointment is that you won't get to see much of the Transformers Michael Bay has a reputation of making expensive lavish with no heart. 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' definitely fits in that category."

","I hate it when people rate some movies just because the story was cliché or predictable, did it ever occur to those people that wasn't the goal in some movies. there's plenty of other great movies with a great storyline, and that was what they wanted. Movies are made for you to escape reality and be entertained. thats what transformers 3 is about! Entertaining you with some badass robot action! Who cares about how intelligent the story was, that wasn't Micheal bays intention. his intention is to show u some crazy action. this movie is so awesome! and really if u think about it, are you really gonna expect a smart storyline about alien robots? NO! ur gonna get a normal action movie storyline, but with amazing effects. bay outdid himself with the effects. Some of the best action scenes I've ever seen. that was why i went to go see this, to see alien robots beat the hell out of each other. i saw the movie for what it was, a badass action flick! I 100% recommend this movie if you're looking for a fun time and some of the greatest special effects in a long time."

","After the disappointing Revenge of the Fallen, director Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg release the latest entry of their Transformers series.

Unfortunately, his ship crashed on the moon and the invention is forever lost, well, until the autobot come to earth. Dark of the Moon's main story is the fight between Decepticon and Autobot to retrieve this invention because whoever possess it have the power to turn the tide of the war. The story actually pretty good if only Bay didn't mixed it (probably in 70/30 portion) with Sam's story. The human side of story in Transformers is not only unimportant, it's annoying and take too much of the film. I don't care about Sam's hardship to get work and settle down, i don't care about Sam's romance story. I watch Transformers because i want to see Transformers, i want to see Optimus Prime! <br/><br/>Dark of the Moon is just as boring as the 2nd. The last stand on Chicago is definitely too long to enjoy. Too many unnecessary scenes and the continuity and logic of each scenes is simply bad.

For example, when we're expected to believe that serious stuff is happening in Chicago, it's actually Detroit's former Packard auto assembly plant that is the backdrop for some scenes. Granted, many may not know of the difference, but for those of us that do know about it, it's a serious flaw. After all, Detroit is NOT Chicago, and vise-versa.<br/><br/>But however you look at it, this movie continues to entertain those of us who enjoy the sci-fi and action genres, and it does it quite well.

"barryweir","1","1","4","1 October 2011"," A pathetic end to the worst franchise in history
","I was disappointed by the first Transformers movie. It was too far away from the Generation One characters I had grown up with as a child. I then sat down for Revenge of the Fallen, which I hoped would be moving more towards the routes of the toy franchise. Alas, that did not happen. I will not fill this up with reviews of those films, but suffice it to say that I had been told that this was an improvement. All I can say is, what liars!<br/><br/>I am amazed Michael Bay gets to make movies after so many awful films. I am ever more amazed he gets to make big budget movies after so many awful efforts. I am even, even more amazed that our cinema audiences are so moronic that they go on their droves to lap this rubbish up in lieu of the well made cinema of days gone by.....meaning that they are the chief reason that a franchise with no quality whatsoever manages to get to three installments.<br/><br/>This movie is bad on every level imaginable. Maybe I am biased, but to me two and half hours of CGI does not get me excited. I like real effects. Sure I know this is difficult with something like the Transformers concept, but what insults me here is that the studio, and Bay, think this film can rely on good CGI as it's driving force. Sure, the CGI is good by itself, but after three movies of robots just bashing each other up in CGI it all gets a bit ""ho-hum"". If animations were enough,why do Pixar films only succeed once they also include good scripts and music? This movie was an absolute joke. Consider the following:-<br/><br/><ul><li>We learn nothing much about this Sential Prime. He's just ""bad guy for rent"". Shame on you Leonard Nimoy, I know you are related to Bay, but even so, do you want your last outing to be a total turd?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is no character development for the transformers themselves AT ALL. Hell, Megatron only appears in the movie to get killed at the end. Worse still, he is turned away from Sentinel Prime's evil plan by Shia's love interest. That's right a dumb blonde walks up to a huge evil robot and convinces him to help with one line. Oh...dear.....god.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The great Optimus, who, for those who remember the great 1987 animated film, usually shows mercy, kills both Sentinel Prime and Megatron in cold blood....just like that.....and once they are dead the movie...just ends! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>None of the human characters really have any kind of an arc, even Shia. The highlight of Shia's appearance is when he is taken over by a Decepticon wristwatch (yep, a watch), which exists there to spy on the Autobots.....oh but when the autobots fake an explosion, the watch just gives up. WTF?. Shia's parents are there for no reason at all and serve no purpose. John Turtorro shows up again but actually, well, does nothing. The great talents of Frances McDormand and John Malkovich are criminally wasted, especially the latter, who completely vanishes half way through the film when Shia tells him to leave a room.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>20 foot Bumblebeee seems to be able to walk through small doors into apartments</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Washington DC is apparently also Chicago.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Megan Fox replacement is simply a blonde for hire whose first appearance is in the form of her panty wearing backside</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We are treated to more insufferable pro-American nonsense. The Autobot Transformers are, it seems, American agents because, well, America is the best dontcha know.....this extends to them attacking a supposedly ""illegal"" Middle Eastern Nuclear Plant (complete with Iranian flags - determined as illegal by, um, who? Americans?) and swarming into Chernobyl to discover evil ex-Soviets hiding transformer technically and working with the Decepticons. Yes, that's right. Ex-Soviets are Decepticon agents. Those dirty Reds!</li></ul><br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I think I have already indicated how bad the picture is. All I'll add is that together with all the problems above the movie really has no logical and worthwhile script whatsoever.<br/><br/>This movie is a criminal indictment of the modern state of Hollywood. An industry driven by pumping out mindless drivel in place of good quality artistry on the sole premise that it might sell more tickets. Bay himself should be ashamed that, as a filmmaker, rather than a studio executive, he is helping to prop this up."

","Being curious about the current 'state of the arts in Hollywood' is possibly an acceptable reason for viewing this grueling 2 1/2 hour + mechanical mishmash, but after enduring the storyless CGI exercise in visual and auditory assault the viewer can only hope that in the theaters, with the added dimension of 3D to the soup, the film might have had some saving graces.<br/><br/>Apparently the 'story' goes something like this (at least in a neutral writer's words): 'Autobots Bummblebee, Rachet, Ironhide and Sideswipe led by Optimus Prime, are back in action taking on the evil Decepticons, who are eager to avenge their recent defeat. The Autobots and Decepticons become involved in a perilous space race between the U.S. and Russia, to reach a hidden Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon and learn its secrets, and once again Sam Witwicky has to come to the aid of his robot friends. New villain, Shockwave, who rules Cybertron, is on the scene while the Autobots and Decepticons continue to battle it out on Earth.' In other words this is an action film where the main characters are expanding and imploding auto parts in some semblance of a battle for taking over the earth. What little dialogue there is was written by Ehren Kruger and the comic book cum video game cum 3D epic was 'directed' by Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Given that the film did so well in the theaters (likely due to the novelty of 3D) it made a lot of money. The cast assembled is an admirable one: Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich (for his brief few seconds on screen), Ken Takemoto , and the voices of the mechanical dolls supplied by such actors as Hugo Weaving, Frank Welker, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Foxworth, James Remar, and Francesco Quinn. The problem is that there is so much destruction of the city of Chicago and the flying pieces of the fighting Autobots and Decepticons that finding a story and caring about the non-mechanical actors is tough. But then this is what the public is spending money to see so it is obvious why Hollywood is making movies like this. Could there possibly be another installment coming? Probably..... A must miss award to TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","I was reluctant to view another ""Transformers"" movie since I always thought those robot cars to be childish - and I was proved right yet again.<br/><br/>The story starts out rather promising - the formerly famous Sam Witwicky finally realizes that he basically didn't contribute anything (and how could one with all that vastly advanced aliens roaming about) and has to find a new orientation in life. Too bad he doesn't find any. So he just decides to bust in on the incompetent military leaders and shows them how it's done. Wow. Exactly what you would expect to excite those teenagers - I mean apart from transforming cars, explosions and Megan Fox. Not that I wouldn't approve of all that. It's just that the whole impression is not convincing, the action scenes are rather boring and Megan behaves quite erratic.<br/><br/>So instead of people spurting blood, deep insights by main characters and some nice bikini shots we just get two hours full of explosions where no one dies, people who don't have to make any decisions and a bitchy female lead who behaves like a 15-year old girl. Oh and did I mention the non-conclusive moral sermons? As if you could get a message to those youngsters among exploding cars and collapsing buildings...<br/><br/>Also the cuts are rather crude, sometimes you feel like you have fast forwarded too much and then again they crammed so much dialog into one scene that you get confused."

And 10 years after 9/11 Americans fear nothing more than an invasion...and women; why else are there literally hundreds of men but only three women in the film? <br/><br/>It's sad to see that in the year 2011 women on film still either have to be mothers or supermodels. Well, or they have to be so butch (Mearing) that you might as well have the credentials to be a guy, which makes you anything but sympathetic, except to Simmons, who seems to be attracted to that kind of woman and makes sure that the only female without male attachment is properly attached in the end. But, even more disturbing, where are all the women soldiers? Shivering in fear and crawling under the wings of their boyfriends, I guess. Because guys fight tough and women can only make bad decisions (Mearing), raise children (Judy Witwicky), or be compared to a car - a thing to possess - and contribute by whispering betrayal in the ears of the enemy (Carly Spencer), in this case to no one less than Megatron.<br/><br/>The movie is quite unnerving with fast cuts and ever-moving camera work from the very beginning. Where has the art of building suspense disappeared to? The action sequences are stunning and probably the reason why most people stayed until the end; though cutting the movie down to 90 minutes would have greatly improved it. I went because I liked the premise with the moon landing at the beginning. There were some good ideas and a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it all went downhill after the first five minutes. I should have read the prequel comic instead. At least the previous two Transformers movies featured some humor and offered some fun entertainment, if you powered down your brain a bit.

I would have said that the new characters did a pretty good job if there was any focus at all on the them.

","Michael Bay is one of the few Hollywood directors out there who isn't ashamed to put on his bad boy hat and shove aside story and characters to give us intense unrelenting action scenes. As a major action buff, I live for these types of movies where Robots are fighting in our world and we clash as one. While pretty much everyone in human existent absolutely loathed the second transformers movie, I walked out having had a fun time and was able to be entertained for the 2hr 30 min run time. Keeping some entertained for over 2 hours is no easy task, but with Michael Bay's hand at the director realm, we got great action and fast paced witty dialogue. I am not trying to defend the second film, all I'm saying is that I liked it. There are a lot of Michael Bay haters out there and it really disgusts me that people go to see these movies, only to return home just to b**ch and nag on the internet about them later on. Shia LaBeouf has majorly improved as an actor over the years with this franchise and has worked under the intense eye of Bay who can be known for being a bit of a douche on the set. Newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replaces Megan Fox as Sam's girlfriend and despite this being her first acting experience, she does a good job and also looks quite good in tight dresses in the process. The SFX and VFX are amazing and never cease to amaze me as Bay pushes the envelope as to what is going on on screen. It is required that people suspend their disbelief for a movie like this but given what it is about shouldn't make that too difficult. The story is a bit confusing, with one too many twists near the end and the script needed work as is the case with most of these types of movies. This is one of those movies where you can go in and turn your brain off and just enjoy yourself. Nothing wrong with that. The opening sequence is spliced a bit odd and may confuse you but the 3D actually worked in this movie which surprised me but also delighted me. It was shot in 3D so that helped. This is really only meant for action buffs who could care less about plot and characters; and while those elements are important, I certainly don't look for them in a Michael Bay film."

","Having watched the Transformers cartoon as a kid, my expectations were tempered when Paramount Pictures announced that a live-action movie was forthcoming. Once the film came out though, I couldn't wait to see it. The cartoon I grew up watching, was now a real live action movie and there I sat in awe. I recall watching the first time Bumblebee transformed and getting chills at the sight and sound. Once Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was released, I was terribly disappointed. Instead of a worthy follow-up to an enjoyable first movie, what was delivered was an insulting piece of garbage, but that's a review for another day. It was inevitable that a 3rd movie was going to be produced, I was simply hopeful for major improvements being implemented to move the franchise forward. I'm happy to say that my hopes for the movie were far exceeded. The script far exceed that of the first two films; the action was again on a grand scale and the acting.well, it was OK. It's difficult for real-life actors and actresses not to be overshadowed by the sheer awesomeness of the Transformers. Michael Bay has made amends with me, whether he wanted to or not.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay has shown that he loves devastation, often times excessively; i.e. Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor. The one thing about Bay's movies though, is that they never lack excitement and entertainment. Transformers: Dark of the Moon meets the required criteria, with non-stop action and massive destruction from start to finish. Shia LeBeouf's Sam Witwicky is once again thrust into the middle of the war between Autobots and Decepticons. I've enjoyed LeBeouf's portrayal of Sam throughout all three movies. In Transformers: Dark of the Moon, he plays the role with humor, such as his interactions with his parents and while interviewing for a much needed job; and he plays the role with a convincing intensity, which is necessary in action movie of this magnitude. Bay added big name talent to the roster this time around: John Malkovich, always a pleasure to watch, in a small but humorous role as Sam's boss; the talented Frances McDormand; Patrick Demsey; and the hilarious Ken Jeong, who continues a strong run of supporting roles. Reprising their roles for a third time are Josh Duhamel, Tyreese Gibson and the highly amusing John Turturro.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a HUGE improvement over Revenge of the Fallen. There's a lot to love about the effects, and even the storyline.yes, it has a solid storyline, which revolves around the race to land on the moon in the 60s. I think it's a safe bet that the Transformers are here to stay and that more movies will be coming. Hopefully, should Bay decide against returning as rumored, that the studio replaces him with someone capable of continuing to move the series in the direction he just left it....pointed towards the stars and the planet Cybertron.<br/><br/>Oscar worthiness: Special effects and Sound Summer movie Grade: B (my son, who is 7.5 gave it an A+) Age appropriate meter: 10+ (some excessive language, A LOT of violence, one sexual situation in the very beginning, some scenes may be deemed too scary for younger children)<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

","If I had to judge this movie purely on special effects it would be a 10 but since I look at deeper things like character and plot development I have to grade it a little more harshly.<br/><br/>The plot is... not bad. It sort of makes sense and it has enough complexity that it can support the massive amount of action. That's another thing. The finale action scene is like an hour long. At some point you become immune to fire and explosions and its just boring again. Only Michael Bay could blow enough stuff up that it becomes normal... I don't want to ruin anything but it doesn't really make sense for the Autobots to be under the governments control and have to answer to them since they're a different species are like super strong.<br/><br/>On to actors: Shia LaBeouf is, as always, mediocre. He's the goofy, everyday man that manages to save the world, again, and somehow gets no recognition for it. It's sort of charming but LaBeouf doesn't really help his own character since he is getting annoying after the third installment. There is not enough of his parents, especially his mother played by Julie White who is fantastic in her mania. Tyrese Gibson is shockingly good in this and seems to have a more individual part rather than being in Josh Duhamel's shadow. He shows some depth and has his won motivations. The new chick, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is bad. Like does not act at all bad... Megan Fox looks like an actual actress compared to her and its obvious she was just picked randomly from a pool of attractive women.<br/><br/>This brings me to my biggest complaint against this movie: Sexism. Michael Bay is possibly the most sexist director in the business and it is deplorable that this is acceptable. Huntington-Whiteley literally has no depth of character, wears the skimpiest clothing and manages to wear stilettos for an hour long action finale. The exploitation of her is disgusting and any women shown with strength, Frances McDormand playing the head of the Autobots department, is portrayed as ignorant, power hungry and bitchy. I cannot blame Megan Fox for leaving this franchise and I think she is better off for it."

Look at all those big ticket actor movies. Probably didn't break even. And analyzing the physics and realism??? WTF??? Hey - is there a physics textbook about sentient robots? Have any of you folks traveled into space to speak with authority?<br/><br/>HEY! It's a movie for people who want to be entertained, which, judging by the box office receipts, America wants to be entertained. All of the wannabe critics who feel there's no plot, no heart, no realism, (a misnomer since it's SCI-FI), see a play instead. <br/><br/>I loved this move, and so did most of the movie goers out there, who spend their money to be entertained. Don't believe me? Look back over the past ten years to see what the public has been watching. It's all been moving towards ENTERTAINMENT, not human stories, not higher art, not big name actors.<br/><br/>This was a thoroughly entertaining movie. If you love action and adventure, you should see it. Rates up there with Ironman 1 and 2, Aliens, Star Wars, etc. You get the picture. (No pun intended)<br/><br/>GO SEE IT ALREADY."
"kidneycar","Null","1","4","30 July 2011"," U reviewers are some hypocritical ****ers
","i can't believe all you people are ticked off at t3, saying its nothing but explosions, worse than the holocaust, kill mike bay etc. WTF DID YOU EXPECT!?!?!?!? U all complained about the second one having too many random action scenes without enough plot or background (where did that robot come from?), and wanted it more centered around the characters. NOW U ALL SAY ITS TOO CENTERED ON THE CHARACTERS AND NOT THE ROBOTS. hypocritical morons. <br/><br/>If you liked the first and second movies, then see the third, and don't believe all the h8r's bashing this movie giving it one star. ITS ABOUT AS GOOD AS REVENGE OF THE FALLEN. Its worse in the fact that Sentinal Prime wasn't as memorable as Fallen prime (he was really cool at the end of the second) but better in the fact that you didn't have the annoying beat bots. This one was much more centered on the people (as stated above), with Megatron being on screen for all of ten minutes, with one scene with him talking to Starscream (my personal fav), which kinda irritated me, but whatever. I would say if revenge of the fallen was 8 outa 10, this would be like a 7.8. Still highly watchable, if you base that on a mike bay film, which always have over the top action, without being totally unrealistic (a la shoot em up, or transporter), with a decent script for an action film. One of the autobots was also a Maybach, which are like THE most expensive cars in the world, so that was pretty cool.<br/><br/>See it if you enjoyed the first two, and forget about all the trolls posting one star reviews on this site.<br/><br/>And whoever had the review calling this film 'worse than the holocaust', do us all a favor and go lie down in the street."
"yankeebass22","5","1","4","30 July 2011"," Great effects! Not so great storyline...
","This movie had great elements in it. It had action, comedy, romance, and suspense. The problem was that instead of all of these aspects getting woven together into an enjoyable movie, they were randomly thrown in throughout the film with the hope that they would somehow make a good movie. Well unfortunately that doesn't work! The whole movie seemed like many events mashed together with no real flow to it. One minute there would be some type of awkward comedy going on and the next there would be a full on battle. It just didn't make any sense! All of the characters seemed extremely flat and the twists were predictable. Also, Sam's love interest, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Victoria's Secret model), while being attractive has very little acting skills and it was quite obvious during the movie. On a positive note, though, the effects in Transformers 3 were breathtaking! It was, in fact, one of the only things that kept my attention. The bottom line is that Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a good movie if all you like is action, but if you actually like a storyline its definitely a rough film to watch."

","Well, at the beginning of the movie, we see that it's a dark and intense story but it atmosphere disappear in the next half an hour...<br/><br/>The visual effects are great, such as the other two movies but the actors...well, it's poor. I think that Sam's parents wouldn't appear in this movie, it's like an unnecessary refill. And the main female actress it's awful. Megan! Come back!<br/><br/>The movie is full of humoristic parts, and it's great. There are intense and drama parts. There are fine.<br/><br/>It's a great movie after all, but only if you are a Sci Fi movies fan. If you are not, well, don't watch it."
"theworldisyours_l","Null","1","4","21 July 2011"," Transformers: Dark of the Moon Review
","The Transformers franchise returns with its third installment ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Pmly one significant character change has taken place, the replacement of Sam's girlfriend. The actress Megan Fox is now an English actress Rosie Huntington-Whitely called Carly Spencer in the movie. Both suffer from a lack of acting chops but provide the movie with what it needs -- a beautiful damsel in distress. The way Carly Spencer was introduced as a character however left a lot to be desired with no back-story provided or any explanation as to why Mikaela has left Sam's life.<br/><br/>The Decepticons want to change earth into the new Cybertron, with only the Autobots, military personnel, and Sam Witwicky standing in the way of earth's transformation and the enslavement of human civilization. Michael Bay is the director of this project best known for directing ""Bad Boys 2,"" ""The Rock,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" and the previous installments of ""Transformers."" His specialty is action packed summer movies with all the bells and whistles to be expected from explosions to mayhem.<br/><br/>I think this installment of ""Transformers"" is better than the last film but doesn't hold a candle to the original. The plot is helter skelter but what else can be expected from the writer of the second film who has also written other projects such as ""The Skeleton Key,"" ""The Ring,"" ""The Ring 2,"" and ""Scream 3."" As I said before the back story involving Carly is nonexistent with no effort at all given to explain the disappearance of Mikaela and sudden appearance of Carly. The visual effects are top notch which I'm sorry to say is the best thing about this movie. The runtime of the film is also too long. I believe it could benefit from being thirty minutes shorter. Overall I give the film a grade of C-. If you need some mindless entertainment, you'll enjoy the film but don't expect a masterpiece with any witty dialogue to accompany the action."
"kelly-boyle","6","1","4","21 July 2011"," Disappointed
","I have to say I was very disappointed with this film. I think they need to make it more about the actual transformers and less about Sam and the cast. Yes the parts involving the robots were visually amazing but I wanted more, I left the cinema bored and unsatisfied. I felt the story line could have been improved and I have to say that I preferred the first two with Megan Fox, did they really have to add another girl purely for looks? I rated this movie 5 as I do love the Transformers films and the effects but I was hoping for something a little bit more I guess. I think if they do a fourth instalment they should restart with a whole new cast as taking out one of the main characters was strange to the dynamics of the film, however involving totally new people and focusing on the Transformers would definitely have improved this movie for me!"
"nglhay","Null","1","4","20 July 2011"," I was somewhat disappointed with this episode of the Transformers trilogy. I was expecting a lot more from this especially after watching the trailers.
","Warning: Spoilers ahead. I was somewhat disappointed with this episode of the Transformers trilogy. I was expecting a lot more from this especially after watching the trailers. I was expecting a certain direction for the film to take, taking its origins from the trailer, but it somehow manages to get lost half way through. The dark of the moon concept was brilliant to begin the movie with and I think that they should have focused it there instead of trying to bring things down to earth and thereby make it look like ""Independence day"" or ""Battle Los Angeles"". The lack of an original concept is what lets this movie down as well as the lost characters such as John Turturro for example who does a whole lot of shouting but nothing much in between. Sam Witwicky also comes out as just a lost soul trying to find a place in the movie which has lost its plot. The viewer will find himself wondering what happened to Sam's previous girlfriend and how this new one seems to appear in Sam's life. On top of this there are new Autobots that appear in the film and you don't know where they arrived from. The action sequences are great but lose their effect because the models don't show individual actions in slow motion. The action is so fast that the viewer finds it hard to follow at times. Shockwave for example confuses you where you wonder if he is just one individual or if he is a part of the monolithic monster that wreaks whole buildings. The final part of the film shows Sam standing by while the Autobots take down the main pillar. Then there good old John Malkovich who appears only to disappear into obscurity in what must have been his shortest part in a motion picture... Whats going on Mr. Michael Bay.. you did an excellent job with one and two but three for me is a disappointing flop."
"liell","2","1","4","19 July 2011"," Worst film of the year...
","Well, I went into the theater with low expectations. Even then, this film disappointed me beyond belief. It was even worse than the previous two. Wait, maybe that was because it was almost exactly the same as the previous two.<br/><br/>Now, if you're someone who goes to a movie and looks for nothing but action, I have four words for you: GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You'll love it. The whole thing is action, and I must admit the action is top-notch.<br/><br/>However, if you're someone who actually appreciates the art of cinema, and looks for emotions and good plot line when watching a picture, you will probably agree that Transformers 3 sucks. That's because there is no emotional buildup, no climax, no real characters, no meaning, and overall no point. It's robots fighting. That's it. <br/><br/>Firstly, the characters, which are arguably the most important factor of a movie, are not developed AT ALL. I guess you could say that they developed them in the first two, and so we're already supposed to know who they are. Well, we do know who they are, but that's about it. Many of the characters have about ten lines of dialogue throughout the whole thing, or so it seems. This means that whenever something really ""climatic"" happens, no one cares anyway since we barely know the characters. Frankly, I didn't even care if a main character was about to die, because the film didn't touch on the character's personalities at all. Instead, the whole thing is constant action with a FEW dialogue scenes, which are pretty pathetic as well.<br/><br/>Secondly, if you find pointless action boring, you will bored the hell out of this movie. The final battle in Chicago takes, I'd say, a good 45 minutes. The first 15 were actually really entertaining. If it would've stopped there, I actually would've given the movie a better rating. But no... it drags on for several eternities. Each time you think it's going to end, they trick you and add in another obstacle and another cheesy, slow motion thing that's supposed to be climactic and emotional. Well, like I said, no one cares anyway because everyone's going, ""Who is this guy again?""<br/><br/>The bottom line is, this movie sucks. If you want a good, modern action series with an equal amount of good story, I would suggest the Pirates of the Caribbean or the Batman movies. Also check out Source Code and Inception, two of the most innovative movies that have come out for awhile. <br/><br/>With love, <br/><br/>Simba Jackson"
"trooper2448","5","1","4","19 July 2011"," Some old school things needed....
","First, I've been a long time Transformers fan, and fan is putting it lightly. I still have my original Optimus Prime from 1984, along with many other now collectible Transformer figures. In 2007, I was extremely excited to be watching a live action adaptation of the cartoons. All in all, the three movies together are entertaining. This comes from growing up with the original generation one cartoons and toys. To see Optimus Prime and the others interacting with real people is great.<br/><br/>Having said that, all three movies could've been so far beyond what they were with just some simple additions and it wouldn't have involved in depth plots or severely extensive action scenes. I'm used to watching the bots in simple block form. I completely understand that if it were possible in real life for a vehicle to convert to robot form, it would be an extremely intricate robot. As far as size goes, many others have disagreed with the size of Bumblebee and some other bots. I get that money makes the movie and sponsors get a certain say in what goes into certain elements of the movie. But GM getting the rights to the vehicle choices was a mistake. I like the Corvette concept being added but name him Tracks instead of Sideswipe. In the original series, there were all different makes and models: VW (Bumblebee), Porsche (Jazz), Lamborghini (Sideswipe & Sunstreaker) just to name a few. Could they seriously not have a New Beetle to represent Bumblebee? In the cartoons, Bumblebee was tiny, barely coming up to Optimus' waste line. It was great to see tiny Bumblebee whipping some decepticon butt in the cartoons. It would've been equally impressive to see in live action. Sideswipe was a Countach but would've been outstanding as a red Aventador. I will however, give the creators credit for adding in Ferrari and Mercedes to the mix. As far as the decepticons go, it was rumored that Soundwave was to be a SUV full of speakers and he instead got stuffed into a SLS AMG. Someone added in a comment about showing Lazerbeak and Soundwave together in one very brief clip. The scene where Soundwave transforms, kicks Sam out and keeps the girl locked up and Lazerbeak comes out of nowhere - how hard would it have been to have Soundwaze open his trunk and eject out Lazerbeak? Shockwave was an awesome addition in #3 but something as simple as him transforming into a massive tripod gun (his form in the cartoon) to shoot Optimus off of the crane would've been a very distinctive touch to set him apart from being just another robot (which is what he was in the movie). I truly liked Starscream's look as a F-22 but he was the leader of a fighter squadron. Give us Thundercracker and Skywarp with some generation 1 colors to set them apart. The creator's could've got away with this simply by adding them with little or no lines because they didn't talk much in the cartoons either. Another very simple addition to the movies should've been the distinctive transformation sound from the cartoons. The sound that Blackout made in #1 when he landed at the military base and Bumblebee's last transformation in #3, needed to be used every single time, not just once per movie.<br/><br/>Someone out there, please please please buy out the movie rights to Transformers and do the series the right way. Transformers is based off of.......Transformers, not Sam Witwicky. Take out his love life and all the government stuff and you've got about a hour of screen time total in all three movies. It shouldn't be human movies with robots thrown in. It should be robot movies with humans thrown in. A little human story building in movie #1 would've been OK just to show how the autobots befriended Sam. I guess I sort of understand the need for a female cast member to act as Sam's girlfriend....please do away with supermodels going for an everyday run-of-the-mill suburban teen. If you insist on having a female supporting actress, add a more normal looking and better acting female. Megan Fox is a horrible actress. Rosey Huntington was much better but still way too over the top for that part. Transformers has incredible potential as a movie franchise. All three movies were blockbusters and I really did enjoy all three movies. If I wasn't a die-hard Transformer fan, I truly think I would not have enjoyed any of them.<br/><br/>On the very short plus list for this movie, I did enjoy some new additions to the movies. Finally someone decided it was a good idea to give Optimus a trailer, and decided further to add the original graphic to the side. However brief it was, they did show Lazerbeak landing on Soundwave's arm. They gave Shockwave one eye and large frame. These little additions and my love for Transformers is why this movie gets a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Again, someone out there please rectify this situation if there are going to be more movies. It's little things not big things that make a difference."
"alexfirewalker","8","1","4","19 July 2011"," Metallapocalypse
","I'll do myself a favor and I'll skip the worthless introduction...Lets start from what matters most.<br/><br/>Story- Unfortunately, in movies like this , the story is either completely absent or barely present whatsoever . However , fortunately , in the case of ""dark of the moon"" the writers did their best since the first movie in the franchise to offer a pretty comprehensive and easy to pick up story . It is not something exceptional, but still better than nothing . This time the movie was given a darker and grimmer tone (Bay actually kills people on screen this time around ) , by enhancing the sense of a end-of- the-world , all caps disaster and a full-scale war not lacking in deaths and sacrifices. The film begins with a cool back story lasting around 1 hour until the real action makes its way to the screen . That very hour , being scarce on action and epic battles was surprisingly intriguing for me. I assure you , if you can sit through the first hour you will be on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie . Unlike the first part , the film's last one and a half hours are literally bursting with rousing action , full scale battles that fully delivers on its promises unlike other lacking movies of this very caliber (like X-men First Class for example) . However what i didn't quite like is the fact that during those action set-pieces , the story got totally lost and felt totally nonexistent.<br/><br/>Characters , acting - This time around the cast was more ample than before with newcomers like John Malkovich playing Sam's boss , Frances McDromand , Alan Tudyk and others. Shia Labeuf returns as a more mature , determined , but desperate Sam Witwicky . Rosie Huntington Whiteley- now she's a matter of discussion. And NO , I wasn't angry because Megan Fox wasn't in this movie . For her first time on the big screen , Rosie was pretty good and charming , enough to make you forget about megan . John Malkovich , John Turturro, Alan Tudyk and Ken Jeong provided the humoristic component , which by the way was the first in a TF movie where the humor felt at home and not out of place . Particularly , the scene in the Russian bar is worth a billion dollars. The whole overcrowded theatre laughed their *** off ,including me . The Robots - what was wrong with them in the first two movies pretty much remained unchanged here assuming how much I despise those cheesy dialogs between decepticons that were all like "" oh Lord Megatron , this is our greatest plan "" . Quite possible , this was the most frustrating thing in the entire film for me . The autobots on the other hand were surprisingly good and sounded appropriate , fortunately . <br/><br/>Vissual and audio effects , soundtrack- Mr. Bay really outdone himself with this one by showing us one the best visual and audio effects since Avatar. One should definitely see this in 3D as this is the visual spectacle we were all waiting for . The film was more dynamic than ever as the intrigue and the stakes were way higher . I can't tell you more about the effects without spoiling parts of the story , but tell you what, I was always on the edge of my seat , my eyes and ears were in heaven while experiencing this . The soundtrack- another masterpiece by Steve Jablonsky , one of my favorite composers , who provided an emphatic , heroic score . Like the previous Transformers score, the cheesy popcorn factor is very high and I wouldn't have it any other way. I won't say that this score is better than the previous scores, but it's definitely up there. If it is the last Transformers score, it ends on a high. Steve Jablonsky, Michael Bay and Transformers are a perfect fit and I really hope they continue their fruitful relationship long into the future.<br/><br/>Bottom Line- Overall , Transformers dark of the Moon simply destroys Revenge of the fallen in every aspect and lifts itself to the highs of the first film in the series . If you don't mind seeing an summer action popcorn-flick , this is the perfect choice as your impressions after watching it , especially in 3D will be no other than positive and euphoric . No matter if you're a fan of the series or not , you should see this film . Its not perfect at all(a lot of goofs and plot holes , the story could have been a lot better, the villains are terrible except for sentinel prime) but all in all it ultimately does best what it is meant to do - to entertain.<br/><br/>PS: Noticed a plethora of negative reception towards the movie , as from experienced moviegoers as from professional critics. My advice to you : Trust no one and go see this movie if u enjoy such spectacular movies. One can complain about a movie for his/her entire life only to find out , in the end , that this is all he/she can do ."
"toqtaqiya2","8","1","4","18 July 2011"," The biggest and loudest CGI extravaganza in film history.
","Wow. Just wow. If you thought that director Michael Bay was going to take a gentler approach to the third film then be prepared for a surprise. Dark Of The Moon is huge both in action and in the amount of CGI. This time the decepticons have a very transformers-like plan to take over the world. Who stand in their way? Only a small number of autobots and humans. How good is the film? It's somewhere between the first and the second films. It has only two things going for it: the fantastic CGI and the impressive 3D presentation. For a film like this Bay has given up such things as character development, a coherent story or tight direction. Dark Of The Moon is a mess, but not as much as Revenge Of The Fallen. Characters come and go for little or no reason. The humor is awkward, lousy or disgusting. Some scenes are underdeveloped or unnecessary. The acting is bad or passable. The score is loud and generic. The American patriotism is, once again, over the top. A shocker is in store for viewers concerning the American space program. But the worst thing is that Michael Bay still hasn't learned (or decided to ignore) why the transformers cartoons were likable. The transformers themselves were real characters, and they looked different and interesting. In this film it takes some effort to see who's who when they're fighting. Dark Of The Moon is a money-making product at its simplest. It's meant to lure audiences with its predictable combination of humor, action and special effects. It's passable entertainment, but I wouldn't watch it a second time. Like the previous two transformers films Dark Of The Moon is a true product of the Bush era."
"Generic_Gooner","8","1","4","17 July 2011"," Im biased as a fan of the franchise, but this was a great action blockbuster
","Firstly, loved the film, i will say now im a fan of the franchise so im sure that will allow the critics of the film to point to the fact i enjoyed ROTF. But this film delivered a very satisfying finale to Bays transformers imagining. <br/><br/>Before i go any further, i have to say one thing. What are people really expecting to get from a film where the premise is a battle between 20 foot alien robots? I have read a bit of empires review and stopped simply because they had some odd perception of what this film should be. Its not art-house iranian drama, which i know they seem to adore, its a summer action blockbuster. <br/><br/>OK, to the review as best as i can without ruining anything. <br/><br/>Forget any *beep* you hear about a nonsensical plot, compared to the more 'out there' effort in ROTF, this plot is straight down the line. <br/><br/>This next bit is a spoiler so i will cover it accordingly... The starting point where we lay a foundation involving seeing cybertron set a tone that Bay wants to offer up a truly great transformers film, OK they didn't give us much of it, but to have tried to focus any significant time on their planet could have incurred more wrath from the purists complaining it wasn't how THEY imagined it. <br/><br/>So they set the scene well and then as i think someone else pointed out on the board the pacing does take a little turn for the worse. It wasn't bad like some films have been before, but it did obviously have an intention of laying down a lot of plot about Sam and his new life before they could really kick on and hit the main point. But at no time do they ignore the need to bring in the transformers and action sequences to keep the adrenaline pumping. <br/><br/>Again a spoiler, it will be better when many more of you has seen it, but I thought it would be hard to bring a more menacing and destructive decepticon than devastator, yet the introduction of shockwave with his burrowing giant worm was outstanding as an ultimate evil. The fact they made megatron a fallen force, a damaged villain that was being usurped made for another nice little touch. <br/><br/>The last hour as has been mentioned is all out action, but the setting of the city of Chicago did definitely give it that edge to it, and the darker tone we were promised. <br/><br/>And yes, when one of the decepticons or autobots loses a team mate, they die. No get out clauses, Bay made sure when a warrior fell they fell for the last time. <br/><br/>It had comedy that of course some are going to point to as either juvenile, racist or just plan dumb, but i have yet to see a film in recent years that hasn't incorporated at least one example of each of these areas when aiming to play for laughs, so why is this suddenly an issue in a bay film? And yes its an action film, but to draw a balance you need to feel the light hearted side before they assault you with the darker tones. <br/><br/>And the action was exceptional. In ROTF one of my biggest complaints was that when Optimus took on the fallen he had him beaten within a couple of moves. Unlike the epic throw down they had in the forest in the same film where optimus fought 3 decepticons simultaneously while Sam tried to avoid getting squashed (along with the trees showing a perspective of scale for the warriors) the final battle then lacked a bite. Well in DOTM i was not disappointed with the fights, they played out how you would hope. <br/><br/>Like i said it had the human elements played in. It had twists, it had a plot that made sense and the action was mind blowing. It was dark and the comedy was played down. <br/><br/>And for the record, the new girl playing Carly was not terrible at all. She may never be an Oscar winner (like that is a benchmark these days?) but she held her own and did what she was there to do... look pretty and provide a flow to the story as it played out. Sam needed to care at key points in the film, and she provided a love interest worth saving <br/><br/>Overall very impressed, 9/10 and very much looking forward to another viewing before it leaves the cinema. <br/><br/>p.s. 3D viewing was worthwhile, it was far better than the *beep* converts i have seen recently and the made the action all the more amazing."
"filip-109-911847","10","1","4","17 July 2011"," Great action, soundtrack, effects and actors.
","Transformers 3 is the definition of an epic movie. With Michael Bay's epic realistic effects, and the soundtrack from Steve Jablonsky, this movie is so worth watching. Many say that the story line is bad. But I don't think so. I mean, it wasn't bad, I actually enjoyed it. It was unpredictable and entertaining. I don't really care that Megan is gone, the new girl is damn hot and fits with the story line. Though I'm not sure why Megan would break up, hehe. In any way, this is the best of them 3, and it deserves so much more stars. I walked out of the movies, smiling. And in the sad moments, I almost cried. Of course there are the people that hate the too much action and explosion stuff, but hey - that's transformers? I seriously doubt that you don't expect that when you get to the theaters. This movie is number 1 on the movie meter currently, and that's how it's supposed to be. I'm buying the blu-ray copy of this, because that's how it's supposed to be watched."
"chase-valleau","10","1","4","17 July 2011"," One of the best movies I have ever seen
","This movie, like Revenge of the Fallen will get a lot of criticism, just because it is a Michael Bay film. It has a hot chick in it, the storyline is questionable, and it has a sh*t-ton of action in it. I personally think that it was better than the first movie, and that it was a lot better than the second. I actually happened to be one of the few who liked the second movie, also. The action in this movie is unbelievable, the way that it goes into slow motion, and the absolute violence of the robots fighting just blew my mind. Although there were some disappointments, like the fight between Optimus and Megatron could have gone on for a little longer, it was still really great. The characters are still the same, throughout the series, Shia Lebouef was still his goofy self, and still kind of trying to impress people throughout the movie. Rosie Huntington Whiteley did a good job for her first acting career and was a good replacement for Megan Fox. And of course there are the transformers who are always the same and then there are the crazy ones meant to be there for the little kids. The storyline was pretty good and had a few questions to it, but the way I see it is why would you go and watch a movie and ask yourself why would someone do a certain something in the movie. Just enjoy the movie for what it is, a summer blockbuster meant satisfy the minds of people who want to see a sh*t-ton of explosions and robots beating the sh*t out of each other. So I recommend that everybody should go see it and that they should just enjoy it and not be predetermined to say that it sucked, because it really was one of the best movies that I have ever seen."

","Transformers I was truly original, made a breakthrough and created an opening. Transformers II expanded and changed more, but still plot seems similar. And Transformers III, looks to take advantage of big special effects, and the former female lead blatantly deleted and changed for a Victoria Secret's model.<br/><br/>You are taken down a similar route. There is something that happened many years ago. Involve the cold war and a historic event, like the Soviets don't have enough of being reminded of being the bad guys. And again, a city where huge action sequences come to happen. The couple of Shia and Ms. Huntington-Whiteley looks like the little kid is dating the big girl. Parents are the comedy pill needed to improve. New Transformers, but some still seem to be probably out of place. Laserbeak looked more than a dragon than its eagle-like namesake from G1. Others come back, a at the least there is more finesse to where Ms. Huntington-Whiteley is concerned, she acted more than simply show her figure.<br/><br/>Seems a repeat of the other two. I thought all the Primes were dead. Anyhow, the action is the only part which will not disappoint. The rest, more of the same."

Newcomer Rosie Huntington- Whiley delivers as Shia's character's Sam's new girlfriend, Carly. John Tuturro returns as the leader of NEST, and special guests include Buzz Aldrin as himself, and Leonard Nimoy as Optimus' mentor, Sentinel Prime.

","People have mindlessly been trashing this movie about things that don't even happen in this movie. Some of them I understand, but I still give this movie a ten out of ten. Lets start with the pros... This movie is by Michael Bay, whether that be good or not, but the effects are amazing just like any other Michael Bay film. This movie has great acting, and voice acting, by all of the cast including the new addition of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, a former Victoria's Secret model did a great job for her first movie ever, and if you hear any different do NOT listen. She was even better than Megan Fox. Voice acting was superb as the last two movies. Story was probably a 8/10. It had a LOT more story than the other Transformers films, and then some. This movie took real life events and adds them into a story that is intense and captivating. Cons include small story gaps, but nothing big enough to be a problem. Overall this movie was a success and let me just say it one more time. Do not listen to people who trash this movie. If you look at their reviews, you can easily tell they never watched it or are just flaming it because Michael Bay is a not notorious for being nice in person... Do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you do not like it then maybe I have a different taste for movies that everyone else here. You must watch this movie."

","Dark of the moon has made sure there will be a great future for the franchise, bay demonstrates that he has perfected his knowledge of the bots in disguise and takes it to another level. The film is a perfect combination of the previous two installments but with it's own originality in story, characters and action sequences, bay has displayed a great deal of care in the putting together of this film and it shows. As an original fan of the transformers from the cartoons I just wish to thank bay for being able to bring them to life in live action films, thank you Mr bay and please at least do one more or at least be an on hands producer to make sure the standard set by dark of the moon is continued.well done bay.<br/><br/>Regards, A very pleased transformers fan."
"jack_orange_18","8","1","4","12 July 2011"," I approve.
","FIrst, let's get something straight. I enjoyed the first film. 7/10. I think people can understand that rating. The second film, i gave a 5/10, and again I think some will agree. There are some bad and good of that film, so it evens out to mediocre. But the third one, was great. And yes, that's probably the best word to put it. There are flaws, of course, but I think that this was the movie that was trying to take itself seriously, for the most part. There aren't as many annoying robots this time round, and I honestly didn't notice any racial stereotypes, there might be a few subtle ones but they stick out like a sore thumb like in the other films. Many people are complaining about Rosie Huntington's character being the only likable one, and that laBeouf's is obnoxious and screams a lot. I find him fine this time around, and that he only screams for comedic reasons. I should also add that Huntington does a fairly good job for someone whose never acted before. I was impressed. I feel the third act was taken very seriously, and Bay knew he had to finish the series in a well executed way. I believe he succeeded. He is slowly moving away from that fast paced editing, and takes us on some nice long shots to let the audience breathe. And there was no more forced storytelling like in the last movie, we learn with the characters at some points, which was pretty nice. This movie's only big mistake was the runtime. Quite lengthy. ANd let's not forget that the effects and action is spectacular, as always expected from a transformers movie. It's a well made movie, and while not all the problems are gone, they've at least faded a little. And that is all I have to say. In the end, I give it 8/10. But hey, that's just me."
"heil_99","7","1","4","11 July 2011"," 21st Century, All-American Godzilla Movie
","When I was a kid, I used to watch Godzilla movies on TV every Saturday. Those movies always had these really long, boring passages with humans fighting other humans that I'd have to sit through in order to get to the good stuff: MAN IN SUIT! MAN IN SUIT! Transormers 3 is EXACTLY the same thing. Well, except for the ""man in suit"" part.<br/><br/>Godzilla movies were not known for their character development, their story lines, their nuance in dialog or deep themes. I loved them because I loved to see Godzilla do his thing. Mothra, Rodan, Ghidorah... they didn't win many movie awards in their day. I could have happily watched 90 minutes of rubber monsters duking it out. Still could, scarily enough.<br/><br/>What we have with Transformers 3 is a Godzilla movie. Only this is not some low-budget affair with practical effects. This is an over-budgeted, over-produced, CG monstrosity with a master who somehow manages to keep it on a leash! In 3-D!!! Michael Bay, one of my least-favorite directors working in A-list Hollywood these days, has made his masterpiece. This is the biggest, fastest, loudest and perhaps MEANEST 150 minutes (yes, this mofo is 2 1/2 hours long!) I've spent in a movie theater in a long while. Bay stages action sequence after robot fight scene after explosion after pervy booty shot after another in an endless loop of adolescent ecstasy.<br/><br/>That's right, adolescent. I got real childish kick out of it. I'm 35 years old. But it was similar moments in movies from when I was a kid, those initial HOLY COW-PAT moments, like seeing Mary Poppins jump into a picture or Darth Vader slice off Luke's hand or Godzilla laying the smack-down on Mecha-Godzilla, that made me the movie lover I am today! There is fully one hour of AWESOME in the movie. The other 90 minutes, the human scenes, are tripe. Lousy story (who knows what's going on?), lousy characters (it's impossible to distinguish any of the Transformers, other than the two red-and-blue ones), lousy acting, comedic moments that land with a thud, lamentable dialog. But Bay keeps his camera during these human scenes firmly trained on the supple curves of the romantic lead, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, with some vintage Bay Dirty-Old-Man Cam, and that makes the proceedings much, much easier. He clearly takes none of this seriously, which is a good thing. After all, it's a movie about ROBOTS SMASHING ROBOTS! It's not about these 90 minutes of human nonsense. It's about the other 60 full of AWESOME.<br/><br/>And what 60 they are. Robots smashing robots. Robots shooting robots. Ripping apart other robots. Blowing up other robots. Astronauts exploring alien wreckage on the moon. Serpentine robots sailing through buildings like the Loch Ness Monster. Soldiers sailing across the Chicago skyline while dastardly machines try to shoot them down... IN 3-D!!! Mindless action the likes of which we haven't seen since Toho was crushing model tanks under latex feet. On a much higher budget.<br/><br/>And let's hear it for 3-D!!! Avatar really disappointed me. Like, REALLY disappointed me. But in Transformers 3... wow, AWESOME. For 60 of the 150. (67 if you include all the 3-D booty shots.) 60 minutes, by the way, is an incredible amount of time for flat-out action in a single movie. In the Godzilla movies, you were lucky to get 20-30. Then again, those movies were half as long.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of Transformers 3, which tie the ensuing storyline to the first moon landing, are a tour de force of contemporary, big-budget Hollywod filmmaking: dynamic, gripping, utterly stupid, completely absorbing. Easily the best thing I have evah seen from Michael Bay. EVAHHH.<br/><br/>I hated the first Transformers movie. Hated, hated, HATED it. You couldn't PAY me to watch the second one after the unanimous HATE it got. But this one, number 3, was *exactly* what I wanted. It was like I was in my backyard with two of the original Hasbro toys in my hands, banging them together in a fight to the finish... only much, much louder."

But did anyone notice that he used the line, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was the very same line he used in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that no one had picked up on that.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was complete garbage.

"mcgriff1290","Null","1","4","11 July 2011"," Good but not great
","The first Transformers was a great set up for the series openers and transformed the Saturday morning cartoon into a box office hit. The second movie was a disappointment to what the first movie accomplished and left a bad taste in the mouths of fans and critics alike. Now we are introduced to the third and final film that tries to reset the bar set by the original and send Transformers off in an applause. From the middle to end this movie reaches the sheer adrenaline that was presented to the audience in the series opener. Delivering more action and story then the both films, but the major issues associated this with film is the running time is stretched a little and a lot of dry, unfunny humor. Those few hiccups may be a problem, but the last hour of amazing robot vs. robot action will distract from those flaws a bit. Plus the added 3D is a nice touch to the film and is one of the best incorporated 3D I have seen in a movie. Transformers 3 was not a great film by any means, but best one of the series and a great summer flick where you can sit back and enjoy all the action this movie has to offer. Michael Bay is not the greatest director, but is the best in crafting some of the best action sequences ever displayed on a movie screen and does his best work in this movie. He has to be given a lot of credit at what he does best and never fails to raise the level of action in each one of the Robot movies, despite the lack there of story and acting. He knows his weakness as a director and knows how to outshine it with his craft, making his movies enjoyable to watchable. In saying all those things, the story that follows Shia Labeouf character use to symbolize an anchor in the sense that it ways down the film, never letting it reach its potential. It was redundant at times to watch him and his gang of pointless cast members running across the screen, screaming, making bad jokes and doing nothing but serve as a human connection for the audience to relate to. Rosie Whiteley, who is a far better actor than Megan Fox and more charming, was a great plus to the Transformers story. Also new comers John Malkovich and Ken Jong are meaningless, replaceable actors that are placed in the film to be a comic relief that never gets there. The human cast that succeeds in making their presence be felt are Patrick Dempsey and Frances McDormand who were incredible to watch in this film and display the best acting out of the cast. They fit in perfect and brings a certain edge and seriousness to the film. I'm going out on a limb here and say that the thing that makes this a good film are the robots. Their acting has never been showcased in the movies and never given enough screen time to understand them better, but Bay must have realize that and given them more depth. They display better performances than their human counterparts and give the audience what we have been yearning for since the begin and that's more connection to them. I mean beside them having more depth, they have a lot of nice eye dazzling scenes and just grabs the enter child in you. This apocalyptic movie tone is way darker than its predecessors and pushes the boundary of a PG- 13 movie. The Transformers trilogy as a whole if not one of the greatest cinema has seen, but on the perspective of action films, it has set the bar high for action films in the future. Transformer 3, while a flawed movie at times sends the Robot series out in style and is one best sequel by far in the summer non worthy sequels."
"charlieccannon3","4","1","4","11 July 2011"," 6.8? Seriously?
","This movie deserves much more than a 6.8 review. That is lower than the first one which is nothing compared to this. As far as I am concerned, this is the first actual movie that Michael Bay as tried on. This movie is excellent. It has a nice, followable storyline, amazing effects, and good acting; what more could you ask for. People are just giving this movie bad reviews because the critics don't like Michael Bay and the people want to be like the critics. If you are on the edge about seeing this, don't let the rating fool you. This movie is fantastic! I have already seen it three times and while it does have it's certain microscopic flaws, this movie really is excellent and has a wonderful ending. Congrats Michael bay, you have gained the support of one more person."
"eric-zander100","8","1","4","11 July 2011"," Considering I had zero good expectation to see a good film, I was pleasantly surprised!
","Michael Bay doesn't makes films that would be considered in an award ceremony for anything except special and sound effects. I also have the opinion that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the worst block busters I have seen. I won't give away much of the story (what little there is here) and get on with the review.<br/><br/>Like I said, there isn't much of a story here, and what story there is gets very predictable. Who cares. This film is 100% meant for those who want to shut their brains off for a couple of hours, sit back, and enjoy some amazing visuals. <br/><br/>The story itself is MUCH better than that of Revenge of the Fallen. With RotF, I felt that they tried to pack too much in to it all at once. There was no set up for many of the film's larger plot points, and they were just presented in an ""in-your-face"" fashion, like ""oh by the way you should know these eight things so we can get on with the movie."" This film, however, uses a much more simple plot line and in my opinion it works. <br/><br/>For the most part this was a film you were meant to go and enjoy for what it has to offer. That would be: explosions, special effects, some comedy mixed with even more explosions and special effects. For the hell of it throw in a beautiful woman, who unfortunately was more eye candy than anything as her acting wasn't all that great(much like Fox). Did I care though? Even if her acting sucked I still couldn't stop paying attention to her, which I feel is exactly what she was in the movie for.<br/><br/>The special effects and explosions mentioned above were top-notch. People put a great deal of work in to making this film look visually stunning. Many of the stunts were unrealistic, but we as an audience should forgive this because it is a science fiction film. Who cares about the technical crap when you realize the film was never intended to be for the most part realistic. If you have the ability to switch off and be stunned by what you see on the screen without thinking ""he should be dead"" or ""they would never do that"" then this is the movie for you. I know some movie-goers have trouble doing this, and in some instances it's justified. Not here, though. We were promised an action flick that will entertain the dumb side of us all, and Bay delivered.<br/><br/>Remember, I absolutely HATED the second film. The special effects were great but jumpy, the story was convoluted, and it was just an overall piece of crap, in my own opinion. This film makes up for most of the mistakes the second one made, and I believe it accomplished everything it was supposed to. So use this review to make an informed judgement. You should have a pretty clear idea of what to expect. <br/><br/>If you expect it to get to you on a deeper level, you'll be disappointed. If you wanted a new ""Dark Knight"" or some other action film with substance, you'll be disappointed. If you expect to see a bunch of robots blowing up buildings and each other, have decent special effects, and laugh every now and then, you have a chance of walking out of the theater (or your living room) pleasantly surprised like I was."
"onegemini77","5","1","4","8 July 2011"," (( Spoiler Alert )) Please someone other than Michael Bay for the next
","Let us start out with the good: -Action 10/10: The only good thing about this movie are the action scenes. When Optimos fights watch out. It was also good to see more involvement with the newer autobots. I was upset in the previous movie for almost always showing the autobots in their auto form. We got to see a lot more of them in robot form and in combat with this one. I find it hard to fault anything in the action scenes. I especially liked the wingsuits and how intense it felt as guys tried to escape their transports. Not sure where they would go with another one, as it seems all the major Decepticons have been killed (Really bring Megatron back again from being smashed to pieces).<br/><br/>-Acting 3/10: Absolutely horrible. Once more we have the constant dithering between almost all the actors, excepting the soldiers and Optimus Prime. It was almost painful to sit through it all, just to get to the action.<br/><br/>-Plot 6/10: This movie is a story from the old cartoons, where cybertron actually was moved into our solar system. As a child watching it, you do not question such a massive object appearing in Earth's orbit. Now we have to suspend belief for these movies, after all we are watching transforming intelligent alien robots. However, even in the prebious movies, they tried to keep within the boundaries of physics. A massive object like Cybertron appearing that close to Earth, would likely tear the surface apart. At the very least, in this movie, they could have had it cause devastating effects world wide. Which would possibly even the playihng field more and provide a post apocalyptic setting for future movies. Still the fact that they took from the old cartoon added points. The rest is quite atrocious. The way they introduced a new (smoking hot) girl to replace the last, was slapstick at best. They expect us to believe the girl from the first two movies dumps the guy and is a total beeatch. They also expect us to believe that the next girl he dates is working for the right hand man of the Decepticons? The whole scene with Jerry Wang was ludicrous. Seriously we had to sit through all that to get to the final battle? Thank god for scene selection when this comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>-3D 3/10: Really, what is all the hype about 3D? It wasn't that impressive. It seemed Forced in places. It seemed like they did not know when to use it and when not to. The whole thing was more of a minor headache and it is almost twice as much.<br/><br/>-Overall 5.5/10: Rounded down on review vote at my discretion. Truly the only good thing about this movie are the action scenes. Which would be just as good at home on an non-3D HDTV.<br/><br/>One last note, I hope someone else takes the Transformers on. I am tired of the Michael Bay/Shia Labeouf team."
"ryokan_wc","9","1","4","11 July 2011"," TRANSFORMERS forever!
","When the credits began to roll, the first word that came out my mouth was 'Damn!'. And i'll say it again- DAMN, the movie is Tomahawk spectacular!<br/><br/>Transformers. Ever since the news of its third installment was released, i was anticipating this movie like none other. With an intensified desire to watch and an irresistible attraction to the robots in disguise, i was all willing to work deeper into my pocket to fork out the price for a 3-D ticket.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a fictitious twist to the moon landing history- the discovery of one of the Autobots spaceships remains on the Moon. Years later, Autobots and Decepticons on Earth realize the existence of powerful Cybertronian parts in the ship and war between the two intergalactic parties starts- the final battle.<br/><br/>The movie has a solid storyline- smart! The twists and turns in this movie keeps me on the edge of my seat. However, i have to admit that the beginning was a tad too choppy and it made the movie a little messy. It progresses at warp speed, developing the characters and story simultaneously in between scenes. Unlike Transformers 2, this movie does not start with a 'bang' at the beginning or has continuously loud action scenes at the stage of development. It takes a more subtle approach, building everything to a peak so high i have never seen in any other movie. When the twist of the plot is revealed, the movie kicks in in high gear!<br/><br/>The real Bay prevails- the action movie maestro, and for the next hour or more, the movie blasts to the end. The struggles between the Autobots and Decepticons, and the Autobots-side human allies and the Decepticons- side human allies take over, lots of explosions, running, screaming and shooting. The effect is mind-blowing! And my eyes were locked to the screen, in awe at the transforming vehicles and true-to-life gunfire. The music comes at the right time, rushing adrenaline through my veins.<br/><br/>Some scenes in the climax strike straight to the heart and it would be a lie if i say i had no goosebumps or chills run down my spine. At times, i was touched by the characters' words and actions. I was constantly rooting for the Autobots, cheering every time they tear a Decepticon and take its life; i felt like having a gun or bomb or anything that can shoot so that i can help those Autobots. I was deeply pulled into the movie, fitting myself in Sam's or any other soldier's shoe. I had never really felt this absorbed, this connected in the movies.<br/><br/>The fight was one of the greatest ever, different characters- human and robots, converging paths. I can't word out how the movie manages to link the characters together with its plot. You have to see it to believe it. Kudos to Bay and his crew, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and the rest of the casts for a tremendous effort. Alas, I don't really like Megan Fox but her character is definitely nicer to watch than Carly Spencer, Sam's new love.<br/><br/>As a fan of Transformers, and always will be, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Iron Hide, Ratchet, Sideswipe to name a few, will always play a role in me. A lesson of loyalty to be learned, and to have faith in oneself teaches a lot about life itself. And a story told in such epic grandeur, my money is well worth spent and i don't mind returning to the cinema for another run of endless action scenes.<br/><br/>Sit back and relax in its beginning and buckle up when it comes. Because when it comes, there is no stop! Transformers 3 rocks to its core and Dark of the Moon is a perfect end to this trilogy. Transformers forever, an Autobots at heart, and a ride i will never forget! Damn!"
"fee-hee-hee-heeny","9","1","4","10 July 2011"," Not awful, but not perfect. Still pretty fantastic though.
","I have seen all of the movies in the series and absolutely love all of them. I'm addicted to the action, the explosions, and the stunts. Shia LaBeouf is fantastic as always. All of the original characters were good as well, but it seemed like they were trying to shove their stars down our throats. The movie easily could have done without Patrick Dempsey and especially without that model Rosie-whatever. She was unexperienced and clearly just added for her looks. Who would have thought that I would have missed Megan Fox! But I definitely wish that they had hired someone who deserved the role for something other than their sex-appeal. She added nothing worthwhile to the movie. Other than the force-fed celebrities and beauties, the movie was full of drama and action and I loved it! There were twists and turns at every corner. In addition, you could really connect to the robots (as ridiculous as it may sound) but every time one of the good robots was killed I was affected. They had original robot characters as well as new ones to add to the plot. All in all I loved the movie (especially in 3 D) and would definitely go see it again!"
"FoxWolf87","7","1","4","10 July 2011"," A Definite Improvement
","Having seen the last film, ""Revenge of the Fallen,"" I did not have high expectations for this movie. I also heard a lot of bad reviews of this film. But having seen it, I have to say the movie was actually pretty decent and I think it's a definite improvement from the last one. In fact it's probably the best of the three. That's not to say it doesn't have its problems, but I did actually find myself entertained by this film and I do appreciate that the filmmakers tried to make improvements based on everyone's complaints about the last film.<br/><br/>IMPROVEMENTS - Annoying characters are mostly dialed back and removed, and stereotypes are dialed back. That's not to say there aren't stereotypes, but the stereotypes this time around didn't totally offend or annoy me to the point where I couldn't enjoy the film. Skids and Mudflap are gone with no explanation (they needed to be removed from existence), the parents aren't in it as much, and John Turturro is far less annoying. The story makes more sense (at least for a popcorn fun blockbuster) and I'm able to understand what's going on without getting totally annoyed. There are no robot balls, and there is no close-up of John Turturro in his underpants (there is a close-up of Ken Jeong in his underpants, but it's played up for a shock humor joke which actually made me laugh for the big payoff so I can't complain. Others might find it offensive, though). Oh, and there is far less dog and robot humping all around.<br/><br/>OTHER POSITIVES - Obviously the action and special effects. Definite props to the animators, the cinematographers, the stunt coordinators, and the special effects guys because they did an amazing job. Again. Plus I'm actually able to tell which robots are fighting in this movie, which is good. The jokes are a bit funnier this time around (not all big laughs, and not all tasteful, but definitely more hits than the last movie). There is better (not great) but better character development and I didn't totally loathe anyone. The pacing, the editing, and the music were also all very good. The elements I enjoyed all contributed to the story and added to my enjoyment of the film. The villains are also much more threatening because they have a definite goal and you see more of the damage they can cause (although the foaming at the mouth was over the top).<br/><br/>NEGATIVES - There are a lot of unnecessary cameos and characters in the film who pop in and leave. For example, I'm not sure why John Malkovich is in this because he doesn't really do anything. He just comes in, acts weird, and leaves. They introduce him like he's an important character and then he's dismissed about halfway through. Kim Jeong will be annoying and offensive to some people, but he didn't annoy me so I really only mention this for the benefit of others. Bill O'Reilly and Buzz Aldrin make unnecessary and distracting cameos. And I love Leonard Nimoy, I think he had a good voice role in this film, and I love Star Trek and Spock, but the Spock love was totally distracting. They mention Spock a lot, show a scene from ""Amok Time,"" make references to the Enterprise, and even have Leonard quote a famous ""Wrath of Khan"" line. It's really very distracting. There are a ton of distracting ad placements in the movie (which, you should really expect if you go to see any Michael Bay film because they pay for the effects). Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a very sexualized, very stereotypical, very useless damsel in distress who may be offensive to some people (as one of only 2 major female characters in the movie). There are also still very noticeable plot and logic errors, despite the improvements, and some scenes that don't quite fit right.<br/><br/>But, in spite of my problems with it, it did entertain me and I did enjoy it. It's about on the same level as ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" or ""Twister"" and any problems I had are made up for by the improvements and positives. <br/><br/>7/10 - Some problems, but overall enjoyable popcorn fun. Recommended for people who just want to watch a robots and stuff blowing up movie without worrying too much about plot or characters.<br/><br/>3D<br/><br/>I don't like 3D anyway, but I saw this with a friend in 3D, and I do have to admit that the 3D was better than the last film I saw in 3D (""Tron Legacy""). It's not totally dark, and it didn't make me sick looking at it. However, the graphics popping out are still distracting, and I can't focus on some of the animation detail due to the blurring effect of some of the 3D graphics. If you go to see this I recommend 2D just to get the full details of the animations."

","Without debating the technical aspects of the 3d in the movie, Transofrmers, Dark Of Side Of The Moon, was a wonderful ride. I believe the 3d box office for the film was driven in equal parts to a wonderful story, a wonderful star (Shia Labeouf), a wonderful supporting cast ensemble, and wonderful CG capably drawn in a dimensional medium.<br/><br/>I was happy that the dimension in the film was used to paint the landscape rather than as a neon flag to be waved in front of one's nose. My experience was that negative space elements were treated, in the most part, with respect. I like the fact that in much of the film the camera moves were slowed down so one could truly enjoy and explore the airspace.<br/><br/>Granted there were some scenes where the camera moves and cuts were exhaustively fast and furious ala 2D.<br/><br/>I like the fact that the medium is starting to come of age. To me, there were more positives in the crafting of the film than negatives. (Not to be confused with positive and negative space).<br/><br/>Other than the weight of the shutter glasses over a 2.5 hour period, I found myself wonderfully immersed in the story and visuals rather than being constantly pulled out of the story by Marx Bros-esque face slapping 3D.<br/><br/>Meredith Day - Dreamland 3D"
"johnnymacbest","7","1","4","9 July 2011"," Entertaining than Revenge of The Fallen.
","Upon entering the theater, I was really hesitant on seeing this film; mainly due to the fact that Revenge of The Fallen received very negative reviews. However, and I'm really shocked to say this, I actually enjoyed Dark of The Moon. Sure it's no masterpiece by any means, but what do you expect from a director whose only talent is making things blow up minus character development, plot, and dialog.<br/><br/>Dark Of the Moon really is the best film in the series, surpassing ROTF by many a long shot. It's story is better than the first two films, though that's not saying a lot when Bay for no apparent reason at all, inserts random shots of sexual innuendo that really serves no purpose at all in the film and scenes that are totally unnecessary; particularly the antique car and bathroom scene. But the battle scenes between the robots is really impressive and I'm shocked to admit that I was on the edge of my seat watching it all.<br/><br/>But still, some characters are seriously overlooked; especially the villains Megatron, Starscream, and Shockwave. Sentinel Prime, really, was the only one who had the most development out of them all. As better than Revenge of the Fallen may be, Dark of the Moon still suffers from the same problems that 1 and 2 had: No fully fleshed out characters and plot. Dark of The Moon has a plot, but it's really skin deep as far as the twists and turns go and because of the fact alone, the emotional attachment is drained significantly.<br/><br/>I will say that Dark of The Moon is better than Revenge of The Fallen, but it's not exactly the game changer of the whole Transformers mythos. And judging by the box-office business it's doing in theaters, it's safe to say that a 4 installment will inevitably be made. Hopefully by then it will have a better director and screenwriter along with better acting and plot."
"ced_yuen","Null","1","4","8 July 2011"," The sequel that 'Revenge of the Fallen' should have been
","""Transformers, robots in disguise! Autobots wage their battle to destroy the evil forces of the Decepticons"". Simple lyrics, from the theme-tune of the 1980s cartoon, outline what 'Transformers' is all about: the simplicity of good versus evil, combined with the novelty of shape-shifting robots.<br/><br/>The key problem with the sequel, 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen', was its attempt at 'humour', which took attention away from the robots' story. The film became defined by bad decisions. Offensive stereotypes, irritating characters, robot testicles – there wasn't much room left for good and evil.<br/><br/>Hope, however, is not lost. With 'Transformers 3', director Michael Bay demonstrates that, to an extent, he is able to learn. 'Dark Of The Moon' is far from perfect, but it does redeem many past mistakes.<br/><br/>This instalment begins in the 1960s, when a Cybertronian spaceship crash-lands on the Moon. The US government quickly launches their space program to cover things up. Fast- forward to today, and it transpires that the vessel contains *Important Things*, which the Autobots must recover before the Decepticons do so. As usual, humans are caught up in the ensuing destruction.<br/><br/>Much effort has gone into making the robots' war relevant to humans. The destruction at the end of the first 'Transformers' had little impact on its sequel. Now, there are consequences. Autobots must follow military rules and procedures. Cities have sensors to detect Decepticon presence.<br/><br/>Transformers now occupy the background of little-known historical events such as the moon landing and Chernobyl – a simple but inspired move. Finally, the Cybertronians seem more like a civilisation than a handful of characters. It feels as though the fate of man is tied to the alien war, giving the film a sense of threat sorely lacking in earlier outings. The Decepticons are now far nastier. The scenes of collateral damage in the first 'Transformers' had a slapstick quality, but this time the approach is brutal. People die on- screen - the camera follows as people plummet off skyscrapers.<br/><br/>The action is much more coherent. The fights, previously a series of tumbling metallic blurs, have been replaced by specific choreography. Bumblebee, for example, seems to have picked up Taekwondo. The clarity of the action allows for some truly stunning set pieces.<br/><br/>The improvements, which could have made this the strongest entry in the trilogy, are undermined by a few persisting issues. The racial stereotypes remain. There is a very strange Chinese character called Wang; an English-sounding Autobot calls people ""old chap""; a Scottish-sounding one threatens to ""bottle"" an enemy. These are not offensive so much as they are painfully unfunny.<br/><br/>The unnecessary, overpowering minor characters remain. Sam's (Shia LaBoeuf) parents return, sucking life out of every scene they occupy. Sam's boss, played with crazed zeal by John Malkovich, is nonetheless pointless. Supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley performs acceptably as Megan Fox's replacement token eye-candy, but the fact remains that the romance side-story is a waste of time - time that could be better used.<br/><br/>Despite a steady introduction, the middle is rushed to accommodate an overly long and busy third act. Bay, no doubt, felt indebted to his military contacts - there are far too many shots of soldiers getting into position. The action can be spectacular, but the truly impressive scenes are diluted with an overabundance of activity.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Transformers: Dark Of The Moon' is a success. It is inexcusable for the same issues to keep reappearing, but these are outweighed by numerous improvements that this entry brings. Those who didn't like the first film will have no reason to see this follow-up. For those who did, this is the sequel that 'Revenge Of The Fallen' should have been."
"valen060","9","1","4","8 July 2011"," For A Michael Bay Film: Just Reached Mayhem to the Max!
","Michael Bay just brought ""destruction"" and ""mayhem"" to a whole new level compared to his past movies! It definitely blows the previous ""Transformers"" films he's done right into the stratosphere! <br/><br/>With Shia LaBeouf back once more as protagonist Sam Witwicky, looks like his reputation as an A-list actor just got brighter (no way LaBeouf will work cheap so easily now) With Bay's constant signature explosions, continuous robot brawls, few comedic moments (most notably Ken Jeong delivering a few of his somewhat obvious, toned down ""Hangover"" shtick), and various acts of betrayal and cunningness, Bay has just made his formula go unstable (in a good way)! <br/><br/>I needed some time to make sense of all that madness and this movie reduces ""Revenge of the Fallen"" to ashes.<br/><br/>Megan Fox's replacement (newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) didn't quite fill in the void she left behind (because Fox was a little more active and a headstrong female figure than what Rosie could possibly pull), the script could have improved by a tiny percentile, and the acting needed several tweaks, but in the wake of every destruction on-screen, my adrenaline just kept growing higher. What caught my attention above all was seeing factual U.S. historical moments crossed over with the fictional storyline. It was amazing on how the filmmakers can make these intertwine. Hasn't changed one bit since ""Forrest Gump."" <br/><br/>Thanks to minimal support of 3D from fellow director James Cameron, Cameron and Bay just made the film work out. A must-see!"
"dhrgoos","8","1","4","8 July 2011"," Very entertaining!
","Last night me and 4 of my best friends went to see Transformers DOTM in 3D.<br/><br/>We had a blast of a time! We enjoyed the graphics, the action, special effects, the cast (read: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley :-) )and the non complex (but very entertaining) storyline.<br/><br/>True, this is definitely not a film to watch with your girlfriend, wife, parents, grandparents or anyone who thinks this movie has a cultural or profound meaning.<br/><br/>In short, this one to see when you want a great night out with your buds of budettes and a cold one."
"Sam_Ramzy","6","1","4","7 July 2011"," I had fun but,,,,
","OK, i won't say any spoilers but the story it self is shallow and allow me to say its totally predictable, we all knew what will happen, in other words you'll give your brain a rest because there's no depth in the story at all. What was real amazing was the effects i mean wow :D its one of those few time that you can actually have fun in a 3D movie i was in the edge of my seat ,Michael Bay made an amazing job in directing this movie. Hell yeah i had a lot of fun and i had a gr8 time, but that's all the movie's goal is to have fun so it served its purpose, but don't expect to see something deep, because you won't find any.So if you just want to have fun, see flying robots and these kind of stuff then this film is for you."
"leachim3","5","1","4","7 July 2011"," Overwhelming and not 3D-compatible
","I thought the first and second Transformers were actually better than this one. I actually like pop-corn action movies, though.<br/><br/>Although John Malkovic and ""Dutch"" were good fun, the rest of the acting was bad enough to take away from enjoying the action, as action movie lovers like to do, especially the main actress.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot telling did not allow for a continuous feel of suspense to arise. This was partially due to important scenes being way too short, others were way too long.<br/><br/>The action scenes were not as well spread over the film. There was one action scene in the first half, and the second half was one action scene. The second half dragged on too long because of this.<br/><br/>As an action fan I have to say that the fights were ""cooler"" in the second Transformers. Better and more convincing fighting from the Autobots.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of 3D in the first place, by in my opinion, unless your in the center of the one row 3D is actually enjoyable from, I would don't recommend seeing this movie in 3D. There is so much action, that the low definition and blur of 3D really stones you by the end. It's too much."

","Transformers 3 was amazing! It was the better instalment by far, and one of the best action blockbusters this year.<br/><br/>The story was excellent, the acting plausible, and the effects grand. Fight scenes were clear, a vast improvement from un-interpretable clashing tin in previous attempts - it was now possible to distinguish who was duelling with what!<br/><br/>Transformers 3 was different from the other 2. The war for humanity - its survival, its struggle - was comparable to epic battles in Lord of the Rings. Victory meant everything, and failure meant all.<br/><br/>The film was comical, action-packed, romantic, adventurous - elements all rolled into one, but executed harmoniously well. It was global but personal; there was a sense of hope but also a feeling of loss.<br/><br/>True fans of the Transformers brand will not be disappointed. Go watch now! It's beautiful..."
"nEoFILM","7","1","4","7 July 2011"," Underrated
","This is the third and final installment of the iconoclastic Transformers franchise. By the law of diminishing returns, this should have fallen well below the par from the excellent first outing; well, has it? The answer is a definite no. First off, it's not as good as good as Transformers, lacking much of the comedy and puerile action, but it would be on par with the Revenge Of The Fallen, which is not up to much in many critic's opinions, which was overly smashy, confused and missed some of the pacing of the first.<br/><br/>Dark Of the Moon carries on the tradition of complex back stories, tying in to U.S. Space Race history, this time, right back to 1962 and the inception of the Apollo programme. Here, they postulate that NASA's moon race was purely conceived to get to the Moon first to recover a massive Cybertron based space craft, which had crashed in the Moon after the final battle on the doomed Transformer planet.<br/><br/>At the crash site, Sentinel Prime is discovered and years later, Optimus Prime recovers him, as he was the true leader of the Autobots in their war with the Decepticons. Also, there are a collection of what are referred to as Pillars, very 3D friendly, yet still plausibly so, floating metallic rod styled devices which would play a pivotal role later. Meanwhile, Sam, Shia LaBeouf, has moved on from his Megan Fox girlfriend and has now, somewhat inexplicably, moved in with Victoria Secrets model, though in the film, she's supposed to be some form a P.A., played by the inept Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, which is simply ridiculous. This point is also brought up in the script as his own mother warns him that he would not get so lucky a third time!<br/><br/>The world is has now been invaded by Decepticons and Sam, along with his collection of mis-matched allies and seven remaining Autobots are all that stands between them and total destruction. Sounds like a good setup but with a typical running time 157 minutes, the plot was simply too thin to sustain itself, leading to patchy pacing and moments that begin to plod. I didn't find this to be all that bad but others felt that the word boring would more than a little apt.<br/><br/>You see for me, the pay off of robots beating the hell out of each other and taking the world down with them is worth the wait and the flaws in the narrative, but for others, this will not be the case. Leonard Nimoy's voice portrayal of Sentinel Prime was fine, but the constant need to remind us that it was Mr. Spock wasn't. This culminated in a completely unnecessary piece of dialogue where Sentinel reprises Spock's line from Star Trek II, ""...The needs of the many, out way the needs of the few"". This was a quote to far in my opinion, certainly when justifying some questionable and immoral acts...<br/><br/>Then there was the 3D, and what 3D it was! This finally proved that a blockbuster can be produced in 3D without sacrificing the cinematography for cynical dimensional gestures. The film looked as I would expect any 2D blockbustering actioner to look, with sweeping aerial action and objects flying towards the audience but the 3D effect only amplified this, and didn't make it. This was well conceived and I take my hats of to them. This is what 3D should look like and it was visually arresting.<br/><br/>Overall, the film provided all the thrills and spills that you would expect from Transformers, with acceptable acting for a film of this genre, with the gross exception of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who should stick to modeling and as acting or even speaking would seem to be light years beyond her. John Malkovich and Frances McDormand, deliver great cameos and bring some of the only really decent acting to the film, with the further exceptions of the returning John Turturro and the addition of Alan Tudyk, who both deliver most of the belly laughs in this outing.<br/><br/>It was fun but not as much fun as the previous films. DOTM was clearly trying to shift the tone and in doing so it succeeded at moving the film into a slightly darker, more action film place. This felt more like a straight forward 12 rated actioner such as Bay's other efforts, The Rock and Armageddon and a little less of the lighter more child friendly overtones of the previous two. Still, I enjoyed this and feel very strongly that the naysayers who would rate this film so lowly that you'd have to look for it in the gutter, have allowed themselves to take this way too seriously.<br/><br/>Is this the end of for Transformers? I hope so, but the door is still open and with the vast profits that it's already made, Transformers 4 could be just around the next corner. If that's the case, it is not what i would prefer, feeling that they've gone as far as they came but I would certainly run out to watch it!"
"pkrayden","8","1","4","7 July 2011"," Surprisingly better than I had thought.
","First of all unlike most people this review will not be biased. I'm not a fan of Michael bay; personally he's not the greatest mare in the stable but I can say I finally can feel closure to the adventure that began in the first film. Truthfully that's all that matters. I didn't and won't ever expect to go into a movie about giant alien transforming sentient machines thinking it will top Inception or tease me intellectually. The initial plot is the worst possible idea of all time, and it has got to be the longest rant about false history I've ever endured..Its so annoying and it lasts the first 20-30 minutes.But After we get over the fact that Sam (Lebeouf) had been dumped by his girlfriend and the FIRST moon landing and outer space adventure was staged to retrieve something it soon becomes safe to retract your hand from your face. Because after the pleasantries are over its all a big thrill ride of sarcasm, robots, Bad ass revenge, explosions, and actually a surprisingly good subplot in my opinion. I went to see this to be entertained. Its a film based on a cartoon, not a documentary. If you wanna criticize physics, locality, and even the social standing of women I think you'd ought to check out the cartoon for yourself. Transformers is what it say sit is. And this one ""and then some"". I could complain all day about it but it was 100% worth watching. Except for Rosie, at least Fox was an actor. Five things say this movie deserves an 8: The cliché but unexpected betrayals, The death scenes, The worm, Sam's coming of age subplot,and the Cole Train."

","This my first review in IMDb.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wanted to share my thoughts.<br/><br/>I loved both previous Transformers movies and was expecting a lot from this one.Luckily it doesn't disappoint.The movie starts slow and shows its mettle from the second half.But from there on out its an action packed thrill ride.The transformer fights and some scenarios are breathtaking.Only negative that i felt is the replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley brings in nothing new and plays her part as expected.Even with some wrongs here and there its an action packed fantastic movie and if you loved the previous ones you will LOVE this one.I only wonder where Michael bay will take this franchise to from here on out.<br/><br/>My rating:8\10"

","I rather enjoyed the movie. I thought it was much better than part two. It had good comic relief and the action stunts were good, some a bit over the top but overall good. Loved the dark undertone of the plot, it was a nice change for Transformers. Liked how the humans were more needed in this one despite stupid antics by the ones in charge. but your main human heroes were important and played a much braver role in here which was nice to see. It had some tearful moments but ended well. There were definitely areas to improve on but I can't complain. I believe the viewers will enjoy this movie and I must say it was nice to see Megan Fox out of the movie."

"Mikeboy0001","5","1","4","5 July 2011"," I'm Glad I Saw This....
","....on my 15.6'' PC screen. Sorry, but it really doesn't deserve better than that. I only watch movies from cam source when I suspect they won't be very good, and unfortunately, I was more than right about this one. Only some directors get me to a Cinema these days, but I also enjoy watching good CGI movies there, for the spectacle we get with sound effects. Transformers 1, although with flaws, was a movie I enjoyed watching a lot in the big screen. Transformers 2 destroyed the good feelings I had for the first movie. Transformers 3, makes the 80's cartoons I used to love as a kid, look like Citizen Kane. The story is almost a copy of the previous movie, and it's so, so bad. It goes from one set to another, with no sense or point. We never care for a moment about any caracther, not even my beloved Optimus Prime. Man, in the cartoons even the Decepticons had a lot of personality. Megatron was tough, but Starscream was a badass, I always loved the disputes between him and Megatron. Michael Bay seems to wannabe a James Cameron like director, but it's far from it. In Cameron's movies, we always have a link to the caracthers, then we get the action and CGI as a part of the process. It's like building a house, you've start at the foundations, and only then you place the nice design on top of it. He also seems to add now a few elements of slow motion, alias, Zack Snyder style, but again, it just doesn't add up If you liked Transformers 2, you should go and see this movie, as it's almost a rerun of the same. If you think Transformers 2 was a empty soul with a overdue makeup, skip this one into TV or PirateBay. Getting a ticket for it is just asking Hollywood to make them more like that. My wish is that the series get a reboot in 10-15 years from someone like Cameron, or even who knows, Christopher Nolan, that would be asking too much, but great nonetheless Shame on you, Bay"
"ryanvance","10","1","4","5 July 2011"," This is a good film, solid story with a plot. You can't beat the CGI.
","The movie is extremely entertaining, and a visual masterpiece. Yes I said masterpiece. It does move the bar to the next level visually. So unless you are just another hater (Bay, Transformers, sci-fi, whatever) you will enjoy the film. It is long, but it goes by very fast. Although there are some points in the story that seem to drag a bit. It is not perfect by any means. It is not a film for the Hollywood film critics either. I am sure most of them hated it and the first two films as well.<br/><br/>But all that aside. The story is very well played out, a few twists, lots of action. All of the characters (human and alien robots) are accounted for, except for Meagan Fox of course but her replacement does a fine job. The new characters, Sentinel Prime, Shockwave, Lazerbeak and the Wreckers are all awesome. You can nit pick the small stuff, there are a few plot holes, the dialog is not always flowing with the story. But overall it was very enjoyable. Everyone in the cinema applauded at the end of the film, so if you are reading all the negative stuff, put that in to perspective. This film makes up for the second films missteps. This film stands on its own. The best part is that all of the action takes place in the daytime, you get to see all of the bits and pieces (literally, especially in 3D) of what makes this film so memorable. Go see it, you will not be disappointed."
"ShadowxoneX","6","1","4","5 July 2011"," It could've been better... or worse...
","So I was excited to know that Shockwave was going to be in this movie, but disappointed at the fact that it was the final entry in the Transformers film series.<br/><br/>I remember hearing that Shockwave was going to be the main psychopathic antagonist in this film, but as I watched this near 3 hour film, he only says one word and controls a robotic worm which eats a building. Sure, he's awesome and scary looking, but he barely does anything; standing and walking without actually killing anybody, only to be ambushed by the good guys and then finally killed by Optimous. What happened to the cool, sinister voice? I really wished they developed Shockwave's character a little more.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film... it was long, dull, and filled with highly incoherent characters, as I'm seeing that the chemistry between certain characters are simply not working or no longer working. After leaving the theater, I had a huge headache from the loud, noisy explosions and and annoying mechanical sounds. I'm glad Megan Fox wasn't in this film; smart move for her! The only good thing about the film is action sequences; just be sure to ear plugs."

","The special effects are great to entertain your pre-teen sons, but the plot was weak after the moon shot secret mission cover-up part(that was totally believable) with Shia Lebouf getting an underwear super-model girl friend? No way! There was no chemistry between them at all! And the break-up with Megan Fox totally undermined the plots of the first two movies. No true love after all? Pathetic! It was as stupid as Aliens 3 killing off all the main characters who survived Aliens except Weaver or Mission Impossible making Mr. Phelps a bad guy after a couple hundred missions as a good guy. I boycotted the whole Mission series for messing that up and I would have skipped Transformers 3 if it wasn't for my sons liking robots and explosions. When you have a core ensemble cast (like Star Trek or Next Generation for example) you don't drop one of the main actors and expect success. No Megan Fox= no love story= no plot."

","I am a fan of the Transformers movies so when the third one was announced I was pretty excited for it and the trailer looked promising.....as the all do. The movie starts off rather interesting with Sam's new love interest, Carly(Rosie Huntington-Whitely) and I must say that she is a big improvement from Megan Fox, she brings sex appeal and class to her character which I love! Back to the movie... The plot revolves around an ark that crashed on the moon and Apollo 11 being used as a cover to investigate it however the deceptagons want to use it to bring Cybertron to earth and make it their home, and the auto bots must stop them. I will commend Spielberg and Bay on their great work on the effects and use of 3D, it was really a good action flick however, to me, that is all the movie ended up being. For 2 and a half hours I sat there knowing what would come next and instead of feeling sympathy for some characters I found myself waiting for this movie to be over. The script was OK, I think it could have used some more dialogue and the fades annoyed me. Good acting, good plot, great effects but not enough depth to hold you into wanting to see how it ends but rather dragging it out and having certain parts predictable.

The only thing that I would say is that if you are a parent planning to take your young children to go and see it, although it is only rated a 12a, it is quite raunchy at parts and in one scene there are people getting disintegrated and blown up casing body parts to go flying but apart from these darker scenes, the film is AMAZING!!!!!!!

"olga_sab","4","1","4","3 July 2011"," is this seriously still going?
","Unfortunately, this was an awful movie. Most movies that have sequels... the sequels just get worse and worse. The fact that they managed to drag this on for 2 and a half hours is just fascinating. The first movie was okay.. generic, but exciting. The second movie had bigger robots but this, just didn't even need to happen. I think if they had just done the first movie, Transformers would have a better reputation. The films just consist of fight scenes between the robots and people in random parts of the world, with some attempt of an actual plot -although it always just seems to be the same: robots taking over the world. And of course they have to give it an interesting title to make it appealing. ""The Dark of The Moon,"" in my opinion, just sounds like a rip off of one of Pink Floyd's greatest albums."
"jason_chen91","4","1","4","3 July 2011"," Overall an unimpressive movie
","I should start off by saying that I was never a fan of Michael Bay's Transformers. And after seeing this movie, I'm still not. To me, the movie is an overall failure as a piece of entertainment. I found the characters to be thoroughly uninteresting, especially Shia LeBeouf's character. He is still the annoying person that tries to play off as a courageous hero in the story. Co-star Rosie Huntington-Whitely plays a almost non-existent role except for just being the pretty face on the screen. Michael Bay still creates initially serious scenes that later become riddled with lame jokes and crude humor with the help of the little robots that serve as nothing more than a poor excuse for comic relief.<br/><br/>The plot is filled with holes and a little hard to follow but none of that matters because everyone goes to the theaters for the action! That is the one thing the movie does well. Stunning, computer-generated, robot-mashing, action. <br/><br/>Of course, this is just my opinion and everyone seems to have their own. I generally dislike this movie because the characters lack depth and the plot development was clearly not a point of focus when the script was written."
"psysword","4","1","4","3 July 2011"," A big Bang Movie with some hidden Ideology
","The movie starts out nice, graphics galore, all in space combat, with space ships, and guns blazing. Then we get to Earth where things start to fizzle out, the Auto-bots , protectors of Earth with what would seem like an Israeli-Jewish bent to their Protection, single out Iran as a troublemaker and make it clear to any Iranian watching the film that Jewish ""Autobots"" are patrolling their skies. Kind of what is already happening in the Global war on Terror with Drones patrolling vast swathes of Islamic Lands, something the Nazis fantasized about doing with the Slavic People. A pathetic shot of Chernobyl, and a Metal Monster ripped straight from the Japanese animes. Talk about Original ideas, this movie has none.<br/><br/>Then the movie launches into some sloppy Shia Labeouf job hunting along with some simple-minded relationship building. The girl does all of us a favor by keeping her gob shut most of the time, and performs extremely well as the ""blonde eye-candy"", not to mention with what I think is her Australian accent, gives her a half intelligent sway.<br/><br/>But of course evil lurks and the simple-minded UN can't be expected to do the right thing and all hell breaks loose on Earth. Fortunately the Plot is feeble enough that even if you missed half the movie, you would still feel right at home no matter where you rejoined it. Then the amazing Hollywood ""big money"" goes into effect. The destruction of Chicago, and intense, frantic action, one sequence after another. You certainly get your money's worth of any sort of dislike that you might have harbored for Chicago is amply rewarded by its epic destruction. But Shia Labeouf is at hand to save the rest of the World. Of course there is the bad guy with the money, the girl, and the Bots. Cheesy storyline and after the X-Men First Class, another movie that glorifies Revenge and calls for Endless War. Kind of preparing our Youth and our People of what to expect when the Jewish New World Order firmly establishes itself on this Planet. Hollywood is certainly preparing the ground for impressionable minds to be impregnated with ideas of only Death and no Forgiveness. The theme of ""Never Forget"" hangs in there. Other than that, the movie is quite enjoyable in the company of popcorn popping young girls. It's definitely a ""School's out for the summer"" movie. <br/><br/>I give it four stars primarily for its fantastic camera, CGI, and Production. Everything was awesome except for the Story and some of the acting that was absolutely appalling."
"motobikeriderjosh","5","1","4","3 July 2011"," Definitely A Let-down
","okay I'm no professional reviewer and i have read many of the reviews from here but i was left so highly dissatisfied with this film i felt for once in my life i needed to at least share my 2c.<br/><br/>This film had no central cohesion between anything be it the humans, Autobots or the Deceptacons. The Autobots just traipsed around and did all the fighting, the humans just had a bunch of close-ups and a lot of yelling and 'awesomeness love for them-self' and the Deceptacons did NOTHING.<br/><br/>I felt that at least with the other films the Deceptacons had a greater input and the story led to the Deceptacons having a true purpose throughout the film and that once there was a fight scene, there was a necessity for that scene albeit not always but generally. This time round the Deceptacons were the last aspect they had a thingy-mabob and it was the centre and they defended it and thats about it. They needed to hunt for sentinel or the Autobots or something..<br/><br/>I noticed in this movie (probably due to its length) that there is a hell of a lot of cars just driving around with loud 'The saviour's are coming' type music. okay so i like nice cars, actually I'm a sucker for them, but there would have to be a good 20 minutes of this in the movie; it seemed somewhat of a space filler and it made me think.. how the hell can all the Deceptacons seem to have the ability to fly and yet the Autobots have to drive (sometimes over rocks in a 458 Italia like come on the front would have been ripped off way back) to the epic battle and then out of no where Optimus has the jet engines again, something he ditched from the second movie where the hell did he get them i didn't see the truck with jets (it would have made a bit of a cool upgrade to see) <br/><br/>My biggest gripe is with that blonde bimbo and dempsy < i dunno how to spell his name frankly i don't give two poops. that bimbo cant act, mostly her lines were just yelling 'SAM!' anyone could do that, hence the bimbo, but her fake botox lips made me feel sick. Okay so she has a rocking body and many would want to tap that but geeze we have calendars, mags, REAL GF AND WIVES for that. I payed to see transformers, the central characters, and better characters i thought considering the input of the them in the last movie. i may be wrong but i felt at least in the last ones the transformers where the central and the humans were there because they were on earth so they had to be there. Dempsy.. well he is just a tug, his character is a tug and when he tries to act 'cool' to a younger (less than 40 year old women) audience he continues to 'tug' that appendage attached to his forehead. A completely unnecessary character much like the bimbo who can have 10 explosions behind and look like there is a slight breeze coming from somewhere.. please <br/><br/>i know this may have been a bit of a rant and i probably cant review properly but there was just not that magic feeling i felt when i seen the first two. I grew up with transformers, i had transformers, i felt like a kid again and that some of the dreams i had about transformers were coming to life in the first two films (obviously not specifically, I'm not a mental) which was just not there with this.. sadly, because we all somewhat liked the last films we are bound to see this one and therefore, there will be a good sales figure at the end of the day and Bay will be labeled a 'god' and his appendage will be left bone dry from all the media outlets hailing him as such... sad sad sad"

"troy-manatunga","8","1","4","3 July 2011"," Get to the movies as soon as you can!
","SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! Get to the movies as soon as you can! 4 Stars ladies and gentleman, I believe Micheal Bay, his cast and crew deserves 4 big fat stars on ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"".<br/><br/>It was widely admitted that ""The Revenge of the Fallen"" was not very well accepted by the viewers as the 1st installment of the ""Transformers"". I am beginning to believe now that even director Micheal Bay agrees with this trail of thought. Back to the drawing boards it was for him and the team. They must have done some extensive research at the pre-production stage of ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". A noteworthy comeback to the franchise and if I may so; a must watch movie of the summer. I would fearlessly say that this will have a standing at the top 3 movies of the summer of 2011. Viewer preference wise and box office wise. Micheal Bay is a favorite of mine since ""Armageddon"" and for those of you who know his work, he has used every method in his big book of secrets in this summer hit. ""Transformers"" was always said to be too much of action and metal clanking together, whilst this cannot be avoided, this time round, the entire movie is dominated by the humans and a plethora of emotion in comparison with the previous movies. There is a bit of ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" carefully blended in with the Autobots and the Decepticons. A magnificent musical score that compliments the scenes with immense depth, edge of your seat CGI, Cinemax, Stunt choreography and deep concentration in some lovely character development is what you are about to experience. Maybe even more but definitely none less!<br/><br/>Megan Fox is no more; I have to address that concern, don't be disheartened; Rosie Huntington-Whiteley the Victoria's Secret diva has some wicked talent. She is amazingly talented and is stunningly convincing and yes indeed an Aphrodite on screen. Shia LaBeouf, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel & Tyrese Gibson are at their very best. Hardcore to the cause and determined for victory, they carry the entire story line along with Whiteley onto the highest levels of the Trilogy. Deep connections between the humans and the machines are introduced and concentrated on shifting the paradigms of viewing pleasure at well-timed intervals. Introducing John Malkovich and Ken Jeong to assist Kevin Dunn & Julie White with the comic relief within the 157 Minutes is shrewd choice. Even I did check my watch once since I felt the length of the movie (Another typical Micheal Bay Trade Mark) however, the choice of the addition of such characters for comic relief was needed, and rightly chosen talent indeed. Need I say more?<br/><br/>If I am to pick a bone, I would pick the writing. However to make such a great movie out of the toys I played with back as a kid, I am just going to let this one go!<br/><br/>Title: Transformers: Dark of the Moon Directed by: Micheal Bay Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington – Whiteley, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Ken Jeong & John Malkovich Rated: Rated PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of sci-fi action violence, mayhem and destruction, and for language, some sexuality and innuendo Rating: 08/10 157 Minutes"
"LinkGoku","6","1","4","3 July 2011"," Pretty good, but still the worst of the series.
","Let me start with the good.<br/><br/>The 3D was amazing. The action was intense. The special effects were jaw-dropping. The acting was good all around (with the exception of Rosie Huntington-Whitely) And the story was actually quite interesting.<br/><br/>Now for the bad.<br/><br/>Some extremely tedious moments. less actual ""fun"" (especially lacking in laughs) The crappy excuse for Mikaela not being there. Replacing Megan Fox with Rosie (she didn't do bad but she was utterly emotionless) And the killing of a few characters. (not to mention the brutality of some of it)<br/><br/>Die hard fans like me will still enjoy it and buy it on DVD but it probably wont be so well excepted by others. there's also a lacking of likability, characters that i loved in the past two were less awesome.<br/><br/>In closing it's a great action flick with non-stop mayhem (mostly in the second half), and if that's your cup of tea then you'll enjoy it, but it isn't a mind blowing classic or anything."
"adrongardner","7","1","4","2 July 2011"," Spock goes crazy, you may too
","The first movie had a pretty good story. The second movie was a pretty good ride. The third movie is pretty good as far as junk food for your eyes go but it is utter nonsense.<br/><br/>I'll be honest. <br/><br/>It's so long and demanding, I felt 10 years older when I left the theater. The acting was abominable. There is no story telling here. Michael Bay has no idea how to tell a story. Half the time, I couldn't figure out what was shooting who. Where did John Malkovich go? I don't understand why Megatron was still alive. Does Dino have Italian family on Cybertron? I don't know why humans were helping the Decepticons. I lost count of how many booty shots of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley were jammed into the lens. I think it is the most violent movie I have ever seen - unapologetically violent - bordering on hateful. And My head hurt about an hour in.<br/><br/>But somehow, I enjoyed it. Oh and, coming from a person laughed at Avatar's (and every movie since) 3D, the 3D here is genuinely impressive.<br/><br/>You'll forget most of it ten minutes after you leave. It is mean spirited and makes no sense at all. Yet, if you are looking to escape - there are few better places to find it than here."
"Seii5","4","1","4","2 July 2011"," It was good but not good enough
","I just have a few things to say about this movie. Number one, why did the trailers and posters advertise Shockwave like he was the big threat to the humans and autobots in the movie when you will see Sentinel Prime in the movie more then Shockwave? Shockwave shows up in the beginning of the film then you do not see him anymore until towards the end and he barely does anything. Number two Megatron was barely seen in the movie also, it seems as the main villain was really Sentinel. I thought Starscream's death was pretty cheesy, and how did Barricade come back to life when his head was sliced clean off in the Transformers comic after the 2007 live action film? I give this movie a 6 because it is so misleading and plus the ending was kind of terrible. I'm not saying this movie sucks, but it could've been much better, and for this to be Michael Bay's last film you would think he would really give it all he's got, and if this is what he could only offer, then he should have never been the director for Transformers, but his action scenes, and special effects are glamorous. He needs to learn to stop focusing so much on the humans also, it's called Transformers, and the sexual references like when Carly was in her panties near the beginning needs to stop, this use to be for kids at one point. Out of all three, I think this was the best, but you have to ask yourself, was this worth two years of waiting?"
"gchild94","6","1","4","2 July 2011"," Wanted to Love it...but only liked it
","To start with let me just say that as a kid I thought Transformers were the best thing in the world. I used to watch the original series cartoons all the time on TV, VHS! and I thought the original movie was amazing, still do. The 3D in this movie is amazing. It seems to be getting better and better with each new movie being released. The soundtrack for Transformers DOTM is not as good as the first or second Transformers movies in my opinion. The title track by Linkin Park seems quite tame by comparison. Some things that annoyed me about this movie are as follows :- Optimus Prime, apart from when he gets real mad and easily kills a load of Decepticons is pretty pathetic in this movie. There are parts when he's grovelling at the feet of Sentinel Prime which were just plain stupid. This would never have happened in the original animated series. The film makers in their wisdom decided to rename Wheeljack to Que and he is easily the most annoying thing in the entire movie for me. Personally I was glad when he got offed! Along the same lines with Mirage who is now called Dino. I don't know what they were thinking when they changed these but as a huge fan of the originals I wasn't impressed at all. As for Rosie Huntington-Whiteley she was OK. Definitely no worse an actor than Megan Fox. Overall the movie didn't suck but I thought it could have been much better. I want them to make a fourth one and even a fifth one in the hope that they eventually get it right and do justice to my expectations."
"thesilentwatchers","9","1","4","2 July 2011"," One For the fans
","Firstly and most importantly, if you ever had watched the comic/ cartoon version of transformers , this movie is a must-watch. Why? Because the machines are better and more awesome in their depiction. There maybe no Megan Fox but Rosie is no less sexy either. The 3D made it a better experience for sure. Unlike last time where I thought there were too many fights happening , this time we know who is fighting whom. There are many a 'Oh-damn' moments with many a 'Woah!' moments as well. All the talk about CGI is well just talk. Go ans enjoy this movie. Its well worth it for any transformers fan. I would go as far as saying that this is the best movie of the franchise. No doubts!"
"henry_yan","8","1","4","2 July 2011"," This is what I call entertainment!!
","Just came back from the cinema watching the latest Transformers, and I will say this : This installment of the series is entertainment at its best! Note that I use the word ""entertainment"" and not story telling because this film is what it is and makes no apologies about it. Critics and others who savage this film are obviously stuck in their ivory tower and unable to differentiate just what summer film audience wants. You do not go to a cinema in the middle of summer expecting a dose of Chauncer, Shakespeare or Hemingway! Yes, there are holes in the story the size of elephants, but so what? You want to be entertained. End of.<br/><br/>So here's my review.<br/><br/>As a lay follower of the Transformers story, I am somewhat familiar with the lead characters, and I have to say that although the movie takes creative license to the max, the end result is a satisfying 2 hrs of solid entertainment. You have it all : a revisionist view of the lunar mission, treachery by a senior ranking Autobot in Sentinel Prime, moments of comedy, a gorgeous woman, and eye popping special effects that will leave you breathless to the very last minute. The final hour is a fantastic convergence of the story where Chicago is pulverised to smithereens, and yes, this time unlike the previous two installments, innocent civilians can be seen vapourised on screen. The producers have also obviously realised that the audience wants to see a more detailed, ie, slower, transformation of Autobots and Decepticons from their robot mode to their alternate mode, and the special effects team have done that splendidly! You will be amazed.<br/><br/>However, despite this, I could not give this a full score because I am left with a certain level of disappointment. The relatively cheap and undignified deaths of Starscream, Megatron and Shockwave was totally unexpected. You would think that a major character like Starscream deserve a more glorified death than being hit in the eye by Sam's weapon. I could not believe these high tech villains could be undermined by really low tech solutions.<br/><br/>That said, this is a fantastic piece of entertainment which will make your summer that much more memorable."
"ttcsuck2","Null","1","4","2 July 2011"," Great special effects, a lot of adrenaline, serious plot holes
","I must admit that the special effects are great, much improved compared to the first episode. The second half of the movie can be considered exciting. I'll consider this a good movie for pure entertainment.<br/><br/>However, the plot is twisted, awkward and unbelievable. The key problem is: If Sentinel has made a deal with Megatron to rebuild their planet long ago, then what's the point for the Decepticon to shoot down Sentinel's spaceship, and then do all sorts of tricks to set up Optimus to revive Sentinel? That just doesn't make sense to me. <br/><br/>Besides, if the USA and USSR knew there was an alien's spaceship on the moon with technology several generations more advanced, I bet they'll do everything to go up there to retrieve that spaceship. Claiming that because of some spies they have abandoned the attempts simply underestimates the greed and ambition of human beings.<br/><br/>The Decepticon's robots look quite easy to beat IMHO. Some grenades in the joints and some machine guns can take down one. That pillar device is also so fragile. I just wondered how come the human defence looked so weak. I guess the US military must have used up all their weapons in the Middle East. Only a few fighters, no missiles, no tanks, no heavy artillery. Just send in a few paratroopers..... My wife even whispered to me: ""just nuke the city"". After all, taking out one city is better than being enslaved, right?<br/><br/>There are many other little problems in the plot, but for a popcorn movie aiming for excitement instead of good reasoning, I'll accept that. One last thing, that character that replaces Megan Fox is simply not lovable to start with. If my girl friend can accept a 200k Mercedes from her boss as a ""bonus"" without a question or suspicion I'll just drop her for stupidity. And I found it so funny when she can always keep herself perfectly clean (she's wearing white, that makes it even more amazing) and uninjured in the battlefield.<br/><br/>PS. Even forget about the acting, that Rosie Hungtington may look good from far, but she actually looks a bit gross closeup. Excessively thick upper lip and bad skin. Better suit to be a model than an actress."
"vrinalex","8","1","4","2 July 2011"," Transformers= Okay... Transformers 2= WTF?! Transformers 3= Great!
","I just returned from one of the Dark of the Moon premiers. To tell you truth, I didn't have high hopes for this one after I saw the mess of Revenge of the Fallen. But when I left the theater, I thought WOW! Bay redeemed himself! What makes this movie great is the whole story plot with the alien space ark and pillars that could create a space bridge between Earth and Cybertron. I'm not saying anymore. I also loved the new characters which were not only robots but humans as well. Some of them brought the comedy to the film.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about this film is the whole hour and a half of chaos in Chicago at the end. This is where Bay didn't learn his lesson. He thinks to make an excellent movie is to destroy cities and bring destruction and violence. My other problem: Everyone knows how the main villain is this film is supposed to be Shockwave. I was going to see a whole new transformer so I was curious to see how he was like. Wrong! He only appears twice in the film and you learn like nothing about him except his name. It's hard to call him the ""main villain"" when it's probably Megatron again.<br/><br/>Overrall, great film compared to the other two. Bay has made progress! Totally recommend it!"
"rohanworld29","10","1","4","2 July 2011"," Best part of all three.
","Transformers 3D is really improved and more realistic from earlier parts. Robots are more in details and visual effects are superb. But they could have worked more on 3D. But still awesome work by Michael Bay and his team. Some scenes were very realistic and thrilling to watch. Josh Duhamel playing Lennox, Shia LaBeouf playing Sam Witwicky characters were really fantastic. Also enjoyed the funny stuffs in the movie.<br/><br/>Apart from Linkin park and Stained other songs were bit disappointing. Optimus seem to be more powerful in the movie and would like to wait and watch for another new episode in theaters during couple of years."

","I just took my brother to see the latest film in Michael Bay's blockbuster Transformers series and I must say that he and I enjoyed it just as much, or probably even better than the first two. I actually do heart the first one the most but that's me. I rate this film 10/10 because I'm a die hard action movie fan and that's basically the reason he and I go to see movies like this. We were both disappointed when we heard that Megan Fox was not returning due to conflicts with her and Bay but nevertheless, we loved this movie from beginning to end.

Put into this film is amazing, every dent, scratch and the many explosions (as well as the transformers themselves) look fantastic.<br/><br/>Its worth just seeing this movie for the awesome action scenes and out of this world graphics, but i have not talked about the acting yet.<br/><br/>The hot chick was bland, annoying and a total buzz killer, she looked great while standing still but any time she moved or spoke i felt horrified, oh and did i mention Sams stupid parents are back and more Witwickish then ever? Onto the other characters, Sams bosses, fantastic, John Tuturro fantastic, the auto bots and deceptions, great.<br/><br/>this movie only falls short on the acting department when it comes to Sams ridiculously hot girlfriend and some of the extras.<br/><br/>Ah now the story you ask? Well this film has a story, shame its spread as thin as you can get without there being hardly any story at all.<br/><br/>In short without spoilers, BIG EXPLOSION STUFF CRASH ON MOON! EARTH IN DANGER OH NO! Sure their are some twists but anyone who has seen the last 2 movies will probably know what is going to happen and why.<br/><br/>Now onto the man himself, Michael Bay and his band of merry men.<br/><br/>First of the Direction is VERY solid, not great or different from what Bay has done before but the action is the best yet, the score swells to the occasion and everything else (apart from the crap editing and thin story) works okay.<br/><br/>TLDR a slight improvement from T2 but nowhere near as deep or meaningful as T1, if your a fan of either go see it, if your new to the series you should see it if you want to.<br/><br/>Rating: *****/********** Not Great, not terrible, not as good as Transformers 1"
"DorothyGale3","Null","1","4","30 June 2011"," Transformers: Dark of the Moon
","Director Michael Bay needs to stop filming sequels to the blockbuster mega hit 'Transformers.' The latest film, to complete the trilogy, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' was a major disappointment. The film begins with a tale about how the U.S. government lied to the American people about why they needed to land on the moon. Supposedly, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were on a mission to the moon to find out what was up there before the Russians could. Only 35 people knew about this mission that changes history and now in the year 2011, the only reason why America has not been back to the moon since 1972 is because of the alien robots that Aldrin and Armstrong discovered on their epic space mission. So, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is back with a new model girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), the Autobots, and his military buddies, Lennox (josh Duhamel) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson). The Autobots and Sam have to discover all the top secret information on the dark side of the moon before the Decepticons take over, destroy all of Earth and turn the humans into slaves. Can Sam and the Autobots save the day for the 3rd time, or will the Decepticons finally win this treacherous battle? 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' was awful. It was way too much information, too much action; too much confusion as to what exactly was going on and who was who. The story line was too complex for an action film. It seemed as though the beginning was a completely different film then the ending. There was so much going on in the film, that it will not hold the viewer's attention long enough, especially since the film is almost three hours long. Michael Bay took this film a little too far. He installed too many ideas and stories and subplots that aren't even that interesting or intriguing to make any moviegoer want to sit and watch for three hours. The stories were too confusing that the average moviegoer will eventually get bored and walk out. It starts out with some American history about our space mission to the moon and how surprise, surprise the government keeping secrets from the American people. Then it's present day and Sam is living with his hardworking, rich girlfriend who is of course a supermodel. How does Sam keep getting these runway models for girlfriends? Anyway, all of a sudden the audience learn that the Decepticons are planning to take over the Earth and destroy the Autobots and Sam is the only one who can save the day. It seems that simple, but that's really all that is understood. There are a lot of deceptions and twists that create confusion which then turns this film into a massive headache.<br/><br/>The acting was good. Shia LaBeouf was great as usual, but unfortunately this film he wasn't as funny as he was in the other films. He usually has his great, clever one-liners that add comic relief to the film, the reason why most people enjoy the film other than the non-stop action. But, this film he didn't have much to work with. His new girlfriend Carly, (Huntington-Whiteley) is of course just prancing around in her underwear or little dresses and adds absolutely nothing to the film. She is boring and not a good actress. Josh Duhamel is back and great as well, but he doesn't have much screen time at all. Sam's parents Ron and Judy (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) make a small appearance, which was funny but again their roles were small. The robots hog up the entire screen and not in a good way. Half of the film is just them fighting the Decepticons and majority of the dialogue is Optimus Prime making up these random 'heartfelt' speeches and Carly screaming. The film feels like it will end about 16 times, then the realization occurs that there is another entire hour left.<br/><br/>The action was awesome, but again way too much. There is no happy medium whatsoever, there's too much robots and action and not enough humans and dialogue. Hopefully, this will be the last film for Michael Bay and crew.<br/><br/>This film is not recommended, please don't waste time or money; wait for the DVD if it's that essential in life to see."
"jdesando","Null","1","4","29 June 2011"," Starring the Visuals
","""You may lose faith in us, but never in yourselves.""Optimus Prime<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon is not so much about faith as it is things that bump and grind in the day and night—machines to be exact. Michael Bay directs, and he and his buddy, Steven Spielberg, are executive producers, so kids or kid-like fun dominates.<br/><br/>It's a CGI smörgåsbord impressive for its volume alone. Almost every frame is full of metal parts that burrow, blow up, or just jabber. Although Bay is clearly having a ball, when he gets down to toppling a big building in venerable Chicago (the echoes of 9/11 are sobering), it's almost serious filmmaking: Awe overtakes humor, which has its own part in summer fluffy fare.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and girlfriend Carly Miller (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley--foxy but no Megan Fox) are primary civilians to stop the Decepticons from conquering the earth. Earthlings are in the process of banishing the Autobots, who have been faithful allies. It's all pretty hazy to me, so I'll stop here with the plot and return to the visual, where Bay puts all his effort.<br/><br/>The re-creation of downtown Chicago, with the Wrigley Building taking center stage, is as good as the London of Cars 2. In fact, just seeing street signs such as ""Wacker"" gains immediate sympathy from the natives and travelers in the audience. Transformers is another version of special-effects porn at which our American filmmakers are so adept.<br/><br/>The effect least impressive for me is 3-D, an ubiquitous bother that is finally on the wane as admission prices rise and consumer enthusiasm wanes. The drain of light, making a dull screen image, can be mitigated if theaters were willing to pay extra for bulbs that burn out quickly. I am left to hope for deliverance from this annoying sideshow except in the case of the documentary Cave of Dreams, in which appreciating 30,000-year old cave paintings is enhanced. <br/><br/>Although Bay does an adequate exploitation of the process for romping around the summer screen with thin fare, 2-D is just fine for me, thank you. However, at two and one half hours, he is a magician who keeps the kiddies in their seats. Or maybe it's Huntington-Whiteley substituting for Fox. Anyway, the visuals are the stars."
"kwongwah","7","1","4","29 June 2011"," Good standard Micheal Bay action with some nice 3D, just don't expect a great story
","This is one film where if you like a lot of action and CGI effects then you will love this film to bits, however if it's a film where you are looking for a solid and decent story you are going to walk away disappointed.<br/><br/>The CGI is up there with being some of the best films out there. The 3D effects looked simply awesome in the trailer but for some bizarre reason did not stand out as much in the film. There were a few scenes where I was sat there going wow that looks amazing but there were unfortunately many others where I was sat there thinking I could have just watched this in 2D. Simply put it didn't seem like Micheal Bay took full advantage of the 3D technology available to him, which is a shame.<br/><br/>The story, the story could have been so much more! Without giving too much away, it is a very good idea for a story, but it felt very lacking and non-cohesive in places, with very few scenes progressing naturally from one to another. Some parts of the story were all too predictable. The pacing of the film is hurt as it seems to drag on and have lack of real focus in the latter half of the films.<br/><br/>Potential Spoilers<br/><br/>The scene where the top half the building in the Chicago is being eaten away and toppling. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take a building 10 minutes to topple over when it has no supporting structure. This part of the film really dragged on far too long. <br/><br/>I was somewhat amused and it seemed like I was the only person laughing when Leonard Nimoy's character recites a well known Star Trek movie line. The film though it has its little bits of humour isn't used as much in this film as the second film and struck a fairly nice balance this time round. Some of the humour used is unsuitable for young viewers.<br/><br/>Many of the reoccurring actors have much smaller role in the film than before. General Morshower was more or less reduced to just one scene if that, often leading me to question why even have him and some others in the film? Shia Labeouf is more or less similar to as he was in the first two film. Yet that his wit isn't as evident in this one, and the energy we are accustomed to seeing him with seem to be lacking this time round, it's almost like he is just tired of the role. A lot will be said about Rosie Huntington-Whiteley acting in the film. She didn't do a bad job but she didn't do an outstanding job either. It would not surprise me if many viewers just see her as cinematic eye candy in this film. The only performance really note worthy is Alan Tudyk who brings a somewhat complicated side kick character Dutch to John Turturro's Simmons adding much humour and in places sorely needed character/soul to the film.<br/><br/>The robots themselves, a fair number of them are introduced but do not expect to see many of them with much screen time. Only Laserbeak and Sentinel Prime see much in terms of screen time otherwise it's mainly dominated by Optimus and Bumblebee, even Megatron looks to have all but a part bit to play in this film.<br/><br/>There are some nice bits to the film, the few very good 3D scenes, a good story idea (even though poorly implemented in my opinion), fair dose of humour but not too much to distract from the main story. Some nicely packed action sequences. Overall as long as you are not expecting a rock solid story line with similarly solid acting this is a good entertaining film to watch. If you are expecting either of the two, I would probably recommend you give this one a miss."

","TDOTM was a mess from the beginning to the end and the worst out of the 4 released so far. <br/><br/>The story is a bit far fecthed and forced. The replacement of Megan Fox's character, Mikaela, by another love interest brought continuity issues to the plot and ruined the whole movie. The problem wasn't Megan acted better or worse than Rosie, it just didn't feel right. In ROTF Sam and Mikaela apparently loved each other and passed through a lot of stuff together, but suddenly they break up because apparently she was not interested in Sam for the person he was. That didn't make any sense at all. In terms of acting, replacing an actress by a Victoria Secret model was simply nonsense as well.(even considering the fact that female roles in Bay's movies are secondary and only serve as a means to attract younger audiences...) Malkovich's character as Sam's new boss was pointless and even offensive at times and the choice of Patrick Dempsey as the human villain was doubtful. People complained about annoying characters in ROTF (Leo and the Twins) but the new CIA leader took it to a whole new level.<br/><br/>In a movie that had a darker feeling to it than the previous installment you never feel the atmosphere of tension and chaos you were supposed to. Overall, people were left with a confusing/messed up story and the usual CGI and explosion fest typical of a Michael Bay movie. Such a CGI fest that became boring, and the reason why I only saw this once."

Megan is a master craftsman compare to this. Josh Duhamel also returns. In the end, the story is meaningless. The acting is almost as meaningless. The action is the key. All that matters is the action. And there is nothing new anymore from this franchise. The super slo-mo is more a hindrance.

The movie is action at its best from beginning to the end. Michael Bay knows how to make great films and all three transformers show it. I got hooked on the trilogy from the first one with how good it was not only are all three action but they all have humour in them which is great. I Can't wait for the fourth one. Even though it'll be a whole new cast it should be great. You can't ask for a better action movie then what all these Transformer ones have brought. I remember always watching the animated show and liking it. And all three movies from Bay shows he knew how to turn it into a real life blockbuster."
"ajs-10","4","1","5","19 May 2012"," I'm on the side of the critics with this one (I'm afraid)...
","The opening sequence of the film is very well done (IMO); it sets up the story very well and leaves enough mystery to keep the audience guessing. Unfortunately the film cannot sustain this level for long and pretty soon we're back to the usual 'big robots hitting each other in the streets of America' scenario that (personally) I've seen enough of.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there were some nice comic moments mainly provided by John Turturro and Alan Tudyk. I will also give a nod to the guys that did the CGI, it's all top-notch stuff and some of it is quite spectacular. On the downside I found many of the human characters irritating, in particular Sam Witwicky. He comes over as a bit of a petulant kid when he doesn't get the job he wants. Carly; well I guess she was just there to show off her curves, but as we all know, Michael Bay likes curves. I guess the whole franchise doesn't quite work for me because the filmmakers are so insistent on putting human traits on alien beings. Every robot, whether it be Autobot or Decepticon has to have a character and most of the time and in a lot of cases, it just makes them look stupid. Over all, not one I'll be watching again but I guess there will be a lot of fifteen year old boys out there that'll love it!...

","Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) <br/><br/>1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse than TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, then comes the third entry in Michael Bay's series. I'm not going to waste my time describing the ""story"" as it's clear the screenwriters didn't spend more than a minute trying to put something together. The only thing I'll say about the story is that they try to connect our robots to the moon landing in 1969 and claim that Apollo 11 had several secrets. If that sounds interesting to you then it's best just to watch the teaser trailer and leave the rest of the film alone. This introduction only lasts around seven-minutes and then it's back to the brain dead, idiotic, loud and incoherent mess of a movie. It's really shocking that no one has ever tried to come up with a story that you could follow but I guess to Bay as long as you have loud action scenes then nothing really has to make sense. Taking a look at the box office numbers it's clear not too many people object to the horrid mess that this film is. I'm not sure where to even begin but once again I just don't understand the need for a ""B"" entertainment film to clock in at nearly three hours. It's 154-minutes to be exact but even this is an hour too long. The first thirty-minutes are pure boredom, the next hour has one long, drawn-out dialogue sequence after another and the final thirty-minutes gets to all the action as Chicago is destroyed but by this time I was wishing a real alien invasion would happen and put me out of my misery. This movie is without question one of the worst big-budget movies ever made. The story makes no sense. The comedy is so bad that you can't help but wonder what anyone was thinking. Just take a look at the job interview sequences. Then you have the incredibly stupid parents who are back with even more failed attempts at humor. The performances really aren't any better with Shia LaBeouf really sleepwalking through his part. It's hard to believe that he could have been any more boring as the performance is just downright annoying as is the character. Rose Huntington-Whiteley plays the girlfriend and her performance actually makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep. The supporting cast includes John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro and Tyrese Gibson but they too sink in this horrible material. TRANSFORMES: DARK OF THE MOON is just downright bad on all levels. The one saving grace are the wonderful special effects but these aren't enough to save the film."

Even while not in heels, like a good brainless ornament, she walks on tippy toes (WTF), just so we can get a better look at her ass.<br/><br/>I should have known right there to stop watching.<br/><br/>While Shia Le whatshisname is somewhat endearing in interviews, I ended up hating/pitying him for participating in this film knowing he must have (of course), read this pathetic dribble and STILL GONE AHEAD WITH IT. Every puppet has their price I guess. <br/><br/>The two women in this film give a choice of ball-breaking bitch (who of course being a woman makes all the wrong decisions and almost destroys mankind), or a good looking trinket-possession in slutty dresses. WHERE are the female robots? Even if you do manage to spot them (unlikely), I am sure they are the ones getting trampled like the pathetic gender Michael Bay is determined to show us all they are.<br/><br/>Clearly, I was not able to identify with ANY characters in this movie. <br/><br/>Those even somewhat interested in knowing if Megan Fox was correct in calling Michael Bay a sexist Hitler should know this - she was ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. <br/><br/>She's won a fan in me for telling it like it is, I just wish I'd listened before forking out my cash to be insulted for what felt like forever."
"reeseslightning","Null","1","5","12 August 2011"," A threequel better than a sequel?
","I liked this movie.<br/><br/>It's grittier and darker than the first 2 and the fight scenes are pure badass.<br/><br/>We get to see the Autobots darker side which I felt was long overdue.<br/><br/>Of course, our hero has his typical cliché of a hot girlfriend who just happens to be hot enough to be a Victoria's Secret model (Oh wait! She is one.) Shia's acting never ceases to impress me. His hysterics, humor and ability to be dramatic at the same time cracks me up and makes me believe his character.<br/><br/>Rosie was so much better than I thought (of course I had extremely low expectations). She's running around in 8"" heels and neat, tight clothes but her acting was quite believable, much better than Megan Fox's. Her character however was un-needed.<br/><br/>Do we always have to have a super hot girl running around and breathing hard enough to where her abundant chest takes center screen? Why can't average Sam have an average girl that can actually have a talent besides running behind him and then screaming his name? Overall, her character was nearly useless except to point out why Mikaela is no longer in the picture and to say, ""Over there!"" The storyline is the same of course (decipticons trying to take over blah blah blah) but this time, things finally come to a head.<br/><br/>Optimus, Bumblebee and the other Autobots, that we don't really care about, must dig deep within themselves and start getting dirty.<br/><br/>I, for one, loved the fight sequences. They were long yes, and sometimes chaotic but I felt like I was watching a different auto-bot fight. It was meaner, more desperate to the point where I was actually scared that Bumblebee might not make it! And that's my other complaint: I love Bumblebee and Sam's interactions. They're always funny or heartfelt but there was hardly any of that in here. All relationship (alien/human, alien/alien/, human/human) scenes were soley focused on Carly and Sam.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked it and it's definitely better than ROTF. But it lacks the human/alien interaction that made the first one so special.<br/><br/>And to those who complain about the phsyics...you do realize that this is a movie about machines transforming right? Phsyics and logic don't apply to a robotic alien movie."

"jon.h.ochiai","8","1","5","8 July 2011"," The Needs of the Many...
","In the climactic battle, clashing metal against metal, the voice of Leonard Nimoy says, ""The needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few."" No, this is no remake of ""The Wrath of Khan"". Nimoy voices the duplicitous ancient Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, in Director Michael Bay's visually spectacular ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". This is the first ""Transformers"" movie for me. I could not get through the first ""Transformers"" on DVD, and passed on ""Revenge of the Fallen"". Michael Bay gets the job done in ""Transformers 3""—impeccable action set at hyperkinetic pace. Bay bludgeons sensory overload as his narrative style—and it works for him. We hardly notice the 2 hours and 37 minutes. Neither do we notice the absence of Meg Fox, who lost her invite. Victoria Secret model stunning Rosie Huntington-Whiteley assumes her place as Shia LaBeouf's Sam's girlfriend. Huntington-Whiteley is hotter. We see her Carly introduced as she walks in wearing Sam's shirt and a thong. This punctuated my error in not going with the 3D option.<br/><br/>Bay filmed ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" in digital 3D. No post-production afterthought. The movie looks awesome. The visuals are breathtaking. Bay creates a swirling visual mural as Decepticon drones and airships float above a devastated Chicago. In a very cool aerial sequence, Lt. Col. Lennox (solid Josh Duhamel) and his Special Forces Team dart through the Chicago skyline in their glider jumpsuits. The climactic battle between Optimus Prime (noble Peter Cullen) and his betrayed mentor is a live action samurai anime spectacle. As imposing gleaming gladiators, the Autobots and Decepticons move as graceful warriors. Bay brings back action old school. As a director he is the masterful technician—the human elements are not his strong suit. Then again human drama is not the deal with ""Transformers 3"".<br/><br/>The story by Ehren Kruger is surprisingly engrossing, albeit flimsy. Like ""X-Men: First Class"" Kruger's tale is convincing revisionist conspiracy of the 1960's. Context: The Autobots and Decepticons are sentient robots, who are mortal enemies. Nearing Autobots demise at the hands of the Decepticons on home world Cybertron, Autobot leader Sentinel Prime (Nimoy) escapes in a ship called the Ark carrying the technology that could vanquish the Decepticons. With his mission thwarted, the Ark and Sentinel Prime crash on the Dark Side of the Moon. Detected in 1961, the Kennedy Administration declares the Space Race which was really a covert government operation to retrieve possible alien technology from the Moon. In 1969 the moon mission accomplished the intended goal. Now present day, Sec Def Mearing (callous and commanding Francis McDormand) is well aware of that NASA mission, and the presence of her peacekeeper Transformers under her watch. Turns out in this 50 year conspiracy, the Decepticons too have their human allies.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is convincingly frustrated and funny as Sam Witwicky, and rightly so. As Sam he had saved the world from the Decepticons, and received the Medal of Honor from President Obama, all on the down low. So this Ivy League graduate and Earth's savior struggles to find a job. In the meantime he is living with his super hot girl friend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley). Carly works for charming and arrogant accounting magnate Dylan (slickly menacing Patrick Dempsey), whose intentions are opaque. Sam manages to get a menial job at high tech government contractor working for eccentric John Malkovich as Bruce Brasos.<br/><br/>While this transpires, Josh Duhamel's intense fearless Lennox leads his Special Forces team to investigate transient readings from Chernobyl in the Ukraine. This unveils the global Decepticon threat, and the reemergence of leader Megatron (reliably evil Hugo Weaving).<br/><br/>So the narrative mechanics are poised to intersect, which is really Bay's excuse to blow crap up with amazing style. Bay brilliantly plays to his strong suit. In the midst of all the stunning visuals and breastbone vibrating explosions, the acting leads are solid. LaBeouf performs dependably as his subdued Sam transforms into the hero with vulnerability and a sense of humor. Too bad Duhamel isn't asked to do more. He is leading man handsome, charismatic, and brilliantly underplays the thoughtful hero. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is beautiful, which seems to be the leverage point of Carly. She does so with unaffected presence, and touch of humor. Dempsey plays in position. Tyrese Gibson, relegated to second string, is always cool. Gibson may be the smartest and luckiest actor in Hollywood next to Robert Downey Jr., being in two mega franchise movies—the other being ""Fast Five"".<br/><br/>Bottom line: ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a great summer movie. You shall be entertained."

","(SPOILER) Many people complain about Michael Bay trying to replace Megan Fox. That ""you cannot make the audience connect to the girl and then take her away, and think everything will be okay."" What people don't understand when they watch the film, is that no one is trying to replace Megan Fox or Mikaela Banes( as she was known ), they did in fact try to advance the plot with how she dumped him, and they moved on. In the film, it shows how Shia meets his new Girlfriend ""CARLY"". <br/><br/>MUSIC- The music score was perfectly attached to the movie, enhancing the cinematic experience. The Music was by Steve Jablonsky (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413011/) How ever he is no Harry Gregson- Williams, but closely comparable.<br/><br/>PLOT/STORY- Dark of the Moon. Referring to the actual Dark side of the moon, a part of the moon The U.S or no one at the time, could see at 1969. Due to the war of the Cybertron, Autbots vs. Decepticons, the leader of the Autobots before Optimus Prime was Sentinel Prime. Before the Autobots actually Lost the war, and before the decepticons were set to destroy all of Cybertron, Sentinel had made a Deal with the leader of the decepticon Megatron. The deal was that Cybertron would not be obliterated, but in return for this, the Autbots had to loose the war, in order for this to happen Sentinel( leader of the Autbot army ) had to disappear. So Sentinel took Hundreds of these Pillars that would give transporting abilities to who ever used them, and when in the a Huge ship filled with Resources for the Cybertron Planet to AID in the war. His ""Spark"" ( heart ) was defused, and Optimus had to fight the Decepticons alone with his Handful of soldiers, taking Sentinels place as leader. The Ship crash landed on the ""Dark of the Moon"". In 1969 this ship was discovered by Neil Armstrong on his second and last flight mission in ""Apollo 11"". Diverging from Non-Fiction, He and Buzz Aldrin spotted The weird shaped Ship on the Dark side of the moon. Instead of the mission just being a part of the ""Space Race"" The U.S sent up Astronauts to see what was on the dark side of the moon. Explaning how in the First Transformers Movie the U.S Government wasn't surprised to see a Transformer. <br/><br/>Acting performance. I've heard some Chitter CHatter that the Acting Performance is horrible in this film, however I disagree. Shia Labeouf's Acting seems believable and relatable, from dealing with annoying parents, and with a rich Girlfriend who makes it seem that money is no big deal, especially when he's smooching off his Girlfriend. However there are some parts I thought he could've performed much better, but all in which was Superb!<br/><br/>Overall I gave this film a 9/10 because I really enjoyed Every aspect of this film, its exactly what I wanted when i watched the first two. But its no perfect 10 because not every character in this film had enough parts. His Girlfriend Carly is the first Character you see as the plot starts to advance, throughout the film she has about 10 parts. And that's just her, not including the rest of the cast."

","Expectations were still relatively high for this threequel, despite the disappointing Revenge of the Fallen, and director Michael Bay himself had guaranteed to deliver an instalment that lived up to the promise shown in the original Transformers only four years ago. He has partly succeeded. Dark of the Moon still features many of the flaws present in Fallen – lame jokes (especially from Sam's parents), preposterous plot holes, inaudible dialogue from the robots and woeful acting by the love interest, this time Victoria Secrets model Rosie Huntington-Whitely as Megan Fox's replacement – but it improves on one, arguably the most significant, element: the action. Where last time out you couldn't see what the hell was going on, this time around the robotic fighting (rendered in mind-bogglingly good CGI – the best of the franchise) is clear as day and possesses some tremendous slow-mo metallic clobbering. By no means a brilliant movie, even by 'dumb-action' standards, but leave your mind and maturity at the door and you'll be in for an entertaining two and a half hours."

Interweaving conspiracy theory elements with the still on-going (seemingly endless) war between the Autobots and the Decepticons in an enjoyably plausible way.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the inclusion of Leonard Nimoy as the voice of Sentinel Prime. Because, only those over age 39 (like myself) will remember and appreciate that he was the voice of Galvatron in the 1980's animated feature about the Transformers from Sunbow/Marvel!<br/><br/>The one and only nitpick I have with the movie is the climax. I felt it was a tad overly-long and drawn out.

"FSfilmblog","6","1","5","1 July 2011"," Not as good as the first but better than the second
","The third film in the successful franchise based on an 80s toy product. This one sees the plot revolving around Earth's manned mission to the moon in the 60s (which incorporates some good use of archive footage). The real reason behind the mission is in fact a cover up for an ""incident"" which the world was in the dark over. An Autobot spaceship which crash landed on the surface on the moon, millions of years ago.<br/><br/>With the intriguing premise, the film unfortunately starts to flag. As we head back to the drama's of Sam (Shia Labeouf) Witwicky life. Set a couple of years of the 2nd film. Sam is struggling to find a job whilst his Autobot companions are out on secret missions maintain peace and order with their human allies. It isn't too long before the Decepticons make an appearance and are back to their old tricks again. <br/><br/>We learn that within the crashed spaceship (the Ark) contains special pillars that could help the Autobots once and for all to conquer the Decepticons and win the war....but in the wrong hands they could also lead to the destruction of the planet Earth.<br/><br/>To summarise the plot in such way makes the film so interesting and exciting but it is far from it. The total lack of serious/normal characters in the film jars the brooding menace. Every supporting character is a bit weird (John Malkovich's- Bruce Bezo) or over hyperactive (Ken Jeong's-Jerry Wang). It sometimes feels like there are two films competing here. One a wacky and (un)funny comedy drama whilst the other, an explosive and eye popping special effects laden action film. I am at a loss as to why there was any need for such a need to try to use stock footage of real events for it to only throw us such infantile humour. <br/><br/>After the absolute slating that the 2nd film received you would have thought that Bay would have learnt his lesson, but far from it. Racial stereotypes are still ever present and it seems like any ethnic minority is portray in very unpolitical correct way. A Scottish sounding Autobot is heard to say ""I'll bottle ya"" The humour is also not at all funny. If you do laugh, you'd be laughing at the absolute dire dialogue written for the film. I had high hopes for this film and my hopes soon turned to anger and dismay.<br/><br/>The other problem with the film is the pacing of the whole thing. It takes an absolute age for anything exciting to happen. When you come to see a film like this you'd expect robots to be smashing other robots, buildings or any other inanimate object. What you get is a limp attempt at humour and character development. <br/><br/>Enough about the negatives you say, what about the positives? Well the action scenes are extremely well handled. If you watch in 3D then your eyes will be in for a treat. Bays trademark of slo-mo is in full effect and there is so much happening at one time you could get lost in which Transformer is which. With the carnage and mayhem, you're going to be in safe hands with Bay. The 3D is also implement in such dazzling array and the action packed set pieces are done with aplomb.<br/><br/>I just wish he would try to leave school boy humour and offence pokes at other races alone. Apart from that I just about found the film tolerable. A complete mess with a tone which shifts from one extreme to another and just doesn't sit well. I now know why Megan Fox jumped ship and left this awful mess of a film. A sad waste of money, time and effort. I want my money back."

","hi everyone,i saw transformers 3 today.<br/><br/>I went to this movie with huge expectations and gladly those expectations were mostly met.The film starts off on a positive note and Slightly loses its grip somewhere in the middle.then again returns back to end on a positive note..<br/><br/>About the positives-this film has some jaw dropping mind blowing action sequences.this is a typical Michael Bay film where the tag line is explosion.Special effects are masterfully done.3D is also effectively used.I guess there are only two directors in Hollywood who know how to present a movie in 3D and they are none other than Michael Bay and James Cameron.I thought i would miss Megan FOX.But surprisingly i didn't.Rosie Huntington and Shia Lebouf shared a good chemistry.Also Frances Mcdormand deserves a special mention.<br/><br/>Finally coming to the negatives-This film has no strong plot.The running time is overly long.First half was slow paced.Some big names like John Malkovich were terribly wasted.<br/><br/>But anyhow on the whole,the positives outweigh the negatives.This is the best of the series.So i advice you guys to go to the cinemas,grab a popcorn and enjoy a roller coaster ride.Michael Bay rocks.......my rating 8/10"
"zachariah-coffman-959-928297","8","1","5","30 June 2011"," Great movie, horrible girlfriend replacement
","The movie was great. The weakest points of the whole thing were the interactions between Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and Sam (Shia LaBeouf). When Sam dies momentarily in Revenge of the Fallen, and Mikaela tells Sam that she loves him, I really cared, a lot. When you see the relationship that Carly and Sam have, it feels very fabricated. I am not giving Megan Fox props for being a good actress, but I wholeheartedly feel that she is 100% better than Rosie. I have also read plenty of material about how clueless Rosie is. I am under the impression that in an interview, she did not even know who Bumblebee was? WTF is that? Any way, great job Michael Bay, another robotic epic story, but perhaps you and Spielberg could have maintained professionalism with Megan Fox to keep the integrity of the franchise in tact. I would even accept that she comes back for the fourth one, because Rosie was awful, fake, and clueless."
"stly999","8","1","5","30 June 2011"," Overall exciting but some parts ridiculous (like most movies!)
","I give it 8 for the huge battle scenes with amazing special effects. Unlike most people, this is the first Transformers film I have seen (I don't get out much)and I was impressed by the action (I am easily impressed, due to not going out much). My senses were stirred, rattled and rolled. But I question why the very beautiful Rosie Huntington Whiteley (Carly) was in the film .... she added nothing except a stunning body and big lips, but managed to keep her perfect skin totally unblemished and her white clothes unmarked, in spite of the carnage she was involved in. This girl may be a model, but an actress??? Also, it is impossible at times to know who is the bad guy and the good guy (transformer-wise); they look alike. At times the scenes were a tangle of metal and you hoped that it was the good guy who won; but were not really sure. And why do advanced aliens use bullets (or similar)? Humans can destroy whole cities with one bomb; aliens could do that, or even more. Instead at times they pick off individuals as if they are still in WW1. But in spite of those niggles, still worth seeing the film. As for the choice between 2D or 3D, I saw it in 3D but wanted something to fly out at the audience and make my girlfriend jump .... I was disappointed. But, as to whether it as good in 2D I don't know .... I would have to watch it to make that judgement but now I already know the ending .... and anyway, not sure when I will next go out."
"eff1975","8","1","5","30 June 2011"," If you liked Transformers 1 you'll like Transformers 3
","I rarely write reviews for movies, but I felt the need to for this one, simply because so many reviewers were bashing it and I want to set the minds at ease for those that really enjoyed the first Transformers and were hoping for a return to form after the awful ""Revenge of the Fallen"".<br/><br/>In short, I will say that I think this movie had the best action sequences out of all three movies, but the story in part 1 is better. That being said, this movie is a VERY close second to the first movie. The biggest improvements in this movie from ""Revenge"" are the removal of Skids and Mudflap, and the fight scenes are a lot more recognizable. What I mean by that is I felt like in ""Revenge"" when Prime would fight it was hard to tell who was who and which blade went where, etc. But in ""Dark"" they do a tremendous job in slowing the action down so you can get every aspect of where the punch lands or where the blade slices. I was a bit worried when the film started and a couple of the first Transformers we see are the ""pet"" robots that Sam owns. But, Bay (much like Lucas did with Jar Jar in Revenge of the Sith) keeps their scenes to a minimum and near the end of the movie they actually have some pretty funny scenes.<br/><br/>Acting overall was good. The actress they got to replace Megan Fox did an OK job. She should stick to her day job, but her acting didn't take away from the excitement of the film in anyway. Shia LaBouf did a good job, once again, as Sam. John Tutoro was back as the leader of Sector 7 again, and I though his performance, along with his new parter, were very good as well. Bringing in some veterans like John Malkovich and Frances MacDormand was a good pull by Bay as well. I liked both of their performances and thought they fit their roles well. Malkovich could've held back on the fake NY accent, but again, it didn't take away from the film in anyway.<br/><br/>I grew up watching the Transformers cartoon of the 80's so I consider myself a fan. I'm not a fanatic and didn't really follow them into comic book land or watch the recent animated series. I know some super-fans have been disappointed by these films, but if you're looking for a fun summer movie, with REALLY great action, and sequences that are simply exciting to watch, check out this movie. If you get the chance to see it in IMAX 3D, do take advantage of that as well. The explosions are pretty eye-opening in 3D and the IMAX just makes everything more exciting."
"sam2484","8","1","5","30 June 2011"," Transformers Dark of the Moon- Giant robots in mortal combat, what's not to like?
","Story: The Autobots must recover the Arc, a Cybertronian aircraft that holds the key to save the planet Cybertron, before the Decepticons. The Arc holds the secret which, if it falls in the hands of Decpticons, will spell disaster for Autobots, and more importantly, for Earth. However, the Autobots soon learn that what they strive to protect, has a deeper and a darker plan than they could imagine. They must race against time and fight one of their own to save the planet and the human race from the Decepticons' sinister plan.<br/><br/>Review: Transformers- Dark of the Moon gives its fans something to cheer about. The third instalment of the series makes up for everything Transformers 2 failed at, and goes a step beyond the Transformers (I) glory. The movie serves a huge helping of special effects, complete with a strong storyline. The car chases, the cars transforming or the giant robots in mortal combat- each scene is crafted with attention to detail. While the metal clashing against metal can be overwhelming in certain scenes, the fantastic VFX applied results in a visual delight. However, special effects are not all that the movie has to offer. There are some witty exchanges and moments of comic relief making it a complete package, or one very near to it.<br/><br/>The love triangle is expertly mingled with the main story, leaving no loose ends. The plot is expertly unravelled, with sufficient amount of dialogue and special effects to move the story along. Though the movie is dominated with special effects, care has been taken to inject appropriate amount humour and emotion in it. All things considered, the visuals do justice to the storyline and the plot, in turn, provides occasion for the superb special-effects.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf reprises his role as Sam Witwicky, although, he is now more of an adult with a fair sense of responsibility. Rosie Huntington- Whiteley looks much more like a Victoria Secret's model (which she is) than Sam's girlfriend. However, she does justice to her role and proves a far cry from Megan Fox, whose expression seldom changed with the twists in story in the previous movies. LaBeouf and Rosie try hard to add some chemistry to the lead pair, but fail miserably. Her character appears just too far out of his league. Bay will not be disappointed in Rosie, as she brings doles of glamour and a fair amount of talent to the table. Patrick Demsey looks awkward and is not very convincing as a villain. The rest of the cast play their part well and don't give occasion for any harsh criticism.<br/><br/>Michael Bay will regain his fans' vote of confidence. Where his last Transformers severely disappointed, this one goes a long way to make up for it. Bay makes sure the core issue- Autobots war with Decepticons- is not lost between all the effects. He doesn't alienate the viewers with all the new characters by giving the old ones strong parts to play. He manages to inject a fair dose of emotion in the movie, though; the action scenes far outweigh these. Bay, however, fails to elicit any semblance of romantic feelings between the lead pair. <br/><br/>Fans will definitely not be disappointed. Optimus Prime gets a third transformation capability, while a few other welcome changes are made to the Autobots team. Optimus and Bumblebee return with shiny new additions. Optimus Prime is a treat to watch as he plays the part of the Hero and impresses in every scene.<br/><br/>The bromance between Bumblebee and Sam is something to watch out for.<br/><br/>Decepticon Soundwave and his pet Driller are impressive and could have been given more screen time.<br/><br/>The story has heavy battle sequences, so watching the movie in 3D could give a few viewers headaches. The fact that a few parts in the film was converted to 3D post-production makes it fall short in bringing out the best in some scenes during the movie. However, the 3D format makes many action sequences stand out from the rest, so the viewers will not be shortchanged for the extra bucks spent.<br/><br/>The romance between the lead pair is not at all believable, but considering the fact that the movie is about the robots, the human shortcomings can be overlooked.<br/><br/>Transition between scenes in some places is erratic and abrupt, but this is an exception and not the rule.<br/><br/>There are a few treats thrown in for crossover fans between Transformers and Star Trek. In the initial few minutes of the movie, when the two small Autobots are watching television, a Star Trek scene with a wildly agitated Spock (Leonard Nimmoy) is shown. This is perhaps a harbinger of Sentinel Prime (voiced by Nimmoy) wrecking destruction in the latter part of the movie- a very clever addition. Sentinel Prime also uses a famous line delivered by Spock in a Star Trek movie. A 'trekkie' will surely be able to spot this. <br/><br/>All in all, a good movie to catch over the weekend.<br/><br/>(First reviewed by me for Dailybhaskar.com)"
"cadillac20","6","1","5","29 June 2011"," Better Than The Second Film, Not Quite The First Film
","The first Transformers film was an event for me. As a fan of the cartoon, I was excited to see it brought to life on the big screen. And seeing it was quite an event. I got the chance to see an early screening of it at Anime Expo in 2007 with about 3000 excited geeks and nerds. So, you can imagine, it was a lot of fun. Sadly, the energy in this series is not the same. Gone is the excitement carried by the discovery of CGI- fueled Transformers. Gone is the thrill of seeing Optimus for the first time or hearing the line Autobots, Roll Out. Without that thrill, one thing becomes glaringly obvious: the series just isn't that exciting any more.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is not necessarily a terrible film. Good, well, that's debatable. The action is still very well done and Michael Bay is still probably the best choice of a director to do a Transformers film. He makes the action look great, and it certainly is great here. But, one could argue that this is the same film as the first, and that was probably done on purpose. We're made aware of some dark secret, reintroduced to Sam Whitwicky in his current life, and then things go wrong. And yes, it all ends in a spectacular battle in which an entire city becomes the battleground. <br/><br/>What is highly noticeable is how long the film is. It drags in the middle and by the end, you are starting to notice that the film is really long. And it is, at 2.5 hours. There is certainly some entertainment value to be had. The action is spectacular, to use that word twice. The CGI effects are phenomenal, as they have continued to be for the series and the Transformers are as enjoyable as ever. Sam and Bumblebee's relationship is specifically enjoyable, as it was in the first film. Despite what many will say, Bay does have a certain way of pulling out even the tiniest bit of emotion from his films, and he succeeds here on the smallest scale. Certainly it's not a film to will find a deep connection with, but there's one there. <br/><br/>But, as I stated, this is essentially the first film, minus the excitement of discovering the Transformers for the first time. So, if you enjoy these films as a sort of reunion with old friends, then you will like this one. While the second film was certainly a disaster, this is much better, with a simpler plot, decipherable action, and even a decent story. I, however, was fairly bored. There's some sprinkling of humor and decent action, but again, the film dragged quite a bit. Maybe I was just a bit tired when I saw it, but one thing a Transformers film shouldn't be is boring, and sadly, this one was. <br/><br/>What I say to you is see it if you want some decent summer action. But if the idea of another Transformers film already has you rolling your eyes and yawning, I say skip it. You probably won't change your mind."
"shadowdogg","7","1","5","29 June 2011"," Disappointing but still worth a watch for fans
","I absolutely loved the first film and didn't mind the second. The first transformers had so much soul, the music in it was so amazing that it goes through me if I watch it to this day. I can listen to the music and the scene just plays on the back of my eyelids like I am in the cinema watching it again.<br/><br/>This really does lack any original soundtrack, there is no one memorial soundtrack in it which would remind me of the show.<br/><br/>Obviously the soundtrack is only a part of this show but I did expect some mass transformation to give Optimus Prime wings but instead they did an 'add-on' in his truck.<br/><br/>It provided a good opportunity to show something new and show off a new function of it. As a director, I would do that same scroll around the transformer as he was transforming and do the same pose as the first one - just to show that excitement back into the fan when you first saw Optimus transform in the first one.<br/><br/>I really wanted to love this so much but it just felt like they found a way to make money with their storyboard and stuck with it. Make up some rubbish that humans and transformers met before, battle ensues, main guy gets in a small fight with Optimus. Optimus takes off their head.<br/><br/>I agree with the other IMDb review, definitely lacked soul but action it did have.<br/><br/>I also think they should have tested the waters more with the intro and done a bit longer of cybertron to see what fans thought."
"carlkevad","7","1","5","29 June 2011"," ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was the fastest two and a half hours I've ever experienced.
","Let me start off by just saying that ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is much more better than its predecessor.<br/><br/>I'm not what you'd exactly call a fan of the Michael Bay-directed Transformers film series. I didn't particularly like the first film with it's excess of cheese and CGI. I hated ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" which was even with it's action sequences less interesting than watching paint dry in a dark room. It was muddled, and after 30 minutes of watching the movie, I started to begin to have chronic headaches. Luckily though, Michael Bay has picked up the pieces, and directed the awesome ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon.""<br/><br/>I'm not gonna bother writing a detailed plot description, since it doesn't really matter a lot, but the film is practically the following Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has to once again save the world from total destruction. He once again needs to help his Autobot friends. He once again has the hot girlfriend, this time a new one, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, who's replaced Megan Fox. She is what Megan Fox was, hot and not getting too much dialog. She's effective at what she is supposed to do.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there's less and more humorous humor here. Coen-favorites John Turturro and Frances McDormand star alongside John Malkovich to provide us with subtle humor. Turturro's character, the retired agent Seymour Simmons, who tried to laugh us in the previous films, actually succeeds here. From it's cast to the amazing special effects put to display here, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a carefully made action picture. It succeeds as one on every level.<br/><br/>That said, there are still mistakes in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" The plot is too complicated for the adolescent 12-year-olds it's mainly made for, and it drags quite a lot in act two, but ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was the fastest two and a half hours I've ever experienced. I mean that in the best possible way.<br/><br/>There's a huge cast in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Frances McDormand, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Hugo Weaving, Kevin Dunn, Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and even Patrick Dempsey as Whiteley's boss.<br/><br/>Bay is known for directing bad movies with great action sequences. He doesn't create a good movie here, but he creates a movie that's action sequences are so good, that we don't really care about anything else. He's obviously done a lot of work here. Remember all you haters, Michael Bay doesn't write the dialogs of his movies. Ehren Kruger does that in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" and I give Bay extra credit of making the action so good that we forget about Kruger's horrible dialog writing.<br/><br/>Apart from the action sequences, the 3D is amazing here. It's as good as I've seen in a long while. In fact, I believe that the only movies with good 3D I've ever seen are ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Tron: Legacy."" I didn't see ""Avatar"" in 3D. The second act dragged a bit, but the engrossing act one and the frantic act three with the epic destruction of Chicago in amazing 3D, more than make up for act two's mistakes.<br/><br/>He said it himself, Michael Bay wants to ""entertain the summer audience"". He will with ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" which is the best film I've ever seen that he directed. This isn't a great movie, but it's wildly entertaining. It's got the explosions, it's got the frantic action, it's got the Victoria's Secret model, it's got robots beating the **** out of other robots, and it's got the amazing third act of total destruction. What more could you ask from a summer action flick?<br/><br/>Rating: ★★★ (7/10)"
"Seller7862","Null","1","6","18 July 2011"," Fail Mode
","Wow. Just wow. If you thought that director Michael Bay was going to take a gentler approach to the third film then be prepared for a surprise. Dark Of The Moon is huge both in action and in the amount of CGI. This time the decepticons have a very transformers-like plan to take over the world. Who stand in their way? Only a small number of autobots and humans. How good is the film? It's somewhere between the first and the second films. It has only two things going for it: the fantastic CGI and the impressive 3D presentation. For a film like this Bay has given up such things as character development, a coherent story or tight direction. Dark Of The Moon is a mess, but not as much as Revenge Of The Fallen. Characters come and go for little or no reason. The humor is awkward, lousy or disgusting. Some scenes are underdeveloped or unnecessary. The acting is bad or passable. The score is loud and generic. The American patriotism is, once again, over the top. A shocker is in store for viewers concerning the American space program. But the worst thing is that Michael Bay still hasn't learned (or decided to ignore) why the transformers cartoons were likable. The transformers themselves were real characters, and they looked different and interesting. In this film it takes some effort to see who's who when they're fighting. Dark Of The Moon is a money-making product at its simplest. It's meant to lure audiences with its predictable combination of humor, action and special effects. It's passable entertainment, but I wouldn't watch it a second time. Like the previous two transformers films Dark Of The Moon is a true product of the Bush era.<br/><br/>^^^^^ Why does IMDb tolerate political rants masquerading as reviews? The hissy-fit above seems to serve only one purpose: A cry for help from the mentally ill."

","The worst transformers ever. I hated the movie so much i logged in specially to write a review on it. The movie SUCKS big time, the previous Transformers seem like they were made by Michael Bay but this one by his assistant director. The story is about, guess what global destruction but what the movie lacks is its connectivity to it, you show one city being destroyed by the the deceptacons and the world is in harms way. Thats not global disaster. Half way through the movie i was bored actually bored and i am saying this after being a transformers fan. Now on the good side the movie has good action scenes but they are made just cause the film makers felt ""oh oh i bet this scene would look good in the theater"".The special effect are A class and used brilliantly in the action sequences some of which will actually take your breath way but they are rare. If your in for just some action and good visuals this is the movie for you But if you want to like the transformers franchise miss this one. Oh and the 3D, please make a normal 2D movie we have enjoyed it for years and will still enjoy it in that way cause 3D really is not 3D its converted 3D and the audience know about it. SO WHO ARE U FOOLING"
"julesrulesny","6","1","6","3 July 2011"," No chemistry? no explanation of story line? just special effects!
","I rarely give a movie such a low rating. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I did. Now I actually like Michael Bay films, like Armageddon and Transformers 1 and 2. While every one bashed the 2nd one I liked it. but this 3rd installment - I don't know what happened. Transformers was in a perfect position to make a series of movies that was continuous and had a great story line.<br/><br/>All this one was, was a revamp of the other 2 - found ancient technology that the AutoBots and Decepticons used on Cyber-tron that could destroy earth. I mean, can the writers at least use a little imagination? Now, I didn't mind Rosey Huntington/Hartley or whatever her name is in the movie, but her playing Shia Lebouf's girlfriend was awful! there was ZERO chemistry b/w the two. it was forced and made you feel uncomfortable and awkward when the two were together. <br/><br/>Dark Moon plot would have been better as the first movie b/c Aliens/transformers being discovered on the moon in 1969. they just threw this topic out there and tried hyping it up, but it just didn't work.. gees with all the effort that went into the unbelievable last 60minutes of the movie with constant action, they could of spent some time on story development. the story itself was easy to understand, but there was no development, no explanation to anything.. In one scene we see BumbleBee coming to the rescue of Shia Lebouf, and 3 scenes later he's being held hostage saying goodbye to Shia's character b/c he's ready to be executed. Like, when did he get captured? that was never shown?! <br/><br/>some scenes were totally just added in, and out of place - for instance Optimus Prime being held captive and tangled up in wires by the Decepticons. Like BumbleBee, they made no mention of this, did not show how he was captured, nor did they show how he escaped - except they tried making it a part of the storyline when one character made a 1 second remark saying ""where's Optimus??"". and that was it.. it just didn't flow. and, it didn't work. this introduction of new characters didn't work either. The actors actually acted like they didn't want to be there.. (except shia, tho his antics are the same in every movie - but he's a good actor). the others seemed to want to just get the scenes over with .. No, I don't know what they are thinking but it just seemed that way...<br/><br/>It wasn't an awful movie.. but boy o boy to invest all this money into graphics and special effects and completely lay back on the story line was an upsetting and huge mistake. Transformers had so much potential as a continuous 3 part series of movies.. but they chopped it up, repeating the same storyline each movie.. Just so upsetting for being such a Huge fan of the Transformers!"

"KineticSeoul","7","1","6","2 July 2011"," No more than meets the eye, but it's alright this time.
","The critics seem to be bashing the hell out of this movie, maybe it's because the second installment was just uber terrible. But this time around it wasn't that bad in my opinion. Now I can see why professional reviewer or critics gave this movie a negative review, I guess they just had to. The story is just so cliché and predictable and there is almost no character development in this. Saying this movie is better than the second installment isn't saying much, since that one was pretty much garbage besides the special effects and action. But this time there is much better set pieces and it has the most action from the three movies in this franchise and the action sequences are more well done and more fun to watch. However the constant explosions gets a bit tiresome after a while, explosions and a lot of actions is what this film is known for with robots beating the crap out of each other. But after a while with things constantly blowing up and stuff flying around everywhere for a long period of time it gets tiresome. But didn't get super irritating because of it and was worth sitting through those sequences. The build up is however crappy and so is the climax, there is one twist I didn't see coming but overall everything was so damn cliché and predictable. With the humans on the brink of destruction there was no tension and there was no parts that was actually gripping. You will not care who dies or lives when it comes to the humans or which robots get destroyed for the most part. Also Shia again taking on the main role as sam again got irritating after a while cause all he does most of the way through in the story is constantly whine about his life and how he can't get a job. One of my co-worker was like this and it was a real pain to work with him and didn't want to see the same crap on the big screen, ironically he is a big fan of this franchise and Linkin Park. Unlike the 2nd installment however things stayed consistent for the most part and didn't go all over the place in negative manner, which is a plus. I didn't really like the new girl taking the place of Megan Fox, not that I was a big fan of Megan Fox but she was better than the girl that took her role in this. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is shot in a very sexual way but didn't leave a impact or made the movie better, the audience for the most part didn't seem to care how her assets were expose a bunch of time on screen. Except the annoying 14 yr old kid that was sitting on the next seat in theater that seemed to go bonkers over it and constantly made stupid remarks or talked on his phone. Micheal Bay must have a big grudge against Megan Fox cause here character gets insulted multiple times in this movie. Anyways overall this was a good summer flick that has some entertaining action sequences, the war between the Autobots and Decepticons at the end was satisfying and felt it was worth the price of admission this time around. Oh and Optimus Prime is a badass robot in this as well.<br/><br/>7.4/10"
"griffolyon12","8","1","6","2 July 2011"," Far Better Than Its Predecessor!
","After the complete let down that was Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, director Michael Bay is back with Transformers: Dark of the Moon, sans-Megan Fox, and while not as good as the original Transformers, Dark of the Moon manages to pack enough thrills and emotion into its two and a half hour frame to be more than Summer movie drivel.<br/><br/>In 1961, an Autobot spacecraft crashlanded on the far side of the moon, sparking the space race between the Soviets and the United States. While Dark of the Moon rewrites some history, the whole shebang gains some credibility when the real Buzz Aldrin makes a cameo to talk to the Autobots about the real reason him and Neil Armstrong went to the moon in 1969. As it is, this spaceship held ancient Cybertronian technology that, if in the hands of the villainous Decepticons, could mean the end of all humanity.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we catch back up with Shia LaBeouf's lovable everyman Sam Witwicky. In the first Transformers, Sam went from being a boy to a man through his getting a car that just happened to be a transformer. Film two did nothing to advance the character further, but this film finds Sam fresh out of college, no job, no government clearance, even though he has saved the world two times in the past and has a medal from the President to prove it. Sam wants to do something that matters, like he did when he was working alongside the Autobots saving the planet. At least he has his new girlfriend, Carly, played by Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whitely, who is ogled by Michael Bay's camera every chance it gets, however she surprisingly has some real acting chops and delivers a far more likable performance than Megan Fox ever did. The romance between Sam and Carly is actually portrayed believably through Huntington-Whiteley's hot attitude and LaBeouf's great sense of goofy comedic timing, making it logical that a girl like that would fall for a guy like Sam Witwicky. Together she helps him realize that through their relationship, that this is what matters, and not being a hero.<br/><br/>As it is, the action is all top notch, even through the final hour of nonstop explosions and metal crunching leaving little time to know what happens to these characters post-apocalypse rescue. Bringing us around to the length of this movie. Two and a half hours is a long time to watch transformers duke it out. I love that the humans got more to do this time around, but the movie really wears itself long, and could have been more impactful had some of the usual Michael Bay gags been toned down a bit more. Much more time was spent on gags, when that time could have been used to help flesh out the underdeveloped relationship between Optimus Prime and new badguy, Sentinel Prime. Even still, majority of the gags are funny, however Ken Jeong's whole character was flat out annoying, luckily he was only in the movie for three minutes, enough time to dispense a plot point and get killed by a Decepticon. As for other new cast members, John Malkovich as Sam's new boss ultimately goes nowhere other than a few unnecessary gags, however Frances McDormand is highly enjoyable as the government agent in charge of the Autobots, and Patrick Dempsey plays an intriguing human chameleon working for the Decepticons.<br/><br/>With everything said and done, Transformers: Dark of the Moon could have done with a little trimming of some of the gags that don't necessarily add to the primary theme of Sam's journey through this story, however the action is superb, and many of the gags are quite funny. As well, the movie emotionally involves you in the story between Carly and Sam, and the connection between Sam and his transforming car, Bumblebee, is just as poignant as it was when Sam tried to save Bumblebee from the government in film one; when the transformers fly off in their rocket ship and Sam and Bumblebee must part ways, it's gut wrenching! Even at two and a half hours long, viewers will enthrall to this adventure that blends metal with heart and makes for an enjoyable trip to the movies.<br/><br/>I give Transformers: Dark of the Moon an 8 out 10!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. It would be unfair to analyze, critique or compare this to any ""normal"" movie. Being somewhat limited in scope by the source material, director Michael Bay, delivers what the fans want ... full scale noise and all-out action.<br/><br/>While he admitted that part two of this trilogy was lacking much, it appears his efforts to improve part three come not from script improvement, but rather by tossing in some familiar Hollywood faces: John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey and Ken Jeong. Oh, and we also get Bill O'Reilly, an odd sequence with legendary Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and the best surprise - Leonard Nimoy voicing Sentinel Prime.<br/><br/>Most of the same key players are back: Shia LaBeouf as Sam (friend to Optimus Prime), John Turturro (cashed in on his 10 min of fame), Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson as soldiers, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents in a couple of throw away scenes that cost much less than the CGI that dominates the movie.<br/><br/>While I remain an avid opponent to 3-D, this film offers a few of the best uses since Avatar. Unfortunately the dimmed coloring offset the benefits and continue to annoy me. Just remove your glasses periodically and you can easily see how much brighter the colors are without the 3-D muting. Such a shame.<br/><br/>Michael Bay knows explosions. And there are no shortage on display here. We get plenty of rock 'em sock 'em action and the military is on full display, especially with some pretty cool skydiving tactics. Heck, we even get Frances McDormand as a power-hungry bureaucrat. For those who know Chicago, the familiar sights abound. The Wrigley Building plays a vital role, though it still bothers me a bit to see a skyscraper destroyed. I will say the tilted office is not close to the rotating hallway of Inception, though the effort is appreciated.<br/><br/>The battle of the robots is what people pay to see and the 40 plus minute final battle is something to behold, even if it drags on entirely too long. And I can't fail to mention that the lack of presence of Megan Fox' character is explained a couple of times as having ""dumped"" Sam. Sam has rebounded nicely with Carly, played by supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who looks just fine in a $200,000 Mercedes, a slim white dress or conversing with an injured villainous robot. Yes, one must maintain a sense of humor during the film.<br/><br/>The use of slo-motion, the ties to the space program, and the connection to Chernobyl are all a bit heavy-handed, but this is a Transformers movie, not a documentary. And the actual transformation of these guys is still one of the coolest on screen moments you can find ... even if the story and dialogue will have you desperate for brain resuscitation when the movie finally ends."

","Critics just love to rant on how bad movies are, in fact that's all they have been doing for every movie that has been released the past couple years! Enough is enough just sit back and enjoy the dang movie already. Transformers Dark of the Moon is a great action film that will get all those people sitting in the crowd going crazy in their seats with all the explosions and battle scenes. For those saying that the story line sucks let me tell you that its not the story line that sucks because it is perfectly fine, its yourselves believing you have such a superior mind that is making the films storyline not work out. This seems to happen with all movies regarding things that use real events in history as a back story for a film with supernatural things in them. You all have to be like the X-files and just BELIEVE. Stop telling yourselves thats not possible or thats stupid and could never happen and instead begin asking yourselves what if... or that would be pretty neat if that actually did exist. Now I'm not going to lie this movie wasn't perfect but the reviews I have seen on the last 10 or so pages and from real critics are just way too negative and are not letting the film get the chance it deserves. Overall 8.5 out of 10 and no that is not being generous that is being truthful."

","Another transformers movie, another record amount of explosions. This sums up Transformers 3 in a nutshell and fans of the series wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>If your looking for a movie with an in depth story and interesting, well developed characters then this is not the movie for you but if your looking a summer blockbusters full of mind boggling action then grab Bumblebee and take him for a drive down to your nearest cinema.<br/><br/>However, compared to the previous instalments the story is more developed, with Shia Labeouf and the new love interest Rosie Huntington- Whiteley both providing a decent backdrop to the action. There are a few twists but they are easy to see coming and you certainly wont be remembering the movie for the story. On the whole, the story is the best in the series but this wasn't difficult to accomplish, but the real reason you see Transformers is for the action which doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Just like the previous entries, Michael Bay has directed a movie with special effects so extraordinary that your eyes will be glued to the screen and the hairs standing on the back of your neck. As you would expect, the action in this movie surpasses the previous films which is evident in a skyscraper scene which is just spectacular. The transformer sound effects sound recycled from before but the music which plays during some of the action scenes is very impressive and adds to the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>There are only two things that disappointed me, and considering there were an issue in the previous two films it is disappointing to see them persist. As mentioned the story is decent but I would still like to see it developed. Secondly, with so much action on the screen it becomes difficult to work out who is actually fighting each other which can become as issue in the latter parts of the movie but these two issues don't detract from the spectacle.<br/><br/>Lets just get this out of the way, if your wanting a deep story in your films then avoid this movie. For everyone else, this is a must see just for the action alone. If this really is the last in the series then its a fitting conclusion to a ground breaking trilogy, and if not then the next director has got one hell of a job to improve the action, but not the story."

","Bring your tickets, and bring your earplugs because Micheal Bay is back with another convoluted, overly explosive and sprawling disaster. Ehren Kruger is clearly more focused on writing his signature on a paycheck then writing an understandable story. Sam Witwicky is now past a forgettable character, and his new girlfriend is a searing hot ploy no doubt inserted in the movie exclusively for luring in the teen male audience. There's really not much to criticize here, which is dissatisfying considering it's a long haul just based on running time. Don't be all ears, because that would be devastating. Concussion inducing, visually irritating, and this film is also seemingly drawing from screamo concerts rather then the toys which it's based on. In conclusion, Ehren should be reminded of what a plot is, and Micheal Bay should cease before his hearing disappears."

Yes it's true ... look it up on the internet! <br/><br/>So, my real bone of contention with Bay is not the spectacular drivel that he produces, but his reinforcement of the America-centric vision that is ultimately pretty insulting to any non-American with a brain."
"EffOne","6","0","1","5 July 2014"," Wasted potential.
","I personally enjoyed the first two Transformers movies. They stayed fairly close in concept to the G1 cartoon I grew up with as a kid and had decent plots, a good protagonist with Sam and some humor thrown in for good measure. In this movie though, for me, things get idiotic. First of all, you have the transformation (no pun intended) of the Sam Witwicky character from someone eccentric, little whacky and amusing to a character that is over-acted in most scenes and becomes a whining, neurotic, squealing overly-erratic little punk who is just basically very annoying. Then you have the unnecessary love interest who is just there for eye-candy who is a little better than the one that was in the previous 2 movies but not by much.<br/><br/>The biggest sin though for me that this movie commits is the wasted opportunity with Shockwave. This is a character that in other transformers media is a brilliant tactician and strategist and instead of having him collaborating with Megatron and Sentinel Prime in their plan to rebuild Cybertron, all Bay has him do is smash stuff up everywhere with his driller and utter one line in the whole film. This movie is worth a look but for the reasons mentioned above, it really stands out as the absolute worst in the original 3 movies."
"alindsay-al","6","0","1","30 June 2014"," An improvement but still not as good as the original
","It seems that with the universal hate for the transformers franchise it seems that people ignore the positives that there is with these Transformers film. This film starts with Sam being distraught with his lack of relationship with Optimus Prime and the autobots and having to deal with real life, until the decepticons return and Sam, his new girlfriend Carly and the autobots need to face a new but familiar foe. This film in my opinion is co-led by Sam and Optimus Prime and I like both, Sam is seemingly sympathetic in this film and we are meant to feel for his situation, whereas Optimus Prime is just a total badass and when he is destroying enemies it really is truly enthralling. Also the side characters are pretty good with Carly in my opinion being a huge improvement from Megan Fox in the other films. Bumblebee is a great character who just like Optimus reflects the great characters that these alien autobots are. Also Sentinel Prime is a good new deep character and even in his smaller role Megatron is still cool. Now in true Michael Bay style the story is not very good and these films are not great stories at all, similar is the script which has always been cheesy and this is no different and these things need to be improved in future Transformer films. The one great thing about Transformers films is the style as it is always awesome and the last hour is just a visual epic like I expect from a Transformers film. If it can improve it's story and script the future of these films can improve significantly."

","When the film was still in the cinema the movie had a 7 and something rating on IMDb. Add it to the fact that the producer promised that this movie will be better than the failed second one I decided to spend my money in hopes it'll be a pleasant experience. It's a very pleasant experience if you consider sleeping to be so pleasant you're willing to pay for it. It was actually the first time in my life that I almost fell asleep in the cinema.<br/><br/>This movie is simply ridiculous. And what is more ridiculous that there were people over the age of 15 who liked this movie. Actually I wouldn't even call it a movie. For my best understanding a movie has to have a plot. This excuse of a movie had no plot. Or maybe it had one but it was long lost between all the explosions and fight scenes.<br/><br/>A movie is supposed to be a way to tell a story and play on the viewer's emotions: drama, comedy, action and so on. But someone decided to replace this with special effects. This movie was not made for the sake of telling a story, this movie was made for the sake of showing explosions, fight scenes with giant robots and buildings being destroyed.<br/><br/>Seeing that this ""movie"" actually had a profit makes me think we're on to a future presented in ""Idiocracy"". This ""movie"" didn't have a plot nor deepness, or believable characters. Or maybe it had some of it (though I'm sure there wasn't any deepness), but it was such a small part that personally I didn't notice it between all the explosions.<br/><br/>I regret wasting my hard earned money on something that shouldn't have been in the cinema from the beginning."

They are what we call great entertainment. I have to give props to the greatest iconic director of all time – Steven Spielberg and the genius behind the Transformers Trilogy – Michael Bay. There is no one in the nation that can outdo these 2 gentleman. The cast was incredible from the boy who started the phenomenon – Shia Labouef to the newcomer girlfriend, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

","I thought ""Transformers"" was an enjoyable movie, and it still is. Then ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" came out and there is not another movie that amounts to that ones stupidness. Now we have ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" which is a minor improvement from the second film, but thats not saying much. <br/><br/>""Dark of the Moon"" starts with a war in Cybertron, and a group of Autobots leaving their planet trying to protect something on their ship. They then crash on our Moon. Then Apollo 11's mission to the Moon was to really investigate that crash. We then catch up with Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) who is jobless, but still has a super hot girlfriend, who was an aid in the White House when Sam was being honored by Obama for his hero like actions. But if he is such a hero, why is that he has to settle for job in the mail room. But just when things get normal, all hell starts breaking loose, and Sam is thrust back into saving the world once again.<br/><br/>Alright, lets start with something I did like and that was most of the 3D shots, which fully take affect within the last hour and fifteen minutes. My favorite shots were when a group of military men have to wing-suit into Chicago. The depth was beautiful, and those were the fews scenes that I was truly engaged in. <br/><br/>I hate the story line with Sam's parents. Although in this movie its not so bad as the second film. I just find that the over the top mother gets very annoying. I believe that Shia LaBeouf has the chance to be one of the best actors of my generation. He has had some great roles but nothing that has truly stood out. He has the right look, and I believe his vulnerability but I don't believe him trying to be the hero all the time. I think thats the problem. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is not that great. Of course there are the usual John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, and Josh Duhamel. Then there are some random cameos from Francis McDormand, John Malkovich, and Patrick Dempsey. Nothing to impressive about their roles. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays Carly, Sam's new girlfriend. I have to say that she is just as good as Megan Fox if not a little better. So Im curious to see where her career goes from here. <br/><br/>Now I have enjoyed some of Michael Bay's films. I liked ""Armageddon"", some of ""Pearl Harbor"", and ""The Rock"". But I find most of his film to be a long waste of two and half hours. He just thinks about what the next thing to blow up is, he does not care about his character's development, and he never lets the camera stay still. It is always moving, and I find that extremely irritating. Let the camera rest and let your actors do what they are supposed to. I don't want to believe that Michael Bay takes his films seriously but if he truly believes that his films have significance in someone's lives, he needs to wake the hell up.<br/><br/>I enjoyed maybe about a total of thirty minutes of this movie. The rest can just be thrown away in the trash, where the second movie currently rest. I give ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" a 6 out of 10."

","I would venture to say that we've entered the golden age of cinema sequels. Soon we'll have the misfortune of another Ghostrider film despite the fact that the first one stunk. Sequels can be the best thing to ever happen to a film (The Godfather II, Rocky II) or the worst (see any of the Land Before Time series after the first). So, needless to say I wasn't totally excited about the third Transformers film especially since the second film had left me disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that this third film was a dramatic improvement in several ways over the second. I still feel that the first film was the best, but this film was watchable and even enjoyable. This time the cast includes Shia LeBeouf, Josh Duhamel, and John Turturro. New to the series are John Malkovich, Patrick Dempsey, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.<br/><br/>The story follows up on the previous films as the Autobots discover a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden on the Moon. Now they're in a race with the Decepticons to reach it and to learn its secrets. In the meantime Sam (LaBeouf) is struggling with being a normal guy after the role he played in saving the earth. Slowly he finds his way back into the mix with his old friends, human and Transformer, as the Decepticons begin their efforts to rule the world.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning through the action sequences. The CGI and special effects work well as they make each action scene amazing. If you're looking for anything realistic this won't be for you, the fights and destruction are over the top from minute one.<br/><br/>The acting is exactly I expected, LaBeouf plays his frustrated Sam much the same way as he did in the previous two films. Gibson and Duhamel manage to shoot enough Decepticons to make their mark in the film. Sam's new flame Carly (Huntington-Whiteley) is weak in the film but I'm fairly sure that she wasn't hired for her acting. Newcomers John Malkovich and Patrick Dempsey are definitely the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>If there is any criticism I would say that the effort to leave the door open for a sequel is obvious and may have weakened the ending. It's not a bad film, but like the second film it fails to match the quality of the first film in terms of story.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film if you enjoyed the other two in the series. If the second film left you feeling bad this might redeem the franchise a bit. I would give the film a rating of 2.9 stars out of 5.<br/><br/>Rating: PG-13 Running Time: 157 minutes"

I might sound nerdy but here goes, I will prove the fact that this movie is so amazing!! Also I will tell you about how Transformers is cool and Ninja Turtles is evil!!!<br/><br/>First of all, the ACTING! Very very good acting! The Chinese man was so funny (my daddy says he's Korean but he's stupid because he likes The Godfather!) but at the same time very realistic (woops what a big word) and Sheeya LaBeef (woops what a silly name) was incredible and showed how scary and dangerous it would be if robots came and started destroying everything! And his girlfriend was very good too! She showed how hot and sexy a girl would be if she was only wearing undies!!!<br/><br/>Second of all, the STORY! The story was so complex and smart, also not very long and understandable (woops, sorry guys I'm very good at English because I got a B+) so after the movie I ended I felt sad because the best movie ever was over! So much cool action! Like the big spaceship and explosion and the big octopus robot that was killing the big building! Yeah some parts of the story was boring like the parts where it showed us what was gonna happen next! I mean come on! Focus on the special effects cause that's what makes the stories and the ideas in the movies work! Stories are about EXPLOSIONS! And The Godfather did not have explosions! And I'm pretty sure because I haven't seen The Godfather but it looks boring and boring movies don't have EXPLOSIONS!<br/><br/>Third of all, the ROBOTS! Wow the robots are so cool and I want one and so does my brother! The robots are so cool like Bumblebee I love Bumblebee I have a Bumblebee toy but I was playing with it in the toilet because he was going on a mission to the sewers to defeat the ninja turtles and so I flushed the toilet! But Bumblebee never came back! This is why I hate the Ninja Turtles! They killed Bumblebee! And Bumblebee was cool!<br/><br/>Anyways even though there is war and hungry people in the world it doesn't matter because this very good movie taught us that the Transformers will come and save us one day! I'm looking forward to that day! They're coming aren't they? In fact I'm going to ask Mr. Jenkins, my science teacher! He's the smartest man in the world!<br/><br/>But good bye everyone!

","I realize that the ""Transformer"" movies are generally regarded as the non plus ultra of soulless commercial movie-making and that their popularity is supposed to presage the very demise of Cinema itself as an art form. But such an assessment fails to take into account the movies' sense of high-spirited fun, their playful wit and their over-the-top but sometimes amusing caricatures, human and otherwise (I can't speak for the universally reviled second installment, which I haven't seen).<br/><br/>Part 3, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" starts with a clever premise: that the original lunar landing was really just an elaborate, for-public-consumption-only ruse to launch a covert operation to explore a spaceship - the one carrying the initial wave of autobots - that had recently crash landed on the surface of the moon. Now a new race of evil bots, known as Decepticons, are becoming activated, threatening to destroy the good bots and take over the earth for their own nefarious purposes.<br/><br/>On the human side, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) may have saved the world in the past, but he still can't find a job. But mere unemployment can't keep an honest-to-goodness, dyed-in-the-wool hero from saving humanity once again after the evil creatures pretty much raze Chicago in a literal scorched-earth policy of rampant death and destruction.<br/><br/>The one saving grace of the ""Transformer"" movies - which would indeed otherwise be the epitome of soulless movie machines - has been their sense of humor, their refusal to take themselves too seriously (especially the first one). Unfortunately, the wit and fleet-footedness of the first half of ""Dark of the Moon"" dribbles away in a welter of overwrought CGI effects and self-congratulatory seriousness towards the end. And LaBeouf gets stuck playing romantic lead to any number of automatons: his metallic buddies and his flesh-and-blood girlfriend Carly Spencer - and he isn't too terribly convincing in either role. But as an action comedy superhero, the kid definitely brings the agility and skills necessary to get the job done. Which pretty much describes the film itself, come to think of it."

","You can enjoy the third Transformers movie quite a lot. Michael Bay did not have to listen to the criticism, but he did. You don't get a resolution on issues that concern the second Transformers movie, but the movie has reasonable gaps in its story. I'm assuming you have seen both prior installments, so I'm not considering talking about them spoilers.<br/><br/>Megan Fox prominently has taken off. Reasons for that are not entirely clear, but I guess she wanted to move along. What's good is that it is resolved and mentioned in the movie. But is is really story you are looking for here? I can't speak for how much liberties Bay takes with the Transformers franchise. But I can say that he filmed this more coherent than the last one. The jokes are still there, but he toned a few things down (thankfully) and made the action scenes look better. Plus I could actually understand and see who was who in the shot.<br/><br/>Not superior to the still best part in the series (the first one that is), but a return to action a la Bay, without much to think about.

","Third installment of the Transformers series is much like the first two, but the story is more interesting. <br/><br/>Premise of the story is that NASA sent Apollo space crafts to explore crash landed Transformer space craft containing an elder Transformer named Centinnel. They found five ""pillars"" that is part of the technology to teleport matters. But it was a trap. Decepticon was there first, and they stole most of the pillars before Nasa got to them. They left Centinnel there because Optimus Prime was only Transformer that could revive Centinnel that in turn can operate the pillars.<br/><br/>Shallow story is a hallmark of director Michael Bay's movies, and this one is no exception. It's all about wham !, Bam !, rock um, sock um battle between the robots. It's made in grand scale, but if you expect any depth, you're watching the wrong movie. There're some cruelty as was seen in the previous Transformer movie, that I really didn't care for. But I could see that they had to bring this in to keep the story going.<br/><br/>The movie is best of all the Transformer movies, but it's still not much more than an expensive cartoon."

","Michael Bay is the abusive husband of the cinematic world. He promised us he had learned from his mistakes, he swore that it was the writer's strike that had a negative effect on the second film. And yet here he is, stumbling around like a drunk and going back on his promises. The film sits somewhere between the first two movies in terms of quality. But I may hate it even more than the second film. It's pretty terrible, but it also flirts with some nice ideas that it never explores.<br/><br/>There is less moronic comedy, but one has to ask if there was need for any. It's so childish, and yet we have almost every swear word and put down I can think of. Kids must just love hearing the words d***head, w**ker etc. They've added a completely unnecessary mini-autobot to join the annoying one from the last film. Why? He is always with the other character, and does stuff he could have done alone. It's a waste of screen time and special effects. After Bay was criticised for the racist twins of the last film he searched long and hard for a group it was socially acceptable to ridicule. Thank God for the gays. There are so many jokes about possible gay characters that it gets boring fast. Bay doesn't hide his republican ideals, but shouldn't he be trying to entertain us in more creative ways?<br/><br/>LaBeouf does fairly well here. I enjoyed his take on a wussy hero. It was great to see a young man screaming like a little girl. Leave the heroics up to the autobots. I was also impressed by his frustration. We have someone that has no recognition for his achievements. The pain when he is interviewed for a mailroom job, but declares he has saved the world twice, is a genuine moment of humanity. Yet, because it's Bay, this is soon undermined by a comical Asian character and another gay joke. I was also disturbed by Optimus Prime's killer nature. I was always under the impression that he was a leader and had compassion and morals. Here he declares ""Kill them all"" and stabs people in the back and tears off their faces. He's a bloodthirsty thing and scarier than the Decepticons. <br/><br/>Like I said, the film has some nice ideas. I liked having Megatron as a beaten and disgraced leader. Unfortunately, this avenue is never explored. He's just a hobo, until the scriptwriters managed to fit him in. It could have been a bit of a tragic fall, like Hitler in Downfall. The relationship between him and Starscream could have been very moving, as he would be loyal no matter how powerful Megatron was. Dempsey plays a particularly slimy villain, and it was interesting to see a human threat paired with the Decepticons. The script once again chickened out by having a new love interest. I understand Fox was gone, but Bay's handling of it was so childish. She just up and left did she? Bay seems to have forgotten that her character was separate from Fox herself. She helped save the world twice, and was supposedly the love of LaBeouf's life. Why not take a dramatic angle of an under appreciated hero, just ditched by his partner. Instead she's been replaced ever so quickly by some talentless, dull as dishwater, eye candy that isn't even that attractive.<br/><br/>The effects are incredible. They are seamless, but all this movie proves is that bad effects don't harm a good film and good effects don't make a bad film any better. The action scenes were very well constructed, and I could tell all the robots apart this time. Also, I never fell asleep like with the second movie. Had the fat been trimmed and the extremes of goody comedy and then humans disintegrated been better balanced, we may have had a very enjoyable movie on our hands. Had more attention been paid to the drama, it could have even been great."

","First movie was great. Second movie was AMAZING! Third movie...what a disappointment to those who enjoyed the first and second! Not a fan of the whole Transformers thing, but I LIKE the movies, especially the first and second. This one was way too structural and predictable! Such as: Sam tries to live his human life. His life gets interrupted by the decepticons and autobots. Sam decides to help autobots again. Sam is apparently the ONLY one who can save them. All hopes fail. Autobots are kicked from planet. Sam and other humans decides to save the world. Autobots make a ""surprising"" return. Optimus gives the command to ""roll out."" Metal pieces flying everywhere. Lots of explosions. Autobots win. Optimus' epic"" speech at the end. Done.<br/><br/>Sure the action parts were pretty awesome. But it just felt sooooo bleh. Like, what was Michael Bay thinking??!?!? <br/><br/>About the whole Carly chick thing... she is SUCH A BURDEN!! In many fighting scenes, she is running in her heels while Sam is DRAGGING HER. Sam tried to save Bee, and she TRIED to stop him! Seriously? You're in the middle of a war, woman! If Mikaela (Megan Fox) was there instead, I think she'd be helping Sam try to save Bumble Bee, and she wouldn't be being dragged by Sam. She's be on her own two feet in shoes that are NOT heels.<br/><br/>Rosie Huntington is a beauty, but she just played a very pathetic role which gives off the vibe that the woman can't act. I get it that it's her first acting role, but I think she should just stick to modeling.<br/><br/>I'm not the greatest movie reviewer, but even I am smarter enough to know that this movie was a waste of my time."

","#contains spoilers#<br/><br/>Not as bad as some people have made out, but certainly not as good as it could have been.<br/><br/>The effects are brilliant (as you'd expect in a CGI driven film), but the storyline and pacing leave a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Too much of the first half is taken up with Sams job hunting, and his current girlfriend. That and a few cringe worthy appearances by his parents, which add nothing to the story. Safe to say you can skip most of the first hour and it will make little or no difference to the film.<br/><br/>The final battle scenes contain some impressive CGI sequences, but really you don't find yourself attached to any of the characters. And that means the battle scenes lose a lot of their potential impact.<br/><br/>A shame, as the franchise could've been so much better.

I did think he was knocked off in either of the first two.<br/><br/>Also, some new or change of characters needed. The FBI guy you love to hate, was (as far as I can remember) introduced by talking about his memoirs. Kind of had an ""oh you made it into the 3rd film too"" air about it.<br/><br/>Also the main (cool scripted) army guy was 'also' in this one.

","I thought Megan's acting was a bit light and shallow even for a movie like Transformers but not after seeing Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. I think the two main problems are the weak story line and Rosie. This is of course not a romantic movie but even a pre-schooler would show more passion for her boyfriend and look more convincing than ""Carly"" does for ""Sam"". She is right in the middle of historic and sometimes very dangerous events, yet she sounds and occasionally looks more like she is in a fashion show. Despite Rosie, I think the movie starts pretty nice with the Apollo story and John Malkovich and the visual effects are extremely good throughout the movie but not enough to cover the weaknesses. And for god's sake (and I have two mention that I am not an American), what is a British girl with of course a British accent and quite poor in acting doing in a movie that looks, sounds and feels so American? Rosie's inaptitude for acting made me feel like a bit I am watching a British sci-fi TV show with mediocre visual effects and story line like Dr. Who. I want Megan Fox back please!"

","Saw it on DVD loaned from my public library system.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam Witwicky. The stage is set early in his apartment, with his very briefly clad girlfriend walking up the stairs to where Sam was still in bed. She(model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is quite pretty. But Sam has a bigger issue at hand, his parents are coming to visit him in Washington, D.C. and he doesn't yet have a job, and that would be a big deal with mom and dad.<br/><br/>That is the personal and love-interest story. But the story about the autobots begins in 1962, with Kennedy as President. An impact of sorts is detected on the far side of the moon, and it is assumed the Russians, who the USA was in a space race against, were responsible. In this fictional story, it was this impact that was the catalyst for Kennedy to declare his intentions to send a man to the moon before the decade was over. And, we see again in this film, the moon landing in 1969 depicted.<br/><br/>But what was discovered in 1969 was a crashed space ship, one that contained remnants of the vanquished autobots. This was of course kept secret, but now in modern times artifacts brought back from the moon are on the verge of starting yet another autobot war on Earth.<br/><br/>The critic Ebert has a good, complete review. I enjoyed the first half of the movie, for its story line and tying it back to events in the 1960s. But as I have experienced with the other transformers movies, the fighting among the autobots wears thin long before each battle is over, and at a running time of right around 2.5 hours is too long for me."

In the first movie, Sam, the hero in the movie, a teenager, an underdog, and also being actually useful, he was important. Thats no longer the case in this movie. He now has no meaningful use in the movie. And the script writers have tried to use whatever straws they can grasp at to make some sort of an important role for him. It was sad. <br/><br/>3. The hot girl thing - they have taken it to the lows of a really bad teen comedy. So desperate to somehow show Sam as a big man. <br/><br/>4. Very bad editing. So many scenes have no meaning and some just pop up with no meaning to the story. And some just go on and on. They made action and real cool CGI boring, how ironic. I love action. Yet there I was looking at the time scale to see when this movie would get over......... <br/><br/>5. Bad story.

"lewiskendell","Null","0","2","1 October 2011"," A franchise that just can't live up to its potential.
","Why can't it just be about the robots?<br/><br/>The first Transformers movie struck a decent tone between the humans and the Autobot/Decepticon conflict and mythology. Yes, it was at times silly, but the focus was never totally off of the main characters (and what we want to see from these movies in the first place), the robots. <br/><br/>The second movie took the concept ""more is better"" and ran with it, to less than satisfactory results. More action scenes and more robots, but also more ""wacky humor"" and more focus on the humans.  It was an indecipherable, overly-long mess that was made to be as loud and eye-catching as possible, but it was a noticeable step down in quality from the first movie. <br/><br/>And now we have the third movie, which turns down the potty humor slightly, but features some awful writing and a story that's just silly. Forcing the character of Sam (Shia Lebeouf) and others to be a part of a plot that they have no reason to be in anymore just adds a lot of unnecessary, empty scenes to a movie that has no business being 2 1/2 hours long. I liked his character in the other two movies, but in this one he's so over-the-top and hysterical that it's annoying, and the storyline with him and his new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whitley) is an uninteresting distraction at best. John Turturro returns again in a role that wore out its welcome about 45 minutes into the first movie, Frances McDormand is wasted, John Malkovich is REALLY wasted, and Alan Tudyk is REALLY. REALLY wasted. Don't expect much from the casting of those fan-favorite actors. <br/><br/>If you're under the impression that I hated Dark of the Moon, that's not true. If you ignore the horrid writing and tune out the parade of annoying or pointless characters, there's a decent action movie buried in here about a bunch of robots smashing and blowing each other up. It's just a shame that so much of the movie is spent on the weakest, least interesting part. It's a great idea to ground such fantastical beings as Transformers in our reality through some human characters to relate to, but if that portion of the equation isn't at least adequate, the whole movie suffers. <br/><br/>Enough of my rambling. If the many flaws of the second movie didn't put you off, then you'll probably like Dark of the Moon even more. The action is easier to follow than in Revenge of the Fallen (though there are virtually no good robot vs. robot fight scenes until the very end of the movie) and the editing overall has been improved. I was just hoping that a better balance between the Transformers and humans would have been found by now, but the scales still tip far too much in the wrong direction."

","You can also read this review on my blog: 2bullets5zombies.wordpress.com<br/><br/>Four years pass since the events of the previous movie, Sam Witwicky is now living with his new girlfriend, Carly, in a D.C flat. With his diploma in one hand and a medal from the president himself in the other, Sam desperately tries to find a job. While the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, are serving as robotic soldiers for the US government.<br/><br/>A handful of government and military officials realize that the 1969 moon mission was the result of an event that threatened the secrecy of the existence of the Autobots. When the Apollo 11 astronauts discover the remains of Sentinel Prime, the previous Autobots' leader, and his ship on the surface of the earth's moon, they bring him back to planet Earth.<br/><br/>A new conspiracy arises, threatening the existence of the human kind. Needless to say, the Autobots are obligated to save the day, with Sam's help, of course.<br/><br/>Honestly, I only watched this movie because my friends wanted to; the last movie was kind of disappointing. Every Transformers movie seem to be exactly like the previous one (with a slightly different plot and a whole lot more destruction). However, I am surprisingly glad I saw this one.<br/><br/>So much happens in this movie, making it kind of hard to review. The best thing about this movie is the graphics, everything looks so real, even (insignificant) robots in the background look pretty convincing! And Transformers: Dark of the Moon offers the liveliest 3D experience so far, although a pretty violent one; two hours of entertaining major destruction.<br/><br/>The new chick is so appalling I decided a whole paragraph should be devoted to how awful her acting is! The chemistry between Shia and Rosie is particularly non-existent, so here goes the romance! I've always believed models shouldn't act, and Rosie is no exception. Her acting is extremely wooden (sorry, this is the only word that I could come up with that really sums it up), and the character is sort of unnecessary; all she does is whine and call for help. Literally!<br/><br/>Another thing I wasn't too fond of was the plot; it was awfully unrealistic. I know- giant robots are not realistic either, but the plot contradicts every physics law I ever studied! A few examples to prove my point:<br/><br/>1) Metals tend to self destruct when coming into contact with moon soil as it's highly corrosive.<br/><br/>2) There isn't a dark side of the moon, as the moon rotates around its axis. And sunlight reaches the moon's different areas.<br/><br/>3) Humans are not invincible! Sam would have died a million times if any of this happened in real life; when a bomb explodes in the office cubicle next to were a man is standing, normally he would die (or at least get injured somehow, like a burn for example).<br/><br/>I could list many more, but I think you got the point.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the movie. The plot is pointless but it's loads of fun! The movie is action packed and absolutely entertaining! Plus, it has one of the best soundtracks I've heard for a while."

If you want every film you watch, to have in-depth development of realistic characters dealing with emotional themes, or to have the intro, mid and final sequence to be in accordance with your idea of 'film-making' and not the director's, or to judge the director's work based on prejudices from previous works, or to have an impeccable storytelling, script, narrative, plot, dialogue, timings, chemistry between the lead roles, cinematography, and the likes, you're better of staying the f...(far) out of here.

For the men out there (and perhaps some ladies?), there is also some eye-candy. Let me put it this way, it is called eye-candy for a reason; do we really care if she lacks charisma?, or do we care if there's no chemistry between her and the lead man?, or do we care if ""she's be better off in underwear commercials""? I certainly don't care. I you, for some reason do care about that, then you're one of the aforementioned individuals and my advice is to get the f...(friendly) out of here. <br/><br/>This movie is worth your money and time, and furthermore I'd go ahead and tell you that afterward you won't feel disappointed that we didn't achieve world piece or we didn't discover the origin of the universe.

Maybe he was trying to be heard over the non-stop music and action. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) shouts a lot as well. Sam's new love interest Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is there to be the damsel in distress. Although her accent is out of place, Director Michael Bay does a fine job showcasing her beauty utilizing a variety of wardrobes and backdrops. Tyrese Gibson is featured prominently in the action scenes along with Lester Speight (of Office Linebacker Terry Tate fame). The soldiers seemed to have a greater role in the outcome of this film rather than the previous two.<br/><br/>There are frequent attempts at comic relief from both the robots and the humans, most of which are not funny but at least are entertaining. For the characters that we already know from the first two films, we get more of the same. Sam's parents are less obnoxious this time (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) as is Seymour Simmons (John Turturro). But many of the new characters (played by some veteran actors) were there to ham things up. I don't think any of these guys were necessarily bad, as they succeeded in keeping us occupied until the battles took place. <br/><br/>THE ROBOTS:<br/><br/>In one corner we have The Decepticons who are tough foes once again, this time their heavy hitter is a gigantic snake-like robot that rips through buildings and streets. ""Spock"" does the voice of the powerful turncoat robot Sentinel Prime whose arm is like a sword and the beat-up looking Megatron is back to manipulate and scheme.<br/><br/>And for the reigning heavyweight champ Autobots, Optimus Prime reprises his role as the robot Rambo who comes in only for the final stages of the battles after his mates take their abuse.<br/><br/>Overall, this one was a little more entertaining then Revenge of the Fallen."

","OK so if you didn't like the last two transformers movies you aren't going to like this. but this is pure action entertainment and just the kind of movie people like to see at the cinema this time of year.<br/><br/>as most people know megan fox was replaced by rosie huntington-whitely and although this seems a little odd at first it doesn't really matter because all we really care about is the autobots and decepticons ripping and shooting the crap out of each other. <br/><br/>the second half of the movie has this almost none-stop with explosions after explosions and amazing slow-motion shots, such as one where bumblebee is driving on the motorway with sam and his girl when he suddenly transforms, throwing them in the air to avoid something that slips my mind, and then catches them again as he changes back into vehicle mode. the film is litered with these kind of epic moments and you have to see them on the big screen to fully appreciate them.<br/><br/>the story is quite decent, playing on the space race of the 60's where man first went to the moon. the plot surrounds a mystery space craft that crashed there and when the bots learn of its existence they race to get to it and its secrets, while sam witwicky tries to find purpose in his life.<br/><br/>all in all i give this a good 8/10 as it was a thoroughly enjoyable cinema experience and i hope for another entry in the series which im sure will happen if this is as successful financially as the second & first films."

","Here's the thing, you don't go into a movie like this expecting to see ""The Kings Speech"" because you will be horribly disappointed if you set that kind of standard for a summer blockbuster movie. It recent years I have stop reading a lot of critics because it seems they have forgotten sometimes you just need to not analyze so much and just sit back and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third movie installment in this franchise and surprisingly, almost as good as the first one. After ""Revenge of the Fallen"" it seemed this franchise was doomed, and I didn't want to see this one at first but a few buddies informed me it was actually good, so I decided to give it a chance.<br/><br/>A half hour in or so it seemed this movie wasn't going anywhere and the plot seemed as thin as before but then it all starts up. To say this is an action movie is almost an understatement, since during the last hour or so it's hard to find a scene where something is not blowing up or crashing or being shot at. However contrary to what other critics have said it wasn't an insult to the ears.<br/><br/>The plot that can be a little hard to follow at times with all the mindless violence, but it doesn't really matter it's not that complicated. Even though I will say this time the plot is far more fun to watch and easier to understand then the convoluted ""Revenge of the Fallen"".<br/><br/>I would like to talk about the acting in this movie but there really isn't any. It's hard to act while literally everything is blowing up around you and people just keep yelling things. There are some nice one-liners though.<br/><br/>As a director Michael Bay is known for mindless action movies and sometimes he fails and sometimes as with this one he succeeds. Some of the statements above may seem to be denouncing this film but there really not, since like I said at the beginning you just have to sit back and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>Side note: I've seen 3 movies in the last couple weeks which is more movies that I've seen in theaters in months. 2 of which I saw in 3D (Captain America and the last Harry Potter movie). I didn't feel like spending the extra money to see this in 3D and I think I made the wise choice. The Colors seemed brighter and even thought this is the lesser of the 3 movies I would almost want to say I had a better experience in this one."
"polishsoccerfan","Null","0","2","24 July 2011"," If you are looking for a REAL STORYLINE and the title has to include: Transformers this is for you
","Okay,let me get started. The first thing I'd like to mention, is that it's hard to believe it's actually a Michael Bay movie (Yes, I've had the unfortunate pleasure and the time to waste for one Bay movie after another), which I'm sure was a surprise to most of the others reviewing this movie as it is not as overdone as some of his others (The Island and I am Number Four just to include the worst). The main thing I would like to talk about is the fact that this is the best Transformers movie of the 3. This isn't the one I'd choose to watch over and over (Mostly because I've already seen it 3 times, but also because I liked the action and humour in the 2nd). Okay, back to the main topic. The reason this third movie in the Transformers series is the best of the three is simple. It has a storyline remarkably. Yes, you heard it here, a storyline, and not only a storyline but an immersive one. The story starts out pretty simple. You are introduced to the Apollo 11 mission in 1972 where the astronauts are examining the crashed ship: ""The Ark"" piloted by Sentinel Prime and return to Earth. Sam Whitwicky (Shia LeBeouf) has dumped Mikaela Banes (Mhegan Fox) and found a new girlfriend Carley Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) going to job interviews looking for a job 'where he matters'. Meanwhile, Bumblebee and the other autobots are fighting crime as usual until they stumble across The Ark's Engine Part in Chernobyl. Optimus gets mad, blah blah, blah, they go to the moon, return with Sentinel, Sam gets a job and meets Carley's boss (Making him jealous). Okay, here's where it gets interesting. it turns out that Megatron actually arranged a plan to set up the Autobots into finding Sentinel and reviving him (Optimus is the only one who could) and retrieve the last 5 pillars (Of 100's which are used to pull Cybertron into the atmosphere of Earth). I like this as it actually shows some depth into the story. There are a lot of twists actually like how Carley's boss is actually allied with the Decepticons and kidnaps Carley (which makes Sam venture off in the first place). Ultimately, Optimus kills Sentinel and Megatron and Saves the world (Yay). This movie has very much action as expected and some ill tasted humour but other than that, I don't see how you could wrong with this movie. (I still prefer the 2nd one slightly) P.S. If you are actually reading this, You just wasted idk 5 minutes but also if you think I'm a Micheal Bay basher or you are strongly affiliated with Mr. Bay, I did in fact enjoy The Island and also Armageddon (One of My dads favs)."

","There's only one way to put this...<br/><br/>These Michael Bay Transformers movies are a triumph of special effects over substance and common sense, and once you're used to them, it's almost criminal how easily these movies are forgotten.<br/><br/>I give Dark of the Moon 7 out of 10 if just because of how much a sucker I am for these effects. If you're not big on this sort of thing, but instead prefer details such as a coherent plot, comedy that's not adolescent in nature and a well-paced story, you can drop that number dramatically.<br/><br/>It's all subjective, and it depends what you like, but I'm only a fan because I like seeing big robots beat the crap out of each other.

"FanPerspective","Null","0","2","20 July 2011"," An incredible finale in 3-D!
","While many did not like Michael Bay's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Bay, himself, included), I really enjoyed the film. But, for those who didn't, despite what critics had to say, you will love this dark and action-packed finale to this amazing trilogy! In the fashion of the previous two films, Dark of the Moon takes a turn at giving history a little rewrite. This time with the explanation of the big space race in 1969. It turns out that we actually ventured to the moon to explore an alien spacecraft that had crashed landed there, unaware that it belonged to the Autobots. Years later when Optimus Prime learns of its existence, he retrieves the precious cargo and returns it to Earth, in hopes to keep it safe and away from the Decepticons.<br/><br/>I saw this film twice in theaters and it is just everything you could hope for in the final better and more! Of course, in true Michael Bay style, there are a lot of explosions and much destruction, but also there is a solid storyline that features a brilliant and totally unexpected twist! This film definitely took a darker turn compared to the others, and I dare say that it is the best of them! It did feel a bit off having Megan Fox gone, but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was able to come in and give her character life that aided into the masterfully crafted story. Along with the returning cast, a few other new editions were added, such as the wonderful John Malkovich and Frances McDormand! We also were introduced to some awesome new Transformers, which included my personal favorite, Shockwave, who was able to branch out into this mechanical snake-like creature.<br/><br/>It's sad to think that the end came so quickly, but it couldn't have ended more perfectly! It's just an exciting ride that is packed with action, explosions, laughs, twists and turns, and heart. Not to mention that while most films gain nothing extra from being in 3-D (except for $3 more from your wallet), this movie was what the 3-D technology was made for! It was just spectacular.. especially during the action sequences (which were aplenty)!"

","The popularity of the Transformers movies is very strong around the world at the moment. Being one of those people who grew up with the action figures and animated series it has been exciting to watch the movies so far with the first of the franchise films being created in 2007. Perhaps the Revenge of the Fallen (2009) was not as successful as the first instalment of the Transformers however, the release of the Dark of the Moon looks to already be impressing with the Transformers Craze well and truly alive.<br/><br/>If that alone doesn't convince you that the craze is here, then perhaps a website dedicated to showing off all things transformers around the world that people own or make will, at www.thetransformerscrazy.com you will be shown how crazy this craze really is. Making her spectacular film debut is the gorgeous UK model Rosie Huntington Whiteley, as Carly, Sam Witwicky's girlfriend, who has turned out to be the perfect replacement for Megan Fox. The plot picks up with Sam being unemployed and fresh out of college finding that he has to prove his place in the world. Sam struggles to show what he has so far done to save the world due to the government silence agreements and continues to try and prove his significance.<br/><br/>Although the plot is quite basic it at least has a plot around all that action. The first manned mission to the moon was revealed to be in relation to the alien spaceship that had crash-landed on the surface. The Arc as it is known belonged to the sentient machines known as the Autobots, who are working for the US government as peacekeeping mercenaries .The contents of The Arc, possessed the power to allow the Autobots and Optimus prime to defeat the evil Decepticons.<br/><br/>Sam and the Autobots set out on a mission to revive and rescue Sentinel Prime. The evil Megatron and the Decepticons become a threat wreaking havoc. The plot could have been thought out a little better, however the action made up for what the plot lacked. As can be seen from the trailer the action makes it a worthwhile movie not to mention Rosie Huntington Whiteley playing the perfect girlfriend.<br/><br/>The visual effects and sound design are the best that I have seen in a while it has to be said and technically speaking has to be rated as the best this year. For any transformers fan a must see and for those who are not still entertaining!"

The viewer quickly forgets about Sam's life as he struggles to find a job and his girlfriend leaves him. The viewer forgets soon enough why the decepticons are on earth, but in the end, a short recall aids the viewer.<br/><br/>It is certainly an action packed film which is enough for me. Since I was a kid, I remember the Transformer toys and these Transformer movies make it just so much more exciting. The special effects that are employed in the film are excellent. The sound is outstanding as well as it engulfs the viewer in this fictional world where the human race is at peril.<br/><br/>Most people out there enjoy having a film where the human race is in danger of extinction and this one does not come short. <br/><br/>From the beginning to the end of the film I was at the edge of my seat waiting for more and more battles. <br/><br/>Friends of mine thought it was endless as the movie expends over 2 hours in length, and I'm afraid I do have to agree with this. <br/><br/>Other than that, I thought that it was a very well done movie as all the other Transformer ones in the past."

","Shia LaBeouf is now attempting to find a career after college graduation with little luck. However, all is not so dark and bleak as he has found a new love (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and the world appears safe from those dreaded Decepticons. But things can change quickly as an Autobot spacecraft which was first discovered in the 1960s, becomes a point of interest for all robotic protagonists and antagonists involved. ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" sizzles in its set-up and its plot development early with a vibrant energy and excitement from its highly likable cast (which even includes stand-outs like Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Ken Jeong), but is steadily destroyed by the titled characters. As the clock ticks and the running time becomes astronomical (running nearly 160 minutes) the movie begins to lose its wheels with an unending finale which literally takes up about an hour of the movie's running time. The ""Transformers"" series continues to deliver what it promises---sleek cars, sleeker women, and tons of chaotic noise and visuals. In the end though, the complexities of the human performers always seem to take a backseat to the titled weapons of mass destruction. Director Michael Bay seems to overlook and sacrifice legitimate premises and possibly interesting outcomes in favor of confusing and over-wrought visual effects which ultimately do very little to advance the effectiveness which potentially could have developed within. Sometimes less is more and I do not think it could be more prevalent, cinematically speaking, than in this particular movie franchise. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

The thing that made this film work was that it actually had a plot and the fighting had some reason, unlike the second one. I loved the whole involvement of the moon and space adventure. Some of the action sequences were immense, the stunts were amazing, out of this world. The action was really fun and kept you watching right till the end. Don't expect Oscar worthy acting or scriptwriting but since when does an action film have real substance in acting, not a bad thing but just fact. The new girl was OK, however by her character there were some moments where women were painted in a negative light. Also there were some glitches in the language which was not appropriate and also the couple of sexual references were inappropriate, not explicit but heavily implicated.

Megatron does absolutely nothing throughout the whole film until right at the end, and even that was a let down.

Starscream does nothing, but then he never did anything anyway. I'm not even going to mention Patrick Dempsey. But the biggest let down is with the movies main villain ""Sentinel Prime"". Basically he is Optimus' predecessor but he changed sides to the decepticons and made a deal with Megatron to bring life back to their home planet Cybertron. This is the driving element of the movie, but there are many plot holes from this. Early in the film Optimus basically says he wants to make Sentinel Prime leader of the autobots again, and offers him the matrix (an item that brings dead transformers back to life) but Sentinel Prime declines. Then he changes sides. Why did he decline taking the matrix? it would in definitely be a help in his ploy.

","If your seeking a film with an impeccable story, great plot and progressive character development..... this is definitely NOT that sort of film. Then again if you aren't aware of Micheal Bay's reputation of an all action and special effects based style of direction than you probably don't go to the movies a whole lot. That being said it is in my opinion that this film is nothing short of brilliant. Micheal Bays days of shooting car advertisements have really paid off in these three films and in particular this last installment of the trilogy (Transformers: Dark of the moon). The film lives up to everything I expected, the special effects are amazing, the action is fantastic the Computer Generated Imagery is perfect and to even add onto that the 3D experience is just incredible. I actually think I appreciated the film a lot more watching it in 3D. Like in particular the scenes where Shockwave's pet mechanical leech rips through the commercial buildings and the deployment of the airborne military troops in particular are quite astounding. Though as much as the action was fantastic and nail biting at times. The story is pretty simple and predictable as you would expect. I don't care though, I don't need story for a bunch of robots, just as long as their motives justify their means to blow $%*# up, I'll be happy to watch it to see what happens. <br/><br/>So that being said do me a favor and grab an energy drink and head on down to your local cinema and buy a 3d ticket for transformers.Its one of the only 3D films out that will get you the experience you would be expecting and if your not to keen on an all action based film than its probably time to watch ""The Departed"" again"

","Shia Labeouf is back in Transformers: Dark of the moon, a film that I didn't quite understand but I still enjoyed it to some extent. Unlike its predecessor, the third film takes the time to tell a bit of story, until the last hour which kind of goes out the window.<br/><br/>Its been 2 years since Sam(Shia Labeouf) has had to deal with these damn robots. Since then, hes graduated from college, and has gotten a new girlfriend(Rosie Hunnington Whitely, who isn't as hot as Megan Fox but has a bigger role). But, this of course can't last long. Because at his new job, a transformer attacks and some other things happen, and one thing leads to another, and there is an hour long battle.<br/><br/>I know there is a plot somewhere, I just couldn't follow. And I understood Inception, so thats saying something. But unlike last time, Bay takes the time to tell a plot for a good hour and a half, until the last battle, which he takes time for the cool action sequences. The humans are the main reason to see this though. This has a great cast, which features Frances McDormand as a government agent, and John Malkovich as Sam's boss, and Patrick Dempsey (spoiler) as the villain.<br/><br/>If only Dark of the moon didn't drag on for so long. I may be giving it a slightly higher rating. Its not that bad, especially compared to the sequel, which sucked major ass. Bay should really close his trilogy here before its too late.

Two years ago when I saw revenge of the fallen, I fell asleep towards the end b/c honestly..........it sucked. When I saw dark of the moon last week in IMAX 3D it amazed me in so many different ways. First of all, The 3D was superior to the degree that some scenes felt uncomfortably realistic. The 3d in DOTM beats any other 3d film I have seen in the past. I don't like to exaggerate, but it may have been up to the level of avatar 3D-wise. Second of all, SFX was superb, much better than the past two. My jaw literally dropped about five times during the intense scenes, especially the ones toward the end. And finally the robots were so human-like that it was shocking. Truth to be told, some of the robots have better acting skills than Shia's new love, Rosie-Huntington Whiteley :p.

","Alright-- First transformers: Love it. Second One: Heavily Flawed, but still fun for me. I'm sorry. I like it. I've watched it many times thinking it wouldn't hold up. It still does.<br/><br/>I'll start with the good: Plenty of great action scenes involving humans and Robots alike with just about everyone getting there own bad ass moment. Bay is great at directing action. The plot, while thin and similar to the other films, had enough twists and turns and mystery to keep me invested. There are even a couple of big reveals that I liked. The acting is competent, though it does stray with some and I even got some laughs. I also liked the new girl, despite the Liv Tyler lips. I also like that John Tuturo's character wasn't all that annoying in this one. Even Lebouf's parents were used to a small degree in this one, and weren't quite as annoying, except for one overly-vulgar joke.<br/><br/>Now for the bad, the part most will probably want to love: I said I liked the new girl, but I liked Megan Fox's character a bit better. Fox's character did more in the other films. This girl is pretty much a damsel in distress the whole time. Another big problem is that Shockwave is deemed as the film's main villain on the IMDb pages. He ain't. He may as well not have been named. He has no real dialogue and probably fired his gun once. Another false point is that the cameos by Ken Jeong and John Malcovich. Malchovich serves no purpose and his last couple of scenes should have been deleted. Jeong is just annoying and I was so relieved when his character died. No real spoiler there. There is also some really bad attempts at humor in there, too. The only other bad thing I can name is that we spend too much time with people. I let it slip with the first 2, but this time was too much. We needed a few more scenes with Robots at this point."

","Dark of the Moon is by no means the second coming of generation 1 Transformers, but it is the best of the three live action Transformers films. It also has a good solid story. The use of Sentinel Prime as the main villain is a nice touch as he is an Autobot who is suppose to be one of the good guys. Some people will complain there was too much focus on the humans, but the cost of CGI would have been through the roof if the film only featured the robots. Featuring people does give Transformers a sense of wonder, so the use of human characters is necessary. 2007's Transformers did not live up to my expectations. Revenge of the Fallen was better that the 2007 film despite its flaws. Dark of the Moon shows just how good a live action Transformers film can be."

","I just saw the film last night with my girlfriend. We both liked the film, but it was just a bit too long. I'm not going to try to ""nitpick"" but I wanted to cover some major things that stood out for me.<br/><br/>I was having a difficult time understanding where the movie was taking place until they ended up in Chicago. It jumps all over the place - just like the Transformers.<br/><br/>Let's being with a big point that many people cover - Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Quite honestly, she could have been left out of the film totally. Not only was her ""acting"" bad, but she really provides nothing for the story other than eye candy. I can't stand the shots where it's just the camera panning up and down her body, up her skirt, etc. And what is it with having to have plump lips? It looks so unnatural. She never gets dirty or gets any cuts either, just like her predecessor.<br/><br/>Sam's parents provide some humor, but could have been left out as well. They were used as filler to extend the duration of this film. I guess they leave the city at some point? I don't know, it's never really brought up again.<br/><br/>I thought it was cool that Leonard Nimoy provided the voice for Sentinel Prime. Being a Trek fan, I noticed the nods to him and Star Trek throughout the film (one is blatantly obvious for those who have seen the Wrath of Khan). I know he provided some voice acting for the cartoon series as well.<br/><br/>There are many action shots that I had a hard time deciphering what exactly was going on. I knew two robots were going at it, but I couldn't tell what they were doing. It was just shots of jumbled metal with eventually a robot head dropping to the ground, with ""robot guts"" (yes, the transformers now bleed and have guts now). There are also many ""slow motion"" punches, stabs, decapitations, etc. It seems like no happy medium could be found for the pace of these action shots - they are either too fast to know what exactly is happening, or too slow that the point is engraved into your brain.<br/><br/>***BIG SPOILERS ALERT*** The ending - it just seemed way too abrupt for me. In a span of about 5 minutes, Optimus loses his arm to Sentinel, Megatron (who is wasted in this film) kills Sentinel, Optimus decapitates Megatron, Bumblebee hums ""Here Comes the Bride,"" Optimus gives another speech and the ending credits roll. My thought once the credits came up was like, ""Whoa! That was quick."" It was almost as if they were only given a set time limit to cram all of that in or they thought ""Gee, we better wrap this franchise up."" I'm guessing that this is the final installment of the Transformers movie series (unless they decide to reboot it, like they do with everything). I thought it was better than the second film (no overkill with testicle/ball references). I still think the first film is probably the best out of the bunch. Dark of the Moon is darker and gives off an apocalyptic vibe for the ending half. Most who have seen the previous films will go see this one. People who absolutely love the ""Michael Bay formula"" (meaning T&A, explosions, CGI and erratic camera work) of movies will love this. It's not bad, but it's not great either."
"MF210","Null","0","2","13 July 2011"," An improvement over 'Fallen' but well short of the first film
","My Rating: **1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Spoilers <br/><br/>As far as summer blockbusters go, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is adequate but underwhelming. While a big improvement over it's predecessor, Revenge of the Fallen, which was stupid even by director Michael Bay's standards, Dark of the Moon is no better than mediocre. There's a lot of flash here but for a film that's over two and a half hours you need more than that and Dark of the Moon is pretty hollow. <br/><br/>When the first Transformers came out it provided eye-popping special effects with spectacular, though at times a little hectic, actions scenes and it did present characters you could at least identify with and care about. It wasn't a deep film by any means but it didn't pretend to be. Unfortunately, spectacular visuals and action scenes with a dumb plot only worked for one film. The two sequels are ridiculously too long and the cuts are so fast during the action that you have no idea what's going on, and by the end you don't even care. <br/><br/>To be fair, Dark of the Moon is not a terrible film, it even has some merits. I really liked how Bay took a real historical event like the moon landing and injected the Transformers into it. I had reservations about this when I saw the first trailer but really it's done quite well and we even get a compelling reason why another man has not set foot on the moon in over forty years. This was also done in this Summer's far superior X-Men: First Class, which used the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also, it's interesting that Sentimel Prime, an Autobot, is the villain of the film. This makes the Decepticons no more than a foot note but it is at least an interesting approach. <br/><br/>For about 90 minutes, Dark of the Moon is entertaining enough. The visuals are still spectacular (never a problem with this franchise) and things move fairly quickly. I can honestly say I did not expect to see Sentinel Prime join with the Decepticons so that was a nice unexpected turn. However, there is still another hour to go and those 60 minutes feel like an eternity! The action isn't compelling and it's so drawn out that you're just aching to leave, but you spent $15 and want to stick it out to the bitter end.<br/><br/>One final complaint; I don't like 3-D. Michael Bay decided he would to do Dark of the Moon in 3-D and it was a mistake. It's hard on the eyes and does nothing to enhance the cinematic experience. Unfortunately, moviegoers are going to have to put up with this nuisance more and more in action films so we're stuck with it.<br/><br/>If all you're interested in is great visuals and some mindless action, give Transformers: Dark of the Moon a shot. It wasn't worth the $15 ticket, could've been an hour shorter, and better off without the 3-D, but while it maybe underwhelming it's not a terrible film. Still, if you're anybody but a die-hard Transformers fan I'd wait for DVD."
"rory-d-phillips","8","0","2","11 July 2011"," good movie.
","this was a good film. it was as action packed as the original transformers movie. there were very few plot holes and director Michael bay has done a superb job of making you hold on to the edge of your seat through the entirety of this 2 hour 40 extravaganza. however, the one thing that has made me dislike this film is the underdevelopment of new characters, coupled with a feeling that writer(Ehren Kruger) will not make this the last transformers film, marred my initial feeling about the film. the fact that in the entire movie around 95% of the film is dedicated to Sam Witwicky makes me feel that this movie should not be called transformers: dark side of the moon. but should be called, the adventures of Sam Witwicky: decepticons return? overall if you are like 99% of the Australian population and just want to see the movie for the huge explosions and do not care about the storyline in the slightest, the by all means this will be a good movie for you."
"tjfrye-970-903996","Null","0","2","11 July 2011"," Entertaining movie, but every entertaining movie comes at a price. A price of clichés and stereotypes beyond insanity.
","Okay, to start this off I grew up with transformers toys and the whole TV series and i was infatuated with it, but that does not mean i will be biased with this review. My childhood with the series can be put aside (for the most part) for this review. I am going to start by saying that I went into this movie with absolutely no expectations. I had already seen the previous two Michael Bay movies. The first one was alright, and the second one...well lets not be coy here it was crap for the most part. Going into this movie with an open mind allowed me to really breathe in the whole essence. I was able to enjoy the moments that were truly enjoyable, and question what was...not enjoyable. Like many Michael Bay movies this has his trademark stamped all over it -loud action -S**t ton of explosions -hot babes -long drawn out climaxes usually involving you guessed it...more action and hot babes In a short synopsis it's a stereotypical summer blockbuster, and a stereotypical guy movie. It's got all the testosterone induced fight scenes an adrenaline junky could ever ask for. Like all action movies that have great action, this movie does have major set backs. The movie starts off at a good pace delving into the back story of the cybertronian war and what happened off screen to help catch any new comers to the series right up. but then the nice pacing all of a sudden gets interrupted whenever the focus of the scenes change from the focus on the auto-bots trying to get to the moon and what-not. It interrupts the pacing of the movie from something serious that almost delves the viewer into the urgency....to scenes of a total schmuck just trying to get a job and live life as an every day jack off. *WARNING SPOILERS STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MAJOR TWIST OF THE MOVIE RUINDED...well if you can even call it a twist* I felt that when they had Setinel Prime betray the auto-bots it was kind of unnecessary (although it does make for a very tense and blood pumping climax when optimus whoops his ass in the end). Setinel was Optimus's teacher and one of the leader of the auto-bots, he was like a leader to everyone, and obviously almost even a father figure to optimus. I just found it somewhat odd when he betrayed everything that he had just so he could rebuild cybertron, and most importantly rebuild cybertron under the tyrannical rule that he once fought against. But contrary to this stand point, I could always just be over critical of this and be over analyzing something that really doesn't matter, so excuse me if you find that as the case. Another problem with the movie was the length of the film. For a standard action movie you're looking at the film to be around two hours or so (give or take a half hour) as the run time, but for Dark of the Moon it was roughly almost three hours. And none of the action even happens till the last half of the movie, so what you're left is this back story in the beginning constantly interrupted by a dick head looking for a job (btw john malkovich...pretty funny as usual) as the first half, it's all cluttered up and it's confusing as hell. And then for the last half you have literally all action with little to no scenes of relief, it's all just intense action that they expect you to be interested by because of the back story...but you can't really be interested because of all the mixed up change of focus in the introduction. Anyways to sum it up, it's not a great movie, it has a ton of flaws and it has every stereotype an action movie (let alone any movie of the modern era) has to offer......but it's still entertaining as hell. As a normal movie critic i can only give this an 6 out of ten......but contrary to that from my standpoint of loving transformers and having this be one kick ass film this is a 10 out of 10 on the bad ass scale -FryeGuy"
"gunflyer","8","0","2","11 July 2011"," Improved where it needed to, and that's all I was asking for
","A LOT of people have really gone off the deep end with their critical reviews. Honestly, Dark of the moon, and all the Transformers movies for that matter could have been so much more, so much better. There's no denying that at all! At this point though, we knew what to expect walking in, I knew what to expect walking in. Honestly, I liked this movie. I enjoyed the big dumb action, because even as bad as the Transformers movies have gotten, they still have giant robot wars, and for me, that trumps movies about Boy Wizards or typical action films. What is important is that there isn't just a marginal improvement over revenge of the fallen in this movie, there is a huge improvement over that film. The story is far better, the characters have more to do. The ONLY real complaint I can agree with is that there needed to be some more scenes removed from this film. Seriously, this movie could have done with 15-20 minutes worth of editing.<br/><br/>When the problem in your movie amounts to a lack of editing, I have really got to ask about the basis for all the complaining. A lot of people also apparently take Star Trek too seriously because of a certain line Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime said in this film. Guys, I'm like a hardcore Trekkie, and even I don't care! Star Trek is great, but to take it that seriously, like even WAY more seriously than I do is complete bullshit.<br/><br/>So no, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that Transformers Dark of the moon didn't have problems, it did, but in my opinion the faults from ROTF have improved SO much in this movie that any problems can be easily overlooked in my opinion.<br/><br/>Dark of the moon is an enjoyable action film, and to be fair it's not nearly as bad as some overwrought critics have said it is."
"stevemsands","7","0","2","11 July 2011"," Not for the over thinkers
","To Start, I loved the first transformers movie. I thought it was a very well done popcorn flick and it held my interest. I walked into Transformers 2 with semi-decent expectations and walked out of the theater angry that I just wasted 10$ to see what basically amounted to a half baked attempt at a cash grab. I had very low expectations walking into this one. Maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much. <br/><br/>Actors: The loss of Meghan Fox is a huge plus in the movie's favor. The new girl was alright, not amazing, bu she did a passable job. There were no Oscar performances in this movie, but you didn't buy the your ticket for an Oscar performance. If for some reason you did well god help you. The actors were passable, and, in my opinion, did not drag down the movie. the voice acting for the transformers was good too, again nothing amazing here so lets move on.<br/><br/>Story: Yes, you could examine the continuity and ask why didn't Megatron attempt to retrieve the pillars in the first movie since apparently that was the overall plan? You could question how his film is attached to the other two (other than the returning characters). I'll admit this movie does suffer from some continuity issues. That is the problem when a movie is made without planning for the sequels in the beginning; the writers are forced to make an attempt to connect the stories. Without taking into account the other two movies, the story is decent in here, and (as I've been wishing for since the first transformers)the series finally takes a dark turn. In the past movies it never seemed like human civilians were truly harmed. It was implied that people were being killed in the battles, but it really felt like Michael Bay was avoiding the idea. Not in this one. Mr. Bay did not hold back in the last hour and many, many people were killed. The slapstick comedy does return but for the most part it was actually funny and not annoying this time. At the end of the day, the plot was good enough to hold my attention to the end unlike Transformers 2: ROTF's sloppily thrown together story.<br/><br/>Action: Here's where this movie made up for it's faults. This is the reason you bought your ticket, and Michael Bay did not falter here. This is hands down some of the best CGI/Action I've ever seen in a movie. Trust me when I say the last hour was worth the price of admission. Just turn your brain off and enjoy this movie for what it is and you will walk out satisfied. Epic action, intense fights, huge explosions. Enough said<br/><br/>Overall: People. Stop criticizing every detail. Its a movie about giant robots that transform into cars. What do you expect? Turn your brain off. Enjoy the action. If that doesn't sound like your kind of movie, then go see something else."
"Jimofthenorth","7","0","2","11 July 2011"," Erm...
","I would very much like to do a poo on this movie. It adds to the proof that Hollywood is purely a business, obsessed with making money rather than pushing cinematic boundaries. Yes, the special effects were good - I was fortunate to go see this in 3D at an IMAX cinema. But the effects were not a great deal better than the first or second Transformers movies. It was just more of the same. A great deal of the world also appears to be in mourning over the removal of Megan Fox from the franchise. Yet her replacement was just as attractive and lacked the same amount of acting ability to make her equally as cringe-worthy throughout. And the potential for a higher class of acting was completely wasted by Bay as he reduced the likes of John Malkovich and Frances McDormand to mere extras. I would also have liked to see less of Dr McDreamy running around with his pointless twist in the story, and more of Laserbeak slapping him across the eyes. <br/><br/>BUT... I enjoyed it. Despite being a married family man, there is still a part of me that would like to take a day off work so I can go home and play with Lego. For that reason, Transformers 3 put a big smile on my face. I wasn't expecting The King's Speech. I wanted them to blow stuff up and do some car chases. And I felt like I'd got my money's worth (IMAX is chuffing expensive...). It didn't matter that the producers thought that all you need to do to make a scene emotional is to pipe in some soppy Linkin Park tune. It didn't matter that they went all Team America on us. At the end of the day, the CGI still blew me away, the action was glorious and Rosie whatsername was fit."
"Meven_Stoffat","6","0","2","10 July 2011"," Great action, awesome special effects, hot chick, but messy storyline
","I will start this review by stating that I was not a fan if the previous entry in the series. OK let's be honest here: I hated it. And I really really hated it. Hated it so much at it left me wondering how a movie about gigantic Robots fighting could be so boring. Hell, you know a movie really sucks when even the director himself admits it sucks. So with that said, I was nervous when the announcement of a third Trannys movie had occurred. <br/><br/>Well for the most part, this review is full of compliments, but unfortunately, those compliments are for the technical stuff, and the acting.<br/><br/>The storyline is not as confusing as ROTF, but it still is quite messy. 2 years after the events that took place in Revenge of the Fallen, Sam has a new girlfriend, a smoking hit British gal Named Carly, who used to work for the British embassy and now works at a Vintage car dealership with a creepy and obsessive boss (played cleverly by Patrick Dempsey). Sam gets a job at an office building, and his parents have came to DC to visit.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Autobots find new enemies at hand: Soundwave, and Laserbeak, and even more so- a piece from a deception has been found while they were on mission in the Ukraine. This leads to the discovery of the fact that the 1969 Space Race was in response to the crashing of an Autobot on the dark side of the moon, Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). Suddenly, things get out of hand when Optimus unknowingly sets off a war, causing Sentinel to betray Optimus by working for the Decepticons and begin t use Earth as a source of renewal for Cybertron, making our future look bleak.<br/><br/>Is your head hurting from reading the above two paragraphs? Don't worry, mine is hurting just from typing them (and on my iPad to boot).<br/><br/>The action is simply stellar. I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in the second movie, and so therefore a stationery camera and longer shots made it more easy to take. The finale lasts an hour long and boy does it rule. Some of the most spectacular action I have ever seen is in that hour, specifically the scene where they slide down the building. It is worth it to see the movie in 3D, specifically for one scene: The wing suit scene. I got vertigo from that scene because I am TERRIFIED of heights! <br/><br/>Admit it, you thought it would suck without Megan Fox. Well it actually is BETTER without that trashy gal. Rosie Huntington Whitely is so much hotter and way better at acting than Megan Fox. She can actually carry an emotion, unlike Fox. Furthermore Shia actually is great for once here, and he really shines. And boy, Leonard Nimoy stole the show! Live long and prosper, Sentinel! \\\\////<br/><br/>Now for the bad. The story. ""But that story doesn't sound messy!"" It might not, but watch the movie. I found myself asking who was on whose side. Furthermore, the movie simply is too long. They dragged it out for longer than they needed to, and the film could have had maybe 20 minutes trimmed from it. As well as Sam's parents UGGGGGHHHHHH. Also, is it just me or did the decepticons look all the same? It was hard to tell who was who because they looked too similar to each other. And Megatron should have had a bigger role. He literally is only in the movie for 5 minutes.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is better than it's predecessor but still flawed and not as good as Tranny 1. I would recommend it solely on the strength of the action.and do go see in 3D too."

","May contain spoilers, if you haven't seen this movie yet, then don't read it! I enjoyed the first two Transformers movies in the exact same way, but TF2 I have to admit was a bit confusing. It had nice special effects and all, but the story was really confusing.<br/><br/>When I heard that a third was in the works, I knew that this was one I couldn't miss. After a year and a bit of waiting, it finally came out. I had been keeping up to date with the latest news that were coming out of it.<br/><br/>On July 6th, I took my dad with me as a late Father's day present, mainly because we both went to Revenge of the Fallen. But the problem was that it was a school day, and I had finished college for the year, younger viewers got bored and decided to start running around to play tag and make noise. Despite this, we were able to watch the film.<br/><br/>After leaving the cinema, we had both agreed that the film was worth watching, even though we did enjoy TF2 (UNLIKE OTHERS). TF3 was a really big improvement. Even so we believe that more could have been done.<br/><br/>I have two negative things to say about this film. For a start: Sentinel Prime. After seeing his character in the trailer back in December (Even though I thought he was Ultra Magnus.) I was excited to see him and Optimus fighting side-by-side against decepticon aft. Instead, Sentinal was an absolute flop, Bay had ruined his character in making him work along side Megatron. Not to mention killing Ironhide.<br/><br/>I do however like his appearance, and his vehicle mode or an airport firetruck. I like his robot mode and how Bay made the decision to give his head a sort of Optimus Prime look as well as giving him a sort of beard to make him look much wiser and heroic.<br/><br/>The second problem I have with TF3 is this: WHERE THE HELL IS MEGATRON?! He's in the film, alright. But where is he most of the time? He is the leader of the Decepticons. Yet he only has 4 major appearances through out the film, 2nd and 3rd appearance being and hour apart. They ruined his villain status and gave it to Sentinel instead, making him 'Sentinels Bitch'. (Best line from the film!) Dad and I also agreed that unlike the first film, Megatron was way too easy to kill. In the first film, Sam used the Allspark to deactivate his spark, in this one, he was just standing there one second, then the next second Optimus ripped his head and spine off. (He died Predator style!) Other than that, I like how Micheal Bay had given Megatron an Earth mode now, he has a sort of Demented version of Optimus Prime's vehicle mode. I also like how he gave Megatron a sort of mask to hide the damage he received in the second film. So yeah, thats cool, even though I must admit I liked his Cybertronian mode better.<br/><br/>But I have a load more positive things I want to say. Most of them are to do with the special effects, lots of nice Micheal Bay explosions. I don't see what problems people have with him going over-the-top with explosions. Thats why I love his movies! My final result: 8/10, I liked it better than the first two, but I still believe they could have had more in it!"
"alexm37","Null","0","2","10 July 2011"," The Action is Ridiculous, the Plot....Well...
","Everyone knows Michael Bay basically makes movies to display incredible action scenes with CGI thrown in everywhere. South Park even has Bay in an episode to poke fun at his lack of ideas for an actual plot. That being said, guess what the new Transformers offers...?<br/><br/>If you guessed another action packed flick with not much else to offer, then you're correct.<br/><br/>Now I gave Dark of the Moon a 7 solely based on the fact that the fight scenes blew me away. Michael Bay is obviously good at one thing, and he shows it off in this one. The majority of the fighting takes place in downtown Chicago, and it was exciting to see how the action integrated with the layout of the city. Buildings are taken out left and right, glass shattering everywhere, pretty much complete chaos. <br/><br/>I can go on and on about the battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, but you kind of know what to expect there. What I got tired of was the unbelievably stupid plot. Almost every 5 or 10 minutes I was literally putting my hands in the air and saying, ""Are you serious?"" I'm not going to delve into the details, because I want you to go see the movie for yourself and see what I am talking about, but just know what you're getting into.<br/><br/>Several other reviews I read talk about how certain things in the movie were unrealistic. A few folks went on to complain about the way a machine crashing on the moon would create a different reaction. C'mon people, you've got to let some things slide. I accept the fact that it is a movie, but of course there are still certain issues you cannot look past. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed Dark of the Moon because I'm an action junkie. The fight sequences in this Transformers blow the other movies out of the water, but don't get your hopes up that all will make sense. Obvious flaws are abundant, but it's still worth the watch."

","A mysterious event from Earth's past at the time of the moon-race is kept from the Autobots.  It's a secret that now threatens to bring a war to Earth and the Transformers may not be able to save us.<br/><br/>The special effects have certainly been honed in this third instalment, it appears that with the right amount of money and talent you can achieve anything on screen. The action and locations are visually fantastic with great sound effects and music to match. The storyline is engaging especially for a film based on a Saturday morning cartoon made to push toys. <br/><br/>John Malkovich has a great time in a lengthy strange cameo (that didn't need an actor of his calibre) as Sam's boss but he's enjoyable in every scene and a welcome surprise. Megan Fox's replacement model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a fine addition, with a natural striking, quirky look. And while not a veteran actress she's more than adequate as the love interest. Josh Duhamel, John Turturro and Tyrese Gibson return. Both Patrick Dempsey and Shia LaBeouf are on form with the Witwicky character given a little more development and purpose. Sam's toilet encounter aside there's less forced humour in this instalment and at times some of the robot attacks are violent, possibly be fitting of a Terminator movie.  <br/><br/>Most notable robot characters are present. Key voice Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is back, and oddly the leader against his traits remorselessly goes 'postal' in the closing act. Leonard Nimoy voices Sentinel Prime who gets much of the dialogue and is the most interesting of the robot characters development wise. It's a pity that like the previous two films this one also lacks the rapport between the robot characters that the cartoon captured so well. It's a missed opportunity, there's little interaction between Starscream and Megatron (Hugo Weaving who is given little to do) and the Autobot's shenanigans, bouncing off each-other and camaraderie is missing.<br/><br/>It must be a blast for the new generation but for those who grew up with Transformers it still fails to capture or match the original magic. That said, it moves one step closer in the right direction. Michael Bay puts every buck on the screen with great compositions and flair. It's loud, it's spectacular and debatably the most satisfying, balanced and rounded of the three.<br/><br/>Considering its origin (based on a series of cartoon and toys) it's solid entertainment which is being overly analysed and unfairly panned."

","Michael Bay has more holes in his movies then you can possible imagine, i like detail, thats the way i am i just like stuff that makes sense as it follows its story line. every Michael Bay movie has big holes and the holes just get bigger. enough of that this is a FUN movie, lots of action, some drama and laughs. that girl who replaced Megan Fox is nice but i would of kept fox or gotten someone who could act. Megan would of been so much better for this film. over all its a good movie it surprised me and i think i want to see it again really soon. its actually one of the better films i seen this year. watch it, enjoy it and have fun. i hope they make a lot more of these"
"jboothmillard","6","0","4","9 July 2011"," Transformers: Dark of the Moon
","The first Transformers film was of course a brilliant display of special effects and action, the second film was terrible in comparison, and I saw that this next follow up was rated well, so I had to see it, from director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock). Basically the film opens with all the notable mission to the Moon, starting from 1961, and also in 1969, we find out that these missions were not simply to land on and explore the rock, but investigate a landed Cybertronian spacecraft, the Ark. Present day, the Autobots from the planet Cybertron, including Ironhide (Jess Harnellv), Barricade, Ratchet (Robert Foxworth), Sideswipe (James Remar), Bumblebee and leader Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), are working secretly alongside the military to help avoid large disasters around the world. The disasters they especially help deal with are the attacks on cities and officials by the Decipticons, including Starscream (Charles Adler), Shockwave (Frank Welker), Soundwave (also Welker), Leadfoot (Futurama's John Di Maggio) and leader Megatron (Hugo Weaving). The big story here is that from the Moon the astronauts discovered another robot inside the Ark, and the Autobots do not know it, but the Deceticons know that they will take the bait and try to revive this turned machine Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy). Sure enough, after Sentinel Prime has been awakened and seems like he is trying to help the effort in stopping the destruction of cities, he soon goes the opposite direction and joins the war with the Decepticons. The big plan for the villain robot army is to activate some hidden alien satellite style machines, launch them into space and destroy Chicago, and many cities afterwards, in order to turn Earth into another Cybertron like planet. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), recently working for annoying stuck up boss Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich), is obviously joining the effort with the Autobots and the army to try and stop them, as well as Lt. Colonel William Lennox (Win a Date with Tad Hamilton's Josh Duhamel), Simmons (Quiz Show's John Turturro), Epps (2 Fast 2 Furious's Tyrese Gibson) and Sam's new girlfriend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Charlotte Mearing (Frances McDormand) and Dylan (Patrick Dempsey), many with expertise, many just brave and ready to fight. Also starring Kevin Dunn as Ron Witwicky, Julie White as Judy Witwicky, The Hangover's Ken Jeong as Jerry Wang, Alan Tudyk as Dutch and Buzz Aldrin. LeBeouf is still reasonable, his new female co-star certainly looks the part but is nowhere near as watchable as Megan Fox (who had a feud with director Bay, she said he was like Hitler on set), and the supporting members all do their parts. Of course with the other two films the real stars are the robots and explosions, all achieved by the fantastic special effects, the story may be a little hard to follow at times, and I didn't fully feel it deserved four out of five stars, but it is certainly better than Revenge of the Fallen, and a watchable science-fiction action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects. Good!"
"kabu-1","8","0","2","8 July 2011"," Whoop ass Michael Bay style
","8 out of 10 because it was entertaining. Entertaining Michael Bay style. Lot of action...and action. And, wait for it.... some more action! <br/><br/>Yeah. So, there was a plot but how they pieced it all together was sorta clumsy. It's like there were too many different parts that were just forced together. And there were some editing mistakes or other stuff that didn't make that much sense. Like for example Optimus lost his trailer with his flygear on it and then some minutes later he just comes flying in and kicking some ass Optimus Prime style (yeah!) with his flygear (doh) on. I was like ""well OK... so he got his flygear..right"". Sorta felt like they should have shown that.<br/><br/>Anyhoo. There were some good things also. Like for example the bit with Bumblebee. It made me cry.. you'll see it then. That was a huge plus :) Emotional stuff is always good!<br/><br/>The new chick, wasn't that bad. Pretty decent considering she's a model and this was her first? time acting in a movie (or acting altogether?). To be fair, she didn't have to act much but the bits she did act, she acted pretty well.<br/><br/>What annoyed me was that ""badass bitch"" .. you'll know what i'm talking about when you go see it. And then too many lame jokes. Come on. The second Transformers had enough of those already but still you keep on going.. keep on throwing water into hot stones (you've heard of a sauna, right?). Oh yeah and then the music. ENOUGH WITH LINKIN PARK ALREADY! It's CRAP.<br/><br/>Still, despite of all that negative stuff, it was entertaining and since I wasn't expecting anything more than a huge amount of whoopass Autobot style and seeing how they destroy Chicago, I was happy with what I saw! Hence, 8 stars.<br/><br/>Michael Bay doesn't disappoint if you know what you're gonna get. He might even surprise you just a tiny bit, with huge ass explosions, and way too cool looking Transformers! IN 3D! (3D was better than before)<br/><br/>Oh and. Bumblebee and Optimus, i LOVE j00!"
"purely-nothing","7","0","2","8 July 2011"," It might not be a work of art but it's fun and thats all that should expected in the first place.
","Transformers has never been a series about good story or good acting. It's about having too many explosions, stupid jokes, the hottest girls I've ever seen bending over the nicest cars I've ever seen, and robots killing each other.<br/><br/>To think that it's anything other a fun movie is expecting too much and when the movie is 2 1/2 hours long you'll have a bad time if you're not going to overlook the fact that it's not the next Shawshank Redemption. Michael Bay is a director who people go to expecting explosions and action. In Transformers 3, you got it.<br/><br/>However, the fact that it's a very long movie does give it some downsides. The real action doesn't start until the second half of the movie following a real exciting twist. One of my friends even started crying at it. The second half though is without a doubt one of the coolest movie scenes I've seen in a couple years. I went with my girlfriend and we were talking about it with her dad and we suggested going into it half way through the movie if he wouldn't have the patience for the slow beginning. I thought they were going to end the movie at the twist at first and make it the sequel as the second half would've been a great movie on it's own.<br/><br/>Similarly the story is all over the place, I would suggest not paying too much attention to it as it wasn't very good, only complex and confusing. It's slow and mysterious at first and until the action picks up not a lot happens.<br/><br/>Give the movie your attention long enough to get to the second half and you'll see some amazing robot fighting action that's way cooler than anything I could've done with those cool toys. It's fun, it's cool, it's stupid. Don't let the fact that it isn't a perfect movie ruin the action. I would suggest seeing it in theater; it's just a great time."
"lekgolah","4","0","2","7 July 2011"," An improvement on the last film but then again the only way was up
","Having enjoyed the first film a lot (a good blend of action and comedy), I was greatly disappointed by the second film (too much bad comedy and barely any memorable action scenes) and was concerned how the third would turn out. It seems that Bay reduced some of painfully unfunny comical moments from the last and improves on the action however there are still some moments that take us back to ROTF reminding me that Bay still hasn't learned entirely from his previous mistakes.<br/><br/>There's no writer's strike to hind behind this time and Spielberg is back on the team so what stops this from being as good as the first one? The best answer that I can give is that the film feels too chaotic and messy in its storytelling for it to become truly enjoyable. There are some key plot points that are delivered either by crazy robots who are hard to understand or by human characters talking really fast while the camera is focusing on their skin molecules. If you are going to tell a story in a film aimed towards a young audience, speak clearly or as in this case, it turns into someone making a mess of a job interview by speaking too fast in an effort to cover up any holes in their presentation hoping that those listening will not notice. I know that the story isn't really worth worrying about but we deserve to have an understanding of what is going on.<br/><br/>Other issues include unnecessarily comedic moments such as Ken Jeong who should have been taken out of the script (but his scenes are pointless so maybe there was no script for him) as that could have allowed for more time to be spent trying to develop the Autobots. Thankfully that character has an abrupt ending that couldn't have come sooner. However the film does achieve at some points in being funny. Perhaps if the film had concentrated on being like the trailer i.e. being darker and focusing on the events at-hand it would have been so much better.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film never becomes too offensive unlike the last, making for an enjoyable final act as Chicago is destroyed. Amongst all the chaotic destruction that we have all seen before is an action set-piece set within a collapsing building that we keep you fixed to the screen. It has everything that Bay forgot to do with the rest of the film, which is that there is tension, there is a purpose to the scene, the build-up is great and you are actually concerned for how the characters will escape. If only there were more scenes like this one, which you actually care for!<br/><br/>Returning cast members (Shia, Sam's parents who are actually pretty good this time, Josh Duhamel and John Turturro) are all watchable. Meagan Fox's replacement may divide opinion but I found Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to fit in well amongst the rest of the film. John Malkovich is funny at first but his character soon feels more like a cameo. Ken Jeong was horrible to watch and nearly derailed the film. Patrick Dempsey was good at would he did but come the battle he had little to do. Frances McDormand played the cold government agent role well while Alan Tudyk was good but deserved a bigger role. <br/><br/>But of-course the film is about the Transformers and the auto-bots in this are all pretty good. Like last time there could have been more of Ratchet and Ironhide but they have their moments. Bumblebee is as good as he was in the first film but I felt the focus had been moved too far away from him and Sam's relationship together which was important in the first film. Optimus still demands the audiences attention every-time you that red and blue truck enter the screen but there is one scene where I found myself questioning his actions but on the whole he was great and Peter Cullen is fantastic as ever.<br/><br/>There is something wrong with the villains though this time as they never really seem to be much of a threat as they seem to get taken down pretty quickly. More of an emphasis on the villains strengths and capabilities would have drastically improved the already enjoyable action scene at the end. Sorry guys but the once great Starscream from the first film is gone and we are still left with a sniveling henchman that is embarrassing to watch at times considering he was the one who tore those jets to pieces at the end of the first. <br/><br/>Overall this is enjoyable to watch. When it works (collapsing building and car chase scenes) it really works and this also goes for the humour. Sadly the film is not perfect but I doubt anyone was expecting it to be. Once again the trailer promises something else but what we end up receiving is still worth your attention if you enjoyed the either of the last two."

","i feel bad for giving this movie a 6, it deserves a 6.5 in my rating system. Its better told than the 2nd one, but aside from the effects and action sequences, well it sucks.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that people like this better than transformers 2. my guess is that they hated the 2nd one so much that this could seem only better. Because this movie is not better than the second one, its just told in a better way (slightly).<br/><br/>Im sorry if you re a united states citizen, but every movie that goes for the proud us flag waving in the back style of script fails, and fails in a big way. Bay movies are no masterpiece in my opinion, they are written for people who are very different than me and my kind of people.<br/><br/>don't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie, but i knew what it was. The action scenes are awesome, like really awesome, specially the falling building scene and the final battle: the new bad guy fought off all the autobots like a MACHO, and he gets killed in the most pussy way. the dialog SUCKS, in the name of freedom we declare you the war?? damn that was bad. At least there is no mudflap and his brother who were awful in the second film.<br/><br/>for me there were like 6 big plot holes and did i mention the dialog sucked? but the acting was not bad for me. another thing that bugged me, Malkovich, Mcdormand and Turturro are all major Coen brothers stars, are they friends with Bay or what?.<br/><br/>i didn't hate the movie, the action was awesome and only that gave it the six points i gave it. i would like to give it more because i gave the previous movie a 7, but i will change the score of the previous film to 6 as well, because thats is the score the trilogy deserves.<br/><br/>Bay should go on a mystical trip to other cultures and return to filmaking after at least 5 years, he should change his views because he is being toss aside of whats really cool nowadays"
"iReviewFilms","7","0","2","5 July 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Transformers: Dark of the Moon
","Our summer of sequels continues with the Transformers returning to the big screen with their third outing. After the rather disappointing Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen I have to say that my hopes were not particularly high for this one.<br/><br/>Dark of the Moon is set several years after the second movie where Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is struggling to get a job and return his life to normal and yet this still hasn't stopped him from bagging the most attractive girl in the city- Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). At the same time, the Autobots discover that a Cybertronian spacecraft crash landed on the Moon during the 1960's and race against the Decepticons to reach it first and protect the secrets that it holds. The two story lines overlap and voilà the plot is born.<br/><br/>As always the visuals impress and are the best in the franchise so far but I ended up asking myself how is this different from the previous two and it led me to this answer- there isn't that much of a difference at all. Bay has upped the ante somewhat in regards to the amount of CGI he has crammed into the movie so expect more fighting, more action and a whole lot more slowmo. While many will think great more action, I see it as part of the problem though. There is only so many times that I can be impressed with a vehicle transforming into something else, in slow motion, before it becomes repetitive and I felt like I reached my limit in this film.<br/><br/>Aside from the first 10 minutes which dealt with the space race of the 1960's, it took a while for the film to get going. For the last hour or so though, I was enjoying what the film had to offer where it took on a Black Hawk Down kind of persona during battle scenes in the city.<br/><br/>Several issues I had: at 157 minutes the film tended to drag in several places and led to a rather rushed final scene that should not have been; the comedy element was greatly reduced despite a cameo from Ken Jeong aka Mr Chow from The Hangover; the new love interest did not impress with her acting skills at all and was more than likely brought in merely as token eye candy for the viewers, which she did succeed in; and most importantly, the plot had more holes in it than a Swiss cheese being used as target practice on a shooting range. And that is an understatement. Also there has been zero continuity between the trilogy of films so far which does not go down well with me.<br/><br/>I was more impressed than I thought I was going to be but as I said expectation had been lowered due to the extremely poor second film. I have to be careful here because I think the impressive graphics have partly blinded me to the rest of the cracks that appear in the film. All I can say is if you enjoyed the first movie or like good visuals then you will enjoy this one and if you didn't or want an involved and interesting plot that develops itself and the characters as the movie progresses then you won't get that here.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"
"pete_peewee_wilson","7","0","2","5 July 2011"," Enjoyable but a bit confusing
","We came out of the cinema feeling that we really enjoyed something. It was a long movie, but after spending a long time there the whole real climatic ending happened just too quick. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley should stick to modelling, it will help for her botox injections anyway, she was really flat and lifeless. I have seen a few reviews say that she brought a bit of English class, yes, like ""fish and chips"" brings English class. There were so many holes in the movie and I agree with many other reviews that it seemed like many many hours were filmed, but they did not necessarily pick the best two and a half hours for the finished version. Still the CGI was the best I have ever seen and we still enjoyed the movie and were happy to part with our hard earned money for a ticket, well it filled the afternoon."
"directoroffilm","7","0","2","5 July 2011"," Depends on what you expect...
","What you think of this film will depend entirely on what you expect when you walk in. If you are expecting a detailed script, mesmerizing acting and deep/thoughtful story then you are going to leave a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Though if you walk in expecting amazing action sequences, massive explosions and brilliant visuals then you'll leave satisfied. Not saying that all the acting is bad, Shia LaBeouf plays Sam well again and also the comedic performance by Ken Jeong brings life to the film.<br/><br/>Even though the film is 2 1/2 hours long, time goes by quickly. If you are looking for a great action packed film to see these holidays I recommend seeing 'Transformers'.<br/><br/>Also if you're going to see one 3D film this is the one. I was lucky enough to see the film in IMAX which is definitely the best way to see it as the film really immerses the viewer and you can really feel it, as the cinema shakes for a large percentage of the film. This is one film which really benefits from IMAX.<br/><br/>Overall: Don't go see the film if you want a smart and brilliant story. Go see it if you want a good time!"
"zardoz-13","9","0","4","4 July 2011"," An Above Average Sequel
","""Transformers"" movies can get away with a lot more than most movies. After all, they are cinematic adaptations about a line of extraterrestrial alien robot toys originally made by the Japanese! In 1984, the American toy manufacturer Hasbro obtained the rights to the figures and called them ""Transformers."" Twenty-six years later, the ""Transformers"" remain incredibly popular! As the ""Transformers"" grew in popularity, they became comic book, television show, and cinematic sensations. Doesn't it tell you something about America when the movie that sells the most tickets features computer-generated versions of humanoid robots? Primarily, the ""Transformers"" movies are all about spectacle. Measured by this standard, the new ""Transformers"" movie in 3-D is stupendous. Director Michael Bay's third installment in the franchise ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" isn't as obnoxiously farcical as ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" Instead, this threquel emerges as a little darker than the second movie. <br/><br/>This sequel cleverly rewrites history to accommodate its outlandish plot. The war between the Autobots and the Decepticons on the planet Cybertron is drawing to an end when the Autobots launch the Ark. This craft transports a secret cargo known as the Pillars which could enable the good guys to defeat the villains. Unfortunately, the Decepticons blast the Autobot spacecraft, but they don't destroy the vessel. Little do the Decepticons know that the crippled Ark, flown by Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, crashes on the dark side of the Moon when the Cold War is heating up between the United States and the Soviet Union. President John F. Kennedy vows to put a man on the Moon, but secretly he wants the U.S. to beat the Soviets to the mysterious crash site. During the Apollo 11 landing in 1969, NASA gives astronauts Neil Armstrong (Don Jeanes) and Buzz Aldrin (Cory Tucker) about twenty minutes to explore the Ark without letting anybody on Earth--primarily the Soviets--know about it. Armstrong and Aldrin as well as later Apollo missions stockpile artifacts and pictures from the Ark, but nobody knows how to make the best use of them. <br/><br/>The scene shifts to the present. Colonel Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and the Autobots are continuing to track down and eliminate the remaining Decepticons. When they visit the notorious Chernobyl disaster site, Autobots Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) uncover fuel cells from the Ark. Actually, the Soviets tried to harness the power of these fuel cells and their efforts triggered the infamous meltdown. As they are investigating Chernobyl, Lennox and the Autobots encounter the Decepticon known as Shockwave (Frank Welker) and another Decepticon. Later, the Autobots confront Secretary of Defense Charlotte Mearing (Frances McDormand) and learn that the Moon race was an effort to recover as much as America could from the Ark. The Autobots fly to the moon. Not only do they find the body of Sentinel Prime in hibernation, but also five Pillars. After Optimus revives Sentinel, his old comrade turns on him and joins a horribly disfigured Megatron and the Decepticons. Sentinel plans to use the Pillars to enslave earthlings. Naturally, like a vintage Republic serial of the 1940s, the Decepticons come to within a hairsbreadth of winning. Not surprising, the architect of their defeat is none other than Sam Witwicky. <br/><br/>Life hasn't been kind to Sam since ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" Although he has graduated from college and received a Medal of Honor from President Obama, Sam hasn't been able to find a job. As ""Dark of the Moon"" opens, our frustrated hero is shacked up and living off the generosity of his latest girlfriend, Carly Spencer (newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whitely), while struggling to get a job before his mom and dad arrive in Washington, D.C. If this weren't bad enough, Sam has to contend with Carley's wealthy boss, Dylan Gould (a smarmy Patrick Dempsey) who owns a huge accounting firm as well as his own auto museum. Ironically, Gould helps Sam land a job in the mail room of an aerospace, telecommunications conglomerate. While making his deliveries, Sam bumps into a giddy Asian-American co-worker, Jerry Wang (Ken Jeong of ""The Hangover""), who recognizes Sam and warns him about an imminent Decepticon attack. Sam approaches Defense Secretary Mearing, but she doesn't believe him. Later, she realizes Sam has legitimate information. During a slam-bang finale in Chicago, which supercharges the last hour of this lengthy two hour and thirty minute epic, Sam and his old cronies deal the Decepticons another devastating defeat.<br/><br/>""Arlington Road"" scenarist Ehren Kruger and Bay have added some new Autobot and Decepticons to enliven the action. The surprises are few and far between, but the best one is Leonard Nimoy. Indeed, Mr. Spock of ""Star Trek"" fame furnishes the voice for legendary Autobot leader Sentinel Prime. Oscar winner Frances McDormand joins the cast as a powerful National Security honcho who abhors being addressed as ""m'am."" Sexy Abercrombie & Fitch model Rosie Huntington-Whitely replaces sultry Megan Fox. Huntington-Whitely looks like a Keira Knightley clone. Patrick Dempsey plays the slimy, cynical human villain who aligns himself with the Decepticons, while John Malkovich pops ups in a brief supporting role as a corporate big wig. Meanwhile, virtually everybody else reprises their original roles, including Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and Glenn Morshower. One of the coolest things in ""Dark of the Moon"" is the glider suits that military deploy in to fly into a combat zone. The liveliest action set-piece takes place in a skyscraper that is about to collapse as Decepticons pursue our heroes throughout it.<br/><br/>As usual these noisy ""Transformers"" movies amount to morality lessons. They laud the value of freedom over tyranny, unity between mankind and aliens, and the necessity for a strong military. These toy movies display more red, white, and blue patriotism than most movies and put on the kind of show that would gratify a recruiting officer's heart. The ""Transformers"" movies resemble recruiting posters for reckless, adventure-loving lads who want to hurl themselves into the breach."

","Transformers: Dark of the moon was an outstanding movie from the action scenes, the great visual effects, and a good storyline that incorporates real life events. I'm not saying the movie is perfect as nothing is but it definitely is the best of the series. Micheal Bay had many obstacles to overcome as the last movie could have been better and losing a main character in Megan Fox. He overcame these obstacles by picking up Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who did a fantastic job. Sure she was not perfect and could have done better but it was her first acting job and she only has room to grow. Rosie for me did a better job than Megan and Rosie played an actual role in the movie where as Megan just followed Shia around looking good for the camera. The storyline was more thought through and used the real events of the space race. It was clever to bring in Sentinel Prime and have a choice he made many years ago affect his modern day decision. The storyline takes you through an emotional roller-coaster as many times you are lead to believe an Autobot is going to be killed.<br/><br/>The only thing that was not that great was the main decepticons roles in the movie, Megatron did not really play any role until the ending and starscream did not either."
"Al_The_Strange","9","0","3","4 July 2011"," ""Where were you when they took over the planet?""
","As expected, ""Transformers: DotM"" showcases one of the most ambitious and epic finales of any film series. Even if you thought the action could never top the intensity or breadth of the first two films, ""DotM"" finally cuts to the chase and brings us all-out carnage! It's pretty darn awesome watching the transformers duke it out in foreign lands and on the highways (in a scene which could possibly surpass the highway chase scene in the first movie), but the last hour or so is entirely devoted to a massive invasion where robots and ships are literally tearing the city up and brutally massacring each other. The ruined cityscapes are about as imaginative and artistic as what we see in the ""Crysis 2"" video game; the intensity and the stakes are about as high as what we see in a ""Terminator"" movie; the action is easily the best of the series. And with strong storytelling and cinematography, ""DotM"" easily bests most other alien invasion movies (especially following the releases of ""Skyline"" and ""Battle: LA,"" both of which were rather disappointing).<br/><br/>This movie may be overshadowed by the weaknesses of ""Revenge of the Fallen,"" but rest assured that the story for ""DotM"" is fleshed out way better. The conspiracies that are unveiled are quite sublimely integrated, and seeing them unravel feels like a refreshing revelation. The climax works very well to tie up the events of the first two films, and ultimately I feel that this movie incorporates a number of elements that may have been lost in the last film (namely, the ideas that the transformers are covert, the ideas that they are fighting for their way of life, and most importantly, the idea that they are fighting for freedom). As far as the human element goes, the story takes the franchise's hero to his next logical step; all of this drama might test your patience a little (especially with so much hit-or-miss humor), but it all contributes to the amazing finale.<br/><br/>Cinematically, ""DotM"" shows excellent photography and editing; the shots are indeed prolonged and evenly-paced, allowing you to see the action much more leisurely than the last two hectic movies. The film has its share of wonderful scenery, but it feels rather drab and grim overall (which helps add a sense of doom and gloom; parts of this movie are rather scary). Acting is a mixed bag once again; Shia LaBeouf continues to be himself, for better or for worse. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has a few weak moments, but I felt she was an ample replacement for Megan Fox. Patrick Dempsey is convincing as a jerk. Ken Jeong's role was pretty darn wild, for better or for worse. John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, and Tyrese Gibson all return and are still great; Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Alan Tudyk are interesting additions. And of course, Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, and Leonard Nimoy are superb in their voice acting. Aside from using my least-favorite Linkin Park song, the music is great.<br/><br/>I'm not sure at this point if I'd rank this over the first film or not. But at the very least, I'd put them on the same level, and in time I'll see which one I value the most.<br/><br/>Casually recommended! <br/><br/>4.5/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4/5)"

I have watched the first and second movie of the trilogy.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>-Action filled, great CGI<br/><br/>-Bumblebee<br/><br/>-HAS a story line this time<br/><br/>-Megan Fox was not in this film, she was only there as Sam's girlfriend, nothing else, she does not know how to act<br/><br/>CONS: <br/><br/>-The movie was WAY too long in my opinion<br/><br/>-Bumblebee BARELY had any action<br/><br/>-The new girlfriend of Sam had the same exact role as Megan Fox, all she did was yell ""SAM!"" throughout the whole movie, lame. I know.<br/><br/>-Ironhide died 1/3 of the movie? WHY?<br/><br/>-It's always Optimus having all the action, the only Autobots I really know are Optimus, Ironhide, and Bumblebee, since Ironhide died, well.. I don't really know the rest of them, and it would be nice to see the rest of them in action<br/><br/>Summary: I am a sucker for action films, but I went in with high expectations since the opening day, it got a 7.5/10 on this website, the movie was not disappointing, I don't understand why everyone is complaining. People seriously need to go into a theater with an open mind rather than comparing it to the cartoons."
"grahamzkg","7","0","3","4 July 2011"," a huge improvement, but a flat ending to the trilogy
","In 2009, Michael bay graced us with transformers revenge of the fallen. The highest grossing punching bag of the past five years. critics and fans bashed the crap out of Michael and his movie, and made him pick up his teeth and walk away with his tail between his legs. Transformers dark of the moon picks up after the events of the last movie, Sam was dumped(due to Megan fox being fired). and has found Carly, a British babe, who is surprisingly better than Megan fox. Now the story was pretty good up until the huge Chicago battle scenes. they completely forget the conspiracy of the 1969 moon landing. and they never came full circle with it. Now I'm not complaining. the last hour and a half was freaking epic. But i wish that the story wasn't sacrificed for huge action scenes with robots kicking ass. The visual and special effects are the best in the series by far. All of the Autobots and especially the Decepticons look incredible. This movie did a lot of things well, and it did a couple of things wrong. the last little problem i had was the ending. They didn't end it like it was the end of the trilogy, all the ending was, all of the heroes meeting on one of the bridges in Chicago, doing all of the slow motion walking and what not. it should have closed the trilogy on Sam, not a fast zoom to optimus' face. all in all, great movie."

","This was an awesome movie . If you go into this looking for anything other than an action packed , transformer movie , you will be disappointed. I went to see it this weekend and I thought it was the best of the 3 movies . I agree with most that The Megan Fox stand in wasn't the best , but she is smoking' hot and not really that bad . She is better than the chick from twilight...just saying. Shia was great , and so was most of the cast . The movie looked and sounded better than any movie I have ever seen . The music was great as well , although I must say I do miss the old Linkin Park , not really digging the new U2 like version of Linkin Park . Anyway great awesome ride , if you are a Transformers fan GO SEE IT! you won' t be disappointed."

","I sometimes have the pleasure of babysitting my Grandkids, and my 4 year old grandson absolutely delights in throwing his toy cars and trucks off of the second floor landing and seeing them burst apart. He then collects and plays with the pieces, sometimes breaking them even more. This movie is like that. It's like the little boys who used to play with the transformer cars when they were little got older and now they're still playing with them through the manipulations of cameras and computers.<br/><br/>This film does exhibit all of the usual modern computer generated effects. The locations are widely separated with nothing being too spectacular in that regard. The costuming is simple as are the props (except the computer stuff of course). The sets are, well, hard to judge because you can't really believe they're not primarily computer generated effects. I think the problem is they keep trying to do bigger and bigger special effects and at some point it almost gets boring from being so uniformly explosive and overwhelmingly unreal. I'll invent yet another new term here to cover it: ""Action Movie Desensitization"". One can't believe that these types of films are not solely aimed at the average 12 year old out of school for the summer. There's little else in the theaters.<br/><br/>The film also requires an immense degree of the ability to suspend one's disbelief to begin to watch it. The plot is as thin and makes about as much logical sense as a 1930's comic book plot, but it's there if you want to try to follow it. If you saw any of the preceding ""Transformer""-type films you could likely write a better plot yourself; so just substitute your own plot in your head as the explosions unfold (NOTE to writers; a college graduate usually isn't a ""teenager"").<br/><br/>That leaves the acting. The principle characters do yeoman service for their paychecks. Several previous denizens of Transformerville return to reprise their former roles with Shia La Beouf straining his best to out-panic and out-sweat his previous filmic efforts. He does so well, along with John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Patrick Dempsey and Alan Tudyk. The always watchable Frances McDormand comes on strong as a bad-womanesque government wienie. She was cool being bad. John Malkovich provided a great characterization as La Beouf's mildly-insane, oddball boss. He and McDormand are likely the best things in the film, BUT, there was a truly kinetic, unhinged, off-the wall performance by the increasingly popular Ken Jeong. Watch for him, he's a riot.<br/><br/>The odd addition is ""the girl""- there's always a girl. In this case the very publicized Megan Fox from the former films was unceremoniously replaced for little understood insults to the hands that fed her. Such is life. But, Fox's bad luck provided all the excuse necessary to replace her with a younger model, literally. In this instance ""the girl"" is ""unconventionally beautiful"" 24 year-old British farm girl/model named Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whitely's previous claim to fame, it seems, is the talent to look decent while walking around in public places in her underwear, which, of course, brought her to the attention of these film makers, so, at this point in her career I imagine her strategy has worked out rather well. She's not terrible in the film so at least she doesn't embarrass herself. However, skimpier costuming may have brought in a few dozen more teenage boys.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but note that every time Whitely appeared on camera, or in some cases even close-by off-camera, the script became peppered with some rather obvious and sophomoric sexual innuendos and double-entendres accompanied by some rather epic leering. The most blatant one early on coming from someone commenting on the container La Beouf's medal came in. And, please, no one spoil it for me by claiming it was unintentional. I, at least, wanted to give the writer credit for getting away with some originality.<br/><br/>Another thing one can't help but notice the height disparity between the two leads, La Beouf and Whitely. I checked and he lists his height in his bio as an entire quarter of an inch taller than her's states. There seems to be different people playing La Beouf as his height seems to change up and down by four inches or more throughout the film. Some of that can be explained by her footwear, but not all of it. One may wonder why I mention that? I mention it because I was so disinterested in the ""action"" on screen that I was looking for other things to find interest in on screen. Still, I have to give credit for any shorter guy willing to undertake scaling mount Whitely. It must have been very fun for him.<br/><br/>In the long run, I would have much preferred it had they cast a ""real"" young actress in the role instead of a model. There are a number of good ones to choose from. For example, Blake Lively (barely shorter), pixieish Ellen Page, Hilary Duff (Oooo, she can even resemble a tough girl), Kay or DaniellePanabaker (or maybe both of them, they're small), Hayden Panettiere, Mia Wasikowska (shorter than whazziz name), Aly Michalka (barely shorter), Emma Roberts (who is charmingly shorter than that Witwicky guy), Amanda Michalka (also shorter) and, my personal favorite nominee, Emma Stone (also shorter). See how easy it is? In conclusion, I will posit that the theater was uncommonly packed, the most I'd ever seen on a weekday performance, and the audience uniformly seemed to like the film a lot. So, I guess that means that they will make a lot of money which, in turn, will likely generate yet another sequel."
"paulgo-74-488063","6","0","2","1 July 2011"," I enjoyed it BUT....
","I saw this in 3D against my better judgement, but my mates just HAD to.... I was and they were, VERY disappointed with the 3d effect in this movie. I've read some say that 3d is in its infancy...it's NOT. I watched a movie at Universal Studios in the U.S. back in 97. It was a Terminator 3D extravaganza and WOW! Everything lept out of the screen and felt as if you were THERE. You could almost touch things that ""flew"" out of the screen. Not so with this movie. the 3d was subtle at best and looked as if it were done in post production. WHY couldn't we have bits of megabot flying out into the audience,exploding above our heads???? etc etc<br/><br/>THAT would've made the movie much more exciting.<br/><br/>Not to say there was not enough action...I felt at times there was TOO much and not enough dialogue or meaning behind it.The main character runs around shouting ""We gotta MOVE"" all the time and sometimes his lines are totally detached from the scene...meaningless. As for the skirt...JEEZ gimme a BREAK! BOTOX on steroids! uggghhh She couldn't act her way of a paper bag either.<br/><br/>I LOVED the CGI. That's what had me spellbound the whole time. The movie itself lacked something and I think maybe Spielberg might've stuck his finger in the pie a little TOO much this time. FAR TOO MUCH shmaltsy Yankee friggin slowmo hero crap and ""we are the greatest"". I nearly throw up every time I see that crap in a movie. And the ending...YAAAAAWWWWNNNN If I ever see another US flag waving behind the cast I'm gonna run screaming down the aisle and jump through the screen!!! <br/><br/>Mostly, it didn't make sense. Most of the main characters would've been dead halfway through if it were real but let's face it...it's a comic book.<br/><br/>Apart from that I enjoyed it ;)"
"rosser_86","7","0","2","1 July 2011"," Awesome action.....but that's about it.
","I was never a fan of the Transformers franchise when I was younger (I had nothing against it, but I just wasn't in to it) so this is going to be a fanboy-free review. However this also means that my knowledge of Transformers lore is limited - all I know is the handful of Wikipedia articles I read after I watched the first and second films to understand characters more.<br/><br/>When I watched the first film on DVD I instantly loved it. Why? Because the action sequences are fantastic. However, as I watched it more and more, I began to realise that that's about it. The same goes for the second film and, sadly, this one too.<br/><br/>Firstly, the films might as well be three stand alone movies. I mean, there is hardly any continuity between them. For starters, I'm not really sure just WHAT the Deceptions are after - in the first film it was the AllSpark (the purpose of which seems to change throughout the film), in the second they wanted to blow up the Sun or something, and in this one it's all about saving Cybertron. But that's just it - the big twist is that Sentinel Prime formed an alliance with Megatron, to save Cybertron. So, when Optimus offers Sentinel that little device that can bring the 'bots back to life and whatnot(I forget what it's called), why does Sentinel refuse? Surely that would help in his endeavour? Also, sticking with continuity, in the second film, Megatron put a bounty on Sam's head and broadcasted it world wide...so why does no one know who he is? Why can he not get a job? Speaking of Sam, and the humans in general, is there any need for them now? Michael Bay seems to masturbate over the army (as is apparent in the majority of his films), and this is in no way disrespect to the REAL US army, but I'm sure they're not all action-men-stereotypes? And especially the black guys - I thought we covered racism with Skidz and Mudflap (glare) in the second film? Why need more? Additionally, I personally think that there was no need for Sam in this film. OK, maybe a little, as he was the 'messenger', but I think a film about the Deceptacons vs Autobots, sans Sam, would have worked just fine. But no, he's back. Shia Lebouf is an alright actor, but when tied to a God-awful script...it's just a bit painful. And his whole relationship with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is so fake and clichéd. I know Megan Fox had her reasons for leaving and was supposed to be in DotM, but at the end of Revenge of the Fallen there was a massive hoo-har about how Sam and Mikaela love each other, and then, enter T3 and ""yeah, she dumped me"". If that's the case, then why not have NO love interest for Sam in T3? I know that all his motives in the third film are to save Carly, but they're so staged, clichéd and fake. Also, Huntington-Whitely is as dense as wood it seems. Yeah, she's hot, but that's another problem - there are too many hot girls in this franchise! Megan Fox, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Isabel Lucas and Rachael Taylor - it's ridiculous. Do all the hottest girls in the world (enhanced by CGI, of course) gravitate around Sam? It's just silly. Of course sex sells, but have some more ""average"" looking girls instead of ""awww yeah check out dat ass!"" shots.<br/><br/>Like I said, though, the action sequences were enough for me to enjoy the films. I mean, the nigh hour long battle at the end of the film was pretty awesome, all in all, but at the same time, it still seems more focused on the humans than the 'bots. Although the Autobot vs Deceptacon fight scenes are very cool, I have to say I was a little bit disappointed with the final fight. I was expecting a big three way battle between Optimus, Sentinel and Megatron. But no. Optimus is getting his arse handed to him until Megatron f's up Sentinel (because a hot girl told him too, despite the fact he's supposed to be the feared leader among the Deceptacons), and then Optimus just blows Megatron up. I mean, this is a fight that has been building up for three films! Also, when the first trailers were released I thought that Shockwave was the main antagonist, but I don't even know what he is doing in this film! He has no interaction with Megatron; it seems that he is on his own little mission to just blow up buildings...but it's not even him that does it - it's his snakey Deceptacon thing. I don't know. At the end of the day, it is worth seeing, and I still give it 7/10 for the action - but when judged as a whole movie...well it's just another Micheal Bay film - so take that as you will. Oh, also, Ken Jeong plays Ken Jeong."
"karthik-rangaswamy","7","0","3","3 July 2011"," Excellent action movie without a human touch
","I had a lot of expectations from DOTM right from the moment I saw the first trailer. The media hype about a dark story, technically pronounced action sequences, toned-down comedy and last but not the least '3D' were driving me crazy to go watch the movie. Well I did, and here are my opinions. The action sequences have defined DOTM to be the benchmark for all future action movies aiming to blast the audience in 3D format. Michael Bay has once again proved that there is no one to parallel him in orchestrating explosive shots deftly. The story elements embedded with amazing special effects work as constructive blocks in the able hands of Bay, building up to an explosive hour long climatic sequence that should end Bay's take on the saga. But...I feel that the story was a bit of a let down. The first movie was a fresh artistic piece that made me look up in awe. The second movie was just a mix of better action with not so good a story, yet a good take for an intermediate episode. But in both those movies, the human characters, especially Sam, were at least 70% instrumental in moving the story forward. Unfortunately in DOTM, I found Sam to be less integral while many characters who were important in the past two movies ended up playing near-insignificant roles except for some comic bits or command- center style dialog. If you think the robots filled the gap, well, I don't exactly think so as it is a simple autobot vs decepticon plot with more numbers on either side bombing each other, and hence more focus on action. So in all... 3D 'wow', story 'so-so', experience 'worth it'. If you want the action, go get it as you don't want to miss it on the big screen. Else if other elements are important to you as the action is, you might be disappointed."
"chunga95","7","0","3","3 July 2011"," Personification of a Summer Popcorn Movie
","Not new news: Transformers DOTM is not the best movie ever, nor is it the best of the series, so far. The story is riddled with holes, the acting (from some people in particular) is passable, and it has more than its share of moments that make you think ""really?"".<br/><br/>That said, this is a great summer action flick. Expect an entertaining, visually and audibly stimulating movie, and your expectations will be exceeded. For all its many, many faults, this Transformers movie is fun and thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>It has some elements of the first two movies that contribute directly to the plot, but stands alone quite well. Not having seen the first two movies you would not be lost, although seeing the first two would give you a stronger appreciation for where the movie enters, character-wise. Transformers is long on action and short on making sense. Many times during the movie I caught myself wondering ""how did we get here?"". I believe this was the editing, which probably omitted many bridge elements of the story in favor of pacing and effect. Nonetheless, the actions sets are spectacular and, once again, found myself caught up in them cheering till the end.<br/><br/>For 2 1/2 hours of escapism, entertainment, and eye candy (in all its forms) I rated it a 7. Withdraw the action sequences and the non-sequitur comedy bits would leave this movie a 2, which should give you some idea the impact these elements play in the overall movie. Have the correct expectation, you won't be disappointed. Expect Olivier playing Henry V, and I'll ask you what in the hell you're doing at a Transformers movie!"

","I must first say that going into this movie I expected nothing more than a fireworks show; lots of explosions and carnage without much plot.

The scenes were a little jumbled, but not enough that you couldn't follow the movie. <br/><br/>I'll list the pros and cons, and warn you of spoilers.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/><ul><li>Best Transformers movie in the series in terms of plot </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Really, really, REALLY good special effects.

","***SPOILERS ARE HERE*** Stop reading NOW if you want to be surprised (although I don't see HOW you can be).<br/><br/>Michael Bay has done it again. He has blown up yet another U.S. city and made you enjoy it. He's turned into the Roland Emmerich of robot flicks. Bay actually sort of blows up two cities...but D.C. got off pretty easy this time. Chicago...well, I won't be taking any vacations there soon. Just sayin'...<br/><br/>The good points are many. The special effects and explosions kick butt. Awesome, awesome, AWESOME! The transformations of the robots still makes me gasp. It is that good. The robots show more emotional range and character development than the humans. I saw the movie in 3-D and the 3-D effects didn't totally suck. Yea Michael! The footage of the wind flyers is almost as cool as the first time I saw it done in a Lara Croft movie back in 2003. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin has a cameo. Leonard Nimoy as the voice of Sentinel Prime was way cool. But...that leads me to the bad stuff.<br/><br/>The bad points are many. There is no plot. Well, there's sort of a plot but it has so many holes in it that you just don't want to think about it. The dialog is rudimentary. Sam screams ""OPTIMUS!"" or ""BUMBLEBEE!"" at every turn. Leonard Nimoy swipes his signature phrase from The Wrath of Khan. Even Bumblebee steals a line from the same film. What gives?! The non-PC jokes abound and they are all groaners. I thought we couldn't sink lower than the scrotum reference in the last film...but I was so wrong.<br/><br/>The human actors are not horrible...well, except for the new girl. They really should have waited until the swelling went down on her lips for those kissy closeups. She continues the excessive T&A of the previous actress....what was her name? Megan...something...Fox? The humans don't really matter. We're here to be blown out of our seats and see cool effects. On that the movie delivers.<br/><br/>Go see it in theaters. Don't wait for the Blu-ray. But, be warned, it is a long ride on this roller coaster."
"Coryg59","9","0","3","3 July 2011"," Transformed my view on Franchise
","This was by far the best of the 3. I was not a big fan of the first 2, and a big fan of Shia Lebuf. But this one blew me away. And I believe it has to do with the story. The story was way better to get your mind drawn into this universe than the first 2. The action/fighting scenes were a step forward for the auto bots. The absence of Megan Fox I think played out well for the storyline of Sam, and Shia acted better in this go around. The Transformers them selves were much better. You always root for bumblebee and Omptimus Prime. Prime and the Autobots had a role that suits them better in this film. One of best of 2011 and by far best of the trilogy."

","I think the latest transformers film is the best of the three. The megan fox replacement was better than megan fox and much less annoying. Even though she isn't in the first two she does just as good a job better really. The plot was very good and the story was well explained as the film went on. It has a lot of the old faces in it as well which was a very welcome touch to the film.<br/><br/>There is lots of action and it in 3d, its amazing to watch. They definitely made the most of the 3d aspect. Transformers is cheesy in parts but if you're not a fan of films like this, i wouldn't advise you to see it. I loved it though.<br/><br/>This film is so much better than the 2nd one and in this film you see a lot more deaths which don't happen in the previous two. It just adds more to the film though. I would give this 9 out of 10. It is very entertaining and sad in places and funny in others. If your a fan of this type of film i would recommend you go see it. This will probably be the film of the year."
"chicagopoetry","7","0","2","3 July 2011"," If You Like Chewing Bubblegum This Is For You
","Okay, right, the plot is confusing. Okay, right, the acting doesn't amount to more than some screaming and yelling and macho poses. Okay, the most absurd casting in the history of film was made by putting British supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in the role of the main lead and love interest. She slides down collapsing buildings, runs though explosions with shrapnel flying everywhere, crawls through burning pits of smoky ash, and doesn't so much as smudge her white sweater or show a single emotion besides sticking out her big pouty lips and speaking a few lines as if lobotomized. But besides all of this, Transformers 3 is pure bubblegum, two and a half hours of explosions and robot violence with at least an hour of Chicago getting attacked that rivals the destruction in any other movie. What do you expect from yet another sequel to a movie based on Hasbro toys? Clint Eastwood giving Meryl Streep a bouquet of fleshly picked flowers? If you want action and over the top special effects this movie is top notch, but if you expect anything else, why go see a movie called Transformers 3 in the first place? I thought it was a lot of fun."
"toviamyles","7","0","2","3 July 2011"," Leading Lady
","I give this movie seven out of ten stars, which is a little higher than I really thought it deserved only because of how well portrayed and right on the money the leading lady was. This wasn't the typical Transformer film where the leading lady is supposedly this bad ass chick but all they seem to do is play up on her sex appeal. In the first film they make it a point to tell us about Mikaela's juvy record and we see her driving a tow truck all the while scantly clad and unsmugged lipstick. This leading lady was the damsel in distress who was extremely beautiful but they did not make a point to tell you that at every turn. It didn't seem realistic at one point in particular where the damsel in distress plays up on the human hating decepticons insecurity and need for power and walked away unharmed. At first I was like ugh really a victoria's secret model as the leading lady I guess acting isn't what this movie will be about, however Rosie Huntington-Whitely is a decent actress already and may be a force once she is seasoned."
"apope42","9","0","6","3 July 2011"," don't believe the hate!
","there is one simple reason in my opinion for all the hate generated over an over-the-top action film about KID'S TOYS...(cheez, I mean).....which I will get to soon. But it's NOT, repeat, NOT any of the following, although they are contributing factors. It's not Michael Bay hate, although there is an element of jealousy in the professional movie world, which I say is not the cause, because this is the case with almost every successful action picture. There's always a feeling that the character-driven drama is somehow more worthy or more artistic. It's not Megan Fox fans, if there are any still, dissing the picture out of loyalty, nor do those purist fan-boys account for the raw bile being spewed, very wrongly, about this near perfect summer movie. No, and I will not go on with what it's not. I read a review here from someone from the UK who states he's not an American, which I think summarizes it. It's posted here on this site, so if I misquote, you can check me. The reviewer didn't think much of the scene where Abraham Lincoln's statue is destroyed. But this is an example of where the movie succeeds and makes me, and I think the audience it is aimed at, a fan. I didn't consider myself a Michael Bay fan, thought Armageddon was one of the silliest and worst movies ever made. Hard as it may be to believe this 3rd installment of the Tranformers franchise has made me rethink that opinion. I don't go to blockbusters, as a general rule. I didn't see ET for many years, just as a resistance to all the hype. Conversely, especially now, when important critics line up in a mob to stone a movie and/or its maker, I go to learn why. I'm not a Transformers fan, the TV show was one of the most shameless cartoon marketing ploys, but my kids liked it and it wasn't like some other drivel, it seemed to have some basis in right versus wrong, and few if any unsavory elements, so I basically put up with it, without thinking of it much. I didn't like or hate the first movie, the second seemed worse and I basically agreed with the criticism, too loud, too dark (not in theme, hard to see), confusing battle scenes, story holes really so big the story wasn't even on Saturday cartoon level. When I saw so many saying the same things, I prepared myself for the worst.<br/><br/>To repeat the title of this review for emphasis, Don't Believe the LIE! Michael Bay and his crew obviously listened to any valid criticism leveled against 'Fallen', most of the battle scenes take place in daylight, many are slowed down and simply glorious in the detail and realism of the CGI effects. (Some effects not related to robots are ridiculously poor, more later.) At least in the theater I saw it in, noise levels were the best I've seen in years. I have pretty sensitive ears, and hate going to a movie where the sound is like a rock concert. The story is just complicated enough to engage interest, without adding extraneous detail or annoying subplots. Remember, especially all of those reviewers here, who seem to want Star Trek style consistency and detail from a movie based on a Saturday morning cartoon, designed to sell pre-teens toys. C'mon, people! So why the hate? I am sorry to say, it's painfully obvious. The movie has the audacity to be....GASP....Pro-American! (shudder) Yes, a summer movie, made in the USA, by Americans, released near the national birthday anniversary of July 4th, shows a pro US bias! How dare they! and it had Bill Oreilly, instead of Chris Matthews, John Malkovich instead of Sean Penn, flags wave, echoes of September 11th in the destruction of Chicago. And the really unforgivable sin, it finally puts the Communist slogan, used to great effect in other sci-fi films, in the mouth of a villain. I hate to bring politics to this, but the conclusion is inescapable. I saw the film with a very eclectic crowd, trying to escape crushing heat, in a nearly-closed mall on the Saturday of the holiday weekend. Everyone stood up and applauded even cheered at the end. How long has it been since that has happened? My 14 year old son saw it on opening day, in a different city, different demographics, and said the same thing happened. Now, about those poor effects. There are scenes showing 'dead presidents' related to the moon conspiracy subplot, which are shamefully poorly done. JFK looks like a figure from Disney's presidential robot exhibit, they show Nixon on a TV screen with the real kinescope of an appearance during the moonshot, and an actor in the same frame, the actor doesn't look as much like Nixon as Anthony Hopkins did. The movie admittedly is too long, I think because of trying to please others by adding material to make the story less disjointed than part 2, but it isn't insufferably so. I got a little restless just before the climactic battle, but some judicious cuts of the parent's roles and the set-up scenes with 'McDreamy' to show him in a good light before the surprise would have solved this minor problem. Go, with family if possible, this weekend if possible, and be inspired, as silly and puerile as it seems, but some goofy toy robots, some forgettable jokes, and some kick-ass, drop-dead gorgeous, and heartbeat-racing action, with a definite and unapologetic American pride."
"vincent_loy412","8","0","5","2 July 2011"," Transformers 3 brings me for an action-packed ride!
","I have to say, this second sequel is the best out of the three movies based on 'Transformers', all directed by the ambitious Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg. My expectation is quite high for it after I have watched the trailer which seems to be very promising with a number of exciting action-packed scenes, and yesthe film appealed to that successfully, and so it reached my expectation, and even a bit higher. The story is based on the aimed exploration of astronauts on the other (dark) side of the moon on Apollo 11 mission in 1969 whom discovered a huge dead autobots' spaceship, with story following from there and brought to the Earth.<br/><br/>The Autobots lead by Optimus Prime lost to Decepticons lead by Megatron in war and they flee to the Earth which is regarded as their new home, in cooperation with humans while trying to activate Sentinel Prime which in turn betrays them by trying to take over the Earth with placement of Cybertron to the planet itself. Sorry for a little spoiler here if you haven't watch it, but there would be a lot of story to be told throughout the progress of the film, which total up to a length of approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes which for me is considered a bit too long. Some parts can be reduced for a better picture overall.<br/><br/>I'm satisfied with the story, and I have to admire the creativity of making the story related to famous incidents in the history of mankind like the first 'landing to the moon' mission and even the Chernobyl disaster of radiation. I also do like how humans are being integrated into the story, into the fight of the robots in our world, which usually centered on US cities normally (this time in Chicago and a bit in Washington). The only part I don't really attached to is the love thing again, between the main characters as predicted. Oh manit's the story dealing with end of the world and both of them having childish couples' act of breaking up or jealous at that point of time is nonsense and ridiculous. This dragged the story in the middle. Can the movie directors just leave this part aside for a movie or two, and not for ALL, including this one. Even without that portion, it would be already nice to watch, and might be even better!<br/><br/>There are also quite a number of hilarious moments, cracked by the people and even as well as the robots, especially the two tiny robots. Both of them just made me laughed whenever they appeared, either being left behind, being in the state of powerless compared to the others, or even when they are contributing in bringing down the Decepticon's ship which they didn't expect to board in. The humans also have played their roles well in the story, and special credits given for those who had really fly from a high position for the filming, which are in turn edited as to make them appeared to be flying at the sky of Chicago. They really performed the stunt.<br/><br/>I have to emphasize on the action scenes again. Although some scenes of excessive battle might be confusing and some just come and go in a very quick pace which I hardly get attached to, but overall everything showing the battle are just awesome. The use of 3D technology in the film is brilliant, and is by far the best 3D feature of the year, and after Avatar. I just get excited and interested over so many action- packed scenes with incredible viewing angle and position, all enhanced by 3D. So, it is much better and recommended to watch it in 3D! I still remember the scene of the tower slanting down due to attack from Decepticons while the people are in there, trying to avoid the attack and get out of the building. That is way too awesome, and at that time I wouldn't want to miss a second of it.<br/><br/>That really captures my attention until the point that I forgot the love thing between Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and their parts are not that much, luckily. The theme of betrayal between robots and even humans are stressed too which further makes the story interesting as it flows on an exciting journey. The movie really brought the audiences for a ride over, especially at the second half of the film, over the beautiful Chicago, city of skyscrapers with damage done by the Decepticons and Sentinel Prime appearing very realistic and impacting to the audiences.<br/><br/>I have to just say again that the battle scenes are WOW! Great job by all the people responsible in creating such a great science-fiction action film, which is definitely a big-budget production. The background scores in the film sound suitable too. The only thing I am a bit disappointed is that more attacking capabilities by the Autobots should be shown, rather than just showing how great the Decepticons can be, in numbers, in size, and in technology. Autobots should be more revealing in many aspects, rather than just from the colours. Okay, that is a minor issue. Overall, this movie is definitely very well made, very well worth-watching, and very well impressive. Wowthis is even a big review for this big film! Out of 10 points, I would give this one 7.6. (which many points are honestly dedicated to the action scenes!)<br/><br/>(from my own blog, www.vincentloy.wordpress.com)"
"UAWildcat28","6","0","4","2 July 2011"," Filled with clichés and dragging at times yet fun to watch
","I watched this movie in 3D, which I suggest to avoid and save the extra couple dollars. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty sweet, but it's such a long movie that after your eyes adjust to the 3D you kind of forget about it. There are few scenes worth watching in 3D anyway and most of the biggest explosions can hardly be seen in 3D.<br/><br/>Now about the movie. It was freaking awesome! I've been reading some of the negative reviews and I just have to laugh at them. Those guys are so right about the movie yet they missed the point. One guy wrote a review and didn't even watch the whole thing! Oh well, all I have to say is that if it weren't for the Autobots I would have walked out as  well. Yet, I knew better. This movie was never meant to win any awards that has to do with screenplay, acting, or directing. I mean it was done in two years. Two years! That's not enough time to write something crafty without some concrete background like a book. I mean I'm sorry, but I don't think the cartoons count. Especially with the special effects and everything. Just not enough time at all.<br/><br/>No, Michael Bay doesn't know structure in a movie. He doesn't even do transition within a scene very well either! Yet he knows one thing: how to make a movie exciting. And since this movie was done in only two years I give it a positive rating. Yeah I noticed all the clichés and the dragging storyline about the humans. Bay pays too little time on the Autobots and Decepticons at the beginning that I just felt like it was starting to become Witwicky's story, which is understandable, but something I didn't like all that much. Michael Bay seemed to misunderstand the type of story some fans wanted to see. Yet, despite all that I couldn't help but feel entertained at the end. That's because Michael Bay understands that the majority of fan goers aren't going to watch this movie expecting a grand Oscar worthy type movie. They are going to watch it to escape. To watch a little fantasy that is completely unrealistic but enjoyable. Remember what happened with Pirates 4? Yeah I felt like the story improved, somewhat, but the excitement and the overblown action was gone. That wasn't fun. <br/><br/>Yes, this movie was filled with clichés. I rolled my eyes a couple of times, but I didn't care at the end. What is not cliché about this movie is the different take Michael Bay gives us this time. After the excitement, but at times lame writing, of the first movie and the awful, yet at times entertaining, second movie I was hoping for something like Dark of the Moon. I never felt, for one second, that Michael Bay should abandon his formula. It works and it's exciting. All I asked for was a bit more seriousness and no more goofy jokes that the second movie was filled with. At the beginning I felt excitement, followed by some anxiety as the movie seemed to drag for minutes at a time, kind of like driving a car through traffic (I know, cliché, but it's the best thing to describe it), then finishing with an awe of excitement that even topped the first movie. The movie takes itself more seriously, yet there are plenty of clever laughs throughout, and yes a few goofy ones along the way as well as some unintentional ones, but those parts don't negate the fact that when you double-cross Optimus you pay. I highly recommend watching the movie. I don't understand critics and the people who say ""it's a wonderful spectacle, but I'm giving it a few stars because ..."" of whatever reason. They don't understand that Bay has not failed. These movies are so extremely successful for one reason: it's exciting to watch the Autobots fight the Decepticons. What would make it more exciting would be getting rid of a human lead and just focus on the ""robots in disguise"" and to keep the seriousness and lighthearted humor. Until then enjoy this movie. ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a summer movie after all, whether just saying that is cliché or not. It's one spectacular movie to watch. My advice: go watch it and just have some fun, which you will."

"josh-carrigan","8","0","3","2 July 2011"," What a summer movie should be
","First let me start of by saying that I was a big fan of the first Transformers movie. In my opinion it was exactly what I was looking for in a summer movie. It had lots of action, excellent effects and was a great way to spend a summer evening. The second on the other hand was a step down from the first. The seconds biggest downfall was the fact that it lacked a coherent story. I have tried hard to piece together everything that happens in the second movie and link it together but I cannot. It does not advance the story in anyway and it seems it was made primarily to make money and to give Michael Bay the chance to blow stuff up and show us sexy shots of Megan Fox. In other words the second one sucked big time (and everyone from Michael Bay to the actors have said as much). Going into this third Transformers film I was not sure what to expect. The previews for it were good and it seemed as though this one had coherent plot. However, the memories of the second still lingered and I was prepared to be disappointed again. That was not the case. TF3 was everything I wanted and more. First off there is a coherent and easy to follow story line, which was a welcome departure from the second. Second the film does an excellent job of evoking emotions. If you do not hate the character Dylan by the time the Chicago battle starts something is wrong with you. Third is the action. As with every Michael Bay film the action and effects are typically at the forefront. This film is no exception. The effects in this movie are incredible. The entire last hour of the film is a climatic battle in the streets of Chicago. There is a lot of autobot and decepticon fighting (much more than in the previous two). Furthermore Bay shows the ruthlessness of the decepticons in graphic detail. The battle of Chicago begins with an intense attack on the city by the decepticons. Bay shows them destroying the city and also it's human inhabitants. Another excellent scene is a car chase about halfway through the movie. It is an incredible scene. The big question is how good is the 3D in this movie. This is the best 3D I have seen since Avatar. This entire battle of Chicago needs to be seen in 3D. It is a breathtaking battle and I cannot imagine seeing it any other way. As with most live action films there are scenes where the 3D is not utilized as effectively as it could be, but those are few and far between. Basically see this movie in 3D, it is worth the price. This movie is lacking in several areas and many of them have already been covered by other reviewers. Basically the acting is okay, it is not great, but it is also not awful. There are several cringe worthy lines in this one (one in particular is delivered by Optimus just before the battle of Chicago kicks into high gear). The humor, although not as prevalent and not nearly as bad is still there. The good definitely out weighs the bad in this movie. It is a perfect summer blockbuster. I loved it and I highly recommend it. Very rarely do I see people clapping at the end of movies, but the audience I saw it with clapped several times throughout the movie and also at the end."
"william-95-404040","9","0","3","1 July 2011"," Solid and epic
","Transformers Dark of the Moon was a excellent firm, filled with action, humour and story. The 3d elements were amazing and the acting, (yes not 8/10 at times) was ultimately good. Rosie did a good job, considering it was her first firm, shia is a top Hollywood actor, he has made his character the face of the movie. The robot vocals were excellent. Yes there may have been some clichés, but that is understandable for an American movie. The movie definitely had plot twists, it was griping and shocking at times(human killings). The word epic is the exemplification of the movie. it really was a great 3rd movie that reminds me of the matrix 3 or a much better version of war of the worlds. There was definitely moments when the movie consumed me into its atmosphere- the feeling when you forget where you are... In conclusion transformers 3 was a solid and epic movie that audiences will what to watch over and over again"
"diac228","6","0","2","1 July 2011"," The ""D"" in the report card full of ""F""s
","We are now up to the third installment of the action-packed franchise. Is this Transformers also stupid? Yes. Does it still have stupid characters doing idiotic things? Yes. Does it still have Optimus Prime disappearing throughout most the film and still not being quite as bad-arse as his cartoon 80s days? Yes. Is Michael Bay still dropping the ball as director? Yes. Does the franchise still not know how to have a decent ending? Yes. And finally, does it still have this overgrossing obsession about the military? Yes. Despite all this, we have clearly found our best entry in the trilogy, as Dark of the Moon mixes the humor and heart of the first, with the utter carnage of the second, while jacking up the ante in terms of conflict and suspense. That being said, it is freakin' frustrating to watch sometimes.<br/><br/>With Dark of the Moon, we follow Sam with a new girlfriend but no job and a frustration of not advancing far in life despite saving the world.twice. In the meantime, the Autobots and the Decepticons race to discover the secrets of a spacecraft that had crashed on the moon many decades ago. This discovery will lead to the most haunting conflicts in the franchise as well as a multitude of surprises and twists and turns. Unlike the first two scripts, which didn't really pack anything juicy other than action scenes, Ehren Kruger's script actually does a great job fixing the Megan Fox dilemma while adding a dosage of much-needed heart with a much more likable cast of characters and less of the embarrassing stereotypes that we had to suffer through in Revenge of the Fallen. The stakes are much higher and the film never really drags along with unnecessary scenes. The final battle did take a while though.......<br/><br/>The special effects have always propelled this franchise during the dullest of moments, and they shine once again with Dark of the Moon. If this doesn't get at least an Academy Award nomination, I will be extremely disappointing. Action junkies, you will definitely get your money's worth as a major city becomes a massive battlefield full of nasty destruction and pure mayhem everywhere. In the meantime the Transformer fights, while (once again) minimal, deliver in the visual department. That being said, it was odd to change the blood of the robots from a dark color in the second to a clear red. Not quite sure what they were trying to pull off there. That little note can be pushed aside as we see a gigantic building get torn in half literally and fall on top of another building.<br/><br/>The cast in the third was the strongest, and it's mostly because of the small roles. While Shia LaBeouf actually disappointed a bit, the Megan Fox replacement (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) didn't do half-bad with the minimal material she was given. In the meantime, check out the talent in the small roles department: John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong, Leonard Nimoy, John Turturro, Patrick Dempsey (okay, so the last one might be pushing it, but he did well. Honest. Despite being a really...stupid character). Of course, the parents once again weren't in the movie enough (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) and pretty much disappear way before the climax.<br/><br/>Here is where the ball is dropped: Transformers 3 is a pretty stupid movie. There is some heart, some soul maybe, but no smarts. Without spoiling too much, some of our characters (heroes and even villains) just make some dumbfounded moves and utterly questionable decisions that defy logic. And then, Michael Bay, once again, falters as a director. He does indeed have a knack for explosions and military-based scenes, but the robots fighting each other (yet again) are sometimes hard to distinguish. And then he does some very questionable things lake fading the screen to black far too many times (in one instance three times in a small scene that wasn't even necessary). I miss 90s Michael Bay, when he kept the action close and crisp, but never too close to a point of getting a headache. He got the carnage and destruction scenes right, but once the action picks up amongst those robots, it becomes a frustrating game of Where's Waldo.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the best of the three films, but that's still not saying too much as the direction is still shoddy, I still don't care about Shia LeBeouf's character, there is plenty of stupidity sprinkled throughout, and it still just doesn't have the quality factor of the better summer blockbusters we've seen over the decades. While the casting, writing, and special effects improved, we are still treated to strong potential not being met. The main villains (and coolest robots) are still idiotic and reduced to cameos, as Optimus Prime once again does his ""I am going to disappear for a while and then re-appear later to kick some arse"" routine. If you are a Transformer fan, you will probably appreciate this much more, as the transformers (while some reduced to cameos) visually look amazing, and the chaos they create is incredible on the big screen. But if you are looking for quality, you may want to peek elsewhere. For some mindless fun, look no further.<br/><br/>And be happy that this is far better than Revenge of the Fallen."
"Dereksle","8","0","2","1 July 2011"," Good
","In this film by Michael Bay was way better than the second film but not as good as the first it would have been if there was megan fox. There was so many things going on in this movie. And there was this weird ray that the deceptions shot people and they disintegrate yes fricken disintegrate. This movie is also very surprising too. Optimus finds a guy that the decepticons captured but he ended up working with the decepticons not cool right. The marines do awesome in this movie they kick some robot butt. They had cool new auto bots and Optimus Prime had like a trailer attached to his truck that transformed to like a pod that gives him cool new weapons and stuff which was cool. So go see this movie in 2D not 3D because then it is dumb."
"jdkraus","7","0","2","1 July 2011"," ""Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon"" is not as remarkable as the original 2007 release, but it is still so much fun to watch.
","Many critics who hated the second ""Transformers"" movie will probably shout about this movie, ""Go away Michael Bay! We don't want to see you and your big-ass explosions again!"" Personally, I like Michael Bay's films. ""Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon"" is not as remarkable as the original 2007 release, but it is still so much fun to watch. There's much to mention in this review, so I'll be direct.<br/><br/>Like the other ""Transformers"" films, there are big explosions, sweet action sequences and CGI. However, unlike the prior films, they are more memorable, much longer, and more awesome. I mean the city Chicago becomes a massive war zone between Autobots and Decepticons. For this sequence alone, my eyes were glued to the screen. Michael Bay's ability to put a viewer into this scene as well as with the aid of the outstanding visual effects by IL is purely astounding. <br/><br/>Though purely a work of fiction, the screenwriter delivers a comprehensible story. I like how the film's plot ties in the NASA landing on the moon as a ""cover up"" to retrieve data from a crashed Autobot ship. This is pretty clever. To push this conspiracy theory attitude, the editors throw in archive footage of the moon landing, and of Presidents Kennedy and Nixon. <br/><br/>Much of the cast is the same, yet they are different than in the previous films. There's less humor and more drama. Instead of running and screaming for 2 and half hours, Shia LaBeouf actually does some butt kicking. He even takes on a Decepticon all by himself—Sam's really grown up. John Tuturro as former Agent Simmons, now a very successful published author, provides much of the comic relief. He's such a character. As usual, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Dumahel kick butt as soldiers. Julie White and Kevin Dunn as Sam's parents deliver clever one-liners, but they are kept to a minimal in this film, which is a good thing since they hogged up too much in the second feature.<br/><br/>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replaces as Sam's girlfriend. She does a better job than Megan Fox. She is both more attractive and delivers better as a more believable character. John Malkovich jumps on board as Sam's boss, playing his eccentric self. Warning: he does not like the color red. Frances McDormand joins too as the new government official that oversees the Autobots. I honestly did not recognize her until the credits rolled; this just shows how well an actress can transform oneself. Even so, Malkovich and McDormand seem out of place in this film. They're characters have no purpose. The only actor whom I consider annoying is Patrick Dempsey. He's a handsome guy with charm, but this not a film for him. He needs to go back and do romantic comedies and chick flicks. The robotic villains are not as up to par either. Shockwave and his snakelike partner appear within the first fifteen minutes of the feature, and then disappear for nearly two hours. Starscream doesn't do anything—then again he never did much. Likewise, Megatron is very inactive until the very end. <br/><br/>In addition, the humor is sparse and much of it borders on juvenile sexual innuendo and stereotypes. Innuendo isn't an issue for me, but I don't need to see African-American stereotypes in the middle of a ""Transformers"" film, specifically during an action sequence. The film's ending is also very abrupt—there's hardly an epilogue following the forty plus minute war scene. Now I'm getting nitpicky. For big action lovers like myself, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a wise choice. Michael Bay mentioned he will not do a fourth film. In fact, the ending leaves it so that there won't be another one. If God forbid there is another ""Transformers"" movie, I'll be in line to see it. <br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****"
"Ld-Trtle","9","0","4","1 July 2011"," Are we Decepticons?
","Michael Bay described his last transformers film aptly. He referred to it as 'crap'. So why did I pay to go and see this sequel? I don't really know. What I can scarcely believe though, (and in fact virtually not at all) is that Transformers: Dark of the Moon is, for an awfully complicated reason, quite possibly one of the finest films ever made. No, I'm serious! Please, bare with me (and my spoilers) as I explain why...<br/><br/>We start with two alien races: the Decepticons and Autobots. They are at war with one another. Due to things that have happened in the past, the Decepticons are far more numerous and powerful than the Autobots.<br/><br/>A small band of Autobots make their home on Earth alongside humans. Due to the war and the deterioration of their home world, Cybertron, the mighty Decepticons travel to Earth in force so that they may use its natural resources (in particular its native population) to help restore it. Doing this, however, requires physically bringing Cybertron to Earth. Bringing Cybertron to Earth requires some technological magic, beyond the abilities of the Decepticons, but not beyond those of certain powerful Autobots. So the Decepticons essentially do a deal with one of the Autobots, namely Sentinel Prime. In exchange for promised power, Sentinel Prime agrees to help the Decepticons bring their home world to Earth. In addition, the Decepticons buy over various influential and powerful humans, in particular Patrick Dempsey's character, to help in the fight against the Autobots and their followers. Needless to say, the Autobots and their followers resist all this because it is not what they believe in. This struggle leads to widespread destruction on Earth and the ultimate ruin of Cybertron. The deal between Sentinel Prime and the leader of the Decepticons breaks down, and to two end up in conflict with one another. Eventually, due to the resolve of the Autobots and their followers, the Decepticons are defeated, they leave Earth, and their leader is killed.<br/><br/>Now, I honestly don't think I'm trying to find something that isn't there, when I say that the plot of this film is all about is exploring the War in Afghanistan from the point of view of the Afghans. Yes, you read that right. Unless this has already dawned on you, please read on as I illustrate why the film appears to be a huge and remarkably complex analogy. Consider the basics of the Afghan conflict (and compare to the above plot summary!):<br/><br/>We start with America and the Terrorists. They are, because of 9/11, at war with one another. Due to things that have happened in the past, the Americans are far more numerous and powerful than the Terrorists.<br/><br/>A small band of Terrorists make their home in Afghanistan alongside local Afghans. Due to the war and the deterioration of the success of their democracy, the mighty Americans travel to Afghanistan in force so that they may use its natural resources (in particular its native population) to help restore its sense of identity (by successfully bringing democracy to Afghanistan, America might hope to restore its faith in it). Doing this, however, requires physically bringing democracy and western ideals to Afghanistan, beyond the ability of the Americans, but not beyond those of certain powerful Afghans. So the Americans essentially do a deal with one of the powerful Afghans, namely Hamid Karzai. In exchange for promised power, Karzai agrees to help the Americans bring their democracy to Afghanistan. In addition, the Americans buy over various influential and powerful Afghans, in particular the Northern Alliance, to help in the fight against the terrorists and their followers. Needless to say, the Terrorists and their followers resist all this because it is not what they believe in. This struggle leads to widespread destruction in Afghanistan and the ultimate ruin of democracy and the American Dream (maybe not quite). The deal between Hamid Karzai and the American government breaks down, and the two engage in a complex power struggle. Eventually, due to the resolve of the terrorists and their followers, the Americans are defeated, they leave Afghanistan (this is definitely due to happen), and their American government suffers a major political defeat (not quite 'killed').<br/><br/>The parallels are perfect and clear! Key elements in the film correspond to key elements in the Afghan conflict: Earth represents Afghanistan. The people of Earth play the 'Civilian Afghan Population'. The Decepticon home world, Cybertron, represents America, or, more abstractly, American ideals, democracy and the American Dream. The Decepticons represent 'The American Military' (Well 'NATO' really, but never mind) while Megatron represents 'The American Government'. The Autobots represent 'The Terrorists'. Optimus Prime plays 'The Terrorist Leader' (the leader of Al Qaeda or the Taliban, say). Shia LaBeouf and his friends represent 'Those local Afghans persuaded by the terrorists to fight and die for the terrorists cause'. Sentinel Prime plays Hamid Karzai, or, more generally, 'The leader of those Afghans who actively collaborate with the Americans for supposedly idealogical reasons' (as opposed to just for cash). Patrick Dempsey's character, on the other hand, a powerful industrialist, represents 'The Afghan warlords and mercenaries who do actively collaborate with the Americans simply for cash'.<br/><br/>Not only do the key elements of the film correspond to key elements of the conflict, but in fact the key elements of the film correspond to all of the key elements of the conflict. Unfortunately there's not enough space here to go in to more detail (for example consider the role of women, and compare 9/11 conspiracy to the collapsing tower scene).<br/><br/>It is possible that nothing I've suggested was ever considered by the film makers. Obviously I don't know for certain. All I know is that I've been typing for too long now, so I'll stop.<br/><br/>Except to say one thing. The original reason why I went to see this film is not really unknown to me.<br/><br/>It's called Rosie Huntington-Whitely..."

","I did not have the opportunity of watching transformers in an IMAX but a decent multiplex, but let me tell you I enjoyed every bit of the movie. There were some draggy moments but over all a roller coaster ride. The point that Mr Bay spends so much of energy/time/money just to shoot a frame of 2-3 seconds really pays off.The special effects are mind boggingly brilliant and this time there is a decent story backing up but for me the thumbs up comes from the fact that this times humans are contributing in some kind of robot killing and esp the gliding scene where a few soldiers glide in the sky with some nasty robots chasing them is brilliant. Shock Wave is scary and Optimus Prime is a rock star. Micheal Bay has mixed his ingredients right this time and congratulations it tastes brilliant. A good fun/action filled movie and good to have the transformer series back on track."

","I grew up on Transformers, and this movie was quite mediocre as the previous two. The action is great and well executed, but it's still lacking focus on the transformers - which are more interesting than the human story. The boy's story is boring and uninteresting, and the new girl is clearly here to shut up and look beautiful. I personally don't like Rosie, her face is filled with too much silicon.<br/><br/>I'd still recommend watching it in the theaters - it's a fun action packed film. It's just too bad Michael Bay makes us watch boring and ridiculous stories about the humans. And no, I don't care about the chick in the film. This isn't James Bond, Michael."
"Fields201","8","0","3","30 June 2011"," ""Kill Them All!"" - Optimus Prime
","After the horrible Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, I didn't have high expectations going into the third installment. I was expecting to go home and write a review listing every horrible thing I could think of in this movie, and there are a few, but the last half of the movie really made up for it and made this one awesome summer movie.<br/><br/>The movie opens to what I think is pretty brilliant with the whole Apollo landing and the astronauts come across a strange spaceship and some autobot. Then it shifts gears to Shia Labitch's girlfriend's butt, and she wakes whineyboy Shia out of bed. Yeah he spends most of the movie whining and being a jerk to people. He also won a Congressional Medal of Honor from Obama, but yet he can't find any jobs (in a very funny montage) until John Malkovich gives him one. However, he is soon discovered by the Decepticons, and Whineyjerk breaks into a facility to call upon Optimus Prime once again. I don't know why the Decepticons keep going after him, but I guess we need to find some way to fit him into the movie.<br/><br/>Whineyjerk calls on the team from the previous installments as the Decepticons take over the earth. They are bringing their home, Cybertron, to our planet and it's really up to the autobots to save them. Seriously, the humans are like ants and it really shows. Like just when you think the humans are about to take out a Decepticon, here comes an autobot to save them. This happens more than once. The action is exciting this time around and they really hit home with some fresh ideas for some of the action sequence. In fact, if you love action, you will love this movie because the last half of the movie is nothing but action. It's a huge war in Chicago. Just be prepared for some moments where you can't tell if they are autobots or Decepticons. You just have to go with what's going on. Heck, I can only name two autobots: Bumblebee and the legendary Optimus Prime. I don't know the rest.<br/><br/>The villain in this movie.... is not Megatron again. This makes me a little mad since Megatron is always made to be a big wuss in all three movies. I thought for a moment that Megatron will finally grow some gonads and give Optimus a run for his money. It doesn't happen. I feel bad for you, Megatron.<br/><br/>With all said and done, this is a well done summer movie flick. It's another prime (no puns intended) example of a summer movie done right, unlike that last Transformers movie. I even like some of the twist and turns the movie throws out you. It keeps you entertained. Now... let's see a Go-Bots movie!"

","'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' showcases the best and worst of director Michael Bay. As incoherent as the plot may be, the metal-mania on the other end, is a spectacle of cataclysmic proportions. Acting in this film must be more difficult for the actors themselves, rather than for the audience to see them but it isn't about them. It never really was. When Michael Bay brought the alien robot race to Planet Earth, it was made very clear that it's always going to be about them. Thus, you will be made to watch this T:3 through the eyes of the Decepticons to whom, humans don't matter. So shall be your approach while watching the absolute Bay-hem that dominates the movie's tedious 157 minute length. Only then, will you have a blast....<br/><br/>Following the likes of George Lucas and Wachowski Brothers, Bay ventures forth with his indulgent film-making with some of the best artists around who aid the rendering of his metallic vision with gargantuan destruction being the enthralling lure for devotees, much to the shame of critics who shunned them on every new venture but couldn't stop their movie installments from making billions. These films are beyond critics. The sheer scale of their production and presentation warrants a mandatory viewing regardless of their critique for one doesn't chase their substance but their astounding visual effects that make it all larger- than-life. <br/><br/>Apollo 11, USA's maiden voyage to set a man on the moon, has been a cover-up to the discovery of an Autobot ship's wreckage that escaped the last battle on Cybertron. For over 40 years, humans and Autobots alike, have been kept in the dark about the dark side of the moon. Optimus Prime uncovers the conspiracy on a mission in Chernobyl where he discovers familiar parts to be used for teleportation by Autobots. After convincing the bossy head of the secret Government agency, Optimus flies to the moon to bring home Sentinel Prime, deactivated in the ship's wreckage. With the matrix, he brings Sentinel to life and along with him the apocalypse that had been planned all this while, by the Decepticons. A jobless Sam (Shia LaBeouf), in desperate search for credit, is suspicious of his new girlfriend's boss but takes up his offer to work. He inevitably becomes a part of the new battle against the Decepticons, much to the dislike of his girl (Rosey Huntington-Whiteley) and his annoying parents. While the pillars are assembled all over, hundreds of decepticons are summoned to Chicago as they prepare to teleport Cybertron into Earth's atmosphere. Thus begins the hour long devastation of Chicago in 3D as Decepticons lay a siege on a much destroyed city, while military operatives dive down from airplanes in bat-wing-suits while our world's leaders decide to send the Autobots off into far away space. But this was never about humans standing a chance by themselves..... <br/><br/>Devoid of any richness, emotion or rationale is the tale of humans here. Sam's relationship with Carly lacks chemistry and with her fashionably plastic persona, the rawness of Megan Fox will be deeply missed. John Turturro's Simmons is now a haughty, attention- seeking non-contributor whose presence is questionable. The same goes with Gibson and Duhamel, whose military persons don't carry any weight in such out-of-control situations. John Malkovich and Frances McDormand are wasted in inexplicably empty roles. Those who draw our attention away from the void of these soulless characters are Sentinel Prime, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron and the numerous talkative Autobots who are richer both in character, dialog and screen presence. Indeed, such is their transformation that one can analyze them as though they were humans. That is of course, until Michael Bay puts them in Chicago.<br/><br/>Bay is at his cinematic best in the carnage that spans highways, high rise buildings, city streets and skies. He renders 3D in its best form since 'Avataar' to dazzle the viewer with robots, guns and humans flying through the screen. The special effects surpass all prior attempts at depicting metallic annihilation of a city and while there is a resemblance to some of Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds', its intensity is pure and unique. As Shockwave goes through the epic deconstruct of a building, Optimus Prime slices through Decepticons, Bumblebee repeatedly transforms from and into a sexy Camaro, we witness the prowess of Bay-hem and the might of one man's vision to enthrall an audience. <br/><br/>'Revenge of the Fallen' was criticized for its plot and character development but it looks richer in those aspects when compared with Dark of the moon where the plot's sheer incoherence is louder than the clang of metal. Why do the characters exist and why do they do what they do? Sam's relationships are irrelevant and so are his job interviews when total devastation is upon Earth. It takes over 50 minutes for the film to grind its gears but then, it does follow up with summer's most explosive action. Bay succeeds in making 3D look worthwhile and his robots cooler than before but we could've only hoped for a shorter length that focused more on them rather than the excessive human role. There might not be a sequel to follow because Megatron, Starscream and much of the Decepticons are destroyed to the core by Optimus and his Autobots. Thrice the aliens have tried to invade and have failed. Another attempt would seem ridiculous for Paramount to even finance.<br/><br/>In the end, this isn't a movie outing you base on reviews. Ratings don't matter in this case. What matters is that you are among the first week viewers who contribute to a stellar opening as always for this franchise. While Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots pledges his presence forever on Planet Earth, to save and protect, you were there....in the theater... to witness it all.<br/><br/><ul><li>8.069 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"LordElrondd","8","0","5","30 June 2011"," Transformers: Lots of loose ends.
","First of all , you have to watch this film in 3D, and try to get to IMAX. THE best 3D so far, without a doubt. it was the best on IMAX as well, so if your looking for an entertaining film, this is for you !<br/><br/>Now, we get to the important part, Getting rid of Megan fox: big mistake. I think everyone would agree with me, this was one of the items that made the film interesting,you take that away you loose big points.<br/><br/>You look at this film , with this big cast like John Malkovich and Patrick Dempsey and you think that this could be something,but you can be wrong.<br/><br/>The story and the characters, especially the new ones, are so shallow and simple that you cant get your head around it.<br/><br/>plus lots of loose ends at the end, so much that i lost count during the film. not to mention too many new robots that you that you cant tell which is which !!! the only reason that you see an eight at the end of this ""review"" is only and only because of the 3D, especially IMAX.<br/><br/>Overall : 8/10"
